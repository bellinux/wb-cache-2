40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the microbial community composition and operating metabolisms {{on the surface and}} in the permafrost of Deception Island, (Antarctica) with an on site antibody microarray biosensor. Samples (down to a depth of 4. 2 m) were analysed with LDChip 300 (Life Detector Chip), an immunosensor containing more than 300 antibodies targeted to bacterial and archaeal antigens. The <b>immunograms</b> showed positive antigen-antibody reactions in all surface samples (lichens, pyroclasts) and the top layer of the permafrost. The results indicated the presence of exopolysaccharides, bacteria belonging to the Alpha-, Delta- and Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gram-positive Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, as well as archaeal species, most probably Methanobacterium spp. Positive reactions with antibodies to proteins and peptides revealed the presence of nitrogen fixation (NifHD, GlnB, HscA), methanogenic (McrB), iron homeostasis and iron scavenging (ferritins and DPS proteins) proteins, as well as ABC transporters, which indicated that these processes were operating at the time of sampling. These results were validated with other molecular ecology techniques such as oligonucleotide microarrays, 16 S bacterial rRNA gene sequence analysis, aerobic viable counts and microscopy. Molecular ecology results showed a differentiated pattern along the depth of the drill, being the top active layer the most diverse, with Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and the phototrophs Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi as dominant groups. Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were dominant in depths from 0. 5 to 2 m, and Betaproteobacteria from 3 to 4. 2 m.

40|$|Recurrent rhinosinusitis occur {{against the}} {{background}} of immunodeficiencies, latent, long-term, without pain symptom. Background: Determination of indications for immune-therapy of recurrent rhinosinusitis. Materials and methods. The study involved 85 patients with purulent rhinosinusitis without recurrent pain symptoms. All patients underwent a complete clinical examination, <b>immunogram,</b> determining the level of IL- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, TNFα, INFγ and substance P (SP) in the blood serum. To correct the immune deficiency in the standard treatment of purulent rhinosinusitis scheme in some patients with the level of SP < 100 pg / mL (n = 30) on the first day included immunotherapy. The control group (n = 24) was treated in the normal way – without immunomodulator. Results. In patients with levels of SP more than 100 pg / mL change display-teley <b>immunogram</b> were typical for a normal immune response to bacterial antigen. Cytokine balance shifted toward anti-inflammatory cytokines was significantly increased concentrations of IL- 4 and IL- 10.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{metabolism}} of bradykinin BK after a single {{passage through the}} coronary bed in isolated Langendorff rat hearts. Methods: BK was infused into the aortic flow line to obtain a final concentration of 10 nM, and the coronary effluent was collected to quantify BK and des-Arg 9 -BK by competitive enzyme immunoassay. The nature of immunoreactive material was confirmed by <b>immunograms</b> after HPLC separation. The experiments were performed with hearts perfused at either {{one of the following}} coronary flow rates: 1, 5 or 10 mlrmin. Results: BK recovery without inhibitors was 86. 3 " 2. 9, 60. 8 " 6. 3, and 29. 6 " 6. 8 % at 10, 5, and 1 mlrmin, respectively. The V rK ratios at these coronary flow rates were 2. 19 " 0. 72, 4. 81 " 0. 64, and 2. 59 " 0. 33 miny 1 gy 1,max m.. respectively. The angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat 130 nM, reduced BK degradation at all flow rates.. Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase with retrothiorphan 25 nM had no effect on BK degradation. However, the combined treatment with enalaprilat and retrothiorphan reduced BK degradation to lower values than enalaprilat alone. The effect of enzyme inhibitors on BK recovery was inversely related to coronary flow: inhibiting BK degradation markedly increased BK recovery at 1 mlrmin, but had no effect at 10 mlrmin. The kininase I metabolite of BK, des-Arg 9 -BK, could not be detected under these experimental conditions. Conclusions: ACE is the major enzyme responsible for BK degradation during a single passage through the coronary bed. Neutral endopeptidase contributes to BK degradation only when ACE activity is impaired. The effect of enzyme inhibitors on the coronar...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A complex {{immunologic}} {{examination of}} fifty patients with clinically significant postoperative fibrosis has been performed. <b>Immunogram</b> indexes were determined, {{and activities of}} basic oxidation-reduction enzymes were investigated in blood lymphocytes. What concerned immune status of the patients under study, some peculiar features have been revealed, with respect to cellular and humoral compartments, i. e., relative increase in CD 3 + population, a shift to CD 4 + cells in the ratio of lymphocyte subpopulations, higher indexes of immune regulation and phagocytosis, increased IgG level, and lower content of IgA, as compared to appropriate controls. Metabolic parameters of lymphocytes reflect their functional activation, being expressed as an enhanced ability for intracellular synthetic processes, elevated functional activity of lymphocytes, and increased immune response. The general pattern of changes in immune status and metabolic indexes of lymphocytes allow us to assume participation of autoimmune component in progression of epidural fibrosis.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the effect of roncoleukin and gelofusin on {{cerebral}} circulation in victims with severe brain injury. Subjects and methods. A hundred and forty-seven patients with severe brain injury were examined. The patients were divided into 4 groups: 1) 41 patients received the standard treatment (a control group); 2) 35 patients had the standard treatment added by roncoleukin by a scheme; 3) 35 had the standard treatment and ron-coleukin supplemented with gelofusin; 4) 36 received the standard treatment and gelofusin solution. All the patients underwent monitoring: rheoencephalograms on days 1 — 3 and 10 — 14, daily determination of plasma viscosity by a VK- 4 viscosimeter, and an <b>immunogram.</b> Results. Severe brain injury causes a 2 — 3 -fold reduction in cerebral circulation {{and an increase in}} arterial and arteriolar tones. Along with a marked immunoprotective effect, roncoleukin improved cerebral circulation. The other agent (gelofusin) made blood rheological properties better.

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the impact of intestinal lavage (IL) on the incidence of pneumonia in patients with poisonings by psychopharmacological agents (PPA). Subjects and methods. The incidence of pneumonia as a complication of acute oral poisonings by PPA was studied in 393 patients with moderate and severe poisonings. Of them, 112 patients underwent IL as a detoxification method; the other patients received standard blood detoxification methods in a package of remedial measures. The time course {{of changes in the}} blood levels of gram-negative intestinal bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and immune status were studied before and after IL. Results. Prior to treatment, 65 % of the patients with PPA poisoning were found to have an 8 — 10 -fold excess in the reference values for blood LPS. At the same time, there were suppressed <b>immunogram</b> readings. After IL, there was a 1. 5 -fold decrease in blood LPS levels, which remained during 3 days, and activation of immune processes. It was shown that the patients undergoing IL developed pneumonia as a complication of PPA poisoning 1. 6 times less frequently and died of pneumonia 16 times less often. Conclusion.

Materials and methods: The study examined 38 patients coinfected with HIV and CHC who were injecting drug users and 36 patients with HIV/CHC who were not injecting drug users. In the study of immune status, the relative and absolute numbers of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 16 +, and CD 20 + cells were determined by means of flow cytofluorometry of “FACSCount” using monoclonal antibodies of the company Becton Dickinson. The level of circulating immune complexes in blood serum was determined by means of precipitation in polyethylene glycol solution. Results: It was found that T-cell immunodeficiency was developing in patients coinfected with HIV and CHC. T-cell immunodeficiency was characterized by {{a decrease in the}} number of T-helpers, mainly for injecting drug users. At the same time, patients coinfected with HIV and CHC experienced markedly elevated levels of circulating immune complexes, mainly among injecting drug users. The evaluation of <b>immunogram</b> indices in injecting drug users coinfected with HIV and CHC, depending on the stage of HIV infection, revealed a greater degree of immune-suppression of T-helper cells in clinical stage III. Conclusion: Our comprehensive immunological study of patients coinfected with HIV and CHC revealed a pronounced dysfunction of the immune system. The comparison of the immune system indices in patients with HIV/CHC showed a more pronounced T-cell suppression in injecting drug users than in patients with HIV/CHC but who were not injecting drug users.

40|$|Introduction. Recently, {{the issue}} of {{environmental}} pollution with various trace elements becomes increasingly important. Especially their adverse effects, even in small concentrations, {{on the health of}} children, in particular the immune system, because the child’s body is more susceptible to their accumulation in the process of the development. Objective. To evaluate the load of micronutrients in children — the inhabi­tants of the modern city of Lviv (Western Ukraine) and correlation of immunity parameters with their imbalance. Materials and methods. Using selected randomized copy-pair method, in 50 pairs (n = 100) of healthy children aged 6 – 15 years who lived in the area of research and rural regions from the birth, we have analyzed the contents of some heavy metals (toxic Pb, Cd and conditionally essential Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Co, Cr, Ni) in the hair by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Immune status of children has been assessed in terms of composition and expression of surface phenotypes of immune competent cells by direct immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody panel. Mathe­matical processing of the findings was carried out by the methods of parametric and nonparametric statistics. Results. The content of heavy metals in children who live in modern cities is exceeded several times. At the same time, there was a reduction of conditionally essential micronutrients. The analysis of correlations between the main indicators of <b>immunogram</b> and concentration of trace elements in biological substrates of children found a close relationship between them, which confirmed the influence of environmental factors on the basic immunological parameters. Mathematical equations also confirmed the presence of factorial-effective relationship in the «environmental pollution — morbidity — micronutrient composition of biosubstrates — immune status» system and have a prognostic significance. Conclusion.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} {{the time course of}} {{immunological}} changes in patients with acute severe brain injury (SBI) and their use along with the integrated indices of evaluation of its severity to define criteria for predicting the development of pyoseptic complications. Subjects and methods. Immunological parameters were studied in 53 SBI patients aged 17 — 65 years on days 1, 7, and 14 days after injury. There were 2 groups: 1) 16 patients without complications; 2) 37 patients with pyoseptic complications in the acute period of the disease. The integral scales SIRS, CPIS, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), APACHE II, laboratory parameters (immunograms, platelets, soluble fibrin-monomer complexes, and medium molecular weight peptides) in the prediction of pyoseptic complications were analyzed in patients with SBI. A control group consisted of 23 apparently healthy individuals. Results. The found immunological parameters lead to the conclusion that patients with SBI had significant immunodeficiency of mixed genesis by the cellular and humoral types in the acute period of the disease, immune system activation at week 2 of the disease in the development of pyoseptic complications. The decrease in the immunoregulatory index or less than 1. 17 or its increase or more than 2. 55 on day 1 after SBI was associated with the higher risk of pyoseptic complications. Some indices of an <b>immunogram</b> and the integral scales APACHE II, SIRS, CPIS, and GCS were found to be of low importance in the prediction of pyoseptic complications in SBI. Multivariate regression analysis showed that indices, such as the relative blood count of CD 3 +, CD 95 + lymphocytes, platelets, the serum levels of immunoglobulin M and medium molecular weight peptides (at 262 nm), as well as GCS scores and the maximum temperature {{on the day of the}} investigation, were of the greatest value in the construction of prognostic models.

Human gut microbiota {{plays a key role}} in the development of metabolic syndrome. Recently, the gut microbiota has emerged as an important contributor to the development of obesity and metabolic disorders through its interactions with environmental (e. g. diet) and genetic factors. The aim of this study was to research the effects of synbiotic on the gut microbiota and host metabolism. Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Our sample included 180 adults (ages 30 - 89) with symptoms of metabolic syndrome, who were allocated to either placebo or synbiotic group. The main inclusion criteria were: blood pressure of around 130 / 90 mmHg; raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 100 mg/dL (5. 6 mmol/L), previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia triglycerides (TG) of 1. 70 mmol/L, a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of 0. 90 mmol/L in males and 1. 0 mmol/L in females, and central obesity with a waist/hip ratio > 0. 90 in males or > 0. 85 in females or a body mass index > 30 kg/m 2. Results: We enrolled 90 adults in the placebo group and 90 in the synbiotic group. The two groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics. Consent was signed by all patients. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation, including complete blood tests, glucose test, glycosylated  hemoglobin, total cholesterol and triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL, HDL plasma, <b>immunogram,</b> and coprogram. All patients were interviewed with a questionnaire that included 200 questions related to diet, lifestyle, and health. Synbiotic were used by patients in a dose of 200 grams twice a day.
