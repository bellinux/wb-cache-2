5|$|During a brief {{concert at}} the Tool and Die club in San Francisco, Dead Kennedys {{frontman}} and Alternative Tentacles overseer Jello Biafra witnessed their performance and became a fervent fan. Biafra invited the group to open for Dead Kennedys and T.S.O.L. at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, and soon made an offer that would launch their recording career; if they could <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> lend them studio time, Alternative Tentacles would reimburse the studio when the album was complete. The band then returned to San Antonio to record at BOSS Studios (a.k.a. Bob O'Neill's Sound Studios, a.k.a. the Boss). However, the Mathews brothers did not enter the studio with Haynes and Leary; the two had quit following a physical altercation between Scott Mathews and Haynes. The bass position {{was taken over by}} Bill Jolly, who would play on Butthole Surfers' next two releases, and a number of drummers participated. The last of these, King Coffey (born Jeffrey Coffey), is still with the band to this day.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown {{into a pair of}} steel ring steps. Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, to the point that security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Touch {{sequences}} {{fall into}} two different types, repetitive and strategic. Repetitive is when one person touches and the other person reciprocates. The majority of these touches are considered positive. Strategic touching {{is a series of}} touching usually with an ulterior or hidden motive thus making them seem to be using touch as a game to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> do something for them.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, a new New Year's special was {{produced}} and was broadcast on 4 January 2014. The story features Nan {{as she is}} accompanied by a school girl named Alice, who has volunteered to visit Nan as part of the 'Young and Old Buddy-Up Foundation' while her grandson, Jamie is in Africa helping to build a school for orphans and keeps in contact with Nan regularly via Skype. As Nan's tap is broken, she and Alice head to the council {{to see if they can}} <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> fix and there Nan land herself in trouble for 'disturbing the peace and simulating a heart attack' at the local community centre. Returning guest stars include Mathew Horne and Niky Wardley and with Ami Metcalf as Alice.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the evacuation, the American Embassy had distributed a 15-page booklet called SAFE, short for [...] "Standard Instruction and Advice to Civilians in an Emergency." [...] The booklet included a map of Saigon pinpointing [...] "assembly areas where a helicopter will pick you up." [...] There was an insert page which read: [...] "Note evacuational signal. Do not disclose to other personnel. When the evacuation is ordered, the code will be read out on Armed Forces Radio. The code is: The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising. This {{will be followed by}} the playing of I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas." [...] Frank Snepp later recalled the arrival of helicopters at the Embassy while the song was playing over the radio as a [...] "bizarre Kafkaesque time". Japanese journalists, concerned that they would not recognize the tune, had to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> sing it to them.|$|E

2500|$|Sam Kellerman was 29 years old. In {{speaking}} about his brother, Max Kellerman recalls that [...] " [...] was a creative genius... He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read. I used to tell him, 'I'll {{always be able to}} <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> pay me for talking, and you'll always be able to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> pay you for writing.' When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, but I think he was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor. He was in several national commercials. And acting wasn't even what he did best. Sam was a sure thing. It {{was just a matter of}} time before he made it big." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a note {{explaining}} his motives Barbaro wrote: [...] "I guess I {{just wanted to}} kill the person I hate most -- myself, I just didn't have the courage. I wanted to die, but I couldn't do it, so I had to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> do it for me. It didn't work out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991 Campese {{released}} his first autobiography On a Wing and a Prayer with Peter Bills. When {{asked why he}} chose a British journalist to co-write his autobiography, Campese responded that, “I know the journos too well in Australia.” He further stated that, “And {{it was an opportunity}} to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> write something different. Sure, some of the things don’t sound like me, or even very Australian, but I think it adds to the flavour of the book.” The opening sentence reads as follows: ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Getting</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> {{confess to}} a crime during an {{interrogation}} - whether innocent or guilty - means the suspect has been broken. The key to breaking points in interrogation {{has been linked to}} changes in the victim's concept of self - changes which may be precipitated by a sense of helplessness, by lack of preparedness or an underlying sense of guilt, as well (paradoxically) as by an inability to acknowledge one's own vulnerabilities.|$|R
5000|$|The hectic {{gameplay}} makes {{most players}} inevitably begin shouting their orders. Smith suggests {{this was not}} an intended feature. [...] "People start shouting because it's the only way <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> hear your instruction. In harder levels, you basically have to talk over each other otherwise the timer runs out too quickly ... it's just what you do in that situation-all hell's breaking loose, and you're trying to get people to hear your instructions." ...|$|R
2500|$|The band did not tour {{in support}} of the album. Hollis explained, [...] "There is no way that I could ever play again {{a lot of the stuff}} I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place." [...] The band would never tour again.|$|E
2500|$|They were dragged to {{the nearby}} Casement Park sports ground. Here they were again beaten and {{stripped}} to their underpants and socks by {{a small group of}} men. According to the BBC and The Independent the men were also tortured. A search revealed that the men were British Army soldiers. Redemptorist priest Father Alec Reid, who later played a significant part in the peace process leading to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, intervened and attempted to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> call for an ambulance, but was dragged away and threatened with shooting if he didn't stand up; he was then pulled away from the men. [...] The corporals were further beaten and thrown over a high wall to be put into a waiting black taxi. It was driven off at speed, while camera crews captured one of its passengers waving a fist in the air.|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 11, {{during an}} intense bombardment, Smith was badly bruised when a {{cannonball}} {{crashed into the}} barracks, struck him in the left hip, and showered him with bricks. Before being removed from the fort, Smith tried to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> volunteer to take command but no one stepped forward. Finally, Smith appointed Thayer to lead the defense, noting he was, [...] "the bravest man he had ever known." [...] Thayer accepted. He would command the fort from the 12th to the 15th. When he took charge, the situation was rapidly becoming critical. On November 15, the British managed to work Vigilant, an East Indiaman razeed into a 20-gun floating battery, into a position 200 paces from the fort. HMS Somerset (64), HMS Isis (50), HMS Roebuck (44), and HMS Pearl (32) blasted Mud Island from the river while numerous batteries flayed the fort from the land side. Thayer gamely directed his men to move a 32-pound cannon to the threatened area. The gun crew put 14 shots into the Vigilant but soon had to abandon the piece as the position was deluged by fire. With the situation hopeless, Thayer ordered the fort to be evacuated that evening and the survivors were rowed across to Red Bank, New Jersey. There were about 300 survivors. Thayer stayed behind with about 40 men to burn down {{what remained of the}} barracks and left at midnight. On the morning of November 16, the British took possession of the wrecked fort.|$|E

2500|$|Some have {{postulated}} that postnatal (e.g., {{social and environmental}} factors) development {{can play a role}} in the sexual orientation of an individual, yet solid evidence of this has yet to be discovered. Children born through artificial insemination with donor sperm and consequently raised by lesbian couples have typically been heterosexually oriented. Summed up by Bao and Swaab, [...] "The apparent impossibility of <b>getting</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> change their sexual orientation ... is a major argument against the importance of the social environment in the emergence of homosexuality, as well as against the idea that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice." ...|$|R
