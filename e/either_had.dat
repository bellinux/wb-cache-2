5|$|From the 1940s to the 1960s, The Accounting Review {{published}} articles of greater diversity, and leading authors {{during this period}} tended to have less practical accounting experience and more formal education. During this period, the three individuals that accounted {{for most of the}} editorial duties of the journal were A. C. Littleton (1944-1947), Frank Smith (1950-1959) and Robert Mautz (1960-1962), all of whom <b>either</b> <b>had</b> practical accounting experience, or were leading authors prior to 1945, when the journal was oriented towards the accounting practice.|$|E
5|$|Arévalo {{took office}} on 15 March 1945, inheriting {{a country with}} {{numerous}} social and economic issues. Despite Ubico's policy of using unpaid labor to build public roads, internal transport was severely inadequate. 70% {{of the population was}} illiterate, and malnutrition and poor health were widespread. The wealthiest 2% of landowners owned nearly three quarters of agricultural land, and as a result less than 1% was cultivated. The indigenous peasants <b>either</b> <b>had</b> no land, or had far too little to sustain themselves. Three quarters of the labor force were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent.|$|E

At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they <b>either</b> <b>had</b> to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E
5|$|Potter <b>either</b> <b>had</b> no live {{models for}} the eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other teams}} <b>either</b> <b>had</b> similar {{knowledge}} or had pursued Bure, {{but there was}} confusion as to {{the legitimacy of the}} extra games. The Detroit Red Wings had asked league vice president Gil Stein about Bure's availability before their fifth-round pick, but were told he was not eligible. They later decided to select him with their sixth-round pick, 116th overall, and settle his eligibility later. The Canucks selected Bure three picks ahead of Detroit's turn. Meanwhile, Winnipeg Jets general manager Mike Smith, claimed he made an offer to the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation that would involve three years of transfer payments before Bure would be allowed to join the Jets; however Smith did not have any plans to draft Bure in 1989 as he believed he was ineligible.|$|E

5|$|Sticky & Sweet Tour was {{the eighth}} concert tour by American singer Madonna to promote her {{eleventh}} studio album, Hard Candy. It began in August 2008 and was Madonna's first tour {{from her new}} recording and business deal with Live Nation. The tour was announced in February 2008, with dates for European and North American venues revealed. Though initially planned, the tour did not visit Australia due to financial problems and the financial recession. Costume designer Arianne Phillips designed the costumes, supported {{by a number of}} famous designers and brands. The stage for the main show was planned similarly to that of her previous 2006 Confessions Tour. After the tour concluded in 2008, Madonna announced plans of playing a second European leg in 2009 to play in territories she <b>either</b> <b>had</b> never been to or had not played for a long time.|$|E
5|$|The 12th and 13th centuries were {{a period}} of huge {{economic}} growth in England. The population of England rose from around 1.5million in 1086 to around 4or 5million in 1300, stimulating increased agricultural outputs and the export of raw materials to Europe. In contrast to the previous two centuries, England was relatively secure from invasion. Except for {{the years of the}} Anarchy, most military conflicts <b>either</b> <b>had</b> only localised economic impact or proved only temporarily disruptive. English economic thinking remained conservative, seeing the economy as consisting of three groups: the ordines, those who fought, or the nobility; laboratores, those who worked, in particular the peasantry; and oratores, those who prayed, or the clerics. Trade and merchants played little part in this model and were frequently vilified {{at the start of the}} period, although they were increasingly tolerated towards the end of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche {{chose not}} to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the New York Rangers on a three-year {{contract}} worth $21million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7million. He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury's first year in Manhattan was a disappointment. He scored only 15goals in 1999–2000, struggling {{under the pressure of}} trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in New York. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that <b>either</b> <b>had</b> any effect on his play.|$|E

5|$|The Femme Fatale Tour was {{the eighth}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It {{was launched in}} support of her seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011). It was officially announced in March 2011, with dates for North American venues revealed. The tour was initially planned as a co-headlining tour with Enrique Iglesias, but he canceled only hours after the announcement. The show is inspired by {{the concept of the}} femme fatale and femmes fatales throughout the ages. The setlist was mostly composed of songs from Femme Fatale, although Spears also performed hits from her previous albums for her fans. Fashion designer Zaldy Goco created the costumes. In July 2011, Spears announced plans of playing a South American leg in territories she <b>either</b> <b>had</b> never been to or had not played for a long time. Spears has named the Femme Fatale Tour the best show of her career.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{had been}} a home for music video pioneers. When the music video cable channel MTV started {{broadcasting}} in 1982, the importance of videos abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience. MTV filled its programs with many hard rock and heavy metal videos, but these were too expensive for bands who <b>either</b> <b>had</b> no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels. Moreover, music videos exalted the visual appeal of a band, an area where some British metal groups were deficient. So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following. Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable {{to follow up on}} their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.|$|E
5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody <b>either</b> <b>had</b> been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that <b>either</b> <b>had</b> a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
