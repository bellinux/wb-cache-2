5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. The call of the greater melampitta is a <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and {{is reminiscent of the}} black pitohui. The call of the lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped whistles, both of which are repeated at intervals.|$|E
5|$|High {{altitude}} sections {{subject to}} {{snow and ice}} have yellow lane markings and red reflector posts (which are sometimes <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> height); {{in contrast to the}} white lines and posts generally seen elsewhere around Australia. It is recommended that snow chains are carried for all two-wheel drive vehicles travelling on this highway within Kosciuszko National Park during the winter months.|$|E
5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in <b>Double</b> <b>or</b> <b>Triple</b> battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E
50|$|In {{productions}} to date, the opera’s eight {{characters have}} been performed by singers <b>doubling</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripling</b> roles.|$|R
5000|$|The lowest {{possible}} score for a bingo is 56. This {{is achieved by}} making an 8-letter word with six one-point tiles and two blanks, or by making a 7-letter word with one blank and a two-letter word with both blanks. The word must not be <b>doubled</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripled,</b> and no one-point tile may be <b>doubled</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripled.</b> A 55-point bingo is theoretically possible in tournament play, by making a two-blank play on an empty board that misses the center star.|$|R
25|$|Other {{important}} factors affect the point totals. Some local special event races are <b>double</b> <b>or</b> even <b>triple</b> point races, <b>doubling</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripling</b> the points each {{position in the}} Mains each racer would normally get. points are awarded, so an Expert winner could look forward to collecting 400 points for winning his class in addition to bonus points and participant points.|$|R
5|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{received}} {{criticism for}} {{his inability to}} win lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game; Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful in his life. He returned to Kansas for his junior year and to play another season under coach Dick Harp. Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams' way of playing him, which primarily consisted of <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> teaming Chamberlain in order to limit his offensive production and effectiveness. In addition, many teams resorted to running out {{the time on the}} clock when in the lead against the Jayhawks to increase their odds of winning the game. After the Jayhawks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year, Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He did not return to Kansas' campus for over 40 years after leaving for the Globetrotters; he finally returned in 1998, the year before his death, when his jersey was retired.|$|E
25|$|In sociolinguistics, a <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> slash {{may also}} {{be used in the}} {{transcription}} of a traditional sociolinguistic interview or in other type of linguistic elicitation to represent simultaneous speech, interruptions, and certain types of speech disfluencies.|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of Lie theory, a Dynkin diagram, named for Eugene Dynkin, {{is a type}} of graph with some edges doubled or tripled (drawn as a <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> line). The multiple edges are, within certain constraints, directed.|$|E
50|$|The machine clips {{the wool}} at its full length which often <b>doubles</b> <b>or</b> <b>triples</b> its value, it also removes the wool in a fleece instead of {{chopping}} it {{into small pieces}} like the shears.|$|R
50|$|Lack of {{cross-town}} bus routes, forcing bus {{riders to}} travel downtown to cross {{from one side}} of the city to another, often <b>doubling</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripling</b> what the trip distance would have been with a direct route.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, {{with his}} {{colleague}} David Weisburd, he demonstrated that <b>doubling</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripling</b> {{the frequency of}} police patrols in crime hot spots could reduce street crime by two-thirds. This discovery has been replicated by other scholars as well.|$|R
25|$|OsO4 is {{very soluble}} in tert-butyl alcohol. In solution, it is readily reduced by {{hydrogen}} to osmium metal. The suspended osmium metal {{can be used}} to catalyze hydrogenation {{of a wide variety of}} organic chemicals containing <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> bonds.|$|E
25|$|Less {{common is}} the use of a <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> {{chainring}} in conjunction with an internally geared hub, extending the gear range without having to fit multiple sprockets to the hub. However, this does require a chain tensioner of some sort, negating some of the advantages of hub gears.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of hydrogen to <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> bonds in hydrocarbons {{is a type}} of redox reaction that can be thermodynamically favorable. For example, the {{addition of}} hydrogen to an alkene has a Gibbs free energy change of -101 kJ·mol−1. However, the reaction rate for most hydrogenation reactions is negligible in the absence of catalysts.|$|E
50|$|Ambit Energy {{has come}} under {{scrutiny}} from regulators and consumer advocates. A 2014 story by ConsumerAffairs documents numerous complaints by customers whose rates <b>doubled</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripled</b> without warning. Complainants also said {{it was difficult to}} contact Ambit to discuss rates or switch plans.|$|R
50|$|Coupons. The LLLLL digits are the {{manufacturer}} code, the first 3 RRR are a family code (set by manufacturer), {{and the next}} 2 RR are a coupon code, which determines {{the amount of the}} discount. These coupons can be <b>doubled</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripled.</b>|$|R
50|$|As well as {{relieving}} the shearer's hand of {{the cutting}} effort, the machine clips the wool at its full length, which often <b>doubles</b> <b>or</b> <b>triples</b> its value. It also removes the wool in a fleece instead of chopping it into small pieces like the shears.|$|R
25|$|Some ocarina makers {{increase}} the range by designing double- or triple-chambered ocarinas (sometimes simply {{referred to as}} <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> ocarinas) tuned an octave or a tenth apart although some double ocarinas are not made to {{increase the}} range, but to play {{in harmony with the}} other chambers.. These double and triple ocarinas can also play chords.|$|E
25|$|Retention time {{increases}} with hydrophobic (non-polar) surface area. Branched chain compounds elute {{more rapidly than}} their corresponding linear isomers because the overall surface area is decreased. Similarly organic compounds with single C–C bonds elute later than those with a C=C or C–C triple bond, as the <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> bond is shorter than a single C–C bond.|$|E
25|$|All Folds {{are born}} with straight, {{unfolded}} ears, and those with the Fold gene will begin to show the fold usually within about 21 days. The kittens that do not develop folded ears are known as Straights. The original cats only had one fold in their ears, but due to selective breeding, breeders have increased the fold to a <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> crease that causes the ear to lie totally flat against the head.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} ICF drivers are being explored. Lasers have {{improved}} dramatically since the 1970s, scaling up in energy and power {{from a few}} joules and kilowatts to megajoules (see NIF laser) and hundreds of terawatts, using mostly frequency <b>doubled</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripled</b> light from neodymium glass amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{combinations}} {{that can}} beat a <b>double</b> 2 <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> 2.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{guideline}} {{that corresponds}} to this crime typically <b>doubles</b> <b>or</b> <b>triples</b> the sentence the alien would otherwise have received if the deportation follows conviction for an aggravated felony. In Almendarez-Torres v. United States, , the Supreme Court held that this increased maximum sentence did not violate the Sixth Amendment.|$|R
25|$|This genere, the {{offspring}} of the contradanza, was also danced in lines or squares. It was also a brisk form of music and dance in <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> time. A repeated 8-bar paseo was followed by two 16-bar sections called the primera and segunda. One famous composer of danzas was Ignacio Cervantes, whose forty-one danzas cubanas were a landmark in musical nationalism. This type of dance was eventually replaced by the danzón, which was, like the habanera, much slower and more sedate.|$|E
25|$|For some {{molecules}} and ions, {{it is difficult}} to determine which lone pairs should be moved to form <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> bonds, and two or more different resonance structures may be written for the same molecule or ion. In such cases it is usual to write all of them with two-way arrows in between (see Example below). This is sometimes the case when multiple atoms of the same type surround the central atom, and is especially common for polyatomic ions.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} {{has also}} been cited as a contributing factor in medical errors. One study found that being awake for over 24 hours caused medical interns to <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> the number of preventable medical errors, including those that resulted in injury or death. The risk of car crash after these shifts increased by 168%, {{and the risk of}} near miss by 460%. Interns admitted falling asleep during lectures, during rounds, and even during surgeries. Night shifts are associated with worse surgeon performance during laparoscopic surgeries.|$|E
40|$|Only <b>doubling</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripling</b> α-synuclein {{expression}} significantly {{increases the}} risk of developing Parkinson's disease. In this issue of Neuron, Nemani et al. show that this modest overexpression of α-synuclein does not lead to obvious toxicity in the near term, but impairs glutamate and dopamine release, potentially leading to broad network dysfunction and eventual pathology...|$|R
50|$|The Local Powerhouse Scheme {{showed the}} {{problems}} of isolated systems, as demand often outstripped capacity shortly after opening, with generating capacity needing to be <b>doubled</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripled</b> in some cases. Interconnection was the long term solution, and Aramac was connected to Barcaldine, with Augathella connected to Charleville, both in 1961, heralding the future.|$|R
50|$|In trucking, a bogie is the {{subassembly}} of axles and wheels {{that supports}} a semi-trailer, whether permanently {{attached to the}} frame (as on a single trailer) or making up the dolly that can be hitched and unhitched as needed when hitching up a second or third semi-trailer (as when pulling <b>doubles</b> <b>or</b> <b>triples).</b>|$|R
25|$|In some cases, {{a referee}} can impose a <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> minor. The infraction is counted as {{two or three}} {{separate}} minor penalties. If a team scores a power play goal during such a penalty, only the current block of two minutes being counted down is canceled; the penalty clock is then reset to the next lowest interval of two minutes (ex. a goal with a double-minor penalty clock at 3:45 is reset to 2:00). Expiration rules of double- or triple-minor penalties due to goals being scored are identical to that of regular minor penalties being served back-to-back.|$|E
25|$|The Maginot line {{required}} {{a large number}} of fixed anti-tank artillery, which was easily disrupted by artillery shelling or smoke screens. Flexible lines use mixed natural and artificial anti-tank obstacles; tanks and other armored vehicles could not get through these well-planned defense lines on their own, especially if the design take advantage of the natural relief and objects. The most effective protection provided by <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> U trenches on hillsides, because enemy's artillery can not destroy an indentation. Armored troops can only get through this line with AVLBs or extensive engineering operations, which is relatively easy to counteract.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in previous experiments, notably the Shiva laser, was that the infrared light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054nm in vaco) couples strongly with the electrons around the target, losing {{a considerable amount of}} energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an optical frequency multiplier, which can <b>double</b> <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> the frequency of the light, into the green or ultraviolet, respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. HiPER will use frequency tripling on the drivers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first meeting}} at Asbury Grove {{was held in}} the third week of August, 1859, and {{attracted}} 2,000 people at its inception. Some reports state {{that by the end of}} that first week, the attendance had grown to nearly 12,000. As with other camp meetings in other towns, these were major events, often <b>doubling</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripling</b> (<b>or,</b> multiplying even further) a town's population during the gathering.|$|R
50|$|Scores will be doubled if a word {{is placed}} on the DW space. The word will have a triple value if it {{is placed on}} the TW space. Individual letter's scores can also be <b>doubled</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripled</b> by placing them on the DL or TL space, respectively. 35 Bonus points are awarded to players who use all 7 tiles in a single turn.|$|R
50|$|The {{writing system}} is a Latin-based {{alphabet}} and has 26 letters. It has three additional letter symbols which correspond to the IPA symbols. There are also eleven digraphs and two trigraphs. Vowel length is represented by <b>doubling</b> <b>or</b> <b>tripling</b> the vowel symbol, e.g. 'a', 'aa' and 'aaa'. Tones are not represented. Nasalisation is represented after oral consonants where it distinguishes between minimal pairs.|$|R
