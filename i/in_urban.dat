5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E

30|$|We {{notice that}} the raw gender wage gap is more {{pronounced}} in the rural sector than that <b>in</b> the <b>urban.</b> <b>In</b> the rural sector, women are mainly employed in agriculture and related occupations.

On the other side, <b>in</b> the <b>urban</b> sector women are employed in other occupations such as professional and clerical and the wages between men and women remain comparable.
