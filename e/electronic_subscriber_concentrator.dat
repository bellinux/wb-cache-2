The aim is to develop the methods and devices for multi-channel operation of the digital telephone communication system signals in the cable television channels. The digital lines of telephone communication have been developed and investigated from position of the electromagnetic compatibility and noise immunity. The methods of constructing multi-channel transmission systems in the section from subcriber to the concentrator have been proposed, developed and investigated. The methods for designing multi-channel systems of the digital telephone communication from <b>subscriber</b> to the <b>concentrator</b> satisfying the given conditions have been developed taking electromagnetic compatibility into consideration. The device devealoped has been protected by two RF patents.

Scientific {{publishing}} {{is currently}} undergoing significant paradigm shifts, {{as it makes}} the transition from print to <b>electronic</b> format, from <b>subscribers</b> only to open access and from static information to a dynamic knowledge space. In this paper, we investigate four tremendously promising online publishing systems and projects as a short review of state-off-the-art scientific publishing platforms...|$|R
50|$|While many {{telephone}} service providers have for decades published {{a list of}} their subscribers in a telephone directory, and similarly corporations published a list of their employees in an internal directory, {{it was not until}} the rise of electronic mail systems that a requirement for standards for the <b>electronic</b> exchange of <b>subscriber</b> information between different systems appeared.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for mobile radio {{services and the}} scarce bandwidth available suggest to devote considerable research efforts to find more efficient multiple access techniques {{in order to improve}} the system capacity. In this work we compare the system performance of three mobile radio systems: the well known TDMA system, which is the basis of the European GSM, the recent CDMA system (a standard introduced by Qualcomm) and the proposed slotted Aloha packet system. The results of this paper show that the performance of slotted Aloha is comparable or better than CDMA, while exhibiting a virtual insensitivity to propagation conditions. I. Introduction Mobile communications have gained a great interest in the past decade, due to the necessity for a user to travel freely within a service area and simultaneously communicate with any telephone, fax, data modem and <b>electronic</b> mail <b>subscriber</b> in the world. The first-generation cellular radio systems use analog frequency modulation and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Remote Access Multi-mission Processing and Analysis Ground Environment (RAMPAGE) is a Java-language server {{computer}} program that enables near-real-time display of spacecraft telemetry data on any authorized client computer that {{has access to}} the Internet and is equipped with Web-browser software. In addition to providing a variety of displays of the latest available telemetry data, RAMPAGE can deliver notification of an alarm by <b>electronic</b> mail. <b>Subscribers</b> can then use RAMPAGE displays to determine the state of the spacecraft and formulate a response to the alarm, if necessary. A user can query spacecraft mission data in either binary or comma-separated-value format by use of a Web form or a Practical Extraction and Reporting Language (PERL) script to automate the query process. RAMPAGE runs on Linux and Solaris {{server computer}}s in the Ground Data System (GDS) of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and includes components designed specifically to make it compatible with legacy GDS software. The client/server architecture of RAMPAGE {{and the use of the}} Java programming language make it possible to utilize a variety of competitive server and client computers, thereby also helping to minimize costs...|$|R
50|$|A Credential Service Provider (CSP) is {{a trusted}} entity that issues {{security}} tokens or <b>electronic</b> credentials to <b>subscribers.</b> A CSP forms {{part of an}} authentication system, most typically identified as a separate entity in a Federated authentication system. A CSP may be an independent third party, or may issue credentials for its own use. The term CSP is used frequently {{in the context of}} the US government's eGov and e-authentication initiatives. An example of a CSP would be an online site whose primary purpose may be, for example, internet banking - but whose users may be subsequently authenticated to other sites, applications or services without further action on their part.|$|R
40|$|New {{forms of}} {{scholarly}} communication are evolving on international computer networks such as BITNET and Internet. Scholars are exchanging {{information on a}} daily basis via computer conferences, personal e-mail, and file transfers. Electronic serials are being distributed on networks, often at no charge to the <b>subscriber.</b> <b>Electronic</b> newsletters provide timely information about current topics of interest. Electronic journals, which are often refereed, provide scholarly articles, columns, and reviews. Utilizing computer networks, scholars have become electronic publishers, creating an alternative publication system. Electronic serials hold great promise, but a variety of problems currently limit their effectiveness. Given the serials pricing crisis, librarians should encourage the development of network-based electronic serials...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique implemented for {{the integration of}} paging networks with the Internet through <b>electronic</b> mail. Pager <b>subscribers</b> are assigned standard Internet e-mail addresses. When a message is received for such a subscriber, he/she is immediately informed via the pager by a concise radio message. The actual e-mail message remains at the e-mail server until the subscriber retrieves it. The growth of the Internet {{and that of the}} paging industry has been rapid and widespread, though independent of each other. Also, different communities have come to be served by each. With the technique described herein, a small, cheap pager receiver will not only be part of a global network, but it will also extend the reach of the Internet to an entirely new community...|$|R
5000|$|The Theosophical Movement is {{a monthly}} {{magazine}} that {{was started by}} the United Lodge of Theosophists India under B.P. Wadia on November 17, 1930. It is a magazine that {{is devoted to the}} living of the higher life. The monthly magazine is edited in Mumbai, India, by associates of the ULT. Its print and <b>electronic</b> editions have <b>subscribers</b> all over the world. All articles in the magazine are unsigned, except those that had been written by H.P.B., W.Q.J. or others who had made signed contributions in the older Theosophical magazines. Furthermore, articles in the magazine distinctly avoid all references to personal opinions and experiences of the author. These are directly in keeping with one of the core tenets of anonymity and impersonality of ULT associates as expressed by Robert Crosbie. The magazine is dedicated to: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology by libraries promises {{a solution that}} could {{make it possible to}} inventory hundreds of thousands of items in their collections in days instead of months. In addition, it would allow patrons to check out and return library property automatically at any time of the day. Besides speeding up checkouts, keeping collections in better order, and alleviating repetitive strain injuries among librarians, RFID promises to provide a better control on theft, nonreturns, and misfiling of a library’s assets. With an estimated 35 million library items tagged worldwide in more than three hundred libraries, this technology is generating ever-increasing interest. In October and November 2004, the industrial technology department and the Robert E. Kennedy Library at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, surveyed participating libraries, RFID electronic discussion groups, and Library and Information Technology Association (LITA-L) <b>electronic</b> discussion group <b>subscribers</b> to collect information with regards to the implementation of RFID systems in libraries. Opinions were gathered regarding such topics, actual or estimated, as RFID implementation costs and time; the impact of the technology on operations such as handling of volumes and security; and RFID system features adopted such as conversion stations, self-checkout units, and security systems. Information on the various RFID library components and the results from the survey are presented in this paper...|$|R
