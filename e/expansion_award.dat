40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to engineering mathematics education begins with {{one year of}} freshman calculus as a prerequisite to subsequent core engineering courses. However, the inability of incoming students to successfully advance through the traditional freshman calculus sequence is a primary cause of attrition in engineering programs across the country. As a result, this paper describes an NSF funded initiative at Wright State University to redefine {{the way in which}} engineering mathematics is taught, with the goal of increasing student retention, motivation and success in engineering. This paper provides an overview of the WSU model for engineering mathematics education, followed by an assessment of student performance, perception and retention through its initial implementation. It also summarizes the scope of a recent NSF CCLI Phase 2 <b>Expansion</b> <b>award,</b> which involves a multiyear assessment at WSU, pilot adoption and assessment at two collaborating institutions, and a widespread dissemination of results...|$|E
