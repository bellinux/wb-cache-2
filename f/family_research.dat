40|$|Purpose: This {{editorial}} aims {{to investigate}} the interface between gendered processes and family business by exploring {{the extent to which}} gendered processes are reinforced (or not) in family business operations and dynamics. This approach will complement the agency and RBV theoretical bases that dominate <b>family</b> business <b>research</b> (Chrisman et al., 2009), and further contribute to extending gender theories. Design/methodology/approach: Acknowledging that gender is socially constructed, this editorial discusses the interface between gendered processes and family business within entrepreneurship research. Findings: Despite a growing interest in gender and family business, there is a limited literature that explores gender theory within <b>family</b> business <b>research.</b> A gender theory approach embracing <b>family</b> business <b>research</b> contributes to a needed theoretical deconstruction of existing perspectives on the operations, sustainability and succession of family businesses in the 21 st century. Originality/value: This article makes a contribution to extant scholarship by extending gender theories through an exploration of the gendered processes in <b>family</b> business <b>research...</b>|$|R
