50|$|Types of <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndromes vary by pathology; {{including}} serum <b>hyperviscosity,</b> {{which may}} cause neurologic or ocular disorders; polycythemic <b>hyperviscosity,</b> {{which results in}} reduced blood flow or capillary perfusion and increased organ congestion; and syndromes of <b>hyperviscosity,</b> caused by reduced deformability of red blood cells, often evident in sickle cell anemia.|$|E
50|$|Although {{elevated}} {{whole blood}} viscosity {{is a better}} measure of <b>hyperviscosity</b> and more common and clinically important, serum viscosity and plasma viscosity are more frequently measured. Normal plasma viscosity is between 1.4 and 1.8 centipoise while symptoms from <b>hyperviscosity</b> typically occur greater than 4 centipoise (about 4 times more viscous than water) and require emergency treatment.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{of related}} <b>hyperviscosity</b> {{syndrome}} {{may be required}} to prevent neurologic symptoms or kidney failure.|$|E
50|$|Other uses are {{the removal}} of blood {{proteins}} where these are overly abundant and cause <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{risk factors}} {{which are being}} studied include levels of various {{inflammatory}} mediators such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, <b>hyperviscosity,</b> hypercoagulable state.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. Evidence of anemia, {{constitutional}} symptoms, <b>hyperviscosity,</b> swollen lymph nodes, or {{enlargement of}} the liver and spleen that {{can be attributed to}} an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder.|$|E
50|$|Monoclonal IgM myeloma {{proteins}} operating {{through their}} effects on increasing blood <b>hyperviscosity</b> can reduce {{blood flow to the}} central nervous system to cause blurred vision, headaches, vertigo, ataxia, and cold-induced hemolytic anemia.|$|E
50|$|A {{person with}} Eisenmenger's {{syndrome}} is paradoxically {{subject to the}} possibility of both uncontrolled bleeding due to damaged capillaries and high pressure, as well as spontaneous clots due to <b>hyperviscosity</b> and stasis of blood.|$|E
50|$|Autoimmune {{thrombocytopenia}} and anemia sometimes seen {{in patients}} with SMZL. Circulating villous lymphocytes are sometimes observed in peripheral blood samples. A monoclonal paraprotein is detected in a third of patients without hypergammaglobulinemia or <b>hyperviscosity.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperviscosity</b> occurs from {{pathologic}} {{changes of}} either cellular or protein fractions {{of the blood}} such as is found in polycythemias, multiple myeloma (particularly IgA and IgG3), leukemia, monoclonal gammopathies such as Waldenström macroglobulinemia, sickle cell anemia, and sepsis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperviscosity</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a group}} of symptoms triggered by increase in the viscosity of the blood. Symptoms of high blood viscosity include spontaneous bleeding from mucous membranes, visual disturbances due to retinopathy, and neurologic symptoms ranging from headache and vertigo to seizures and coma.|$|E
50|$|The {{emergency}} {{treatment of}} polycythemia (e.g., in <b>hyperviscosity</b> or thrombosis) is by phlebotomy (removal of {{blood from the}} circulation). Depending on the underlying cause, phlebotomy may also be used {{on a regular basis}} to reduce the hematocrit. Cytostatics such as busulfan and hydroxyurea are sometimes used for long-term management of polycythemia.|$|E
50|$|The {{life span}} in {{patients}} with Schnitzler syndrome has not been shown to differ much from the general population. Careful follow-up is advised, however. A significant proportion of patients develops a lymphoproliferative disorder as a complication, most commonly Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. This may lead to symptoms of <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome. AA amyloidosis has also been reported in people with Schnitzler syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The ESR is {{increased}} in inflammation, pregnancy, anemia, autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), infections, some kidney diseases and some cancers (such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma). The ESR is decreased in polycythemia, <b>hyperviscosity,</b> sickle cell anemia, leukemia, low plasma protein (due to liver or kidney disease) and congestive heart failure. The basal ESR is slightly higher in females.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{includes}} the monoclonal antibody rituximab, sometimes {{in combination with}} chemotherapeutic drugs such as chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, or vincristine or with thalidomide. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may also be used in combination. Plasmapheresis {{can be used to}} treat the <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome by removing the paraprotein from the blood, although it does not address the underlying disease. Ibrutinib is another agent that has been approved for use in this condition.|$|E
50|$|An {{uncommon}} {{but significant}} complication of dextran osmotic effect is acute renal failure. The pathogenesis of this renal failure {{is the subject}} of many debates with direct toxic effect on tubules and glomerulus versus intraluminal <b>hyperviscosity</b> being some of the proposed mechanisms. Patients with history of diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, or vascular disorders are most at risk. Brooks and others recommend the avoidance of dextran therapy in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.|$|E
5000|$|... ==== Smoldering Waldenström's macroglobulinemia ==== Smoldering Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is {{diagnosed}} in asymptomatic individuals {{that have a}} serum IgM level 30 gram/liter and/or a bone marrow lymphoplasmacytoid cell infilatrate >10% of total nucleated cells. These cases should have no symptoms or findings of end organ dysfunction attributed to Waldenström's macroglobulinemia such as anemia, decreases in any white blood cell count, cold agglutinin disease, <b>hyperviscosity</b> of blood, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, peripheral neuropathy, cryoglobulinemia, or constitutional symptoms.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, a panel at the International Workshop on Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia {{agreed on}} {{criteria}} for the initiation of therapy. They recommended starting therapy in patients with constitutional symptoms such as recurrent fever, night sweats, fatigue due to anemia, weight loss, progressive symptomatic lymphadenopathy or spleen enlargement, and anemia due to bone marrow infiltration. Complications such as <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome, symptomatic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, systemic amyloidosis, kidney failure, or symptomatic cryoglobulinemia were also suggested as indications for therapy.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms include {{blurring}} {{or loss of}} vision, headache, and (rarely) stroke or coma are due to {{the effects}} of the IgM paraprotein, which may cause autoimmune phenomenon or cryoglobulinemia. Other symptoms of WM are due to the <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome, which is present in 6-20% of patients. This is attributed to the IgM monoclonal protein increasing the viscosity of the blood by forming aggregates to each other, binding water through their carbohydrate component and by their interaction with blood cells.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{will also}} have {{evidence}} of their underlying disorder. Those with myeloma will typically display a rouleaux formation on a peripheral smear and a large globulin gap, indicative of a significant paraprotein load. While viscosity can be directly measured, results can take {{a few days to}} return and thus a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis in a timely manner. If <b>hyperviscosity</b> is suspected, treatment may need to be started prior to obtaining the official viscosity level.|$|E
50|$|Some {{symptoms}} (e.g., weakness, confusion, and fatigue) {{may be due}} to anemia or hypercalcemia. Headache, visual {{changes and}} retinopathy {{may be the result of}} <b>hyperviscosity</b> of the blood depending on the properties of the paraprotein. Finally, radicular pain, loss of bowel or bladder control (due to involvement of spinal cord leading to cord compression) or carpal tunnel syndrome, and other neuropathies (due to infiltration of peripheral nerves by amyloid) may occur. It may give rise to paraplegia in late-presenting cases.|$|E
5000|$|Macroglobulinemia is the {{presence}} of increased levels of macroglobulins in the circulating blood.It is a plasma cell dyscrasia, resembling leukemia, with cells of lymphocytic, plasmacytic, or intermediate morphology, which secrete a monoclonal immunoglobulin M component. There is diffuse infiltration by the malignant cells of the bone marrow and also, in many cases, of the spleen, liver, or lymph nodes. The circulating macroglobulin can produce symptoms of <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome: weakness, fatigue, bleeding disorders, and visual disturbances. Peak incidence of macroglobulinemia is in the sixth and seventh decades of life. (Dorland, 28th ed) ...|$|E
50|$|The defect, now a right-to-left shunt, causes reduced oxygen {{saturation}} in the arterial blood due to mixing of oxygenated blood {{returning from the}} lungs with the deoxygenated blood returning from systemic circulation. This decreased saturation is sensed by the kidneys, resulting in a compensatory increase in erythropoietin production and an increased production of red blood cells {{in an attempt to}} increase oxygen delivery. As the bone marrow increases erythropoiesis, the systemic reticulocyte count and the risk for <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome increases. Reticulocytes are less efficient at carrying oxygen as mature red cells, and they are less deformable, causing impaired transit through capillary beds. This contributes to the death of pulmonary capillary beds.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to 1990, {{amaurosis}} fugax could, [...] "clinically, {{be divided}} into four identifiable symptom complexes, each with its underlying pathoetiology: embolic, hypoperfusion, angiospasm, and unknown". [...] In 1990, the causes of amaurosis fugax were better refined by the Amaurosis Fugax Study Group, which has defined five distinct classes of transient monocular blindness based on their supposed cause: embolic, hemodynamic, ocular, neurologic, and idiopathic (or [...] "no cause identified") [...] Concerning the pathology underlying these causes (except idiopathic), [...] "some of the more frequent causes include atheromatous disease of the internal carotid or ophthalmic artery, vasospasm, optic neuropathies, giant cell arteritis, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intracranial pressure, orbital compressive disease, a steal phenomenon, and blood <b>hyperviscosity</b> or hypercoagulability." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{simple act}} of {{increasing}} the number of red blood cells in blood may be associated with <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome which is characterized by increased blood viscosity and decreased cardiac output and blood flow velocity which results in the reduction of peripheral oxygen delivery. [...] For instance, an overdose of EPO can thicken blood into a highly viscous and artery-clogging sludge. This increases the chances of heart attack, stroke, phlebitis, and pulmonary embolism, which has been seen in cases where there is too much blood reintroduced into the blood stream. Because blood doping increases the volume of red blood cells, it effectively introduces a condition called polycythemia, a blood disorder that has known adverse outcomes such as heart attacks or strokes.|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} features of cryoglobulinemic disease can reflect those due {{not only to}} the circulation of cryoglobulins but also to any underlying hematological premalignant or malignant disorder, infectious disease, or autoimmune syndrome. The following sections of {{clinical features}} focuses on those attributed to the cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins cause tissue damage by three mechanisms; they can: a) increase blood viscosity thereby reducing blood flow to tissues to cause the <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome (i.e. headache, confusion, blurry or loss of vision, hearing loss, and epistaxis; b) deposit in small arteries and capillaries thereby plugging these blood vessels and causing infarction and necrosis of tissues including in particular skin, distal extremities, and kidneys; and c) in type II and type III disease, deposit on the epithelium of blood vessels and activate the blood compliment system to form pro-inflammatory elements such as C5a thereby initiating the systemic vascular inflammatory reaction termed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.|$|E
50|$|People {{affected}} by the severest, often life-threatening, complications of cryoglobulinemic disease require urgent plasmapharesis and/or plasma exchange in order to rapidly reduce the circulating levels of their cryoglobulins. Complications commonly requiring this intervention include: <b>hyperviscosity</b> disease with severe symptoms of neurological (e.g. stroke, mental impairment, and myelitis) and/or cardiovascular (e.g., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction) disturbances; vasculitis-driven intestinal ischemia, intestinal perforation, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis, causing acute abdominal pain, general malaise, fever, and/or bloody bowel movements; vasculitis-driven pulmonary disturbances (e.g. coughing up blood, acute respiratory failure, X-ray evidence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates caused by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage); and severe kidney dysfunction due to intravascular deposition of immunoglobulins or vasculitis. Along with this urgent treatment, severely symptomatic patients are commonly started on therapy to treat any underlying disease; this treatment is often supplemented with anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) and/or immunosuppressive drugs. Cases where no underlying disease is known are also often treated with the latter corticosteroid and immunosuppressive medications.|$|E
50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{due to the}} cryoglobulins of type I disease reflect the <b>hyperviscosity</b> and deposition of cryoglobulins within the blood vessels which reduce or stop blood perfusion to tissues. These events occur particularly in cases where blood cryoglobulin levels of monoclonal IgM are high in patients with IgM MGUS, smoldering Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in uncommon cases where the levels of monoclonal IgA, IgG, free κ light chains, or free λ light chains are extremely high in patients with non-IgM MGUS, non-IgM smoldering multiple myeloma, or multiple myeloma. The interruption of blood flow to neurological tissues can cause symptoms of confusion, headache, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy. Interruption of blood flow to other tissues in type I disease can cause cutaneous manifestations of purpura, acrocyanosis, necrosis, ulcers, and livedo reticularis; spontaneous nose bleeds, joint pain, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; and cardiovascular disturbances such as shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and congestive heart failure.|$|E
5000|$|Types II and III (or mixed or variant) cryoglobulinemic {{disease may}} also present with {{symptoms}} {{and signs of}} blood <b>hyperviscosity</b> and intravascular cryoglobulin deposition but also include those attributable to cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. [...] "Meltzer's triad" [...] of palpable purpura, joint pain, and generalized weakness occurs in ~33% of patients presenting with type II or type III disease. One or more skin lesions including palpable purpura, ulcers, digital gangrene, and areas of necrosis occur in 69%-89% of these mixed disease cases (see attached photograph); less common findings include painful peripheral neuropathy (19%-44% of cases), kidney disease (primarily membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (30%), joint pain (28%), and, less commonly, dry eye syndrome, Raynaud phenomenon (i.e. episodic painful reductions in {{blood flow to the}} fingers and toes). While the glomerulonephritis occurring in mixed disease appears to be due to inflammatory vasculitis, the glomerulonephritis occurring in type I disease appears due to the interruption of blood flow. The hematological, infectious, and autoimmune diseases underlying type II cryoglobulinemic disease and the infectious and autoimmune diseases underlying type III cryoglobulinemic disease are also critical parts of the disease's clinical findings.|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{suffering}} type 1 cryoglobulinemia {{present with}} symptoms due to cold temperature-induce blood <b>hyperviscosity</b> and consequential interruptions of blood flow, e.g. skin lesions (lower extremity purpuric spots and papules, acrocyanosis, necrosis skin ulcers, livedo reticularis urticaria), peripheral neuropathy, blurred vision, loss of vision, hearing loss, headaches, confusion, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, heart failure, glomerulonephritis, renal failure, oral bleeding, and nasal bleeding. Rarely, patients may present with catastrophic decreases in {{blood flow to}} vital tissues and require emergency treatment. Symptomatic patients typically exhibit levels of a myeloma protein >5 gram/liter and can be diagnosed by simple observing the temperature-induced, reversible induction of serum precipitate formation. Patients, particularly those with catastrophic presentations, are treated with plasma exchange and/or plasmapharesis to reduce the load of circulating myeloma proteins and relieve acute symptoms. Patients with an overt malignancy are treated with the chemotherapy regimens used for Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia or multiply myeloma; patients with MGUS precursors to these diseases appear less reaponsive to these chemotherapeutic regimens. These patients as well as patients with overt malignancy may be treated with rituximab (kills normal and malignant B cells that bear the CD20 antigen or the proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib.|$|E
50|$|While {{traditionally}} {{classified as}} such, {{it is not}} clear that IgM MGUS is a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia. IgM MGUS involves an increase in a B cell derivative with morphological features of both plasma cells and lymphocytes viz., lymphoplasmacytic cells. Studies indicate that both plasma cells and lymphoblastic cells infiltrate involved tissues and that one or perhaps both cell types harbor mutations in a) the MYD88 gene (~20% in IgM MGUS, >90% in IgM-related malignancies almost all of which are L265P mutations that continuously activate the same cell-activating pathways as Toll-like receptors; b) the CXCR4 gene (8% in IgM MGUS, 25% in IgM-related malignancies); and c) increased gene copy number due to chromosomal rearrangements (36% in IgM MGUS, 82% in IgM-related malignancies). It is clear that each cell type contributes to different features of IgM malignancies but not clear that clonal plasma cells are critical to the development or progression of IgM MGUS. In all events, IgM MGUS is diagnosed in individuals who have serum IgM levels less that 30 gram/liter; have less than 10% of nucleated bone marrow cells with the lymphoplasmacytic morphology, and have no symptoms or findings of end organ dysfunction attributed to Waldenström's macroglobulinemia such as anemia, decreases in any white blood cell count, cold agglutinin disease, <b>hyperviscosity</b> of blood, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, peripheral neuropathy, cryoglobulinemia, or constitutional symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} main {{mechanisms}} of damage in non-proliferative retinopathy: blood vessel damage or remodeling, direct retinal damage, or occlusion {{of the blood}} vessels. The first mechanism is indirect damage by altering the blood vessels that supply the retina. In the case of hypertension, high pressures in the system causes {{the walls of the}} artery to thicken, which effectively reduces the amount of blood flow to the retina. This reduction in flow causes tissue ischemia leading to damage. Atherosclerosis, or hardening and narrowing of blood vessels, also reduces flow to the retina. The second mechanism is direct damage to the retina usually caused by free radicals that causes oxidative damage to the retina itself. Radiation, solar retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity fall under this category. The third common mechanism is occlusion of blood flow. This can be caused by either physically blocking the vessels of the retinal artery branches or causing the arteries to narrow. Again, the end result is reduced blood flow to the retina causing tissue damage. Sickle cell disease compromises blood flow by causing blood to sludge, or thicken and flow slowly, through the retinal arteries. Other disorders that cause <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome may also cause blood sludging. Lastly, clots or central artery thrombosis directly blocks flow to the retina causing the cells to die.|$|E
40|$|Hemorheological {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on cases of neonatal polycythemia and cases exhibiting the neonatal <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome. It was found that though hematocrit is the major contributing factor towards <b>hyperviscosity,</b> low plasma viscosity and decreased erythrocyte deformability {{also contribute to the}} final picture of whole blood viscosity observed in neonatal polycythemia. <b>Hyperviscosity</b> may be present in absence of polycythemia and may be responsible for the clinical <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome. This revealed the importance of estimation of whole blood viscosity in cases of newborns at risk, in whom just the estimation of hematocrit {{may not be enough to}} diagnose the condition of <b>hyperviscosity.</b> Measurement of red cell filterability may also be important, as reduced filterability may contribute to the increase in the whole blood viscosity in polycythemia or even otherwise. From this study, it could be seen that neonates exhibiting the <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome may not necessarily have polycythemia or for that matter may not have blood <b>hyperviscosity.</b> This makes estimation of whole and red cell deformability to be important parameters to exclude the diagnosis of <b>hyperviscosity</b> in the 'neonate so that other clinicopathological explanations may be sought by the attending physician to explain the symptoms and signs...|$|E
40|$|In {{this brief}} review, we have {{examined}} some clinical conditions that result {{to be associated}} to an altered hemorheological profile and at times accompanied by skin ulcers. This skin condition may be observed in patients with the following condtions, such as primary polycythemic <b>hyperviscosity</b> (polycythemia, thrombocytemia) treated with hydroxyurea, primary plasma <b>hyperviscosity</b> (multiple myeloma, cryoglobulinemia, cryofibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia, and connective tissue diseases), primary sclerocythemic <b>hyperviscosity</b> (hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, and sickle cell disease). In addition, it may be present in patients with secondary <b>hyperviscosity</b> conditions such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, critical limb ischemia and chronic venous insufficiency...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hyperviscosity</b> {{syndrome}} is usually seen in Waldenstrom macro-globulinemia with the serum viscosity> 4 cP. It commonly mani-fests as skin or mucosal bleeding, visual abnormalities and neuro-logical symptoms. We describe {{a case of}} a 65 -year-old man, who presented with chronic exertional chest pain and dyspnea without other manifestation and had <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome related to marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) even with a marginally elevated plasma viscosity. The symptoms resolved after initiation of che-motherapy. This case illustrates that MZL can cause <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome, which can manifest with cardiopulmonary symptoms without other clinical features even at a marginally elevated plasma viscosity. Atypical cases of <b>hyperviscosity</b> syndrome can, thus, present diagnostic challenges and require a high index of suspicion...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the Community Atmosphere Model's (CAM) spectral element method on variable-resolution grids using the shallow-water equations in spherical geometry. We configure the method as it is used in CAM, with dissipation of grid scale variance, implemented using <b>hyperviscosity.</b> <b>Hyperviscosity</b> is highly scale selective and grid independent, but does require a resolution-dependent coefficient. For the spectral element method with variable-resolution grids and highly distorted elements, we obtain the best results if we introduce a tensor-based <b>hyperviscosity</b> with tensor coefficients tied to the eigenvalues of the local element metric tensor. The tensor <b>hyperviscosity</b> is constructed so that, for regions of uniform resolution, it matches the traditional constant-coefficient <b>hyperviscosity.</b> With the tensor <b>hyperviscosity,</b> the large-scale solution is almost completely unaffected by the presence of grid refinement. This later point is important for climate applications in which long term climatological averages can be imprinted by stationary inhomogeneities in the truncation error. We also {{evaluate the}} robustness of the approach with respect to grid quality by considering unstructured conforming quadrilateral grids generated with a well-known grid-generating toolkit and grids generated by SQuadGen, a new open source alternative which produces lower valence nodes...|$|E
