30|$|It is also {{figured that}} {{increasing}} the number of lanes, reduces the odds of <b>experiencing</b> <b>this</b> crash. The routes having fewer lanes, let the driver move off-road easier which reduce his control on the vehicle, so driving on such roads increase the odds of <b>experiencing</b> <b>this</b> crash that seems to be rational.|$|R

5|$|The Azusa Street Revival was a {{historic}} revival meeting {{that took place}} in Los Angeles, California, and is the origin of the Pentecostal movement. Neely Terry, an African American woman who attended a small holiness church pastored by Julia Hutchins in Los Angeles, made a trip to visit family in Houston late in 1905. While in Houston, she visited Seymour's church, where he preached on receiving the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in other tongues, and though he had not <b>experienced</b> <b>this</b> personally, Terry was impressed with his character and message. Once home in California, Terry suggested that Seymour be invited to speak at the local church. Seymour received and accepted the invitation in February 1906, and he received financial help and a blessing from Parham for his planned one-month visit.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have <b>experienced</b> <b>this</b> before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding sexual harassment, is that it involves a range of behaviors. In most cases (although not in all cases) {{it is difficult for}} the victim to describe what they <b>experienced.</b> <b>This</b> can be related to difficulty classifying the situation or could be related to stress and humiliation experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.|$|E
25|$|Borré {{tells of}} a time when she saw an Inuit woman fall ill who blamed her {{sickness}} on the lack of seal in her diet. Once receiving seal meat, the woman felt better within hours and said that her quick recovery was due to the consumption of seal meat and blood. Borré <b>experienced</b> <b>this</b> many times among many different members of the group and they all attributed their sickness to the lack of Inuit food.|$|E

'It will serve as a challenge for me, they do not know what they are saying, before I have also <b>experienced</b> <b>this</b> before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong.', Pacquiao said.|$|E
25|$|Since {{all of the}} {{electrons}} in the flow <b>experienced</b> <b>this</b> looping motion, the amount of RF energy being radiated was greatly improved. And as the motion occurred at any field level beyond the critical value, {{it was no longer}} necessary to carefully tune the fields and voltages, and the overall stability of the device was greatly improved. Unfortunately, the higher field also meant that electrons often circled back to the cathode, depositing their energy on it and causing it to heat up. As this normally causes more electrons to be released, it could sometimes lead to a runaway effect, damaging the device.|$|E
25|$|Perforation (a hole in {{the wall}} of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract) often leads to catastrophic consequences if left untreated. Erosion of the gastro-intestinal wall by the ulcer leads to spillage of the stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. Perforation at the anterior surface of the stomach leads to acute peritonitis, initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis. The first sign is often sudden intense abdominal pain; an example is Valentino's syndrome, named after the silent-film actor who <b>experienced</b> <b>this</b> pain before his death. Posterior wall perforation leads to bleeding due to the involvement of gastroduodenal artery that lies posterior to {{the first part of the}} duodenum.|$|E

25|$|The {{space between}} the {{pressurized}} instrument compartment and the capsule was originally intended to hold a parachute recovery system for the rocket, {{but it had been}} left empty after this system was abandoned. The three unmanned Mercury-Redstone flights exhibited high vibration levels and structural bending in the adapter area, so Alan Shepard's flight included 340 pounds of lead-infused plastic in the adapter section along with additional bracing and stiffeners. After Shepard still reported noticeable vibration during launch, Gus Grissom's booster included even more ballast. The Atlas booster used for orbital Mercury flights had also <b>experienced</b> <b>this</b> issue, but with more catastrophic results as Mercury-Atlas 1 was destroyed in-flight due to structural failure caused by excessive flexing {{at the point where the}} booster mated with the capsule adapter.|$|E
25|$|The common ostrich has {{no sweat}} glands, and under heat stress {{they rely on}} panting to reduce their body temperature. Panting {{increases}} evaporative heat (and water) loss from its respiratory surfaces, therefore forcing air and heat removal without the loss of metabolic salts. Panting allows the common ostrich {{to have a very}} effective respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL). Heat dissipated by respiratory evaporation increases linearly with ambient temperature, matching the rate of heat production. As a result of panting the common ostrich should eventually experience alkalosis. However, The CO2 concentration in the blood does not change when hot ambient temperatures are <b>experienced.</b> <b>This</b> effect is caused by a lung surface shunt. The lung is not completely shunted, allowing enough oxygen to fulfill the bird’s metabolic needs. The common ostrich utilizes gular fluttering, rapid rhythmic contraction and relaxation of throat muscles, in a similar way to panting. Both these behaviors allow the ostrich to actively increase the rate of evaporative cooling.|$|E
25|$|Though Scriabin's late {{works are}} often {{considered}} {{to be influenced by}} synesthesia, a condition wherein one experiences sensation in one sense in response to stimulus in another, it is doubted that Scriabin actually <b>experienced</b> <b>this.</b> His colour system, unlike most synesthetic experience, accords with the circle of fifths: it was a thought-out system based on Sir Isaac Newton's Opticks. Note that Scriabin did not, for his theory, recognize a difference between a major and a minor tonality of the same name (for example: c-minor and C-Major). Indeed, influenced also by the doctrines of theosophy, he developed his system of synesthesia toward what would have been a pioneering multimedia performance: his unrealized magnum opus Mysterium was to have been a grand week-long performance including music, scent, dance, and light {{in the foothills of the}} Himalayas Mountains that was somehow to bring about the dissolution of the world in bliss.|$|E
