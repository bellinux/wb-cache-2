50|$|The West Indian {{whistling}} duck (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>arborea)</b> is a whistling duck that breeds in the Caribbean. Alternative {{names are}} black-billed whistling duck and Cuban whistling duck.|$|R
50|$|Little Cayman also {{hosts the}} {{critically}} endangered hawksbill sea turtle, and the threatened West Indian whistling duck (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>arborea),</b> {{also known as}} the black-billed whistling duck. The Tarpon Lake, a salt pond {{near the center of the}} island, boasts an unusual population of landlocked tarpon, a large silver fish that usually lives only in the ocean.|$|R
25|$|The faunal species {{reported}} {{from the park}} are giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis, elephant Loxodonta africana, aardvark Orycteropus afer, warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus, hyena Hyaena hyaena, lion Panthera leo, red-fronted gazelle Gazella rufifrons, waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, kob Kobus kob, topi Damaliscus lunatus, roan antelope Hippotragus equinus, impala Aepyceros melampus, vervet monkey Cercopithecus aethiops, patas monkey Erythrocebus patas, olive baboon Papio anubis, leopard Panthera pardus, and cheetah Acinonyx jubatus. Avifauna reported are also substantial {{and some of the}} important species are: areostrich Struthio camelus, ground hornbill Bucorvus abyssinicus, bateleur Terathopius ecaudatus, white-faced tree duck <b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>arborea,</b> Abyssinian roller Coracias abyssinica, standard-winged nightjar Macrodipteryx longipennis and guinea fowl Numida meleagris.|$|R
5000|$|The lake adjoins the Floral Colour Garden {{and covers}} {{approximately}} three acres. Prior to the Botanic Park's {{current state of}} gardens, trails, and natural exhibits existed a natural wetland {{that was part of}} a Buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus) swamp. During the planning stage, park developers decided to develop the swampland into a small lake that would serve as an aquatic bird habitat for several species along with the threatened West Indian Whistling Duck (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>arborea).</b> [...] This aquatic habitat at the Botanic Park has become increasingly important as the wetlands on Grand Cayman Island continue to be lost to development. With the birds that gather here as well the aquatic plant life, lake is a popular spot for photographers visiting the park. Because it is landlocked without any feeding tributaries, the lake varies in size throughout the year, depending on the rainy season to fill it up.|$|R
50|$|The {{group of}} {{terrestrial}} vertebrates {{with the greatest}} diversity of documented species are birds. This taxon is represented by 16 orders, 43 families, 123 species. Of the 123 species reported to date, 9 are endemic, 59 residents, 39 migratory and 16 introduced. The Passeriformes order comprises the majority of families while the Scolopacidae family has {{the largest number of}} species, including 15 species of shorebirds. A total of 16 critical elements are counted in this group including the West Indian whistling duck (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>arborea),</b> the white-cheeked pintail (Anas bahamensis), the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), roseate tern (Sterna dougallii), the American coot (Fulica americana), the Puerto Rican plain pigeon (Patagioenas inornata wetmorei) and the white-crowned pigeon (Patagioenas leucocephala). Other prevalent bird species that can be observed at NEC's beaches include the great egret (Ardea alba) and the great blue heron (Ardea herodias). A great variety of ducks can also be found to include the blue-winged teal (Anas discors), the rudy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis), besides the aforementioned West Indian whistling duck and the white-cheeked pintail. The brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) also resides in this area.|$|R
50|$|In 1186, {{he helped}} {{establish}} Aragonese influence in Sardinia when he supported his cousin Agalbursa, {{the widow of}} the deceased Judge of <b>Arborea,</b> Barison <b>II,</b> in placing her grandson, the child of her eldest daughter Ispella, Hugh, on the throne of Arborea in opposition to Peter of Serra.|$|R
50|$|Nicholas was {{the eldest}} son and {{successor}} of William of Capraia, who had usurped the judicial office of <b>Arborea</b> from Marianus <b>II</b> in 1255. On William's death in 1264, Nicholas took up his authority, but he was imprisoned by Marianus in 1270 and remained in prison until Marianus decided to remove him permanently in 1274. His cousin Anselm tried to take his authority back in Cagliari.|$|R
50|$|Manfred I (died 1175) was {{the first}} marquess of Saluzzo, serving in that {{capacity}} from 1125 until his death. He was the eldest son of Boniface del Vasto, the margrave of Western Liguria, of a noble stock which had ruled the region between Savona and Ventimiglia for generations. Boniface received the county of Saluzzo in feudum directly from its suzerain, Ulric Manfred, margrave of Turin, {{and gave it to}} his son. The county comprised the land between the Alps, the Po River, and the Stura. Manfred transmitted the marquistate to his son by Eleonara (possibly the daughter of Gonario <b>II</b> of <b>Arborea</b> because of Pisa's connection with <b>Arborea),</b> Manfred <b>II,</b> and the dynasty which reigned until the Renaissance was born.|$|R
40|$|Earthmounds {{fields are}} flat floodplain, which contain small {{elevations}} (morrotes) scattered in the landscape. These earthmounds have different soil and vegetation {{from the surrounding}} area, since it does not overflow during the rainy season. It is expected that the size (m²) and volume (m³) of the earthmounds exert influence on the floristic composition and plant community structure. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was analyze the floristic composition and community structure of trees and shrubs in earthmounds in the Pantanal of Poconé, MT, in order to answer two questions: (i) Is there a correlation between the area and volume of the earthmounds with richness and abundance of tree and shrub vegetation? (ii) Is there a correlation between the area and volume of the earthmounds with the basal area of trees and shrubs? Were plots used to delimit the area of earthmounds field to be studied. In each plot, we measured the area and volume of each earthmounds and conducted the floristic and phytosociological survey. We observed that the area and volume influenced the richness, abundance and basal area of the species. Campos de murundus são áreas planas alagáveis, onde se encontram pequenas elevações (morrotes) espalhadas na paisagem. Esses murundus apresentam solo e vegetação diferente da área circundante, uma vez que não se alagam no período chuvoso. Espera-se que o tamanho (m²) e o volume (m³) dos murundus exerçam influência sobre a composição florística e a estrutura da comunidade vegetal. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar a composição florística e a estrutura da comunidade vegetal arbórea e arbustiva em murundus, no Pantanal de Poconé, MT, com a finalidade de responder a duas perguntas: (i) Existe correlação entre a área e o volume do murundu com a riqueza e abundância da vegetação <b>arbórea</b> e arbustiva? (<b>ii)</b> Existe correlação entre a área e o volume do murundu com a área basal das espécies arbóreas e arbustivas? Foram usadas parcelas para delimitar a área de campo de murundus a ser estudada. Nessas parcelas, formam mensurados a área e volume dos murundus e realizados os levantamentos florístico e fitossociológico. Foi verificado que área e volume influenciaram a riqueza, a abundância e a área basal das espécies...|$|R
