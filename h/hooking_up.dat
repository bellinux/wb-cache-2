5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, {{which has a}} mass of 16 short tons. It was installed {{with the use of}} the shuttle's robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.|$|E
25|$|After a {{scoreless}} third quarter, Cincinnati {{began to}} fight back as kicker Shayne Graham got a 33-yard field goal. After Kansas City increased its lead with Huard <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with Gonzalez again on a 26-yard TD pass, the Bengals nearly managed {{to tie the game}} with Palmer <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with Houshmandzadeh again on a 30-yard TD pass, along with Graham kicking a 36-yard field goal. K.C. managed to recover the onside kick and get the victory.|$|E
25|$|However, Denver quickly {{eliminated}} Cleveland's comeback hopes {{with their}} opening drive {{of the fourth}} quarter. On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Elway completed a 23-yard pass to Vance Johnson. Then on third and 10 from the Denver 43, he completed a 20-yard pass to Johnson, two plays before <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with Winder for a 39-yard touchdown completion. Denver then scored field goals on each of their next two drives to put the game away.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the third}} quarter was a {{defensive}} struggle until the Chiefs put together a 49-yard drive to score on Lowery's 23-yard field goal. Then in the fourth quarter, Montana connected with Willie Davis for 22 yards and Birden for 19 on the way to Marcus Allen's 2-yard touchdown run that tied the game at 17. O'Donnell led the Steelers right back though, completing a 26-yard pass to Dwight Stone before <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with Eric Green for a 22-yard touchdown throw to retake the lead, 24–17.|$|E
25|$|Reinforced {{with the}} Fifth Cavalry, General Crook {{took to the}} field. <b>Hooking</b> <b>up</b> briefly with General Terry, he soon moved {{out on his own}} but did not find a large village. Running short on supplies, his column turned south and made what became called the Horsemeat March toward mining {{settlements}} to find food. On September 9, 1876, an advance company from his column en route to Deadwood to procure supplies stumbled across a small village at Slim Buttes, which they attacked and looted. Crazy Horse learned of the assault on the village and the next day led a counter-attack, which was repulsed. After reaching Camp Robinson, Crook's forces disbanded.|$|E

Attach yourself to someone smarter, prettier, more fashionable, hipper, funnier than you are, and you will automatically acquire these missing qualities by osmosis. They, equally, will benefit from your particular brand of star quality. Your public perception will become more complete, more exciting.

25|$|On flight day 10, astronauts Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-130 mission. Their tasks included <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> heater and data cables for PMA-3, removing thermal covers and launch locks on Cupola, and installing handrails on Tranquility and a video cable for another base to be installed on the Russian segment of the ISS. Bob Behnken also connected the second ammonia cooling loop and disconnected a temporary power cable on Tranquility. Once the launch locks were removed, pilot Terry Virts opened the windows on Cupola for the first time. During the day Kay Hire and Terry Virts hooked up and transferred the Cupola robotics station for its use in the future. Terry Virts also completed some transfer tasks in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Face {{protection}} is mentioned {{at least three}} times in the literature of the Komnenian period, and probably indicates face-covering mail, leaving only the eyes visible. This would accord with accounts of such protection in earlier military writings, which describe double-layered mail covering the face, and later illustrations. Such a complete camail could be raised off the face by <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> the mail to studs on the brow of the helmet. However, the remains of metal ‘face-mask’ anthropomorphic visors were discovered {{at the site of the}} Great Palace of Constantinople in association with a coin of Manuel I Komnenos. Such masks were found on some ancient Roman helmets and on contemporary helmets found in grave sites associated with Kipchak Turks from the North Pontic Steppe. The existence of these masks could indicate that the references to face-protection in Byzantine literature describe the use of this type of solid visor.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} quarter alone, Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett {{completed}} 5/6 passes for 160 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for a score. On the third play of the game, Plunkett threw a pass that bounced off the hands of Kenny King and {{into the arms of}} tight end Raymond Chester, who took off to the end zone for a 65-yard touchdown reception. The Chargers seemed primed to respond, as Dan Fouts completed a 55-yard pass to Ron Smith on their first play of the next drive, but Oakland defensive back Lester Hayes, who recorded 13 interceptions in the regular season and four in the previous two playoff games, picked off a pass from Fouts and returned it 16 yards to the Raiders 25-yard line. However, the Chargers defense forced a punt and Fouts made up for his mistake on the next possession, <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with Charlie Joiner for a 48-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7.|$|E

25|$|Hoping {{to build}} on their home win over the Redskins, the Buccaneers flew to Texas Stadium for a Thanksgiving game against the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, the Bucs capped off their opening driver with FB Mike Alstott getting a 1-yard TD run. However, the Cowboys responded with QB Tony Romo getting a 30-yard TD pass to WR Terry Glenn. In the second quarter, Romo and Glenn hooked up with each other again on a 2-yard TD pass. The Bucs could only respond with kicker Matt Bryant getting a 46-yard field goal. Dallas would respond with Romo getting a 1-yard TD pass to RB Marion Barber. In the third quarter, Romo and Barber would hook up with each other again on a 2-yard TD pass, with Romo also <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with WR Terrell Owens on a 7-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, kicker Mike Vanderjagt would close out the scoring with a 22-yard field goal. With the loss, the Bucs fell to 3–8.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 9, Rick Mastracchio and Clay Anderson {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Their tasks included <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> the ammonia and nitrogen lines to the new Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA), installing the old ATA in the shuttle's payload bay, retrieving some Micro-Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) shields, bolting a grapple bar (which had been removed from the old ATA) onto the new ATA, and preparation of some cables on the Z1 truss and tools to be used during STS-132. During the installation of the old ATA in Discoverys payload bay, the spacewalkers had some problems securing a bolt on the ATA to the LMC. The spacewalk took 6 hours and 24 minutes, bringing the total EVA time to 20 hours and 19 minutes. While the EVA was going on, commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki continued transferring items from the MPLM to the ISS. Transfer is more than seventy-five percent complete.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo {{started their}} first drive on their 46-yard line, but it ended with an {{interception}} by Bengals cornerback Lewis Billups. On the next play, Esiason's 29-yard run moved the team into scoring range. However, they also came up empty when Esiason's pass was intercepted by Bills linebacker Ray Bentley. Later on, Cincinnati took a 7–0 {{lead in the}} first quarter after defensive back Eric Thomas' 26-yard interception return to the Bills 4-yard line set up Woods' 1-yard touchdown run. However, a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty against Bengals running back Stanley Wilson (one of six personal foul penalties in the game, two by the Bengals and four by the Bills) after the touchdown was assessed on the ensuing kickoff, and Buffalo ended up getting the ball with good field position with Ronnie Harmon's 22-yard return to the 43-yard line. Kelly subsequently led the Bills back with four consecutive completions, starting out with a pair of throws to receiver Andre Reed for gains of nine and 19 yards and then <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with Trumaine Johnson for a 22-yard gain to the Bengals 9-yard line. On the next play, Kelly found Reed in the right corner of the end zone for a touchdown pass to tie the game.|$|E

50|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} studies that have studied the mental aspects of casual hookups. In a study down by {{psychologist}} Seth Schwartz has shown results that say that people who had many random <b>hook</b> <b>ups</b> had more psychological issues. For instance, students in college that had stated they were involved in casual sex had higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem, happiness and life satisfaction compared to the students who did not engage in a casual <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> in the past thirty days. There was then a study of about 400 young adults that felt lonely and depressed and adults who had less feeling of loneliness and depression who were involved in sexual intercourse. They then researched what emotional affects being involved in sexual intercourse hookups had on them. They then came up with results that showed that penetrative sex <b>hook</b> <b>ups</b> made people with greater feelings of depression and loneliness have a decrease in those symptoms and feelings. Where as people who expressed less symptoms of loneliness and depression had an increase in those feelings after a penetrative sex <b>hook</b> <b>up.</b> Not only does it make people feel depressed but it makes them feel uncomfortable. For example, a study by Reiber and Garcia in 2010 show {{that a lot of people}} that engage in sexual <b>hook</b> <b>ups</b> feel uncomfortable. They also came to a conclusion that 78% of people in a <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> overestimate how comfortable their partner is doing certain things during their sexual engagement.

500|$|As of October 2008, Wu starred with Jessica Rose and Phillip DeFranco in <b>Hooking</b> <b>Up</b> from HBOLabs (the online arm of HBO), a scripted 10-episode web-based series. <b>Hooking</b> <b>Up</b> {{is set at}} {{a fictional}} {{university}} where the students {{spend most of their}} time emailing and twittering, but still manage to miscommunicate.

The entire cast of <b>Hooking</b> <b>Up</b> is composed of YouTube video bloggers in the hope of attracting a young, internet knowledgeable audience. By the show's second day on YouTube, it had received more than 450,000 views. According to NewTeeVee.com, an evolving consensus is that for an online video to be a hit, somewhere between 100,000 and one million views are needed, giving <b>Hooking</b> <b>Up</b> a strong start. Maria Russo of the Los Angeles Times felt that Wu was better looking than star DeFranco and wondered why Wu plays the [...] "tired role of the East Asian friend who helps the white guy get the chicks," [...] while Bobbie Johnson of The Guardian said that many web surfers had [...] "scoffed at what they see as a cynical attempt to cash in."

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] was mixed. Keri Mason from Billboard believed that tracks like [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] made the Teenage Dream album [...] "get heavier sonically and lyrically, with a boom-boom-pow electro punch".

500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast {{is trying to}} get back to the {{elevator}} after <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film.

[...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E
