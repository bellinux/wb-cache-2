If there are competing offers {{for the same}} guide in a particular region, the highest offer receives all of that region's diamonds in an all-pay auction. Competing agents can be bribed to reveal inside information regarding the competitor's decisions. Complicating matters further is the UN inspector, who moves at random between regions on each turn. The inspector blocks all diamond extraction from the region {{in which he is}} present, and can confiscate diamonds from agents within that region. Like other agents though, the inspector can be bribed and directed to regions of a player's choice.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of winning players {{is not to}} win every individual hand, but rather to make mathematically and psychologically better decisions regarding when and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> bet, raise, call—or fold. By making such decisions to place influential bets, one can non-verbally represent or suggest holding or not-holding a certain or possible hand by either betting or not-betting pre-flop, and by venturing smaller or larger bets or raises at possibly more advantageous times, throughout the stages of the hand being dealt. One's pattern of betting may encourage opponents to bet or to fold (in this complex process, called bluffing), without verbalizing a discouraging or dishonest word. The winning poker players know how to enhance their opponents' betting and maximize their own expected gain on each round of betting, to thereby increase their long-term winnings.|$|E

Some clubs require paid or valet parking to be used if keeping cars on the premises, to generate revenue and help regulate patron behavior. Bathroom attendants monitor the restrooms on behalf of management; primarily watching for policy violations and potential liability concerns. In strip clubs, policy enforcement can range from watching for drug use, sex, fighting, and other activities the club would prefer to see done off the premises. The attendant will also attempt to keep the restroom area clean, assist with the washing of hands, and if available, provide by request an assortment of cologne, mints, and other disposable items.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{as part of}} a European Union (EU) member state, Scottish farmers {{received}} £583 {{million in}} subsidy payments from the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Annual CAP payments are made to the UK, which then determines <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> allocate to each of the devolved administrations, including Scotland. In the last CAP agreement, farmers in the UK qualified for additional convergence payments because Scottish farmers receive a lower average single farm payment per hectare, mainly due to the mountainous terrain in Scotland. Supporters of independence therefore believed that an independent Scotland would receive greater agricultural subsidies than when part of the UK. Opponents of independence believed that Scottish farmers benefited because the UK was one of the larger EU member states and therefore had a greater say in CAP negotiations. They also questioned whether an independent Scotland would immediately receive full subsidy payments from the EU, as recent new member states had their subsidies phased in.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to know how much water is currently in the soil before deciding if and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes in {{the natural}} history of a species, large body size confers {{reproductive}} advantage. This raises the question in Hemipepsis ustulata: why do smaller wasps persist? Generation after generation, there is a wide size variation among these tarantula hawks. Wasps do not grow after metamorphosis, so smaller animals are at a permanent disadvantage competing against their larger fellows. John Alcock’s studies emphasize the importance of size variation in claiming desirable territories among male Hemipepsis ustulata wasps. It is hypothesized that female provisioning behavior {{may play a role in}} the maintenance of size variation in this species. In tarantula hawks, the size of the offspring is determined by the mother’s decision on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> invest in each offspring. The size of the tarantula captured by the mother wasp is a function of how big the larva will become when fully grown. The subduing of a larger tarantula requires a greater energy investment and poses a greater risk to the mother wasp. If the offspring is a large male, it would have to be twice as fit as a smaller male offspring in order to repay the investment of the mother wasp. Thus, in some cases, it may be advantageous for the mother wasp to produce many small male offspring. This would enable them to enjoy the same level of fitness as a female, but with fewer, larger progeny.|$|E

500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} received further attention during World War II, {{when the}} bombings of Britain caused blast injuries and associated respiratory problems in both soldiers and civilians. Also during this time, studies with animals placed at varying distances from a blast showed that protective gear could prevent lung injuries. These findings suggested that an impact {{to the outside}} of the chest wall was responsible for the internal lesions. In 1945, studies identified a phenomenon termed [...] "wet lung", in which the lungs accumulated fluid and were simultaneously less able to remove it. They attributed the respiratory failure often seen in blunt chest trauma in part to excessive fluid resuscitation, and the question of whether and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> administer fluids has remained controversial ever since.|$|E
