5|$|Marla F. Prather {{observed}} that Whaam!s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its {{position as a}} historic work of pop art. With As <b>I</b> <b>Opened</b> Fire, Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, Whaam! {{is regarded as the}} culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman. It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work, or, along with Drowning Girl, as one of his two most famous works. Andrew Edgar and Peter Sedgwick describe it, along with Warhol's Marilyn Monroe prints, {{as one of the most}} famous works of pop art. Gianni Versace once linked the two iconic pop art images via his gown designs. According to Douglas Coupland, the World Book Encyclopedia used pictures of Warhol's Monroes and Whaam! to illustrate its Pop art entry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
30|$|In {{this study}} we outline a {{consistent}} management protocol for type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> pediatric forearm fractures that has not previously been documented in the literature. Our results corroborate the those {{reported in the literature}} that pediatric type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures may be managed safely in a non-operative manner. There were no infections in our prospective series of 45 consecutive type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> pediatric forearm fractures using our protocol. Using a protocol of only four doses of intravenous antibiotics (one in the emergency department and three additional doses during a 24 -h hospital admission) is a safe and efficient method for managing routine pediatric type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures non-operatively.|$|R
30|$|Type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> {{fractures}} in pediatric patients {{have been treated}} nonoperatively {{for a number of}} years at our institution. Our purpose was to evaluate the rate of infection in pediatric patients with type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures treated nonoperatively at our institution without admission from the ED.|$|R
30|$|Based on our {{preliminary}} results, {{it appears}} that a protocol using four doses of intravenous antibiotics (one in the emergency department and three additional doses during a 24 -h period of hospital admission) is a safe and efficient method for managing routine pediatric type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> forearm fractures non-operatively. However, the use of antibiotics is not advocated {{as a substitute for}} proper clinical judgment, and the decision to treat pediatric type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures non-operatively should continue to be made on a case by case basis. Pediatric type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures of the lower extremity may react differently and need further study before any recommendations can be made regarding treatment. For now, based on our experience with this protocol, we limit our recommendations for non-operative management only to pediatric type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> forearm fractures.|$|R

25|$|In the mid-1950s, MacDonald toured {{in summer}} stock {{productions}} of Bitter Sweet and The King and I. She opened in Bitter Sweet at the Iroquois Amphitheater, Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1954. Her production of The King and <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> August 20, 1956, at the Starlight Theatre. While performing there, she collapsed. Officially, {{it was announced}} as heat prostration, {{but in fact it}} was a heart seizure. She began limiting her appearances and a reprisal of Bitter Sweet in 1959 was her last professional appearance.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{release of}} Atlas Shrugged: Part <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> on 300 screens on April 15, 2011, and made US$1,676,917 in its opening weekend, {{finishing}} in 14th place overall.

Ticket sales dropped off significantly in its second week of release, despite the addition of 165 screens; after six weeks, the film was showing on only 32 screens and total ticket sales had not crossed the $5 million mark, recouping {{less than a quarter of}} the production budget.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} our current study corroborate those {{previously}} reported in literature that pediatric type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures may be managed safely in a non-operative manner. There were no infections in our series of 45 consecutive type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> pediatric forearm fractures using our current protocol. There was also no significant delay in the healing of the fractures, with an average healing time of 7  weeks for the 45 forearm fractures. Combining {{the results of this}} series with the other three published studies on this subject reveals an infection rate of 1  % (2 / 200) for type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures managed non-operatively [5, 6, 7]. This compares favorably with the infection rate reported in the literature (1.9  %) for type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures managed operatively [6, 12].|$|R

500|$|Lichtenstein {{studied as}} an artist before and after serving in the United States Army during World War II. He practiced {{anti-aircraft}} drills during basic training, and he was sent for pilot training but the program was canceled before it started. Among the topics he tackled after the war were romance and war. [...] He depicted aerial combat in several works. Whaam! {{is part of a}} series on war that he worked on between 1962 and 1964, and along with As <b>I</b> <b>Opened</b> Fire (1964) is one of his two large war-themed paintings.|$|E

500|$|The King and <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> on Broadway on March 29, 1951, {{with a wide}} {{expectation}} of a hit by the press and public. [...] Both Hammerstein and Rodgers professed to be worried. [...] The composer complained that most people were not concerned about whether the show was good, but whether {{it was better than}} South Pacific. [...] Even the weather cooperated: heavy rain in New York stopped in time to allow the mostly wealthy or connected opening night audience to arrive dry at the St. James Theatre. [...] Margaret Landon, author of the book on which the musical was based, was not invited to opening night.|$|E
500|$|Henry IV, Part <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> on 28 February at Her Majesty's Theatre, and Robey {{proved himself}} to be a capable Shakespearean actor, though his Shakespearean debut was marred {{initially}} by an inability to remember his lines. A journalist from The Daily Express thought that Robey seemed uncomfortable, displayed a halting delivery and was [...] "far from word perfect". Writing in The Observer, the critic Ivor Brown said of Robey's portrayal: [...] "In no performance within my memory has the actor been more obviously the afflicted servant of his lines and more obviously the omnipotent master of the situation". Another journalist, writing in the Daily Mirror, thought that Robey [...] "gave 25 percent of Shakespeare and 75 percent of himself".|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success.

500|$|Whaam! {{is one of}} Lichtenstein's {{series of}} war images, {{typically}} combining vibrant colors with an expressive narrative. Whaam! is very large, measuring 1.7 m × 4.0 m (5ft 7 in × 13ft 4 in). It is less abstract than As <b>I</b> <b>Opened</b> Fire, another of his war scenes. Lichtenstein employs his usual comic-book style: stereotyped imagery in bright primary colors with black outlines, coupled with imitations of mechanical printer's Ben-Day dots. The use of these dots, which were invented by Benjamin Day to simulate color variations and shading, are considered Lichtenstein's [...] "signature method". Whaam! departs from Lichtenstein's earlier diptychs such as Step-on-Can with Leg and Like New, in that the panels are not two variations of the same image.|$|E

30|$|More recently, {{several authors}} have {{questioned}} the need for surgical debridement of Gustilo and Anderson type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures in pediatric patients. The risk of infection is correlated {{with the type of}} soft tissue wound associated with the open fracture, and the rationale for surgical debridement of an open fracture is to protect against infection by meticulously debriding all devitalized tissue and copiously irrigating the wound to decrease the bacterial load. While there is no debate over the need for surgical debridement of Gustilo and Anderson type II and III open fractures, the controversy over type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures remains. Yang and Eisler [15], in a retrospective study of both adults and children with isolated type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures, reported a 0  % infection rate. Several other case series report infection rates of 2.5 – 4.0  % with nonsurgical treatment of pediatric open fractures, and consider this to be safe compared to the infection rate of pediatric type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> fractures treated with surgical debridement [16, 17].|$|R
500|$|The next morning, at dawn on March 9, 1862, Virginia {{left her}} {{anchorage}} at Sewell's Point {{and moved to}} attack Minnesota, still aground. She {{was followed by the}} three ships of the James River Squadron. They found their course blocked, however, by the newly arrived Monitor. At first, Jones believed the strange craft—which one Confederate sailor mocked as [...] "a cheese on a raft"—to be a boiler being towed from the Minnesota, not realizing the nature of his opponent. Soon, however, it was apparent that {{he had no choice but}} to fight her. The first shot of the engagement was fired at Monitor by Virginia. The shot flew past Monitor and struck Minnesota, which answered with a broadside; this began what would be a lengthy engagement. [...] "Again, all hands were called to quarters, and when she approached within a mile of us <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> upon her with my stern guns and made a signal to the Monitor to attack the enemy," [...] Van Brunt added.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Bannon's {{books were}} {{featured}} in the documentary Before Stonewall about how {{gay men and lesbians}} lived prior to the 1969 Stonewall riots, wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: [...] "I picked up this paperback and <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> it up... and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body that I had never felt before." [...] She was {{featured in the}} Canadian documentary [...] in 1992, which recounted women's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s. The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969 in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by Cleis Press again between 2001 and 2003—excluding The Marriage—with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.|$|E
500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year.
