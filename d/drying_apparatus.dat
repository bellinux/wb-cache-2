The reduction of moisture content is mandatory to increase overall {{energy efficiency and}} reduce emission in systems operating with biomass, especially during combustion or gasification. One of the established methods of drying biomass is through fluidized bed drying. As such, the current work addresses {{the development of a}} biomass <b>drying</b> <b>apparatus,</b> designated as the swirling fluidized bed dryer (SFBD). The SFBD features an annular bed with inclined injection of gas through an array of blades which acts as the hot air distributor, which then imparts the swirling motion to the bed.

The performance of SFBD was studied in terms of its hydrodynamic characteristic using PVC beads before tested with actual biomass from palm frond. The results show that SFBD exhibits excellent hydrodynamic characteristic with distributor to bed pressure drop ratio less then 10 %. It is also found that bed pressure drop is proportional with superficial velocity of hot air, but still reasonably low for bed weight up to 2 kg.

The instruments {{have been used to}} investigate the effect of process conditions on the structure development and final coating properties. A magnetic microrheometer for in situ measurement of local viscosity of coatings was designed since conventional bulk rheometry cannot be used to follow the temporal and spatial gradients of viscosity in drying or curing coatings. Micron-sized magnetic probe particles under a magnetic field gradient act as probes for local rheological responses in coatings.

Conventional fissure {{detection}} instruments {{cannot be used}} to observe fissures in rough rice kernels, the form in which rice in normally dried and stored. X-rays can penetrate hulls allowing visualization of the internal structure of a rough rice kernel. This study evaluated the capability of X-ray imaging to adequately detect fissures in rough rice and established a correlation between HRY and the fissured kernel percentage (FKP) in a rough rice sample. Fifteen long-grain rice cultivars, harvested in Arkansas in 2015 and 2016 were dried using heated air at 60 ºC, 10 % relative humidity (RH) for various combinations of drying durations and post-drying treatments that resulted in varying degrees of fissuring and HRYs. Fissure detection was conducted using an X-ray system with rough rice and {{compared to that of}} a grainscope, a conventional fissure detection instrument, with brown rice. A strong correlation (R^ 2 = 0. 95) was shown to exist between sample HRY and the FKP of the rough rice sample after drying, resulting in a regression equation {{that could be used to}} estimate HRY. Having confirmed the impact of fissured kernels on HRY, the X-ray system, with an augmented <b>drying</b> <b>apparatus,</b> was used to evaluate the impact of kernel thickness and moisture content (MC) on rice fissuring.

The fissuring susceptibility of kernels from each sub-lot was evaluated during drying. Generally, with increase in kernel thickness, the FKP increased for high-MC lots. In regards to MC, high-MC had greater FKPs than the low-MC lots. Overall, these findings show the importance of kernel fissuring to the rice industry, and highlights the role of kernel properties on fissuring during drying...|$|E

One of the ways to improve the process is complex and i ts local automation. This paper deals with the problems of development and creation of a new control algorithm drying process of the particulate material. Identified a number of shortcomings of the existing methods of automatic control of the process. As a result, the authors proposed a method for drying particulate materials in the device with swirling flow and the microwave energy supply and its automatic control algorithm. The description of the operating principle of the <b>drying</b> <b>apparatus</b> consists in that the particulate material is wet by using a tangential flow of coolant supplied to the cylinder-drying apparatus which also serves the axial coolant flow, whereby the heat transfer fluid with the particulate material begins to undergo a complex circular movement along the circumference apparatus, thereby increasing its speed and its operation control algorithm. The work of this scheme is carried out at three levels of regulation on the basis of determining the coefficient of efficiency of the dryer, which makes it possible to determine the optimal value of the power equipment and to forecast the cost of electricity. All of the above allows you to get ready for a high quality product while minimizing thermal energy and material costs by optimizing the operating parameters of the drying of the particulate material in the dryer with a combined microwave energy supply and ensure the rational use of heat energy by varying their quantity depending on the characteristics to be dried particulate material and the course of the process...|$|E

Pull-out test was carried out to evaluate the interfacial adhesion characteristics of treated and untreated fibres. The results revealed that composites based on treated oil palm fibres exhibited better wear performance compared with untreated ones, i. e. the interfacial adhesion of treated fibres to the polyester was better than untreated fibres. Moreover, treated oil palm fibres were found to reduce the porosity of the composite, which in turn stabilized the surface tribo-characteristics. Based on the SEM analysis, the wear mechanisms were predominated by pitting, grooving, microcracking, microcutting, and fracture in the polyester region...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{evaluate}} the influence of welding conditions on abrasive wear resistance in coating of Fe-Cr-C. The metal base used in this investigation was the steel SAE 1020 and as welded metal the selfshilded tubular wires of Fe-Cr-C with 1. 6 mm of diameter. The welding parameter such as amperage, voltage, welding speed, wire feed speed and {{the distance between the}} point and samples were kept constant by varying the electrode inclination and the number of layers deposited. These resulted in four different weld conditions: pulling and pushing the weld pool and hardfacing formed with 1 end 2 layers. Their influences on dilution, microhardness and microstructure were evaluated and correlated with the abrasive wear according to the standard tests methods for abrasion measurements through the usage of <b>dry</b> sand/rubber wheel <b>apparatus,</b> ASTM G- 65 - 04. The results showed that the wear resistance of the four different conditions was affected by dilution, microstructure morphology and carbide volume fraction. The best conditions for hardfacing deposition were for pushing the torch and two layers added...|$|R
