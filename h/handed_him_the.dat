His debut for Hull was as a late substitute in a 2–0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion on 20 August 2005. Though he lacked fitness {{at the start of the}} season, injuries to Keith Andrews and Ian Ashbee gave him the chance of a regular starting place, and manager Taylor also <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> team captaincy.|$|E
5|$|Pickett was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 8th Infantry Regiment. He soon gained national recognition in the Mexican–American War when he carried the American colors over the parapet during the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847.

5|$|Around 12:00, the Italians {{went over}} to the offensive, with the 3rd Alpine Group tasked to advance to the line Selca–Radovljica, XI Corps to push via Logatec to Ljubljana, VI Corps to drive on Prezid, and V Corps to advance from Fiume towards Kraljevica then Lokve. While one Italian attack south of the Snežnik plateau was stopped by {{elements}} of the Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski and the Italian advance was held up by border troops in some areas, there was little significant resistance, {{and by the end of}} the day they had captured Sušak, Bakar, Delnice, Jesenice, Vrhnika, Logatec and Ljubljana. To assist the Italian advance, the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the Ljubljana region, and the 14th Panzer Division, which had captured Zagreb on 10 April, drove west to encircle the withdrawing 7th Army. The Italians faced little resistance, and captured about 30,000 troops of the 7th Army waiting to surrender near Delnice. When the Italian 14th Infantry Division Isonzo entered Ljubljana, a delegate of the NszS greeted its commander, Generale di Divisione Federico Romero, and symbolically <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> keys to the city. An official reception was held for Romero that evening, attended by Natlačen and most of the members of the NszS, but because Natlačen and the council preferred that the Germans occupy Ljubljana, he asked Romero for permission to travel to Celje the following day to meet with Lanz.|$|E

He had, while editing Anglo-Tamil newspaper and journals in India, been in touch with Indians living in France and in Paris. In Paris, he established contact with Professor Moniers Vinson and a few Indian expatriates. He was able to support himself with help from this circle for some time.

Foster tells Ryu about a more-than-2000-year-old temple Walter discovered in some ruins in the Amazon. He continues by saying that Walter, one day, mysteriously sealed the ruins, in which nobody has since ventured near. Foster explains to Ryu {{that they have been}} monitoring the activity of someone named Guardia de Mieux, also known as [...] "the Jaquio", who recently moved into the temple. Using the statues, the Jaquio plans to awaken Jashin and use it to destroy the world. Foster asks Ryu to go to the temple and eliminate him. After making it into the temple, Ryu discovers that the Jaquio is holding captive the girl who <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Shadow" [...] statue earlier. He orders Ryu to give up the demon statue after threatening the girl's life. Ryu is then dropped from sight through a trapdoor and into a catacomb.|$|E
500|$|One evening, Starr took Carey to {{a record}} {{industry}} gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L.

Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and invited her to go to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, [...] "When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom." [...] After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of [...] "Pee-wee Herman" [...] originated during a 1978 improvisation exercise with The Groundlings, where Reubens {{came up with}} the idea of a man who wanted to be a comic but was so inept at telling jokes that it was obvious to the audience that he would never make it. Fellow Groundling Phil Hartman would afterwards help Reubens develop the character while another Groundling, John Paragon, would help write the show. Despite having been compared to other famous characters, such as Hergé's Tintin and Collodi's Pinocchio, Reubens says that there is no specific source for [...] "Pee-wee" [...] but rather a collection of ideas. Pee-wee's voice originated in 1970 when Reubens appeared in a production of Life with Father, where he was cast as one of the most obnoxious characters in the play, for which Reubens adopted a cartoon-like way of speaking that would become Pee-wee's. Pee-wee's name resulted from a one-inch Pee Wee brand harmonica Reubens had as a child, and Herman was the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. The first small gray suit Pee-wee ever wore had been handmade for director and founder of the Groundlings Gary Austin, who passed it on to Reubens, while [...] "someone" [...] <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> [...] "little kid bow tie" [...] before a show.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the manager}} had been secured, Ned Kelly took Living {{back to the}} bank and asked him how much money they had. Living {{admitted}} to between £600 and £700.
