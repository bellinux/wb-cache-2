500|$|Batavier V resumed Rotterdam–London {{passenger}} service {{after her}} release from German control at Zeebrugge. On 16 May 1916, while outbound from London for Rotterdam, Batavier V struck a mine near the north buoy at Inner Gabbard. The mine had been recently planted by the German coastal minelaying submarine [...] According to one witness, the ship's decks were awash within three {{minutes of the}} explosion, which blew the rear cargo <b>hold</b> <b>hatch</b> and sent {{a great deal of}} cargo flying through the air. Batavier V sank within twenty minutes, taking with her three members of the crew and one American passenger.|$|E
50|$|The ship’s wheel, {{steering}} gear and rudder are intact, as are two bilge pumps {{and the main}} winch and capstan. The interior cabin structure is relatively intact, but the woodwork has collapsed, making small items difficult to discern. The cargo <b>hold</b> <b>hatch</b> covers are displaced, giving {{easy access to the}} hold.|$|E

The cargo <b>hold</b> <b>hatches</b> are designed for lighters with a total weight of 450 tons. The lighters are loaded and unloaded with a large gantry crane, manufactured by KONE, with a span of [...] and lifting capacity of 500 tons. The gantry crane has two three-ton auxiliary cranes.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day the weather worsened {{and the ship}} was soon caught in a force 10 storm 240 nmi km south west of Ireland with 35 feet (10 meter) waves ramming her deck. The ship quickly took on water as the <b>hold</b> <b>hatch</b> covers failed. The crew knowing that the ship was taken in water and was in mortal danger quickly radioed a distress signal at 4 PM. The last radio contact was made at 4:30 PM, at this time the ships {{is believed to have}} sunk. Rescuers searched the {{following day}} for any survivors near the last known location of the ship but it was soon clear that the 27 Greek and Filipino crew members had perished.|$|E
50|$|In 1950 {{the ship}} was bought by the former Russian emigre shipowner, Alexander Vlasov. Laid up for another two years, in 1952 she was renamed Castel Forte {{and sent to the}} Newport News {{shipyard}} in the United States, intended for conversion to a refrigerated cargo ship for Vlasovs Italian-managed Sitmar Line. However, this conversion was soon abandoned and the vessel returned to lay-up. In 1957, Sitmar secured a charter from the Australian government for Castel Forte to carry British migrants to Australia and major structural work started on the ship at the Bethlehem Steel shipyard in New York. The vessel was moved to Genoa in December 1957, where the interior refitting was completed in May 1958. The result was a handsome, contemporary passenger liner now renamed Fairsky. Tourist one class accommodation for a maximum of 1,461 was provided in 461 cabins over five decks. Reflecting similar arrangements in earlier company ships Fairsea and Castel Felice, Fairsky featured just seven cabins with private facilities, located forward on the Sun Deck, beneath the Bridge Deck. Air-conditioning was installed throughout the ship and a good range of comfortable public rooms was provided, mostly on the Boat Deck. Aft on this deck, an attractive lido area including swimming pool (built over the top of a deep <b>hold</b> <b>hatch)</b> was also situated. Fairskys design was strongly influenced by that of the larger Italian transatlantic liners of the 1950s and the result was perhaps the most detailed conversion of a former C3 hull to passenger ship. On 26 June 1958 the vessel commenced service from Southampton under the command of Sitmars senior Master, Captain Jorge Petrescu. Fairsky was registered in Panama under the nominal ownership of the Fairline Shipping Corporation, though remained operated by Sitmar while in Vlasov ownership. The port of registry was later changed to that of Monrovia, Liberia.|$|E

50|$|Sophie Theresia {{was built}} in 1911 by Van der Vuijk shipyard, Capelle aan de IJssel, Netherlands. She is 37 m in length overall, with a beam of 6.6 m, and a draught of 2.9 m. The hull was {{constructed}} from riveted steel plates, with wooden decking and ketch rigging. The vessel originally operated out of Katwijk, fishing the North Sea. An engine was fitted in the 1930s. The vessel was refitted for cargo carrying in 1957, with <b>hold</b> <b>hatches</b> widened and a new engine fitted. She was renamed Aaltje en Willem, and carried cargo between the Netherlands and several small North Sea ports.|$|R
60|$|Slowly the {{hatchway}} yielded, {{and with}} a great effort it was pushed up far enough {{for a man to}} crawl out. Pieces of wood were shoved in at each corner so as to <b>hold</b> the <b>hatch</b> open, and the men who had lifted it stood clear.|$|R
50|$|The open hatch bulk carrier, often {{referred}} to as OHBC or conbulker, is designed to offer direct access to the <b>hold</b> through <b>hatches</b> which extend the full width of the vessel. As a result, large cargo units can be lowered into place. If it is possible, the <b>holds</b> or <b>hatches</b> are designed around standard cargo unit sizes. Sometimes a gantry crane is fitted. There is special attention for cargo-handling shipping gear. These conbulkers are expensive because there is extra steel necessary to widen the hatches. This is crucial to provide strength. The open hatches are useful for forest products, such as pre-slung timber and logs. The heavy units are more easy to handle than in a conventional bulk carrier. The open hatch bulk carriers {{can also be used to}} carry containers on the outward leg, and dry bulk on the return leg. The first open hatch bulk carrier was built in 1962, for the use of paper trade.|$|R

50|$|In Darwin's Frog (Rhinoderma darwinii), {{the female}} lays about 30 eggs {{and then the}} male guards them for about two weeks, until they hatch. The male then takes all the {{survivors}} and carries around the developing young in his vocal pouch. When the tiny tadpoles have developed they hop out and swim away. In this animal, the parents <b>hold</b> the <b>hatched</b> young rather than eggs in their mouths, so is arguably not showing 'broodiness'.|$|R
60|$|Taken by surprise, and unarmed, the Genoese who {{had gained}} the deck sullenly replied that they surrendered. They were bound and led away, {{and the others}} ordered to come up on deck. There {{were found to be}} four-and-twenty in all, and these were soon laid {{side by side on the}} grain in the <b>hold,</b> the <b>hatch</b> being left off to give them air. The masts were then cut through, and were with some trouble lowered to the deck.|$|R
60|$|Day broke, just as {{the last}} batch of men were brought on board. As soon as these had gone below the whistle was sounded, the old crew came up on deck, and the {{preparations}} for making sail commenced. The anchor was hove short, the lashings of the sails were loosened, the flags run up to the mast heads, the last casks and bales lowered into the <b>hold,</b> the <b>hatches</b> put on, and the decks washed down.|$|R
50|$|Stothert and Pitt {{supplied}} their earliest electric {{powered crane}} to Southampton Dock Authority in 1892. Electric power provided several advantages: powerful motors {{could be placed}} in each crane and powered centrally, without requiring a separate prime mover (i.e. steam engine and boiler) in each crane. The crane mechanisms were also lighter, allowing them {{to be placed on}} raised carriages that could then straddle a railway freight line- the portal crane. Rather than requiring a bare strip of unused quayside between the railway line and the harbour wall to leave space for cranes, the railway could now be brought right to the dock edge. Cranes were also available immediately, without waiting for boilers to raise steam. Most importantly though (and an advantage over centrally powered hydraulic cranes), electric cranes were now mobile along the dock edge on their own rail lines. Rather than ships queueing for a single berth space alongside a fixed crane, cranes could be brought to each ship's <b>hold</b> <b>hatches</b> as needed. This made a single crane far more efficient, in terms of cargo handled per day. Soon such mobile electric cranes were near universal.|$|R
60|$|Not a leaf stirred. The sheep were patiently browsing; {{the birds}} had settled. But there lay the old man, with a cloth-yard arrow {{standing}} in his back; and there were <b>Hatch</b> <b>holding</b> to the gable, and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush.|$|R
60|$|At last, with {{infinite}} trouble {{the whole}} body of the enemy were routed from the <b>hold,</b> and the <b>hatches</b> fastened down to prevent a return. But the end was not yet gained, for the creatures had found various refuges on deck, and some had taken to the rigging.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of July 21, 1961, Gus Grissom entered the Liberty Bell 7 at 8:58 UTC and the 70 hatch bolts were put in place. At 45 minutes prior to the {{scheduled}} launch, a pad technician discovered {{that one of the}} hatch bolts was misaligned. During a 30-minute hold that was called, McDonnell and NASA Space Task Group engineers decided that the 69 remaining bolts should be sufficient to <b>hold</b> the <b>hatch</b> in place and blow it at the appropriate time. The misaligned bolt was not replaced.|$|R
60|$|Striking a match, he {{explored}} his surroundings, finding {{that a little}} compartment had been partitioned off from the main <b>hold,</b> with the <b>hatch</b> above his head {{the only means of}} ingress or egress. It was evident that the room had been prepared for the very purpose of serving as a cell for himself.|$|R
60|$|During {{this time}} the party led by Captain Ponsberry had {{attacked}} {{the balance of the}} mutineers. There was a brief fight and Shamhaven got a cutlass cut on the knee. But then the men surrendered, and one after another was made to drop down into the <b>hold,</b> and the <b>hatch</b> was shut and battened down.|$|R
25|$|The circuit {{currently}} has a curfew of 18:30 {{due to a}} housing estate built near to Clearways bend. Race engines cannot be started until after 08:30 and must be turned off by 18:30.

50|$|The {{single deck}} ship {{was built in}} August 2008, and {{measures}} 108 m by 18 m with a gross tonnage of 5598 tonnes. The cargo ship has 3 <b>holds,</b> with a <b>hatch</b> strength of 2.2 t/m² and tanktop strength of 15 t/m². Hold 1 measures 15.2 x 18.9 x 11.2 m, hold 2 measures 15.2 x 29.4 x 9.1 m, and hold 3 measures 15.2 x 27.3 x 9.1 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{whaleback}} {{was designed}} by Captain Alexander McDougall to carry cargoes of iron ore or grain economically around the Great Lakes. A pair of coal-fired Scotch boiler engines provided steam for the three-cylinder, triple expansion steam engine which drove a single screw propeller. The hull was built of heavy steel plates double-riveted to steel angle frames. The bow and stern were of a conoidal shape, with the center part of the hull being roughly cigar-shaped. The ship was 308 feet (94 m) long, with a 38 ft beam and a 24 ft deep <b>hold.</b> The <b>hatches</b> on the deck had no coamings, vertical sections that would have prevented water from coming into the hatches. Instead, the hatches were designed to be {{flush with the surface}} of the deck, and were simply bolted to the deck.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{in upper}} stowage spaces can be embarked/debarked through the hatches with cargo booms, while pallets are embarked/debarked in lower stowage spaces by elevators. The main deck <b>hatch</b> of <b>hold</b> 2 is {{unobstructed}} {{and can be}} opened for embarking/debarking of vehicles without the delay of unloading landing craft stowed on the <b>hatch.</b> <b>Hold</b> 4 is well suited for high priority cargo because of its {{direct access to the}} flight deck or main deck via elevator number 5.|$|R

60|$|At {{another time}} he invented a game; he {{gathered}} his {{officers and crew}} together {{and told them that}} they were going to play that they were living in the lower regions. Thereupon the whole party followed him down into the <b>hold.</b> The <b>hatches</b> and all the other openings were closed, and then Blackbeard began to illuminate the scene with fire and brimstone. The sulphur burned, the fumes rose, a ghastly light spread over the countenances of the desperadoes, and very soon some of them began to gasp and cough and implore the captain to let in some fresh air, but Blackbeard was bound to have a good game, and he proceeded to burn more brimstone. He laughed at the gasping fellows about him and declared that he would be just as willing to breathe the fumes of sulphur as common air. When at last he threw open the hatches, some of the men were almost dead, but their stalwart captain had not even sneezed.|$|R
