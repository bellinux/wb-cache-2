Subsequent research has identified functions for semaphorin signaling in many organs and tissues {{outside of the}} nervous system. Vital roles for semaphorin signaling in vascular patterning and cardiac morphogenesis have been demonstrated, and impaired semaphorin signaling {{has been associated with}} various <b>human</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders,</b> including persistent truncus arteriosus, sinus bradycardia and anomalous pulmonary venous connections.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} profiling by microarray technologies {{has been}} successfully applied to study the transcriptional changes that occur in tissues such as heart, vessels and blood cells in different <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders.</b> Such studies have been performed in <b>human</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> syndromes and in animal models {{with the aim of}} unraveling the complex molecular pictures underlying human pathophysiology. As already observed in cancer research, gene expression studies in humans may provide a finer molecular classification of patients with cardiovascular diseases and indicate new markers useful for prognostic and therapeutic strategies. In this paper, we present the findings obtained with microarray platforms to explore transcriptome alterations in cardiovascular diseases. To describe the potential of global expression profiling approach in this field, we have chosen to review the genomic findings obtained in some classic heart diseases with genetic transmission such as hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy and Fabry disease, together with findings obtained in common multifactorial <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders</b> such as heart failure, atherosclerosis and infarction. Wherever feasible, we present the results obtained in patients together with those obtained in the corresponding animal and cellular models...|$|R

Experience assessing fitness to drive among drivers with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders,</b> and the relevance of other associated medical conditions among drivers assessed as unfit, are reported here. Methods and Results The study included 5, 234 drivers attending 2 Spanish Medical Driver Test Centres to assess their fitness to drive. Information regarding sociodemographic aspects, driving patterns, medical conditions, medication use and alcohol consumption patterns was recorded: 11. 6 % of the drivers had a <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorder</b> that potentially impaired fitness to drive, 82. 5 % were found fit to drive, 15. 9 % were fit to drive with restrictions and 1. 6 % were unfit. The 10 unfit patients with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders</b> were primarily considered unfit because of their associated ophthalmologic and medical comorbidities, but the <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders</b> were a contributing factor. Conclusion Most (98. 4 %) drivers with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders</b> will be completely fit to drive or fit to drive with restrictions. There is a need for a personalized evaluation of fitness to drive for each driver/patient, taking into account such aspects as the associated pathology, the taking of medicinal drugs and alcohol consumption...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study whether {{prospective}} {{measurements of}} circulating concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) could predict mortality {{in the general}} elderly population. DESIGN AND SETTING: Circulating BNP was measured in a cohort of 85 year olds {{from the general population}} who were followed up prospectively for five years as part of a longitudinal population study, " 70 year old people in Gothenburg, Sweden". PATIENTS: 541 subjects from the 85 year old population in Gothenburg. All subjects were investigated for {{the presence or absence of}} <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorder</b> such as congestive heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Venous plasma samples were obtained for BNP analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Overall mortality during the prospective follow up period. RESULTS: Circulating concentrations of BNP predicted five-year mortality in the total population (P < 0. 001). In subjects with a known <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorder,</b> five-year mortality was correlated with increased BNP concentrations (P < 0. 01). Increased BNP concentrations predicted five-year mortality in subjects without a defined <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorder</b> (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In an elderly population, measurements of BNP may add valuable prognostic information and may be used to predict mortality in the total population as well as in patients with known <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders.</b> In subjects without any known <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorder,</b> BNP was a strong and independent predictor of total mortality...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Disorders</b> of <b>cardiovascular</b> {{system can}} cause {{disability}} or death, screening is necessary specially in workers who maybe had risk factors. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, genetic, exposure to chemicals, fumes, solvents, coldness are non occupational and occupational risk factors. Objective was comparison of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders</b> risk factors between workers in different industries of Iran. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, workers of automobile, food industries and light works {{had been selected}} and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders</b> risk factors had been gathered then data analyzed in SPSS with one-way ANOVA, Chi- 2 and multi nominal logistic regression with P < 0. 05. Results: 875 workers had been participated in the study, all of the <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders</b> risk factors were in the normal range. Mean of high density lipoprotein (HDL) in food industry workers was 63. 83 ± 17. 42 mg/dl and it was protective, but in workers who work in automobile industry was 38. 97 ± 11. 08 mg/dl and the lowest, Also hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia were more prominent in this industry and after regression with P < 0. 05, the differences were significant. Conclusions: Screening of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders</b> risk factors were important and helpful in industries specially automobile industry, that might be preventive method for these disorders in the future...|$|R

40|$|C-reactive protein (CRP) has {{received}} much attention as a cardiovascular risk factor {{and has been}} recommended {{to be used in}} screening to assist in predicting the occurrence of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disorders.</b> There are numerous association studies documenting changes in circulating CRP concentrations, there are, however, fewer studies providing evidence that CRP mediates the progression of cardiovascular pathologies.
