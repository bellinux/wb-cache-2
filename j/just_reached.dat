5|$|That evening, von Greim and Reitsch {{flew out}} from Berlin in an Arado Ar 96 trainer. Field Marshal von Greim {{was ordered to}} get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> Potsdamerplatz (only a city block from the Führerbunker). During the night of 28 April, General Wenck {{reported}} to Keitel that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front {{and it was no}} longer possible for his army to relieve Berlin. Keitel gave Wenck permission to break off the attempt.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot of the}} NES version {{follows the}} storyline of the {{original}} movie. At {{the onset of the}} game, Jones has <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> the Pankot Palace featured in the movie and is preparing to free the slave children, recover the missing Sankara Stones and defeat Mola Ram and his Thuggee entourage. The game differs from the original arcade version in many respects, including the layout {{and the manner in which}} one progresses through the game, but the plot remains unchanged in both versions.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the life span of right whales. One of the few {{well-documented}} cases is of a female North Atlantic right whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent callosity patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a new mother who had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years to more than 100 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related bowhead whale exceeding 210 years or more suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.|$|E

5|$|Shankly had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> his 26th {{birthday}} {{when the}} Second World War began {{and the war}} claimed the peak years of his playing career. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and managed to play in numerous wartime league, cup and exhibition matches for Norwich City, Arsenal, Luton Town and Partick Thistle, depending on where he was stationed. On 30 May 1942, he played a single game for Liverpool in a 4–1 win over Everton at Anfield. Shankly was keen on boxing and fought as a middleweight in the RAF, winning a trophy when he was stationed in Manchester. He confirmed in his autobiography that his weight as an RAF boxer was 159 pounds (72kg) and he was only six pounds (2.7kg) heavier than that in 1976. Shankly met his wife, Nessie, in the RAF (she was in the WAAF and stationed at the same camp) and they married in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin {{companies}} were {{running out of}} food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19 a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River approaching the Continental Divide. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them {{a small amount of}} flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20 Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near South Pass that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail—the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.|$|E

25|$|Three Army {{detachments}} with mobile {{units and}} the Marine detachment were ordered {{into the field}} on 3 December with instructions to be in operation by 10 December.

25|$|Despite {{a record}} benefit against the Australians {{and a few}} {{wonderful}} performances in 1961 (notably 8 for 47 against Hampshire), decline set in for the previously incomparable bowler. His haul of wickets fell from 97 at 10.91 to 78 at 17.93 and Lancashire became a weak county {{for the first time}} in Championship history. In 1962, though he was as good as ever in the Tests against Pakistan, with little support for him and Higgs, Statham fell further and only <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> 100 wickets, with Lancashire only just escaping finishing last.|$|E

25|$|During the evening, von Greim and Reitsch {{flew out}} from Berlin in an Arado Ar 96 trainer. Von Greim {{was ordered to}} get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> Potsdamerplatz {{and to make sure}} that Himmler was punished. Fearing that Hitler was {{escaping}} in the plane, troops of the Soviet 3rd Shock Army, which was fighting its way through the Tiergarten from the north, tried to shoot the Arado down. The Soviet troops failed in their efforts and the plane took off successfully.|$|E
25|$|The sanguinary {{events in}} Batumi halted the Russian-Turkish negotiations, {{and it was}} not until 26 September when the talks between Turkey and the Soviets, {{nominally}} including also the representatives of the Armenian, Azerbaijani and Georgian SSRs, finally reopened in Kars.

The UNTSO remains in operation to this day, although the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict has certainly not abated. Almost a year later, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was authorized to monitor relations between the two nations, which were split off from each other following the United Kingdom's decolonization of the Indian subcontinent.|$|E

25|$|Weather {{conditions}} were poor with heavily overcast skies and patchy showers. Andrew Flintoff won the toss and elected to bat. The {{start of the}} first session of play was delayed by 30minutes due to rain, commencing at 11:00 local time (00:00 UTC). The pitch was damp and unpredictable {{with a lot of}} seam movement. Although England managed to survive through to lunch at 1/36, Bell fell shortly after the luncheon interval to a Clark LBW. Collingwood and Strauss appeared to have embarked on a good partnership and brought the score to 2/101. Lee then removed Collingwood with a Ponting slips catch. Two balls later Warne took his 700th test wicket by clean bowling Strauss, who had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> 50.|$|E
25|$|Despite these problems, 76 men crawled {{through to}} freedom, until at 4:55a.m. on 25 March, the 77thman was spotted {{emerging}} {{by one of}} the guards. Those already in the trees began running, while a New Zealand Squadron Leader Leonard Henry Trent VC who had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> the tree line stood up and surrendered. The guards had no idea where the tunnel entrance was, so they began searching the huts, giving men time to burn their fake papers. Hut 104 {{was one of the last}} to be searched, and despite using dogs the guards were unable to find the entrance. Finally, German guard Charlie Pilz crawled back through the tunnel but found himself trapped at the camp end; he began calling for help and the prisoners opened the entrance to let him out, finally revealing its location.|$|E
25|$|When John Field died, he left seven children, of {{whom the}} eldest was only seventeen. He left all his {{property}} to his wife, Joan. The first child was a daughter, Dorcas, baptized on 7 May 1570. The first son was baptized on 4 January 1572 {{and was named}} after his father, John. Theophilus was baptized on 22 January 1574, Jonathan on 13 May 1577, Nathaniel on 13 June 1581, Elizabeth on 2 February 1583 and Nathan on 17 October 1587. Little is known of the two daughters: Dorcas was married to Edward Rice on 9 November 1590; Elizabeth was buried at St. Anne, Blackfriars, on 14 June 1603, when she had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> twenty, {{the age at which}} Dorcas married. We know nothing of the life of John Field, junior. Jonathan Field, who died in 1640. Theophilus followed his father's profession. He married and in his will left all his possessions to his wife, Alice. He died on 2 June 1636 and was buried in Hereford Cathedral.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the appalling}} summer of 1924 brought a setback with Staples {{averaging}} 23 runs a wicket on very favourable pitches. In 1925, though his average was {{much higher than}} the other Nottinghamshire bowlers (Richmond, Larwood and Barratt) his workload was a vital factor in the team's success, and this trend continued throughout 1926, when Staples took 113 wickets. 1927, with Nottinghamshire missing the Championship due to a remarkable loss in their last game to previously winless Glamorgan, saw Staples have his best season with 132 wickets including 9 for 141 against Kent in a game where Carr put Kent into bat but the pitch proved easy. Because the matting wickets were suited to a medium-paced, but flat trajectory, off-spinner like Staples, he was chosen to visit South Africa but did only moderately. However, in 1928 Staples bowled so well that his persistence and accuracy were seen as great assets on the cast-iron Australian pitches, but illness prevented him touring and restricted his cricket somewhat in 1929, when he only <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> 100 wickets.|$|E
25|$|Like so many Nottinghamshire-born men, Albert Hallam took to cricket at {{an early}} age. However, as he developed, he was not seen as good enough for a regular place in the Nottinghamshire eleven and, already {{residing}} in Leicestershire, played for them {{for a number of}} years in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Though these matches were not first-class, Hallam acquired a good enough reputation for Lancashire, desperate for support for the seemingly irrepressible Mold and Briggs, to encourage Hallam to qualify. He steadily improved, and by 1896 Hallam's slow bowling was already providing Lancashire with a third force in attack. He actually beat Briggs in the averages and was only a fraction behind Mold, though he did less than half as much bowling as the two established bowlers. The following year, these three bowlers, together with the newly imported Willis Cuttell, gave Lancashire a deadly attack on any helpful wicket and they won the County Championship. Hallam bowled consistently well and in all matches <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> 100 wickets. Nevertheless Wisden and many batsmen thought he was not nearly so good as the other three bowlers because he was too regular on dry pitches and helped batsmen to play themselves in.|$|E
25|$|Australia made steady {{progress}} on the opening day to reach 1/71, when Harbhajan dismissed Justin Langer. Mark Waugh, the new batsman, was dismissed for a golden duck after Ganguly took a one handed close range diving catch from the next delivery. Sanghvi dismissed Steve Waugh and Harbhajan removed Ricky Ponting for a duck in the following over, to reduce Australia to 5/99 after the first hours play with Harbhajan having taken a spell of 3/8. Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, joined opener Matthew Hayden at the crease, who had <b>just</b> <b>reached</b> 50. After the break, Gilchrist lead a counterattack, scoring 36 from 39 balls, and Australia reached lunch at 5/170, having scored 71 runs in the second hour. The pace of the batting increased after lunch, with Gilchrist moving from 50 to 100 in just 29 balls. 96 runs were added in the hour after lunch and when the 197-run partnership ended just 32 overs, Gilchrist and Hayden had scored 122 and 119 respectively. Australia reached 8/329 at tea, compiling 158 runs in the session. A run a ball cameo of 39 from Warne allowed Australia to reach 349, a lead of 173. Harbhajan ended with 4/121. India's top order fared better in the second innings, managing to compile 58 before both openers were lost. they suffered a last scare when wicket-keeper Nayan Mongia, sent in as a nightwatchman was forced to retire hurt after suffering a finger injury, forcing Tendulkar to face the final over of the second day.|$|E
