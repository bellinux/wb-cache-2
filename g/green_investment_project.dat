40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{arbitrage}} argument, positivists {{claim that the}} interest rate provides the right basis to fix the discount rate to evaluate <b>green</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects.</b> The real interest rate observed in the US {{during the twentieth century}} was around 1 percent. On the other band, ethicists estimate the discount rate using the marginal rate of substitution between current and future consumption. From classical estimations of intertemporal inequality aversion and prudence, assuming a 2 percent growth rate of consumption, they recommend a discount rate of around 3. 5 percent. Ethicists are therefore less prone to investing for the future than positivists. I provide two roads to reconcile the two approaches. First, I claim that the positivist approach is correct f <b>green</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> are financed by a reallocation of resources from productive capital in the economy, whereas ethicists are correct if the projects are financed by a reduction in current consumption. Second, I claim that ethicists should use a rate between 1 percent and 2 percent to discount sure benefits that occur in the distant future to take the uncertainty surrounding the future prosperity of the economy into account. Finally, a risk premium should be added to the discount rate that is proportional to the socioeconomic beta of the <b>investment</b> <b>project...</b>|$|R
40|$|How {{should one}} {{evaluate}} <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> whose CCAPM betas are uncertain? This question is particularly crucial for projects yielding long-lasting {{impacts on the}} economy, {{as is the case}} for example for many <b>green</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects.</b> We defined the notion of a certainty equivalent beta. We characterize it {{as a function of the}} characteristics of the uncertainties affecting the asset’s beta and the economy as a whole. We show that its term structure is not constant and that, for short maturities, it equals the expected beta. If the expected beta is larger than a threshold (which is negative and large in absolute value in all realistic calibrations), the term structure of the certainty equivalent beta is increasing and tends to its largest plausible value. In the benchmark case in which the asset’s beta is normally distributed, the certainty equivalent beta becomes infinite for finite maturities...|$|R
40|$|International {{environmental}} agreements require negotiation and cooperation among countries. This paper attempts {{to analyze the}} presence and nature of inter-country interactions {{in the process of}} ratifying such agreements. We develop a theoretical argument based on the notions of strategic substitutability and strategic complementarity and study the interactions among three different peer types: geographic neighbors, trading partners and <b>green</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> partners (in our case, clean development mechanism projects partners). We test for the presence of interactions by taking into account a temporal dimension, which constitutes a methodological contribution. To this end, we introduce spatially lagged endogenous variables into a parametric survival model and apply the proposed framework to the Kyoto Protocol ratification process. Our data sample covers 164 countries for the period 1998 to 2009. We find evidence that, while countries' ratification decisions are basically strategic substitutes, they become strategic complements once we focus on the ratification decisions of specific peers...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of economic, financial, social, technological, {{ecological}} – environmental and other indicators define {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>investment</b> <b>projects.</b> According to some of the indicators, the alternative <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> is suitable for putting it into practice, according to others, it is not. Therefore, while evaluating the <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> (e. g. the projects which are financed by EU structural funds) it becomes difficult to choose the most effective projects whose realization would bring the most significant benefit to the economy subject and to our country. It is possible to get objective answers about the effectiveness of the alternative <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> by evaluating them according to multicriterial methods. With the help of such methods it is possible to evaluate the <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> comprehensively by presenting one generalized indicator. It shows the effectiveness of the alternative project fairly objectively. The multicriterial evaluation method analyzed in the article gave the possibility {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the projects chosen, and to set the priority level of these projects. From the analysis carried out, it is obvious that three <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> are suitable for being financed and put into practice, and the remaining ones have to be rejected or corrected.
