5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body {{with representatives of the}} District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a <b>key</b> <b>consideration.</b> Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance the system. Because the least expensive way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} older adults is growing rapidly.

Methods: An international expert panel has reviewed and discussed <b>key</b> <b>considerations</b> for interventions against suicide in older adults based on existing evidence, where available, and expert opinion. Results: A set of new <b>key</b> <b>considerations</b> is divided into: universal, selective, and indicated prevention {{as well as a}} section on general considerations.

Approaches range from centralizing the raw data download to outsourcing the entire reference data management function to a third party vendor. In recommending the best approach for CCL, a number of <b>key</b> <b>considerations</b> will be discussed. <b>Key</b> <b>considerations</b> mark the important features or characteristics that make a good data management process.

25|$|Once the {{transmission}} {{characteristics of a}} system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a transceiver. A <b>key</b> <b>consideration</b> {{in the design of}} transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by noise.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{contamination}} of the feedstock material is a <b>key</b> <b>consideration.</b> If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used. If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical biological treatment plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.|$|E

JPMorgan added that almost all regulatory road blocks in building the railway is resolved. The <b>key</b> <b>consideration</b> in the project approval rests {{in the role of}} developing the Iskandar Development Region. On January 2008, the transport minister, Datuk Seri Chan Kong Choy said that the government is still looking in the proposal and had yet to make a final decision. He added that the train would be Broad gauge and will run at 350km/h. If this is the case, new lines need to be laid down as the currently ERL tracks are only Standard gauge. In March 2008, the government is still studying the social impact of the project through the Economic Planning Unit. The Deputy Prime Minister stress out that the risk and funding of the project will squarely rest on the private sector.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} {{related to}} the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable {{it will be to}} handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material. Another <b>key</b> <b>consideration</b> is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1. Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere, {{the main}} {{offensive}} {{which had been}} launched at Hill 971 and Sari Bair, and the fresh landings {{that had taken place}} at Suvla Bay, also faltered. Ultimately, the August Offensive, of which the fighting at Lone Pine had been a part, failed to deliver the Sari Bair heights to the British Empire forces and their allies, nor did it break the deadlock. Following this, stalemate returned to the peninsula during September and October, and although small skirmishes continued, the Australians were mainly involved in defensive actions. As a result of the setback, many of the strategic goals that had been the basis of the campaign were abandoned and as a bitter winter set-in in November, there was much debate among the British high command about the utility of continuing the campaign. In the intervening months, some personnel had been shifted away from Gallipoli as other the situation in other theatres became more relevant, and in late November, Lord Kitchener toured the peninsula. Finally, on 8 December, the order to begin the evacuation was given. The evacuation, which has been described as [...] "more brilliantly conducted... than any other phase of the campaign", took place in stages, and with the maintenance of secrecy a <b>key</b> <b>consideration,</b> a series of [...] "ruses" [...] were used to conceal the withdrawal. Each unit left in drafts, maintaining a presence along the line until the very end. Finally, just before dawn on 20 December, the evacuation was complete.

2500|$|In penal {{theory and}} the {{philosophy}} of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care {{in the distribution of}} punishment in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the utilitarian approach to the philosophy of punishment, Jeremy Bentham's [...] "parsimony principle" [...] states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of proportionality. Parsimony is a <b>key</b> <b>consideration</b> of the modern restorative justice, and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the prison abolition movement. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the sensibility of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dramatic}} {{decrease in}} evasion {{during this period}} coincided with a reinvigorated Transit Police, a 25% expansion of City police, and a general drop in crime in U.S. cities. In the city, crime rate decline begun in 1991 under Mayor David Dinkins and continued through next two decades under Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. Some observers credited the “broken windows” approach of law enforcement [...] where minor crimes like evasion are routinely prosecuted, and statistical crimefighting tools, whereas others have indicated different reasons for crime reduction. Regardless of causality, evasion checks resulted in many arrests for outstanding warrants or weapons charges, likely contributing somewhat to public safety improvements. Arrests weren’t {{the only way to}} combat evasions, and by the early 1990s NYCTA was examining methods to improve fare control passenger throughputs, reduce fare collection costs, and maintain control over evasions and general grime.
