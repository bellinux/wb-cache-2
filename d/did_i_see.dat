500|$|... "Ode to Psyche" [...] is a 67-line poem {{written in}} stanzas of varying length, which took its form from {{modification}} Keats {{made to the}} sonnet structure. The ode is written to a Grecian mythological character, displaying a great influence of Classical culture as the poet begins his discourse with [...] "O GODDESS!" [...] (line 1). Psyche, a creature so beautiful that she drew the attention of Cupid himself, draws {{the attention of the}} narrator, whose artistic imagination causes him to dream of her: [...] "Surely I dream'd to-day, or <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> / The wingèd Psyche with awaken'd eyes" [...] (lines 5–6). As he relates himself to the mythical character of Cupid, he confuses the god's emotions with his own and imagines that he too has fallen in love with the woman's beauty. The poet does, however, understand the temporal difference between the characters of ancient Greece and his own as he declares, [...] "even in these days [...] I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired" [...] (lines 40–43). In line 50, the poet states [...] "Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane", which, Harold Bloom suggests, implies that the poet himself becomes a [...] "prophet of the soul" [...] as he regards the beauty of Psyche and attempts to place himself within Cupid's personage. according to T.S. Eliot, it is the most prominent ode among the six great odes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the post}} race interview, Busch {{was quoted as}} saying on ABC that he was [...] "in [...] head,". He had to be {{restrained}} after the race when NASCAR.com reporter Joe Menzer asked “Kurt, can either you or Jimmie win the Chase...”. Busch cut Menzer off replying “How <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> you were going to come with that? We’re good.” and started to walk away. Busch ultimately shouted expletives and physically went after Menzer before Penske team members had to physically restrain him. Jenna Fryer later in a press conference asked Johnson about the comment during the ABC post race interview, Busch interrupted saying [...] "I didn't say that tonight. Did not." [...] Fryer offered to show him the ABC transcript, which he looked at after the interview. Busch proceeded to tear up the transcript showing he had made these statements {{and walked out of the}} media center.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi {{had to give}} {{a speech}} before a group of Japanese infantrymen who had volunteered to be [...] "human bullets", {{promising}} to strap explosives on their bodies and to stage suicide attacks in order to die for the Showa Emperor. Puyi commented as he read out his speech praising the glories of dying for the Emperor: [...] "Only then <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> the ashen grey of their faces and the tears flowing down their cheeks and hear their sobbing." [...] Puyi commented that he felt at that moment utterly [...] "terrified" [...] at the death cult fanaticism of Bushido ("the way of the warrior") which reduced the value of human life down to nothing, as to die for the Emperor {{was the only thing that}} mattered; he observed that the Japanese infantrymen all had families and friends who cared for them, and had quite possibly been bullied by their officers into becoming [...] "human bullets". Yoshioka tried to reassure Puyi by saying that the [...] "human bullets" [...] were crying [...] "manly Japanese tears" [...] as deep down they wanted to die for the Emperor, but Puyi later stated he was not convinced by this argument.|$|E
