In the Atacama area, the end of the paleolake phase coinciding with Lake Tauca was accompanied by the end of the first phase of human settlement. Some <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> reserves in the dry Andes formed during the Tauca phase.

25|$|For example, {{a reserve}} {{such as the}} Ogallala Aquifer can be mined {{at a rate that}} far exceeds replenishment. This turns much of the world's {{underground}} water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive. The term <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged.|$|E
25|$|An urban civilization, the Garamantes, arose around 500 BCE in {{the heart}} of the Sahara, in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan, Libya. The Garamantes {{achieved}} this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> and bring it to their fields. The Garamantes grew populous and strong, conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves (who were put to work extending the tunnels). The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they traded with them, and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes' capital of Garama. Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes' territory. The Garamantes' civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains.|$|E
25|$|Human {{pressures}} on global freshwater systems are having dramatic effects. The freshwater cycle is another boundary significantly affected by climate change. Freshwater resources, such as lakes and aquifers, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> is sometimes {{used to describe}} aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted {{at a rate that}} exceeds the recharge rate. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion. Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as nitrates, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their overexploitation can result in a Hubbert-like peak. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.|$|E

500|$|The first core {{of freshly}} frozen lake ice was {{obtained}} on 10 January 2013 {{at a depth}} of [...] However, as soon as the ice was pierced, water from the underlying lake gushed up the borehole, mixing it with the Freon and kerosene used to keep the borehole from freezing. A new borehole was drilled and an allegedly pristine water sample was obtained in January 2015. [...] The Russian team plans to eventually lower a probe into the lake to collect water samples and sediments from the bottom. It is hypothesized that unusual forms of life could be found in the lake's liquid layer, a <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> reserve. Lake Vostok contains an environment sealed off below the ice for millions of years, in conditions which could resemble those of the ice-covered ocean of Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus.|$|E
500|$|When rain {{falls in}} deserts, as it {{occasionally}} does, {{it is often}} with great violence. The desert surface is evidence of this with dry stream channels known as arroyos or wadis meandering across its surface. These can experience flash floods, becoming raging torrents with surprising rapidity after a storm that may be many kilometers away. Most deserts are in basins with no drainage to the sea but some are crossed by exotic rivers sourced in mountain ranges or other high rainfall areas beyond their borders. The River Nile, the Colorado River and the Yellow River do this, losing much of their water through evaporation as they pass through the desert and raising groundwater levels nearby. There may also be underground sources of water in deserts {{in the form of}} springs, aquifers, underground rivers or lakes. Where these lie close to the surface, wells can be dug and oases may form where plant and animal life can flourish. The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System under the Sahara Desert is the largest known accumulation of <b>fossil</b> <b>water.</b> The Great Man-Made River is a scheme launched by Libya's Colonel Gadaffi to tap this aquifer and supply water to coastal cities. Kharga Oasis in Egypt is [...] long and is the largest oasis in the Libyan Desert. A lake occupied this depression in ancient times and thick deposits of sandy-clay resulted. Wells are dug to extract water from the porous sandstone that lies underneath. Seepages may occur in the walls of canyons and pools may survive in deep shade near the dried up watercourse below.|$|E

2500|$|The Ogallala Aquifer of {{the central}} United States {{is one of the}} world's great aquifers, but in places it is being rapidly {{depleted}} by growing municipal use, and continuing agricultural use. This huge aquifer, which underlies portions of eight states, contains primarily <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> {{from the time of the}} last glaciation. Annual recharge, in the more arid parts of the aquifer, is estimated to total only about 10 percent of annual withdrawals. According to a 2013 report by research hydrologist Leonard F. Konikow at the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the depletion between 2001–2008, inclusive, is about 32 percent of the cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century (Konikow 2013:22)." [...] In the United States, the biggest users of water from aquifers include agricultural irrigation and oil and coal extraction. [...] "Cumulative total groundwater depletion in the United States accelerated in the late 1940s and continued at an almost steady linear rate through the end of the century. In addition to widely recognized environmental consequences, groundwater depletion also adversely impacts the long-term sustainability of groundwater supplies to help meet the Nation’s water needs." ...|$|E
