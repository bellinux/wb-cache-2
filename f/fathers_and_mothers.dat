On 21 June 2005, experts were called to the Senate to debate the issue. The expert's opinions were diverse; some stated that same-sex adoption {{had no effect on}} a child's development, except for perhaps a higher tolerance towards homosexuality. However, psychiatrist Aquilino Polaino, called by the People's Party as an expert, called homosexuality a pathology and emotive disorder. Among other assertions that generated debate, he claimed that [...] "many homosexuals have rape abuse antecedents since childhood" [...] and that homosexuals generally come from families with [...] "hostile, alcoholic and distant" [...] <b>fathers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> who were [...] "over protective" [...] toward boys and [...] "cold" [...] toward girls.

2500|$|Russian Cosmist Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov {{advocated}} {{resurrection of}} the dead using scientific methods. Fedorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research {{of the possibility of}} restoring life and making it infinite. His first project is connected with collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on [...] "knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world". The second method described by Fedorov is genetic-hereditary. The revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers,</b> they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a genetic twin of the dead person. It is necessary to give back the revived person his old mind, his personality. Fedorov speculates about the idea of [...] "radial images" [...] that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fedorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, Man will learn to restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation.|$|E
2500|$|Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier of Lyon, {{a staunch}} anti-Semite who {{supported}} Vichy's efforts {{to solve the}} [...] "Jewish question" [...] in France thus far, opposed the rafles of Jews, arguing in a sermon that the [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" [...] was taking things {{a little too far}} (his [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish question" [...] was conversion of the Jews to Roman Catholicism). Archbishop Jules-Géraud Saliège of Toulouse in a pastoral letter of 23 August 1942 declared about the deportations: [...] "You cannot do whatever you wish against these men, against these women, against these <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers.</b> They are part of mankind. They are our brothers". Pastor Marc Boegner, president of the National Protestant Federation, denounced the rafles in a sermon in September 1942, asking Calvinists to hide Jews. A number of Catholic and Calvinist schools and organizations such as Jesuit Père Pierre Chaillet's l'Amitié Chrétienne began to take in Jewish children and passed them off as Christian. Many Protestant families, influenced by memories of persecution, had already begun to hide Jews, and after the summer of 1942, the Catholic Church, which until then had been broadly supportive of Vichy's anti-Semitic laws, began to condemn racial anti-Semitism and organized efforts to hide Jews. The official story was that the Jews were being [...] "resettled in the East", being moved to a [...] "Jewish homeland" [...] said to exist somewhere in Eastern Europe, but right from the start, there were disturbing rumors that the Jews were actually being killed. As 1942 went on, the fact that no one knew precisely where this [...] "Jewish homeland in the East" [...] was or had seen it together with the fact that those sent to be [...] "resettled in the East" [...] were never seen or heard from again led more and more people to the correct conclusion that the horrific rumors of the Jews were in fact being all exterminated were true.|$|E
