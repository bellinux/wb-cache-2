[...] "Poor Pretty Eddie is another public domain feature restored for Blu-ray by HD Cinema Classics/Film Chest. Anyone who doubts any significant restoration beyond overly aggressive DNR {{was done on}} this title need only look at the restoration demo included on the disc. The 35mm print utilized for the master is literally littered with virtually nonstop vertical green scratches, most {{of which have been}} removed. Color doesn't seem to have been retimed, at least not significantly, and so things have a slightly ruddy cast some of the time. But let's face it. Though filmed in Technicolor (and mid-70s Technicolor was not the Technicolor of yore), this was never a big budget film, and that low budget indie ethos shines (if that's the right word) through virtually every frame of Poor Pretty Eddie. This was never a glossy, pretty film to begin with and it still isn't. The DNR applied means there's an overly smooth texture to this release, but it also means that we have a largely blemish free image. Color is certainly above average, if not mind blowingly robust, given the low budget confines of the original <b>film.</b> <b>Contrast</b> is on the low side, as it obviously has been from day one, and therefore detail tends to get lost in some of the darker interior scenes. The image is also very soft most of the time, but, again, that's how this film looked from day one. But overall, this is the second color film HD Cinema Classics/Film Chest has released in {{the last week or so}} (The Terror being the other), and the results, while not perfect, are not as hideously troublesome as those who want grain, and lots of it, seem to think." ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{two methods}} of enhancing a photographic image and applies them to duplicating mammographs. Subtractive unsharp masking, one such method, is a photo-optical edge enhancement technique. The degree of unsharpness {{is controlled by}} interspacing between the mammograph and a receiving film while exposing. The other method is optimizing the combination of masking <b>film</b> <b>contrast</b> and duplicating <b>film</b> <b>contrast.</b> Three levels of unsharpness, two levels of mask contrast and two levels of duplicating <b>film</b> <b>contrast</b> were tested. The common objective of this project and mammography in general involves the recognition and diagnosis of breast cancer. Specifically, the experimental objective {{is to increase the}} detectability of breast tumors and calcium deposits caused by cancer relative to an original mammograph. Individual examinations of 36 samples by six radiologists provided data enabling subjective and statistical conclusions to be made. Tumor and calcium detectability were rated relative to an original mammograph. Respectively, results showed that 54 % and 96 % of the samples observed were rated superior in diagnostic qualit...|$|E

40|$|Time-resolved small-angle neutron {{scattering}} (TR-SANS) {{was employed to}} observe temperature-induced phase transitions from the sponge (L- 3 to the lamellar (L (alpha) phase, and vice versa, in the water-oil (n-decane) -non-ionic surfactant (C 12 E 5 system using both bulk and <b>film</b> <b>contrast.</b> Samples of different bilayer volume fractions phi and solvent viscosities eta were investigated applying various amplitudes of temperature jump Delta T. The findings of a previous H- 2 -NMR study could be confirmed, where the lamellar phase formation was determined to occur through a nucleation and growth process, while {{it was concluded that}} the L- 3 -phase develops in a mechanistically different and more rapid manner involving uncorrelated passage formation. Likewise, the kinetic trends of the nucleation and growth transition (decreased transition time with increase of phi and Delta T were witnessed once again. Additionally, NMR and SANS data that demonstrate a strong dependency of that process on solvent viscosity eta are presented. Contrariwise, it is made evident via both SANS and NMR results that the L-alpha-to-L- 3 transition time is independent (within experimental sensitivity) of the varied parameters (phi, Delta T, eta). Unusual scattering evolution in one experiment, originating from a highly ordered lamellar phase, intriguingly hints that a major rate determining factor is the disruption of long-range order. Furthermore, the bulk contrast investigations give insight into structure peak shifts/development during the transitions, while the <b>film</b> <b>contrast</b> experiments prove the bilayer thickness to be constant throughout the phase transitions and show that there is no evidence for a change in the short-range order of the bilayer structure. The latter was considered possible, due to the different topology of the L- 3 and L-alpha phases. Lastly, an unexpected yet consistent appearance of anisotropic scattering is detected in the L- 3 -to-L-alpha transitions...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This work {{presents}} {{the description of}} the procedure of modeling of light field above the sea surface covered by thin oil film. Simulations of the fate of 5 million light photons of solar radiation, which reaches the sea surface, were made. The sea basin model applied included wind waves, sea depth, sea bottom shape and water optical properties. The optical properties of sea surface covered by oil film were derived numerically, by means of simulations of electromagnetic wave transmission in air-oil-water system, separately for upward and downward light. During simulations of photon fate only those photons, which returned to the atmosphere in determined angle ranges were registered. The simulations were made for two chosen angles of incidence: 20 o and 60 o.

40|$|A simple Ginzburg-Landau {{theory with}} a single, scalar order {{parameter}} {{is used to}} study the microscopic structure of microemulsions and sponge phases. The scattering intensity in both film and bulk contrast, as well as averages of the internal area S, the Euler characteristic χ_E, and the mean curvature squared, are calculated by Monte Carlo methods. The results are compared with results obtained from a variational approach {{in combination with the}} theory of Gaussian random fields and level surfaces. The results for the location of the transition from the microemulsion to oil/water coexistence, for the scattering intensity in bulk contrast, and for the dimensionless ratio χ_E V^ 2 /S^ 3 (where V is the volume) are found to be in good quantitative agreement. However, the variational approach fails to give a peak in the scattering intensity in <b>film</b> <b>contrast</b> at finite wavevector, a peak which is observed both in the Monte Carlo simulations and in experiment.

The methods have also been demonstrated with lambda bacteriophages, purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium and fibres of DNA.

40|$|The tube to {{tube sheet}} (TTS) welds of steam {{generator}} of Fast Breeder Reactor {{is the most}} critical joint. This is because, sodium flows on shell side and water on tube side. Any failure would thus be catastrophic. Microfocal radiography is an established technique {{that is being used}} for the evaluation of such welds. Using microfocal radiography pores of the order of 25 microns could be detected. Microfocal radiography of TTS joints is primarily accomplished using a backward throw rod anode. Such an arrangement however is beset with its own problems. The angled beam results in uneven beam intensity across the weld. During actual weld radiography, the trailing edge of the beam where intensity is minimum, traverses a longer distance than the leading edge which compounds the problem of density variation. This results in uneven radiographic density and contrast. It is a well-known fact that sensitivity achievable in radiography is a function of radiographic contrast and definition. Radiographic contrast in turn is affected by subject and <b>film</b> <b>contrast.</b> Uneven radiographic contrasts make interpretation complex and sometimes result in unacceptable density variations. To overcome this problem, the authors devised a novel solution. Using appropriately designed and fabricated filters and image processing techniques, authors have successfully developed procedures for ensuring uniformity i...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Processing {{conditions}} affect sensitometric {{properties of}} X-ray films. In this study, we aimed {{to evaluate the}} sensitometric characteristics of InSight (IP), a new F-speed film, in fresh and used processing solutions in dental office condition and compare them with Ektaspeed Plus (EP). Materials and Methods: In this experimental in vitro study, an aluminium step wedge was used to construct characteristic curves for InSight and Ektaspeed Plus films (Kodak Eastman, Rochester, USA). All films were processed in Champion solution (X-ray Iran, Tehran, Iran) both manually and automatically {{in a period of}} six days. Unexposed films of both types were processed manually and automatically to determine base plus fog density. Speed and <b>film</b> <b>contrast</b> were measured according to ISO definition. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and T tests with P&lt; 0. 05 as the level of significance. Results: IP was 20 to 22 % faster than EP and showed to be an F-speed film when processed in automatic condition and E-F film when processed manually. Also it was F-speed in fresh solution and E-speed in old solution. IP and EP contrasts were similar in automatic processing but EP contrast was higher when processed manually. Both EP and IP films had standard values of base plus fog (&lt; 0. 35) and B+F densities were decreased in old solution. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, InSight is a F-speed film with a speed of at least 20 % greater than Ektaspeed. In addition, it reduces patient exposure with no damage to image quality...|$|E

40|$|Extended-cycle {{process is}} the term used for a {{processor}} in which the processing time has been prolonged usually to approximate 210 seconds. It has been known that the extended-cycle process of some single-emulsion films as used for mammography may enhance <b>film</b> <b>contrast</b> and increase film speed. So the speed was increased in lower speed and higher resolution system than conventional systems by means of using the extended-cycle process in this paper. We investigated how much {{the resolution of the}} system was kept. A single screen-single emulsion combination, Konica M- 100 /CM-H was employed as a low speed and high resolution system. This film after exposure was processed in the different combinations of developing temperatures, 30, 32 and 34 ℃, and processing time of 210 seconds. On the other hand, Konica M- 200 /CM-H was employed as a high speed system. This film was processed in the standard-cycle processing (34 ℃, 90 seconds). Those systems were compared on contrast, speed, screen-film blur and noise by a characteristic curve, MTF (modulation transfer function) and WS (wiener spectrum). Furthermore, the RMI 165 phantom was used to evaluate visibility of mammographic details of these systems. As a result, in the extended-cycle process at the developing temperatures of 32 or 34 °C and processing time of 210 seconds for M- 100 /CM-H, it was possible to increase the speed as much as the higher speed system, M- 200 /CM-H. Then the contrast, the MTF and the visibility were also improved as compared to the higher speed system. Furthermore patient dose could be reduced at the developing temperature of 34 ℃ and processing time of 210 seconds in M- 100 /CM-H. 通常,extended-cycle processは処理時間が約 210 秒に延ばされた現像機のために使われる用語である｡乳房撮影に使われるような片面乳剤フィルムにおけるextended-cycle processは,フィルムコントラストを増し,感度をあげることが良く知られている｡そこで,本論文ではextended-cycle processにより低感度,高解像度システムの感度を上げ,どの程度解像度が維持されるかを調べた｡片面増感紙／片面フィルムの組合わせであるKonica M- 100 /CM-Hを低感度,高解像度システムとして用いた｡露光後のフィルムは現像温度 30, 32, 34 度,処理時間 210 秒の異なる組合わせで現像処理した。一方,高感度システムとしてKonica M- 200 /CM-Hを用い,このフィルムは標準現像(34 ℃, 90 秒) された｡感度,増感紙／フイルムのぼけ,雑音に関して,特性曲線,MTF(modulation transfer function), WS(wiener spectrum) によってこれらのシステムを比較した｡さらにこれらのシステムにおける乳房写真の細部視覚評価のためにRM 165 ファントムを使用した｡その結果,M- 100 /CM-Hに対するextended-cycle process現像温度 32, 34 ℃,処理時間 210 秒のextended-cycle processにおいて,高感度システムM- 200 /CM-Hと同等の感度を上げることが可能であった｡そのとき,コントラスト,MTF,視覚的検出能も高感度システムより向上した｡さらに,現像温度 34 ℃,処理時間 210 秒では,被曝線量の低減が可能であった...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} small angle neutron {{scattering}} (SANS) studies on a binary A,B homopolymer mixture of critical composition {{mixed with a}} symmetric AB diblock copolymer are presented. These A-B diblock copolymers act as an surfactant molecules reducing the surface energy and thereby leading to an improved miscibility and to stronger thermal fluctuations. But, as homopolymer blends and diblock copolymers obey different universality classes blending leads to new phenomena as the universality class of the isotropic Lifshitz case and to microemulsion phases. Mean field theory predicts a Lifshitz critical point {{and in some cases}} even a Lifshitz tricritical point with the critical exponents #gamma# = 1 and #nu# = 1 / 4 of susceptibility and correlation length, respectively. Those mean field critical exponents were observed in such a system of rather large polymer mass. Another related study on a mixture of significantly reduced polymer mass gave a sharp transition with increasing diblock content from 3 D-Ising (#gamma# = 1. 24, #nu# = 0. 63) to the isotropic Lifshitz critical exponents of (#gamma# = 1. 62 and #nu# = 0. 9). These studies have shown that thermal composition fluctuations {{play an important role in}} the range of the Lifshitz universality class. Due to the vanishing surface energy which acts as a restoring force for the fluctuations and leads to a scaling behavior of Ginzburg number according to N" 2 "/" 3. These strong fluctuations are responsible for several deviations from the mean field predicted phase behavior: (1) No Lifshitz critical point is observed and a micro emulsion channel appears between the two-phase and lamellar phase regimes; (2) the Lifshitz Line shows a non-monotonic temperature dependence. The present studies were mainly focused on the regime of the Lifshitz critical behavior. We made new observations from which we hope to further clarify the phase behavior, especially in this range. So, within a narrow range of diblock concentration between 6 and 12 % a closed-loop two-phase regime terminated by a double critical point and a droplet and bicontinuous microemulsion phase was observed. The border line, where the correlations of the bicontinuous microemulsion phase becomes visible, appears as the lower temperature continuation of the Lifshitz line. Samples with three different scattering contrasts were explored in order to better understand the behavior of the diblock copolymer. This was done by measuring the fluctuations between all the A and B monomers, irrespectively, whether they originate from the homopolymer or the block copolymer (bulk contrast); from one block of the diblock copolymer (block contrast) and in the other case only from the middle part of the diblock copolymer (<b>film</b> <b>contrast).</b> In neutron scattering such conditions of changing contrast are relatively easily achieved from the exchange of hydrogen and deuterium during the synthesis of the polymers.
