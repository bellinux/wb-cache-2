It is an oxygenated, nontoxic, sulphur-free, biodegradable and renewable fuel. The scarcity and increase in the crude oil prices have forced everyone to think {{on the use of}} biodiesel as {{an alternative}} fuel source. Also, it is important that unlike the traditional fuels which emit green house gases and particulate matter, the biodiesel is greener and hence less polluting. But the use of <b>food</b> <b>grain</b> based biodiesel may lead to increase in food prices. Therefore {{there is a need for}} finding availability and feasibility of non-food based biodiesel. In this work, evaluation of combination of <b>food</b> <b>grain</b> and non <b>food</b> <b>grain</b> biodiesel has been made by using these two different sources of biodiesel in various blends such as B 40 and B 60.

40|$|There is a {{substantial}} controversy in the economics literature over {{the magnitude of the}} expenditure elasticity for <b>food</b> <b>grain</b> in China that is caused, to a large extent, by whether time-series or cross-section data are used in the analysis.

The results show that <b>food</b> <b>grain</b> has a small positive income elasticity, implying that <b>food</b> <b>grain</b> is not an inferior good in China. The reason that consumption per capita has not increased during a period of rapid economic growth in income is that the relative prices of the food and non-food substitutes for <b>food</b> <b>grain</b> have decreased.

By 1987, the $4 billion translated into $12 investment per person. Economists claimed that a huge budget deficit is spurring inflation, eroding the standard of living of the poorest sections of the people of Bihar. In agriculture, the largest sector, the government failed to invest in the production of agriculture and instead opted to import <b>food</b> <b>grains</b> from other parts of India.
