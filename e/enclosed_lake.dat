5000|$|A huge {{tidal range}} and {{high level of}} {{surrounding}} industry and population have long made the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel a focus for tidal energy schemes and ideas. Plans for a Severn Barrage [...] - [...] running 16 km across the Bristol Channel from Lavernock Point near to and south west of Cardiff to Brean Down near and just south west of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset [...] - [...] would generate a massive 8640 MW when the tide flows, and have been discussed for several decades now. The power generated would come from a lake of 185 sq mi with a potential energy depth of 14 m. Tidal power only runs for around ten hours a day, but by using the <b>enclosed</b> <b>lake</b> as a reservoir of potential energy more hours of operation could be achieved. Other energy sources, such as wind and solar power, also create electricity at times that do not always match when it is needed. Excess power could be stored by pumping water uphill, as is already done {{at a variety of}} other installations in the UK.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOtolith Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr {{ratios and}} {{vertebral}} bone histomorphometry {{were used to}} investigate the life-history of Anguilla obscura eels from an <b>enclosed</b> <b>lake,</b> Lalolalo (Wallis Island in the Pacific), with no apparent connection with the sea. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratio from the core region gives evidence of indisputable marine origin of eels caught in the lake suggesting that underground connections between the lake and the sea exist. Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios recorded after the elver mark are undifferentiated from seawater ones, thus limiting their used as marker of entrance in the lake and movement. However, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratio demonstrated that: 1) eels enter in the lake just after their metamorphosis and spend their entire adult life in the lake and 2) the lake chemistry is consistent with 1 % seawater-like contribution and 99 % basalt weathering and/or geothermal spring contribution. The vertebrae do not show a particular demineralization of bone matrix (45 - 52 %). Reversely, the study of bone compactness shows an important loss of bone that favors the hypothesis of a genital maturation that arises in the ecological state of the lake...|$|E
40|$|The {{continental}} shelf of the microtidal Black Sea, with its 4125 km-long coastline, has an average width of c. 40 km {{and may be}} subdivided into seven regions, the largest of these being the NW Shelf and the SW Shelf. Palimpsest shelf environments and terrestrially derived siliciclastic sedimentation are dominant. The Marmara Gateway, bisecting the southwestern shelf, controls the influx of Mediterranean-sourced water into the semi-enclosed Black Sea, and has been episodically open during the Quaternary. The best evidence for the most recent marine transgression of the pre-existing and isolated lake is found on the mid- and outer NW Shelf. Radiocarbon dating of marine and non-marine bivalve molluscs and peat indicates the most recent re-connection of the Black Sea with the oceanic reservoir occurred between 8200 and 8600 14 C years BP. Water levels during the transgression in the <b>enclosed</b> <b>lake</b> rose from a level 107 m or more below present values, to above the Bosphorus Sill (− 35 m) in about 400 14 C years. However, the transition from low-salinity (0 - 5 ‰) lacustrine conditions to near-modern values (18 ‰) took ≥ 1000 years, indicated by the progression from freshwater to brackish molluscs and gastropods, dominated by Dreissena, to Mediterranean-derived estuarine taxa (e. g. Mytilus), suited to nutrient-rich conditions...|$|E

40|$|Jökulsárlón lagoon is an <b>enclosed</b> <b>lake</b> {{bordering}} the retreating Breidamerkurjökull glacier which flows {{down from the}} Vatnajökull ice cap. As the glacier calves most of the ice it releases decays within the lake {{and the addition of}} the stored fresh water modifies the water local properties. The lake itself is connected to the North Atlantic Ocean through a narrow channel only ~ 80 m wide, and all tidal and residual flows {{in and out of the}} lake are through this channel. In April 2012 (early spring) we conducted four hydrographic sections from a small boat to determine the early season hydrographic structure of the lake. We conducted two hydrographic sections from the entrance of the channel to sea across the lagoon to the Breidamerkurjökull glacier, one across the centre of the lagoon, and one along, and close to the glacier face. Four months of time series hydrographic data from the channel show that the oceanic tidal pulse into the lagoon is short in duration. The water that enters the lagoon is warm and saline enough to descend rapidly to the greatest depths within the lagoon. With our CTD measurements we have mapped the properties of water across the lake. These reveal the pathway of the Atlantic derived water towards the ice face. The warmest water measured within the lagoon was just below the surface and only adjacent to the glacier face. Whilst this warm water was created from solar input, its location and concentration reveal the complex density driven circulation patterns close to the ice face. Calculated oceanic driven melt rates from the ice face show enhanced oceanographic melting in this near surface layer which contributes to the more substantial deeper melting...|$|E
40|$|Lake Chen Co, {{situated}} at 90 degrees 33 - 39 'E, 28 degrees 53 - 59 'N with a lake level of 4420 m asl, is an <b>enclosed</b> <b>lake</b> with 148 km(2) of catchment area and 40 km(2) of lake surface. It is mainly supplied by glacier melt water either from surface inflow or groundwater. Atmospheric precipitation is mainly concentrated in June-September. A 216 -cm long lake sediment core was obtained {{at a site}} with 8 m of water depth, 800 m from the lakeshore and 1. 5 % of the bottom slope in this lake. The sediment core was taken by a piston sampler and was sliced with an interval of 1 cm each. Pb- 210 dating measurement suggested that the average sedimentary rate was 0. 16 cm yr(- 1), which also was confirmed by Cs- 137 peak occurrence. Magnetic analyses included low-frequency dependent susceptibility (chi(LF)), susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetism (chi(ARM)), the saturation isothermal remanent magnetism (SIRM), the isothermal remanent magnetism (IRM) reverse and 'Soft' and 'Hard' contents were performed for the sediment core. Results showed that chi(LF) was an index for reflecting the environmental conditions, but was not sufficient to reveal details of magnetic features. This had been proved by measurements of IRM Reverse percentage and 'Soft' and 'Hard' magnetic minerals values. The log(SIRM/chi(LF)) had much more information to reveal environmental changes. The chi(ARM) /chi(LF) might {{be more sensitive to}} the local environmental conditions because it was well able to indicate the grain-size variations of magnetic particles. In the past ca. 1400 years, the warm stages were ca. 620 - 740 AD, 1120 - 1370 AD and since ca. 1900 AD. After an intensively cold stage during ca. 1550 - 1690 AD, a cold-humid stage from ca. 1690 - 1900 AD and a warm-dry stage since ca. 1900 AD followed. Among these stages, the warmest one occurred in ca. 1120 - 1370 AD and the coldest stage was between ca. 1550 and 1690 AD. This result might be compared with many other research results from lake cores, ice cores and the Chinese historical documents...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the {{majority}} of the last glacial cycle, the Gulf of Carpentaria, the large body of seawater that extends as a broad tongue into the north of Australia, was an <b>enclosed</b> <b>lake.</b> It would have been possible to walk {{around the perimeter of the}} lake from Australia to New Guinea. Aboriginal oral tradition recalls that during some periods, the lake teamed with freshwater fish and waterfowl. At other times, it was shallow and segmented into a series of saline swamps and pools, or even dry and subaerially exposed. Marine waters transgressed the lake margins during periods of high sea level, forming a shallow marine embayment through to open marine conditions. A large brackish lake remained as the waters again receded. The present open shallow marine conditions were emplaced within the last eight thousand years. Fluctuations in the extent and nature of this waterbody through the last glacial cycle are preserved in the sediments of the gulf. The sedimentological interpretation of core material retrieved from the gulf provides a framework of palaeoenvironmental change in the region, in particular the extent of the lake basin, timing of marine influence and evidence of channel activity. Through the detailed analysis of ostracod faunal assemblages of the core sediment and comparison with modern species distribution, inferences are drawn about the ecology of the gulf basin at the time of valve formation. Morphological variation and preservation of the valves also provide information regarding the changing conditions of the waterbody and post-depositional effects. The geochemistry of the ostracod valves permits insight to variations in climate, particularly temperature and effective precipitation change. Comparison and correlation are made with the global sea-level curve and regional climatic records. The implications for the range of environments evident in the gulf region through this period include the presence of warm shallow water for latent heat transport and the generation of cyclones, strengthened monsoon conditions and the mixing of Indian and Pacific Ocean waters through Torres Strait at high sea-level times, and greater continentality, reduced rainfall and altered oceanic currents during sea-level lowstands. The impact of the changing conditions, and shorelines, would have been particularly significant for the human inhabitants who have been present in this region for at least the last fifty thousand years. The nature and extent of the waterbody through the period has enormous implications for people, both as a resource for food and a potential land-bridge between Australia and New Guinea...|$|E
