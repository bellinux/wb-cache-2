25|$|Initially, eight {{options were}} {{identified}} which were assessed. Following initial consideration {{it was found}} that some of the options had identical components so it was decided to redefine the options in the form of varying quality standards covering census, survey and administrative data aggregation, which would each be assessed in terms of accuracy, frequency and geography. In 2012 the second round of assessment commenced with six possible options identified for detailed investigation. The criteria for assessment of these options will comprise cost, technical feasibility, risk, public acceptability, and <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
2500|$|According to the programme, {{dogs were}} {{initially}} bred for practical {{functions such as}} hunting and guarding, but, {{in the middle of}} the 19th century they became a status symbol, and dog breeding became a sport. The function of the dog then became secondary to appearance. RSPCA Chief Vet Mark Evans called the Crufts show [...] "a parade of mutants" [...] and [...] "a freakish, garish beauty pageant that has frankly nothing to do with health and welfare." [...] He pointed out that breed standards take no account of temperament and <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The South Bank Exhibition {{included}} a Design Review, that presented [...] "an illustrated record of contemporary achievement in British industry", showing [...] "the {{high standard of}} design and craftsmanship that has been reached {{in a wide range}} of British products." [...] The exhibits were based on the stock list of the Council of Industrial Design (CoID), chosen for appearance, finish, workmanship, technical efficiency, <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose</b> and economy of production. [...] The Festival was an influential advocate of the concept of [...] "Good Design", a rational approach to product design in accordance with the principles of the Modern Movement. [...] Its advocacy had grown partly out of the standards of utility furniture created during the war (Gordon Russell, the Director of the CoID, had been Chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel) and partly out of the CoID's Britain Can Make It exhibition of 1946. The CoiD's stock list was retained and inherited by its successor, the Design Council.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Britain and Ireland, {{simplicity}} and functionality prevailed in building styles. Castles, such as Alnwick Castle, Caernarfon Castle and Stirling Castle served military purpose and their battlements and turrets were practical solutions to medieval warfare. Under the feudal system that dominated Britain, <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose</b> characterised domestic structures, {{particularly for the}} lower classes. For many, houses were [...] "dark, primitive structures {{of one or two}} rooms, usually with crude timber frames, low walls and thatched roofs. They weren't built to last. And they didn't". Although primarily homes, manor houses of the Late Middle Ages, were designed with achieving respect and maintaining status through their hospitality and lordship rather than the grandeur of their buildings. In the Kingdom of England, Perpendicular style gained preference for civic and church structures throughout much of the Middle Ages. King's College Chapel in Cambridge, which started in 1446 and was completed in 1515, marks the period of transition between Perpendicular and Tudor style architecture.|$|E

2500|$|A {{greater sense}} of {{security}} led to [...] "more outward-looking buildings", {{as opposed to the}} Medieval, inward facing buildings constructed for defence. However, owing to troublesome relations with Catholic Europe, the free exchange of ideas was difficult meaning new Renaissance architecture was generally slow to arrive in Britain. Increasingly isolated from the continent, landowners relied on new architectural books for inspiration, as well as surveyors to interpret designs. This allowed for much more {{in the way of the}} ornamental facades of Italianate architecture to penetrate the architecture of Great Britain; room sizes were increased (as an expensive commodity), and there was also a general move towards balanced and symmetrical exteriors with central entrances, all used as statements of wealth. Medieval Gothic architectural forms were gradually dropped, and mansions and other large domestic buildings became [...] "varied and playful". Ultimately drawing upon ancient Hellenistic art, Inigo Jones is credited as Britain’s first classically inspired architect, providing designs as [...] "sophisticated as anything being built in Italy", such as Queen's House and Banqueting House, both in London. For the majority of the people of Great Britain however, domestic buildings were of poor design and materials, meaning few examples from the early modern period have survived. Most buildings remained tied to the locality, and local materials shaped buildings. Furthermore, the buildings of the 16th century were also governed by <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>purpose.</b> However, more stable and sophisticated houses for those lower down the social scale gradually appeared, replacing timber with stone and, later, brick. The arrival of Flemish people in the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Protestant craftsmen and pattern-books from the Low Countries that also prompted the multiplication of weavers' cottages.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{different}} kennel club definitions of Utility Group. In one, dogs which do not fit elsewhere are placed in the Utility Group, and in the other, certain breeds of working dogs are designated {{as part of the}} Utility Group. The Kennel Club (UK) places in the Utility Group dog breeds that do not quite fit in other groups, such as the Shih Tzu, which other kennel clubs place in the Toy Group, but the Kennel Club does not, as it considers them to be too large.
