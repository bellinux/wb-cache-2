5000|$|An <b>ideal</b> <b>gyrator</b> {{is similar}} to an ideal {{transformer}} in being a linear, lossless, passive, memoryless two-port device. However, whereas a transformer couples the voltage on port 1 to the voltage on port 2, and the current on port 1 to the current on port 2, the gyrator cross-couples voltage to current and current to voltage. Cascading two gyrators achieves a voltage-to-voltage coupling identical to that of an ideal transformer.|$|E
40|$|Am odel of a {{class of}} {{large-scale}} RLC time-variable nonlinear singular networks is derived. This class of networks is characterized by time-varying reactances, whose rate of change is bounded. In addition to independent sources, it also contains nonlinear time-varying resistive multiport components that include <b>ideal</b> <b>gyrators,</b> <b>ideal</b> transformers, controlled sources, etc. Some of the resistive components may have nonmonotonic characteristics. The model does not allow the state-space description and is given {{in the form of}} implicit differential equations. It allows however simple interpretation of the physical decomposition of the large-scale network. Also, the model is suitable for qualitative analysis of response properties of large-scale networks. Sufficient conditions for various qualitative properties of network response are given. The conditions are given in terms of relative passivity associated with the individual disconnected subnetworks, and an additional simple algebraic condit [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{fundamental}} power-processing {{properties of}} switching converter circuits are modeled using generalized power-conservative (POPI) networks. Depending on the appli-cation, {{it may be}} most appropriate to model the first-order con-verter properties as those of an <b>ideal</b> transformer, <b>gyrator,</b> loss-free resistor, or other POPI network. These basic functions can be obtained either through selection of a topology that natu-rally possesses the desired characteristics or by addition of a suitable control network. Some well-known converter topolo-gies are shown to behave naturally as gyrators, loss-free resis-tors, and constant power networks. Application of the gyrator to network two voltage sources, {{and use of the}} loss-free resistor as a unity power factor rectifier, is described. 1...|$|R
40|$|A unified {{approach}} to <b>ideal</b> transformer and <b>gyrator</b> is proposed. They {{are presented as}} the only two ports belonging to the class of ideal power transferitors, i. e., the only two ports that absorb instantaneous power from one port and supply {{the same amount of}} instantaneous power from the other port. By exploiting the transmission matrix, this approach evidences similarities and differences between the two well-known two ports pointing out that other two-port ideal power transferitors cannot exist...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that every pair of {{conjugate}} trees {{of a network}} corresponds to a nonzero summand of a certain expansion of the network determinant. The search for such summands is formulated as a matroid partition problem, for which efficient algorithms are known. The number of operations to be performed is bounded by a polynomial {{in the number of}} branches of the network. The algorithm presented is applicable to networks containing nullator-norator pairs, resistors, and independent sources as well as controlled sources, <b>ideal</b> transformers, and <b>gyrators.</b> (orig.)
