5|$|Rand's work on The Fountainhead was {{repeatedly}} interrupted. In 1937, {{she took a}} break from it to write a novella called Anthem. She also completed a stage adaptation of We the Living that ran briefly in 1940. That same year, she became active in politics. She first worked as a volunteer in Wendell Willkie's presidential campaign, and then attempted to form a group for conservative intellectuals. As her royalties from earlier projects ran out, she began doing freelance work as a script reader for movie studios. When Rand <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> publisher, the novel was only one-third complete.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2008 {{supplemental}} {{draft in}} late June, Layla was drafted to the Raw brand. On the 7 July episode of Raw, Layla made her debut in a tag team match with Jillian Hall, losing to Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, the latter {{of whom had been}} revealed as the newest member of the Raw brand earlier that night. She soon entered a storyline with Jamie Noble in which Noble attempted to impress her with his matches, only to be squashed by his opponents. On 1 September, Noble was able to defeat William Regal, which impressed Layla. The following week, however, Layla chose to align herself with Regal, after he defeated Noble in a rematch. On the following episode of Raw, Layla reinforced her decision, telling Noble that she had <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> worthy man in Regal. Over the next few months, Layla competed only sporadically in matches, spending most of her time managing Regal, and was present at ringside when Regal defeated Santino Marella on 10 November to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship. On 5 April, Layla competed in a Divas battle royal at WrestleMania XXV, but the match was won by Santina Marella.|$|E

50|$|When the Scandinavian and Scottish ice caps first met, the Urstrom (unless it <b>found</b> <b>a</b> way northwards {{under the}} ice) would have backed {{up into a}} huge lake in the {{southern}} North Sea, which <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> outlet southwards over the Weald-Artois Anticline and helped to cut {{the valley of the}} Strait of Dover: see Strait of Dover#Geological formation.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s {{the student}} body {{increased}} dramatically, leading the school to begin a search for additional premises. In January 2004 the school <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> additional campus on Neils Hemmingsensgade, central Copenhagen. Kødbyen then became responsible mostly for the culinary arts students and Neils Hemmingsensgade became the centre for administration and hospitality studies.|$|R
5|$|Ripley {{makes her}} way back to Ricardo, who {{explains}} that the Working Joes, the station's service androids, abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. He also tells her that Samuels is attempting to interface with the station's controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, APOLLO's defensive countermeasures electrocute Samuels shortly after he managed to open a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. Upon reaching APOLLO, Ripley discovers that Seegson, who has been trying to sell off Sevastopol for years, has <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> buyer: Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien. When Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, it refuses due to an unidentified presence within the station's reactor. Ripley arrives there and discovers that it has been converted into an alien nest. She then initiates a reactor purge to destroy the nest, but some aliens manage to escape and begin to overrun Sevastopol. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent by Weyland-Yutani to retrieve the alien, and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crosses her and takes her hostage aboard the Anesidora.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing {{to come to the}} same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1930, Lindbergh <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> ally in the Guggenheim family. Financier Daniel Guggenheim agreed to fund Goddard's {{research}} {{over the next four}} years for a total of $100,000 (~$ today). The Guggenheim family, especially Harry Guggenheim, would continue to support Goddard's work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to Roswell, New Mexico.|$|R
50|$|By 1944, Harry had <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> {{adequate}} {{building in}} nearby Indianapolis. That same year, after moving {{his family to}} Indianapolis and establishing Choc-Ola Bottlers, Inc., Harry purchased a route truck and in conjunction with larger distributors like 7UP, he began having Choc-Ola distributed throughout central Indiana and eventually to all of Indiana and the bordering areas of Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan.|$|R
50|$|Another {{story is}} when Pele, {{the goddess of}} fire {{was trying to find}} a home for herself running away from her sister Namakaokaha'i (the goddess of the oceans) when she <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> island where she couldn't be touched by the waves. There at chain of craters on the island of Hawai'i she danced the first dance of hula {{signifying}} that she finally won.|$|R
5|$|His brother {{claims that}} Stauskas scored about 50 {{points a game}} in middle school. For much of his youth, he and future Gonzaga point guard Kevin Pangos {{attended}} basketball camps together, regularly playing one-on-one while other campers took breaks from basketball for other activities. Until 2009, Stauskas played for Loyola Catholic Secondary School. He averaged 15 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 2007–08 and 32 points, 14 rebounds and 7.5 assists in 2008–09. Its basketball team nearly disbanded before Stauskas's grade 10 season in 2008–09, when Loyola {{was in danger of}} not fielding a team because school policy required the presence of a teacher. Although his father, a computer consultant, was willing to volunteer as a coach, no teacher was willing to serve. Stauskas's father <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> French teacher who sat in the gym and graded papers while his father coached. In the meantime, Stauskas joined the premier Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team in Toronto, run by Ro Russell. Some of Russell's prior players, such as Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph had gone to the United States to complete their scholastic years. Stauskas, not wishing to risk not having a team to play on after the crisis of 2008–2009, spent the 2009–10 academic year at South Kent School, but the forested rural campus made him homesick and he transferred to St. Mark's School the following year. He missed the 2009–10 basketball season {{as a result of a}} hip injury. Michigan Wolverines men's basketball head coach John Beilein became familiar with Stauskas during the Summer 2010 NBA camp prior to Stauskas's junior year. Stauskas visited Michigan that summer and was also being recruited by Villanova, Iowa State, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Florida and Providence. By the time he arrived at St. Mark's, he was expected to be an All-State performer. In the 2011 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game, Stauskas led St. Mark's in scoring with 17 points against Nerlens Noel and the Tilton School, but St. Marks lost 72–56. On March 26, 2011, Stauskas made a verbal commitment to Michigan. This commitment made him the second member of Michigan's recruiting class of 2012. That summer he scored 27 points in an exhibition of Canadian high school all-stars against the Baylor Bears men's basketball team.|$|E
25|$|Christiern Pedersen <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> copy in the {{collection}} of Archbishop Birger Gunnersen of Lund, modern Sweden, which he gladly lent him. With the help of printer Jodocus Badius, Gesta Danorum was refined and printed.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{it looked}} like Sacks had <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> steady ride, driving the No. 98 Ford for Cale Yarborough. However, on lap 136 of the Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, Sacks lost control {{of his car and}} wrecked, {{suffering}} life-threatening injuries. He missed the rest of the season.|$|E
50|$|Moe {{wakes up}} to find the rag has been stolen. The thief is {{revealed}} as Marge, who cleans the rag before returning it. Moe then realizes that he has real friends in the Simpson family, and tosses the rag out the window for Santa's Little Helper, {{who takes care of}} the rag and then fights over it with Maggie. The rag, meanwhile, is overjoyed to have <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> owner who truly loves it.|$|R
50|$|Qhuinn, son of no one, is used {{to being}} on his own. Disavowed from his bloodline, shunned by the aristocracy, he has <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> {{identity}} {{as one of the}} most brutal fighters in the war against the Lessening Society. But his life is not complete. Even as the prospect of having a family of his own seems to be within reach, he is empty on the inside, his heart given to another.|$|R
50|$|Since 2006, he has {{realised}} {{a number}} of learning programs for International Red Cross, European Union Monitoring Mission to Georgia, Swiss Embassy and other international organizations. In 2008 he began a crusade against demolition of the old Rustavi race circuit and <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> investor for its total reconstruction. After putting the new race track into service, Meladze created the first professional racing team in Georgia {{and became one of}} its drivers.|$|R
25|$|From 1830 – 1840 the RGS met in {{the rooms}} of the Horticultural Society in Regent Street, London and from 1854 -1870 at 15 Whitehall Place, London. In 1870, the Society <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> home when it moved to 1 Savile Row, London– an address that quickly became {{associated}} with adventure and travel.|$|E
25|$|After joining up with {{managers}} Skip Taylor and John Hartmann, Canned Heat <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> permanent bassist in Larry Taylor, {{who joined}} in March 1967.

25|$|Viardot began {{composing}} {{when she}} was young, {{but it was never}} her intention to become a composer. Her compositions were written mainly as private pieces for her students with the intention of developing their vocal abilities. She did the bulk of her composing after her retirement at Baden-Baden. However, her works were of professional quality and Franz Liszt declared that, with Pauline Viardot, the world had <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> woman composer of genius.|$|E
40|$|There {{are good}} reasons why Jeremy Lin deserves the {{extensive}} news coverage he has received recently: a Harvard grad playing in the NBA, he had an indispensible role in the Knicks’ 9 - 2 run before losing to Miami on February 23, averaging 23. 9 points and 9. 2 assists in 11 games. Yet the extraordinary “Linsanity” displayed by the mass media {{seems to suggest that}} what makes Lin’s story so notable is what it says about perceptions of Asian masculinity. In Lin, the media has <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> Asian man...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile on {{the distant}} planet of Caldaris a deep space signal of the Iron Savior was received. The Caldarins - {{who are the}} heirs of Atlantis - left the dying Earth just before it was {{destroyed}} and after decades in space <b>finally</b> <b>founded</b> <b>a</b> new civilisation - the world of Caldaris. This all happened 300,000 years ago and during the millennia the Caldarins forgot about their origins. Only myths and legends give evidence of the lost kingdom. Thousands of expeditions returned to Caldaris from their quest {{of the old world}} without a clue.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in 1996 the Magoon Estate {{sold their}} {{development}} {{rights to the}} property where Hula’s Bar and Lei Stand was located. Law was forced {{to find a new}} location. After two years of looking, he <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> abandoned restaurant with an unparalleled view {{on the second floor of}} the Waikiki Grand Hotel which he would later dub “View Hula’s.” Despite some animosity from the old customers, the “View Hula’s” has proved to continue the Hula’s legacy and has been successfully operating since its doors opened in 1998.|$|R
25|$|An operatic {{version of}} The Wicked World {{had been on}} Gilbert's mind for some time. As early as 1897, he had {{suggested}} the idea to Helen Carte, the wife and partner of Richard D'Oyly Carte. Arthur Sullivan, André Messager, Jules Massenet, Liza Lehmann and Alexander Mackenzie, to whom he offered it in turn, all objected {{to the absence of}} a male chorus. Edward Elgar also turned it down, but did not say why. Gilbert <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> willing collaborator in Edward German.|$|E
25|$|The company <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> buyer in 1978, when Family Radio, {{owner of}} KEAR, {{struck a deal}} to {{purchase}} the station for $1 million. In accordance with FCC ownership guidelines at the time, Family Radio sold their station at 97.3 MHz to CBS Inc. for $2 million, and CBS in turn sold their lower-powered station at 98.9 MHz to a small local company, Golden Gate Radio, for $850,000. Golden Gate Radio decided to adopt the KMPX call letters and format for 98.9MHz, at least temporarily. The three-way switch occurred in September 1978, with 106.9 becoming the new location of KEAR's religious format.|$|E
25|$|The {{next several}} Chagatayid khans were {{appointed}} by Kaidu, who maintained a hold upon the khanate until his death. He <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> suitable khan in Baraq's son Duwa (1282–1307), {{who participated in}} Kaidu's wars with Kublai khan and his successors of the Yuan dynasty. The two rulers also were active against the Ilkhanate. After Kaidu's death in 1301, Duwa threw off his allegiance to his successor. He also made peace with the Yuan dynasty and paid tributes to the Yuan court; {{by the time of}} his death the Chagatai Khanate was a virtually independent state.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Parish Kirk of Cambuslang is lost in history, though it is {{traditionally}} {{supposed to have been}} founded by St Cadoc in the 6th century.

However, we hear of its first ecclesiastic about 1180 in relation to the Barony. Subsequently, there is a fairly full record of at least the names of Cambuslang clergy.|$|R

25|$|Grant <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> commander, General Philip Sheridan, {{aggressive}} {{enough to}} prevail in the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Sheridan was initially repelled at the Battle of New Market by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. John C. Breckinridge. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early {{in a series of}} battles, including a final decisive defeat at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the Shenandoah Valley, a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.|$|E
25|$|After {{nearly a}} month without signing a senior player, Matteo Rubin joined Parma from Torino on 6 August 2011 on a year-long loan deal, with the left-back {{unsatisfied}} with life at a Serie B club, although his time at Parma was eventually mutually agreed to be cut short in January. Further developments in the transfer market were not forthcoming until deadline day on 31 August. On that day, summer signing Fabio Borini and Francesco Lunardini were loaned to Roma and Gubbio, respectively. Beanpole striker Sergio Floccari was also loaned from Lazio for a fee of €1.5 million, as Parma <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> replacement on the target man front.|$|E
25|$|Although Jackson was {{internationally known}} and had {{moved up to}} the {{northern}} states, she still encountered racial prejudice.

Everywhere she went, the white owners and real estate agents would turn her away, claiming the house had already been sold or they changed their minds about selling. When she <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> house, the neighbors were not happy. Shots were fired at her windows and she had to contact the police for protection. White families started moving out and black families started moving in. Everything remained the same in her neighborhood except for the skin color of the residents.|$|E

50|$|However Jijé himself died in 1980 and Charlier openly {{declared}} that he would end the series Redbeard as he knew no one with the skills of Jijé and Hubinon to do the series justice. This however only made him more determined to look for an artist to take over Buck Danny. He <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> artist {{in the person of}} Francis Bergèse, who had previously drawn a string of aircraft-related strips with mixed success and openly admitted he started drawing comics because he grew up reading Buck Danny. Furthermore, Bergèse could imitate Hubinon's drawing style almost perfectly.|$|R
50|$|The Producers was so brazen in its satire {{that major}} studios would not touch it, nor would many exhibitors.

In 1968, Brooks received an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for the film, beating such writers as Stanley Kubrick and John Cassavetes. The Producers became a smash underground hit, first on the nationwide college circuit, then in revivals and on home video. Brooks later {{turned it into a}} musical, which became hugely successful on Broadway, receiving an unprecedented twelve Tony awards.|$|R
