5|$|Beginning on September7, {{hurricane}} watches {{were put}} in place for the Florida coast <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> West to Melbourne. The next day, the watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> West to Key Largo, with hurricane watches raised on the west coast northward to Fort Myers, and gale warnings issued <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> Largo to Vero Beach. By September11, hurricane warnings were in effect for southern Florida from Daytona Beach on the east coast to Cedar Key on the west coast, including Lake Okeechobee. Gale warnings were in place northward from Cedar Key to St. Marks, as well as from Daytona Beach northward to Savannah, Georgia. Evacuations in the Florida Keys disrupted traffic along the Overseas Highway. The Air Force evacuated 90Boeing B-47 Stratojets from Homestead Air Reserve Base. At Cape Canaveral, the threat of the storm caused the launching of two missiles to be postponed. Most flights out of Miami International Airport were canceled during the storm's approach. Officials closed schools in Miami and the Florida Keys, and recommended residents in low-lying areas of the Florida Keys and southwestern Florida to evacuate. Ultimately, about 12,000people in southern Florida sought refuge in storm shelters, two of which were damaged during the storm. In Miami-Dade County alone, there were 77storm shelters housing 10,000people.|$|E

5|$|Leo Kashida {{worked as}} an {{outsourced}} writer with Key on Tomoyo After, Little Busters! and Angel Beats. Chika Shirokiri, another outsourced writer who worked with Key on Little Busters!, also wrote the scenario for Kud Wafter. Manack and members of PMMK composed music in Little Busters!, and members of MintJam helped with arrangement. Magome Togoshi had been with Key since before Kanons release, working {{as one of the}} signature composers, but left the brand in October 2006 after contributing to the soundtrack of Little Busters!. Jun'ichi Shimizu composed all the music in Kud Wafter. Two outsourced writers worked on the scenario for Rewrite and its fan disc Rewrite Harvest festa!: Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, and Romeo Tanaka. Rewrite and Harvest festa! also featured three outsourced musical composers: Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki. Mizutsuki later returned to compose music for Harmonia. At the time Maeda stepped down as the main scenario writer, Yūto Tonokawa joined Key and first worked on the scenario in Little Busters!. Tonokawa later contributed to the scenario in Rewrite and Harvest festa!, but resigned <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> in 2015. Itaru Hinoue, one of Key's founding members, was Key's main artist and was the sole art director and character designer for six of Key's games. Hinoue resigned <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> in September 2016 after working on Harmonia.|$|E
5|$|On October1, a {{day before}} the {{hurricane}} moved ashore, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm signals <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> West, Florida to Norfolk, Virginia. Similar warnings were issued in the hours preceding the hurricane moving ashore. The advisories were credited with saving dozens of lives {{and millions of dollars}} in shipping cargo, due to advance warning for boats to remain ashore.|$|E

5|$|The Courtier-Liberal {{alliance}} held near absolute {{sway over}} Brazilian politics for several years. By 1847, however, PedroII had carefully removed {{members of the}} Courtier Faction <b>from</b> <b>key</b> positions. Aureliano Coutinho's influence was destroyed after the Emperor implicitly banned him from participation in political decision making. The monarch then moved against the Liberals. From 1844 through 1848, the country saw several successive Liberal cabinets, all plagued by internal divisions. PedroII called upon the Party of Order {{to form a new}} cabinet in September 1848.|$|E

5|$|The next European {{known to}} have visited the Key Biscayne area was Pedro Menéndez de Avilés. In 1565 his ship took refuge in Biscayne Bay from a storm. Relations were {{established}} with the Tequesta, and in 1567 a mission was established on the mainland across the bay <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne. The mission was abandoned three years later in 1570. No other mission was established on the mainland until 1743, but it was withdrawn a few months later.|$|E

5|$|The {{numerous}} ship wrecks {{that occurred}} along the southeast coast of Florida <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne to the Dry Tortugas was {{a cause for}} concern. Between the late 1840s and the late 1850s, more than 500 ships were wrecked on the Florida Reef. The Assistant United States Coast Surveyor reported that in the period from 1845 through 1849, almost one million (United States) dollars worth of vessels and cargoes were lost on the reef.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued {{at some point}} during the existence of the cyclone for the west coast of Florida <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> West to Apalachicola. Additionally, a {{tropical storm}} warning was put in place for the east coast from Vero Beach northward to Fernandina Beach. Before the arrival of Marco, elementary schools were closed on the three barrier islands in Lee County. Florida governor Bob Martinez ordered the closure of state offices in the Tampa Bay area, and also decided not to open the University of South Florida and nearby community colleges. Public schools were not opened on the day of the storm's passage in Manatee and Sarasota counties, though most other schools remained open. As the storm tracked northward, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of Georgia. A flood watch was later issued for western portions of the Carolinas and for high elevations in Virginia and West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Advisories, {{along with}} {{coordination}} between the National Observatory at Havana and U.S. Weather Bureau, were credited for the reduced deaths in Cuba. Weather observations were also readily available from Cuban meteorological stations. On October 25, the cyclone's hurricane force winds {{were expected to}} remain off the Florida east coast, although gale-force winds were anticipated from the Florida Keys to Palm Beach, Florida. Accordingly, storm warnings were issued <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> West, Florida to Vero Beach, Florida. Military aircraft were transported to safer locations, while watercraft were stored in harbors and rivers. Hotels and resorts were boarded up on the barrier islands. The Bahamas received warnings {{well in advance of}} the hurricane. The hurricane turned quickly to the east, which reduced the threat to Bimini, Cat Cay, Grand Bahama, and the Abaco Islands.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin {{worked to}} deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling {{he had turned}} against the South. Douglas contended that {{although}} the Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T. Field of New Jersey {{started an}} {{enterprise}} {{to develop the}} Florida coast <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne to Jupiter by clearing native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach dunes, and planting coconuts. Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked coconuts from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris). As {{a result of their}} efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront land from the Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70cents an acre.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{tensions}} {{within the}} team and from publisher 2K Games continued during the development process. According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful {{of some of the}} more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce his vision of BioShock. 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role player game hybrid they set out for. Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team. Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted <b>from</b> <b>key</b> design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts for the Medical Pavilion level that {{he was in charge of}} at that time. Near the anticipated completion date, 2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish up the game, extending the current crunch time the studio was already under.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the storm's first {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings beginning on August29 for areas of Florida's east coast from Palm Beach south to Key West, while storm warnings were issued <b>from</b> <b>Key</b> West to Boca Grande on the peninsula's western coast. Electrical power was purposely stopped in Miami as a precautionary measure {{prior to the}} storm's landfall. Two Red Cross officials were sent to Miami to monitor the area during the storm's passage. Other relief agencies were also preparing supplies {{in the event of}} an emergency. In Pahokee and Belle Glade, an estimated 2,000people evacuated to Okeechobee, fearing a repeat of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} next {{considered}} in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition <b>from</b> <b>key</b> Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed. The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it {{at the expense of}} the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests. Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.|$|E
