25|$|During the Second World War from 1941 to 1946 {{he served}} in the Royal Air Force as a radar {{specialist}} and was involved in the early-warning radar defence system, which contributed to the RAF's success during the Battle of Britain. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (GCA) radar, as documented in the semi-autobiographical Glide Path, his only non-science-fiction novel. Although GCA did not see much practical use during the war, it proved vital to the Berlin Airlift of 1948–1949 after several years of development. Clarke initially served in the ranks, and was a corporal instructor on radar at No. 2 Radio School, RAF Yatesbury in Wiltshire. He was commissioned as a pilot officer (technical branch) on 27 May 1943. He was promoted flying officer on 27 November 1943. He was appointed chief training instructor at RAF Honiley in Warwickshire and was demobilised with the rank of flight lieutenant.|$|E

2500|$|In aviation, {{aircraft}} can {{be equipped}} with radar devices that warn of aircraft or other obstacles in or approaching their path, display weather information, and give accurate altitude readings. The first commercial device fitted to aircraft was a 1938 Bell Lab unit on some United Air Lines aircraft. Aircraft can land in fog at airports equipped with radar-assisted <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> systems in which the plane's position is observed on radar screens by operators who radio landing instructions to the pilot, maintaining the aircraft on a defined approach path to the runway. [...] Military fighter aircraft are usually fitted with air-to-air targeting radars, to detect and target enemy aircraft.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{know-how}} available in Germany in the sectors of 'Automation and Robotics' (A and R), 'Rendez-vous and Capture' (RvC), and {{taking into account}} the experience gathered during the Rotex experiment on D- 2, the testing and demonstration of a technology carrier for inspection, maintenance and repair of satellites in geostationary orbit was investigated {{within the framework of the}} ESS (experimental satellite-based servicing system). The superior objective consists in establishing a satellite-based servicing system for commercial applications, e. g. for communication satellites. The target of ESS testing and demonstration are objects in geostationary orbit. The selection of the geostationary orbit, on one hand, has operational reasons. Because of the theoretically uninterrupted contact time/visibility, it is possible to extend the <b>ground-controlled</b> maneuvers during <b>approach</b> to the target satellite as well as the maintenance and repair activities over several hours, while only few minutes are available for such tasks in a low earth orbit.

2500|$|Funding was {{increased}} further from 1951, {{as it was}} considered as an advance on common alliance infrastructure, resulting in a further NOK5.5 million for Bodø. The following year the government decided to acquire the F-84 Thunderjet, which required a [...] longer runway than was being installed. Civilian traffic commenced on 12 May 1952. The first detachment of aircraft were stationed during the exercise Main Brace from 13 to 25 September, before the base was completed. Parliament decided in 1952 that Bodø would become the main air station for Northern Norway and that Air Force Command for Northern Norway would move from Bardufoss on 1 July 1953. The first aircraft to be stationed at Bodø was a Bell 47 in May 1954, and two new de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters from July. Bodø was found ready to host squadrons in 1955, and was allocated the 331 and 334 Squadrons of F-84Gs previously based at Sola Air Station. The 334 moved to Bodø in mid July, while 331 moved in late August. A <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> system was installed at Bodø in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{a member}} of the squadron, Lt. Col. Howard Dallman, was awarded the Air Force Cross for his heroism at Khe Sanh.

[...] On 5 February he was on a mission to transport a load of ammunition and a medical evacuation team to Khe Sanh. [...] The weather was forecast to be at the minimum for an instrument approach, which made landing at the mountain-girded strip a challenge. The challenge was increased when the crew discovered that Khe Sanh's <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> radar was out of commission. [...] The crew's navigator. Maj. Gerald Johnson, was confident he could make a successful airborne radar approach, and the plane broke out of the overcast at three hundred feet above the airstrip. As the C-130 came to a stop, it was hit by a shell that ignited ammunition boxes in the cargo compartment. The crew immediately began fighting the fire while Dallman began backing up the plane to an area {{at the far end of}} the runway, where if the ammunition exploded it would not destroy the runway and support facilities nearby. [...] The crew, with help from the Khe Sanh fire truck extinguished the fire and helped offload the ammo boxes.|$|E

5000|$|Loomis {{also made}} a {{significant}} contribution to the development of <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> technology, a precursor of today's instrument-landing systems that use radar to enable ground controllers to [...] "talk down" [...] aircraft pilots and help them to land safely when poor visibility makes visual landings difficult or impossible.

5000|$|Glide Path is a {{novel by}} Arthur C. Clarke, {{published}} in 1963.

It is based on Clarke's own wartime service with the Royal Air Force, during which he worked on the GCA project.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} labor-intensive nature—one GCA {{controller}} is normally required for each aircraft on final approach—GCAs {{are no longer}} in widespread use at civilian airports, and are being discontinued at many military bases. However, air traffic controllers at some locations in the United States are required to maintain currency in their use, while the Belgian Air Force still uses the PAR for ground-controlled approaches on a daily basis. NATO has kept GCA active while civil aviation adopted the instrument landing system (ILS). Global Positioning System (GPS) based approaches that provide both lateral and vertical guidance are coming into widespread use, with approach minima as good as, or nearly as good as, GCA or ILS. Modern ILS and GPS approaches eliminate the possibility of human error from the controller, and can serve many aircraft at the same time. The <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> is useful when the approaching aircraft is not equipped with sophisticated navigation aids, and may also become a life saver when an aircraft's on-board navigation aids are inoperative, as long as one communication radio works. Sometimes the PAR-based <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> is also requested by qualified pilots when they are dealing with an emergency on board to lighten their workload. In the United States, instrument approaches must be monitored by a PAR (if one exists with a coinciding final approach course) during certain condition such as times of darkness or low weather depending upon the controlling agency (USAF, U.S. Army, USN or FAA) or upon pilot request.|$|E
50|$|In January 1953 the 559th was redesignated as a {{strategic}} fighter squadron. In May it deployed to Chitose Air Base, Japan for approximately 90 days. The principal purpose of the deployment was to provide training for the wing and enable it, while operating {{as a part of}} the Northern Area Air Defense Command, to augment the Japanese Air Defense Force. On 15 May replaced the 508th Strategic Fighter Wing on rotation in Japan. On 12 June the commanding officer of the 559th Squadron, Lieutenant Colonel Paul M. Hall, was killed in an airplane crash while making a <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach.</b> The squadron redeployed to Bergstrom Air Force Base in August.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> is {{the oldest}} air traffic {{technique}} to fully implement radar to service a plane. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It requires close communication between ground-based air traffic controllers and pilots in approaching aircraft. Only one pilot is guided at a time (max. 2 under certain circumstances). The controllers monitor dedicated precision approach radar systems, to determine the precise course and altitude of approaching aircraft. The controllers then provide verbal instructions by radio to the pilots to guide them to a landing. The instructions include both descent rate (glidepath) and heading (course) corrections necessary to follow the correct approach path.|$|E
50|$|Alfred Lee Loomis (November 4, 1887 - August 11, 1975) was an American attorney, {{investment}} banker, philanthropist, scientist/physicist, {{inventor of}} the LORAN Long Range Navigation System, and a lifelong patron of scientific research. He established the Loomis Laboratory in Tuxedo Park, New York, and {{his role in the}} development of radar and the atomic bomb is considered vital to the Allied victory in World War II. He invented the Aberdeen Chronograph for measuring muzzle velocities, contributed significantly (perhaps critically, according to Luis Alvarez) to the development of a <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> technology for aircraft, and participated in preliminary meetings of the Manhattan Project. Loomis also made contributions to biological instrumentation. Working with Edmund Newton Harvey he co-invented the microscope centrifuge, and pioneered techniques for electroencephalography. In 1937, he discovered the sleep K-complex brainwave.|$|E
5000|$|In {{aviation}} a <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (GCA), {{is a type}} {{of service}} provided by air-traffic controllers whereby they guide aircraft to a safe landing, including in adverse weather conditions, based on primary radar images. Most commonly a GCA uses information from either a Precision Approach Radar (PAR, for precision approaches with vertical, glidepath guidance) or an Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR, providing a non-precision Surveillance radar approach with no glidepath guidance). The term GCA may refer to any type of ground radar guided approach such as a PAR, PAR without glideslope or ASR. When both vertical and horizontal guidance from the PAR is given, the approach is termed a precision approach. If no PAR glidepath is given, even if PAR equipment is used for lateral guidance, it is considered a non-precision approach ...|$|E

50|$|Civilian Air Traffic Controllers' {{licensing}} is standardized {{by international}} agreement through ICAO. Many countries have Air Traffic Control schools, academies or colleges, often {{operated by the}} incumbent provider of air traffic services in that country, but sometimes privately. These institutions are structured to provide training to individuals without any prior air traffic control experience. At the completion of academic training, the graduating student will be granted an Air Traffic Control license, which will include one or more Ratings. These are sub-qualifications denoting the air traffic control discipline or disciplines in which the person has been trained. ICAO defines five such ratings: Area (procedural), Area Radar, Approach (procedural), Approach Radar and Aerodrome. In the United States, controllers may train in several similar specialties: Tower, <b>Ground-Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA), Terminal Radar Control, or En route Control (both radar and non-radar). This phase of training takes between 6 months and several years.|$|E
