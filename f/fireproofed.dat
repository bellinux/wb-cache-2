This paper summarized the research status methods and distinguishing features of <b>fireproof</b> materials in China {{which would make}} progress to our research on <b>fireproof</b> materials. The Research of <b>Fireproof</b> Materials in China With the rapid development of social economy in recent years, many monster high-rise buildings spring {{up all over the}} country. The Chinese technologist gradually realized the importance of <b>fireproof</b> materials of fire accident prevention accompanied more and more fire accidents. According to the literature on <b>fireproof</b> materials recently, the research of <b>fireproof</b> materials divide into three directions approximately: the classes of <b>fireproof</b> materials, the principle of <b>fireproof</b> materials and the special applications of <b>fireproof</b> materials in different fields [1] 1. 1 The research on class of <b>fireproof</b> materials classified various materials which include HPL(Pecorative high-Pressure Lcminate), fire resistant doorsets, fire-resisting wood windows, fire roller shutter, Anti-fire Glass, <b>fireproof</b> storage box, fire-retardant coatings and fire-proof sealing materials. 1. 2 The research on the principle of <b>fireproof</b> materials analyzed the flameproof procedures based on principle and prevention measures for preventing even holding back fires though experimentations and theoretical analysis [2] 1. 3 The applied research of dedicated <b>fireproof</b> materials studied the application of <b>fireproof</b> materials in different situation. In accordance with different situation and different environmental needs, certain differences also existed in the selection of <b>fireproof</b> materials [3 - 4]. The research had revealed the particularity, advantages of various <b>fireproof</b> materials and different application or selection in different situation. The special research of Chinese <b>fireproof</b> materials in many different fields would be more professional in future...|$|R

The Army had refused to release it to them. The circus had instead waterproofed their canvas using an older method of paraffin dissolved in gasoline and painted onto the canvas. The waterproofing worked, but as had been repeatedly shown it was horribly flammable. Circus management was found to be negligent and several Ringling executives served sentences in jail. Ringling Brothers' management set aside all profits for the next ten years to pay the claims filed against the show by the City of Hartford and the survivors of the fire.|$|E
25|$|Another {{round of}} arsons in 1961 and 1962 {{prompted}} {{the creation of}} the Agassiz Mountain Prison as a satellite of BC Penitentiary. This prison was specifically designed to house Doukhobor prisoners. Since the Doukhobors refused to do any work while incarcerated, there were no work programs and no privileges for the inmates at the new institution. The entire prison was designed to avoid incendiarism, with everything, including furniture, being made of concrete or metal. All fabrics, such as clothing and bedding, were <b>fireproofed.</b> The leaders of the Sons of Freedom were kept segregated, as were the younger men. The inmates began a hunger strike in August 1962, which carried on for over a year and resulted in one death due to malnutrition, despite forced-feedings.|$|E
500|$|The early skyscrapers were a {{range of}} tall, {{commercial}} buildings built between 1884 and 1939, predominantly in the American cities of New York City and Chicago. Cities in the United States were traditionally made up of low-rise buildings, but significant economic growth after the Civil War and increasingly intensive use of urban land encouraged the development of taller buildings beginning in the 1870s. Technological improvements enabled the construction of <b>fireproofed</b> iron-framed structures with deep foundations, equipped with new inventions such as the elevator and electric lighting. These made it both technically and commercially viable {{to build a new}} class of taller buildings, the first of which, Chicago's [...] tall Home Insurance Building, opened in 1884. Their numbers grew rapidly, and by 1888 they were being labelled skyscrapers.|$|E

The problem of which <b>fireproofing</b> material should be choose and how to make <b>fireproofing</b> measure needs to resolve. <b>Fireproofing</b> test is make for slabs strengthened by carbon fiber sheet bonded with the adhesive protected by Thick-typed <b>Fireproof</b> Coating for steel structure (TFCSS) and Thick-typed <b>Fireproof</b> Coating for tunnel (TFCT). Typical damage state of the two typical coating is compared during and after fire, Temperature field of slab specimen is analyzed, and <b>fireproofing</b> effect is compared. The test results indicate that, steel wire mesh in the middle of coating layer can prevent coating from falling fully, so steel wire mesh is necessary for <b>fireproofing</b> coat which is not too thick. under the protection of <b>fireproof</b> coating with proper construction, TFCT and TFCSS can supply effective <b>fireproofing</b> protection for carbon fiber sheet, but the former is inferior to the latter because the latter is easier to drop and crack in fire. So, TFCT with steel wire mesh can supply the most effective protection for slabs strengthened by carbon fiber sheet bonded with the adhesive...|$|R
