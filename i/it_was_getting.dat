5|$|At 14:45, {{covered by}} an {{artillery}} barrage and machine-gun fire, the Turkish troops counter-attacked again. The regiment's machine gunners returned fire {{and for a}} short time the battle became a machine-gun engagement. During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles, to the right, had occupied a prominent hill, but were under heavy fire. To support them, the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents, which they caught {{in the bottom of a}} valley, with enfilade fire. Then in front of the regiment a fresh Turkish battalion was sent to assault them. In some places, the Turkish force got close enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment's defences. These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill, which was then occupied by the Turkish troops, bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment's positions, which by now were becoming untenable. At first, messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through. Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground, recapturing the hill. This brought the rest of the Turkish line into range of the squadron's guns. Confronted by the new threat, the Turkish troops retired back to their starting point. McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder, forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment. By then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> dark and the only Turkish offensive action was an artillery bombardment. Instead of attacking, the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines. Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy-four wounded. The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by the Turkish troops.|$|E
25|$|Rising Storm {{was mostly}} well {{received}} by critics. In one review by Booklist, the reviewer calls the novel suspenseful, also noting {{how the story}} echoes the journey to maturity. Another review, by VOYA, noted that while the books lacks humor and depth, there was still appeal in the hidden world of the warrior cats. A BookLoons review particularly praised the ending, calling it a cliffhanger. However, Children's Literature was not as positive, saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> hard to remember all of the characters' relatives and leaders.|$|E

Victoria had planned to study at Uppsala University, but after intense media speculation and public discussion when pictures of an evidently emaciated Victoria in sleeveless dresses at the Order of the Innocence’s ball and the gala dinner for the incoming state visit from Austria surfaced in April 1997, the Royal Court decided to confirm what was feared.|$|E

25|$|Although the Company was {{becoming}} increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> clearer {{day by day}} that the Company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. Opinion amongst {{the members of the}} British Parliament urged the government to control the activities of the Company. The Company's financial position was also bad and it had to apply for a loan from Parliament. Seizing this opportunity, the Parliament passed the Regulating Act (also known as East India Company Act) in 1773. The act set down regulations to control the Company Board and created the position of the Governor General. Warren Hastings was appointed the first Governor-General. In 1784 Pitt's India Act made the Company subordinate to the British Government.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry.

25|$|The {{treasury}} was his portfolio, {{but he did}} not recognise {{the financial}} disaster that could result from US government actions. Sterling was draining out of the Bank of England at an alarming rate, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> worse. The canal was blocked by the Egyptians, and most oil shipments were delayed as tankers had to go around Africa. The US government refused any financial help until Britain withdrew its forces from Egypt. When he did realise this, he changed his mind and called for withdrawal on US terms, while exaggerating the financial crisis. On 6 November Macmillan informed the Cabinet that Britain had lost $370m in {{the first few days of}} November alone. Faced with Macmillan's prediction of doom, the cabinet had no choice but to accept these terms and withdraw. The Canal remained in Egyptian hands, and Nasser's government continued its support of Arab and African national resistance movements opposed to the British and French presence in the region and on the continent.|$|E

25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E

500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E

500|$|They had {{problems}} during sequencing {{and had to}} repair the songs, taking some time. Pettibone had to keep things moving {{as fast as possible}} as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. At this point, as far as the music went, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> a little melancholy. However, as Pettibone explained, Madonna's stories directed the creative direction of the songs into deeply personal territory as they were more serious and intense. Madonna left the album's production to work on her next film Body of Evidence in Oregon. Shortly after, Pettibone started on a song called [...] "Goodbye to Innocence", which was not working. He further commented that he made a new bass line for the track. When Madonna went to record her vocals for [...] "Goodbye to Innocence", she started singing Little Willie John's song [...] "Fever" [...] instead of singing the original words. They decided to record it, as they felt it sounded good. As they did not know the words, Madonna called Seymour Stein from Sire Records, and within an hour, they had the Peggy Lee version, and the original version of the song. This song was the last to be recorded for the album, in August 1992, and it was finished within a month later.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{composition}} begun after Strange Music label-mate ¡Mayday! sent Tech N9ne {{the song}} with their and Kendall Morgan's vocals on it. He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E
500|$|While {{designing}} {{sound for}} the musical Hair, Dugan began {{to appreciate the}} human operator's inability to act quickly enough to control multiple microphones. He saw the show's audio mixing person [...] "working rotary knobs for 16 area mics, 9 hand mics, and 10 mics in the band". Dugan thought that a microphone should not be turned on unless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> some worthwhile signal, {{more than just the}} room ambiance. His frustration with microphone mixing led him to experiment for a few years with microphone signals controlled automatically by voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs), finally developing the [...] "Dugan Music System", shown to the AES at their 49th convention, held in New York in 1974. This system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby the total gain was divided between all active microphones. The microphones were [...] "continuously and automatically adjusted" [...] by a set of VCAs to bring each microphone up or down in the mix, based on how much signal it was sending relative to the signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from the other microphones. Dugan's patent application for a [...] "Control Apparatus for Sound Reinforcement Systems" [...] was accepted and published on June 4, 1974. This was the first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm, the basis for all of Dugan's later systems.|$|E

500|$|The {{visits to}} Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and {{ultimately}} settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band {{and joined the}} Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so {{he was able to}} play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> {{in the way of his}} musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that [...] "I'm traveling 90 percent of the time. I can live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport". A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking a couple of years before that; Farmer [...] "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} story, Uchikoshi {{made use of}} what he calls the [...] "inductive {{composition}} method", where a setting is created first, after which one thinks about a core to the story {{that can be used to}} make the setting work. He did not recommend this way of writing, as he saw it as gamble that might not have resulted in an interesting story. This is in contrast to the deductive composition method, where a core story is thought of first, after which a setting is [...] "deduced", that matches the core. As an example of inductive composition used, Uchikoshi did not initially think up the story's [...] "main trick", and instead created two protagonists only because he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> stale with single-protagonist stories in visual novels, after which he thought about how to make two protagonists interesting. The writers only put little effort into hiding the 17-year gap between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes, writing each day of the story casually without a particular plan in mind. Rather, it took special effort to make it seem convincing when the game's secrets were revealed, with hints toward the truth added throughout the story, such as Tsugumi acting more suspicious when playing as the Kid due to having already experienced the events of Takeshi's route, or slight differences between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes due to the characters not being able to perfectly recreate events. While Coco was planned from the beginning as the character who knew the truth, Uchikoshi did not come up with the idea of leaving her on the bottom of the ocean until during the writing of the script.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, {{a scheme}} for {{improving}} {{a section of}} the river between Littleton Road and Adelphi Weir in Salford for boating purposes was included in Greater Manchester Policy Committee's capital programme for 1981/82.
