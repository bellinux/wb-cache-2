500|$|In October Robert Dudley {{returned}} to court, many believed, [...] "in great hope {{to marry the}} Queen". Elizabeth's affection and favour towards him was undiminished, and, importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert, she declared the inquest had shown [...] "the matter … to be contrary to which was reported" [...] and to [...] "neither touch his honesty nor her honour." [...] However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, {{which seems to have}} convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had no illusions about his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: [...] "God's will be done; and I wish he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me." [...] In September 1561, a month after the coroner's verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley's principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.|$|E
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E

6000|$|... "You <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> what I shall be," [...] she said. [...] "The sin be with you. For several weary {{years you}} <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> miserable. Now you <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> wicked." ...|$|R

60|$|Upon my soul, your unseasonable {{interruption}} <b>has</b> almost <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{forget what}} I {{was going to}} say; it <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> grow warm, and drop into poetry.|$|R
60|$|And then I {{suddenly}} got it. I {{suppose it}} was fatigue that <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> so slow to apprehend the nub.|$|E
60|$|This I {{said because}} my {{hours in the}} boat <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> humble, also because the words came to my lips.|$|E
60|$|Everything that it <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{so happy}} to see in her face died away. She was once more wan and anxious.|$|E

60|$|Then Ray looked {{straight}} into my face, and the colour flamed there, for I saw now why he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> his confidant.|$|E

6000|$|This phrase, in its {{senseless}} arrogance, quite cured me of {{the temporary}} weakness which <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> relax my tone and aspect. She rattled on: ...|$|E

60|$|But {{he looked}} so serious after he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> that light answer, that the Major raised his eyebrows at me and I raised mine at the Major.|$|E
60|$|My work <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{thoroughly}} tired, and, as a consequence, it did {{not take}} me long to get to sleep when once I was in my bunk.|$|E
