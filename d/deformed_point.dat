40|$|Registration of RGB-D data using visual {{features}} is often influenced by {{errors in the}} transformation of {{visual features}} to 3 D space {{as well as the}} random error of individual 3 D points. In a long sequence, these errors accumulate and lead to inaccurate and <b>deformed</b> <b>point</b> clouds, particularly in situations where loop closing is not feasible. We present an epipolar search method for accurate transformation of the keypoints from 2 D to 3 D space, and define weights for the 3 D points based on the theoretical random error of depth measurements. Our results show that the epipolar search method results in more accurate 3 D correspondences. We also demonstrate that weighting the 3 D points improves the accuracy of sensor pose estimates along the trajectory...|$|E
40|$|A new more {{efficient}} algorithm for recognition of projectively <b>deformed</b> <b>point</b> sets is presented. It supposes {{the type of}} projective transformation, where the orientation of a triangle is preserved. First, convex layers of two compared sets are computed and left-tangents are found. If their structures are different, then an advanced algorithm is used. It creates the new structure of one set according to the other set. If the numbers of the points in the convex layers differ from each other, then the suitable points are moved to other layers, and if the left-tangents do not link the corresponding points, then their structure is corrected. The suitable combination of optimal structure correction criteria was investigated by a numerical experiment, the angle criteria were found as the best. Finally, five-point cross ratios of sequences of the points from both sets are computed and compared...|$|E

LocataLites {{can be installed}} in locations to ensure optimal network geometry for a certain coverage area. With batch least squares processing, millimetre precision is achievable and thus provides an opportunity to address shortcomings of current deformation monitoring systems. A prototype of a Locata Deformation Monitoring System (LDMS) has been developed, consisting of four fundamental parts, namely data acquisition, quality control and validation, coordinate solution, and deformation monitoring. This paper focuses on the mathematical models. To validate the feasibility of this system, simulation tests and a deformation monitoring field trial have been conducted.

40|$|Tissue {{deformation}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} difficulties in the registration of pre-operative and intra-operative data. Vision based techniques have shown the potential to simultaneously track the endoscope and recover a sparse 3 D structure of the tissue. However, most of such methods either assume a static environment or require the tissue organ to have a periodic motion such as respiration. To deal with the general tissue deformation, a new framework is proposed in this paper with the ability of simultaneous stereoscope tracking, 3 D reconstruction and <b>deforming</b> <b>point</b> detection in the Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) environment. First, we adopt a Parallel Tracking and Mapping (PTAM) framework and extend it for the use of stereoscope in MIS. Second, this newly extended framework enables the detection of <b>deforming</b> <b>points</b> without restricted periodic motion model assumptions. Our proposed method has been evaluated on a phantom model, and in vivo experiments demonstrate its capability for accurate tracking in nearly real time speed as well as 3 D reconstruction with hundreds of 3 D points. Those experiments have shown that our method is robust towards tissue deformation and hence have promising potential for information integration by registration with pre-operative data...|$|R

40|$|Grid-based {{measurement}} {{can facilitate}} metrology and inspection of flexible electronics manufacturing. Multiple fundamental difficulties, however, {{arise in the}} large-area and full-field deformation measurement of deformable grid patterns including noise, occlusions, and artifacts. This paper addresses {{one of the key}} issues in deformation measurement: the registration and matching of deformed grid patterns. The emphasis is on accurate and robust periodicity tracing registration and constellation matching algorithms for grid pattern fidelity. The registration algorithm uses deviation metrics in deformed grids to estimate global translation, rotation and scaling; the matching algorithm uses the constellation reference grid to mine buried <b>deformed</b> <b>point</b> patterns. Using synthetic data, the validity of the registration algorithm is proved by registering noisy deformed grid patterns with various distortion scales and transformations; the validity of the matching algorithm is proved by matching deformed grid point patterns with various distortion scales, extra point rates and missing point rates. Compared to established non-rigid registration and point pattern matching algorithms, our algorithms demonstrate higher speed, sub-pixel accuracy and robustness in the matching of highly-deformed and noisy grids.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a free-form {{deformation}} (FFD) approach to manipulate point-sampled surface. Our approach provides users the powerful free-form deformation directly on point-sampled surface. In the preprocessing, we use a robust extension of hierarchical clustering scheme to partition a point-sampled model into clusters, fit a moving least square (MLS) surface to each of them, and define a valid polygonal area on the base domain of the MLS surface. At run time, we apply the conventional free-form deformation technique on these clusters. While users adjust the grids of the FFD lattice, we propose a novel interpolation method, which responses to the curvature variation during object deformation, to curve the base domain of the MLS surfaces of those clusters concerned. Finally, we resample the new base domain to produce the <b>deformed</b> <b>point</b> set model. The proposed technique is very intuitive, effective and easy to implement. With this technique, high frequency details from the original point-set surface can be maintained well on the deformed surface and several interesting deformed results of point-sampled models are demonstrated to verify the proposed scheme...|$|E
40|$|Moving-boundary {{problems}} arise in numerous important physical phenomena, and often form complex shapes during their evolution. The ability {{to track the}} interface in such cases in two dimensions is well established. However, modifying the grid representing the interface as it evolves in three-dimensional space introduces additional issues. In the current work, three-dimensional interfaces are represented by adaptive unstructured grids. The grids are restructured and refined based on the shape {{and size of the}} triangular elements in the grid that forms the interfaces. As the interface <b>deforms,</b> <b>points</b> are automatically added to ensure that the accuracy of interface representation remains consistent. Results are presented to show how complex interface features, including surface curvatures and normals, can be captured by modifying an existing method that uses an approximation to the Dupin indicatrix...|$|R
40|$|The affine Weyl group acts on the cohomology (with compact support) of affine Springer fibers (local Springer theory) and of {{parabolic}} Hitchin fibers (global Springer theory). In this paper, we {{show that}} in both situations, {{the action of the}} center of the group algebra of the affine Weyl group (the spherical part) factors through the action of the component group of the relevant centralizers. In the situation of affine Springer fibers, this partially verifies a conjecture of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson and Bezrukavnikov-Varshavsky. We first prove this result for the global Springer action, and then deduce the result for the local Springer action from that of the global one. The argument strongly relies on the fact that we can <b>deform</b> <b>points</b> on a curve, hence giving an example of using global Springer theory to solve more classical problems.

In this {{paper we propose a}} new sparse (1 +ε) -spanner with O(n/εd) edges, where ε is a specified parameter. The key property of this spanner is that it can be efficiently maintained under dynamic insertion or deletion of points, as well as under continuous motion of the points in both the kinetic data structures setting and in the more realistic blackbox displacement model we introduce. Our deformable spanner succinctly encodes all proximity information in a <b>deforming</b> <b>point</b> cloud, giving us efficient kinetic algorithms for problems such as the closest pair, the near neighbors of all points, approximate nearest neighbor search (aka approximate Voronoi diagram), well-separated pair decompositions, and approximate k-centers...|$|R
