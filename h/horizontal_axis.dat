5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), {{the philosopher}} Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{was the first}} in China to {{describe}} the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{turbines}} are {{devices that}} convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured {{in a wide}} range of <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> and vertical axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E
5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning forward and back, and by rotating on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis.</b> The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning forward and back to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, hang gliding, is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land {{as close as possible to}} the center of a gray square target.|$|E

25|$|The eigenstates of spin {{about the}} {{vertical}} axis are not simultaneously eigenstates of spin about the <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis,</b> so this atom has equal probability of being {{found to have}} either value of spin about the <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis.</b> As described in the section above, measuring the spin about the <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> can allow an atom which was spin up to become spin down: measuring its spin about the <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> collapses its wave function {{into one of the}} eigenstates of this measurement, which means it is no longer in an eigenstate of spin about the vertical axis, so can take either value.|$|E

50|$|The axis of {{rotation}} for <b>horizontal</b> single <b>axis</b> tracker is <b>horizontal</b> {{with respect to the}} ground.The posts {{at either end of the}} axis {{of rotation}} of a <b>horizontal</b> single <b>axis</b> tracker can be shared between trackers to lower the installation cost. Field layouts with <b>horizontal</b> single <b>axis</b> trackers are very flexible. The simple geometry means that keeping all of the axes of rotation parallel to one another is all that is required for appropriately positioning the trackers with respect to one another. Appropriate spacing can maximize the ratio of energy production to cost, this being dependent upon local terrain and shading conditions and the time-of-day value of the energy produced. Backtracking is one means of computing the disposition of panels. Horizontal trackers typically have the face of the module oriented parallel to the {{axis of rotation}}. As a module tracks, it sweeps a cylinder that is rotationally symmetric around the axis of rotation. In single <b>axis</b> <b>horizontal</b> trackers, a long horizontal tube is supported on bearings mounted upon pylons or frames. The axis of the tube is on a north-south line. Panels are mounted upon the tube, and the tube will rotate on its axis to track the apparent motion of the Sun through the day.|$|R
25|$|The {{graticule}} is {{a grid of}} squares {{that serve}} as reference marks for measuring the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1cm grid with closer tick marks (often at 2mm) on the centre vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis.</b> One expects to see ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (<b>horizontal</b> <b>axis).</b> Frequency can also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its reciprocal.|$|E

The initial position of the <b>horizontal</b> principle <b>axis</b> and the vertical principle axis and the rotation center are obtained using least square method. The <b>horizontal</b> principle <b>axis</b> is acted as a right-angle side and initial enclosing rectangle is obtained. Instead of rotating the image object, we only rotate two principle axes by rational rotational direction, region and interval until the minimal circumscribed rectangle is found.

50|$|Single axis {{trackers}} {{have one}} {{degree of freedom}} that acts as an axis of rotation. The axis of rotation of single axis trackers is typically aligned along a true North meridian. It is possible to align them in any cardinal direction with advanced tracking algorithms. There are several common implementations of single axis trackers. These include <b>horizontal</b> single <b>axis</b> trackers (HSAT), <b>horizontal</b> single <b>axis</b> tracker with tilted modules (HTSAT), vertical single axis trackers (VSAT), tilted single axis trackers (TSAT) and polar aligned single axis trackers (PSAT). The orientation of the module {{with respect to the}} tracker axis is important when modeling performance.|$|R

25|$|Many {{amusement}} rides provide rotation. A Ferris wheel has {{a horizontal}} central axis, and parallel axes for each gondola, where the rotation is opposite, by gravity or mechanically. As a result, {{at any time}} {{the orientation of the}} gondola is upright (not rotated), just translated. The tip of the translation vector describes a circle. A carousel provides rotation about a vertical axis. Many rides provide a combination of rotations about several axes. In Chair-O-Planes the rotation about the vertical axis is provided mechanically, while the rotation about the <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> is due to the centripetal force. In roller coaster inversions the rotation about the <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> is one or more full cycles, where inertia keeps people in their seats.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to inventing the first street lights in Copenhagen, Rømer also invented the meridian circle, the altazimuth, and the passage instrument (also {{known as the}} transit instrument, a type of meridian circle whose <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis</b> is not fixed in the east-west direction).|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{it can be}} said that, {{the amount}} of good X1 that the {{consumer}} consumes will increase, with an increase in the income of the consumer. Thus, the income–consumption curve for the perfect substitutes X1 and X2 will be the <b>horizontal</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The mix {{envelope}} for a two-oscillator patch {{structure is}} arranged on a <b>horizontal</b> line or <b>axis,</b> and is interpreted as one-dimensional vector synthesis.

A patch's mix envelope can be looped for a finite or indefinite {{amount of time}} as well as modulated by controllers.
