40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{location}} errors, geographic routing - {{using a combination of}} greedy forwarding and face routing - has been shown to work correctly and efficiently. The effects of location errors on geographic routing have not been studied before. In this work we provide a detailed analysis of the effects of location errors on the correctness and performance of geographic routing in static sensor networks. First, we perform a micro-level behavioral analysis to identify the possible protocol error scenarios and their conditions and bounds. Then, we present results from an extensive simulation study of GPSR and GHT to quantify the performance degradation due to location errors. Our results show that even small location errors (of 10 % of the radio range or less) can in fact lead to <b>incorrect</b> (non-recoverable) geographic <b>routing</b> with noticeable performance degradation. We then introduce a simple modification for face routing that eliminates probable errors and leads to near perfect performance...|$|R

50|$|The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} distance-vector routing {{protocols}} which employ the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support. A hop count of 16 is considered an infinite distance and the route is considered unreachable. RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown mechanisms to prevent <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> information from being propagated.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies show}} that current inter-domain routing protocol, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), is {{vulnerable}} to various attacks. Previously, the major concern about BGP security is that malicious BGP routers can arbitrarily falsify BGP routing messages and spread out <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> information. However, one type of attack, which we term as the selective dropping attack, has been largely neglected in literatures. A selective dropping attack occurs when a malicious router intentionally drops incoming and outgoing UPDATE messages, which results in data traffic being blackholed or trapped in a loop. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis on this type of attack and advocate that new security countermeasures should be developed to detect and prevent such attack. I...|$|E

By model checking ARAN with the AVISPA Tool, we have discovered three attacks (a route disruption, a route diversion, and a creation of <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> state), while our analysis of endairA revealed no attacks.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} the novel idea of route normal-ization by {{correcting}} {{on the fly}} routing traffic {{on behalf of a}} local router to protect the local network from malicious and misconfigured routing updates. Analogous to traffic normal-ization for network intrusion detection systems, the proposed RouteNormalizer patches ambiguities and eliminates seman-tically <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> updates to protect against routing protocol attacks. Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it sug-gests local routing policy modifications to improve route se-lection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implemen-tation based on empirical BGP routing updates. We validate its effectiveness by showing that many well-known routing problems from operator mailing lists are correctly identified. ...|$|E
40|$|ASes in inter-domain routing receive little {{information}} {{about the quality of}} the routes they receive. This lack of information can lead to inefficient and even <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing.</b> In this paper, we quantitatively characterize BGP announcements that violate the so-called valley-free property—an indicator that universal best practices are not being preserved in the propagation of routes. Our analysis indicates that valley announcements are more pervasive than expected. Approximately ten thousand valley announcements appear every day and involve a substantial number of prefixes. 11 % of provider ASes propagate valley announcements, with a majority of violations happening at intermediate providers. We find that large surges of violating announcements can be attributed to transient configuration errors. We further propose a dynamic mechanism that provides route propagation information as transitive attributes of BGP. This information implicitly reflects the policies of the ASes along the path, without revealing the relationship of each AS pair. BGPspeaking routers use this information to identify (and presumably avoid) routes that violate the valley-free property. ...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{evaluation}} {{studies of}} MANET routing protocols {{have concentrated on}} quantitative, traffic-based metrics like throughput and packet loss. These metrics provide a lim- ited evaluation of protocol performance {{because they do not}} measure how well the protocol finds and maintains routes, only how well functional routes perform, once established. This work proposes a method for assessing how well a proac- tive MANET routing protocol tracks the network topology by comparing the reported routes to the actual topology. This study exposes the impact of routing message propa- gation and message loss on MANET routing by showing the existence of errant routes and protocol-reported informa- tion, specifically broken routes, <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> table hop counts, and existing routes that were not found by the pro- tocol. We use this approach to analyze the performance of the OLSR protocol in a medium-sized MANET, using data from the MANIAC Challenge.

40|$|An ad hoc {{network is}} a {{collection}} of wireless computers (nodes), communicating among themselves over possibly multihop paths, without the help of any infrastructure such as base stations or access points. Although many previous ad hoc network routing protocols have been based in part on distance vector approaches, they have generally assumed a trusted environment. In this paper, we design and evaluate the Secure Efficient Ad hoc Distance vector routing protocol (SEAD), a secure ad hoc network routing protocol based on the design of the Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector routing protocol (DSDV). In order to support use with nodes of limited CPU processing capability, and to guard against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks in which an attacker attempts to cause other nodes to consume excess network bandwidth or processing time, we use efficient one-way hash functions and do not use asymmetric cryptographic operations in the protocol. SEAD performs well over the range of scenarios we tested, and is robust against multiple uncoordinated attackers creating <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> state in any other node, even in spite of any active attackers or compromised nodes in the network. 1...|$|E
40|$|Messages transported {{within a}} sensor network {{are subject to}} losses due {{to a number of}} factors. These factors include losses in the {{wireless}} channel, MAC layer collisions, node error or failure and losses due to <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing.</b> This paper describes these sources of data loss and discusses the various strategies available to prevent data loss. The effectiveness of each of the strategies to prevent the different types of data loss is discussed. In particular, it is examined how the implementation of any particular scheme affects network performance. Here we define performance as accurate sensing of phenomena, reliable delivery of data, and the timeliness of data delivery. The implementation of reliability mechanisms in a sensor network can adversely effect the timeliness of data delivery thus presenting a design trade off in this area. Our principal contribution is the identification and description of this problem. Furthermore, we discuss the trade offs between reliability and delay and investigate the need for a framework to aid in WSN design in this area. It is our intention to implement and evaluate such a framework in our ongoing research. I...|$|E

This research proposed the Sybil Detection and Prevention (SDP) against Sybil attack. The property of this attack is to reply with every neighbors through multiple recognition (MR) value of itself i. e. fake identity, fake generated specification of itself in dynamic network. Routing protocols for MANET must handle obsolete routing information {{to hold the}} dynamically changeable topology. <b>Incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> information accomplished by malicious nodes to extent drop of packets, be considered malicious information. Whereas there are adequately many correct nodes, the SDP is able to find routes that deviates from these compromise nodes and provides secure path in between source to designation. The SDP has detected the malicious nodes and capture the malicious information of MR value generated in MANET. The SDP has immobilized the malicious functioning of Sybil attacker and enhance routing performance in presence of attacker. The better routing performance is devalued through performance parameters such as throughput and packets drop.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} DHTBL, an {{anti-spam}} blacklist built upon a novel secure distributed hash table (DHT). We show how DHTBL {{can be used}} to replace existing DNS-based blacklists (DNSBLs) of IP addresses of mail relays that forward spam. Implementing a blacklist on a DHT improves resilience to DoS attacks and secures message delivery, when compared to DNSBLs. However, due to the sensitive nature of the blacklist, storing the data in a peer-to-peer DHT would invite attackers to infiltrate the system. Typical DHTs can withstand fail-stop failures, but malicious nodes may provide <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> information, refuse to return published items, or simply ignore certain queries. The NeighborhoodWatch DHT is resilient to malicious nodes and maintains the O(log N) bounds on routing table size and expected lookup time. NeighborhoodWatch depends on two assumptions in order to make these guarantees: (1) the existence of an on-line trusted authority that periodically contacts and issues signed certificates to each node, and (2) for every sequence of k + 1 consecutive nodes in the ID space, at least one is alive and non-malicious. We show how NeighborhoodWatch maintains many of its security properties even when the second assumption is violated. Honest nodes in NeighborhoodWatch can detect malicious behavior and expel the responsible nodes from the DHT. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{growth of}} the Internet over the last years, and the expectation of an even faster increase {{in the numbers of}} users and networked systems, suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication media. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The current interdomain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), is limited in implementations of universal security. Because of this, it is vulnerable to many attacks at the Autonomous System (AS) to AS routing infrastructure. Initially, the major concern about BGP security is that malicious BGP routers can arbitrarily falsify BGP routing messages and spread <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> information. Recently, some authors have pointed out another kind of attack, called malicious dropping attack that has not studied before. The malicious draping attack can result in data traffic being blackholed or trapped in a loop. However, the authors did not elaborate on how one can detect such attacks. In this paper, we discuss and analyse a method {{that can be used to}} detect malicious dropping attacks in the Internet. In this paper, we describe the formatting guidelines for IJC...|$|E
40|$|Structured {{peer-to-peer}} {{systems have}} emerged as infrastructures for resource sharing in large-scale, distributed, and dynamic environments. One challenge in these systems is to efficiently maintain routing information {{in the presence of}} nodes joining, leaving, and failing. Many systems use costly periodic stabilization protocols to ensure that the routing information is up-to-date. In this paper, we present a novel technique called correction-on-change, which identifies and notifies all nodes that have outdated routing information {{as a result of a}} node joining, leaving, or failing. Effective failure handling is simplified as the detection of a failure triggers a correction-on-change which updates all the nodes that have a pointer to the failed node. The resulting system has increased robustness as nodes with stale routing information are immediately updated. We proof the correctness of the algorithms and evaluate its performance by means of simulation. Experimental results show that for the same amount of maintenance bandwidth correction-on-change makes the system by far more robust when compared to periodic stabilization. Moreover, compared to adaptive stabilization which adjusts its frequency to the dynamism in the system, correction-on-change gives the same performance but with considerably less maintenance bandwidth. As correction-onchange immediately updates <b>incorrect</b> <b>routing</b> entries the average lookup length is maintained close to the theoretical average in the presence of high dynamism. We show how the technique can be applied to our DKS system as well as the Chord system...|$|E
