5|$|The Bombing of Yawata on {{the night}} of 15/16June 1944 was the first air raid on the Japanese home islands {{conducted}} by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) strategic bombers during World War II. The raid was undertaken by 75 B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers staging from bases in China. Only 47 of these aircraft bombed the raid's primary target, the Imperial <b>Iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Works</b> at Yawata in northern Kyūshū, and little damage was caused. Five B-29s were lost in accidents during the operation and two were destroyed by Japanese aircraft.|$|E
5|$|XXBomber Command began flying {{missions}} against Japan in mid-June 1944. The first raid {{took place}} on the night of 15/16June when 75 B-29s were dispatched to attack the Imperial <b>Iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Works</b> at Yawata in northern Kyūshū. This attack caused little damage and cost seven B-29s, but received enthusiastic media coverage in the United States and indicated to Japanese civilians that the war was not going well. The Japanese military began expanding the fighter force in the home islands after the attack on Yawata, and by October 375 aircraft were assigned to the three air defense air divisions. These divisions remained at about this strength until March 1945. Arnold relieved XXBomber Command's commander, Brigadier General Kenneth Wolfe, shortly after the raid on Yawata when he was unable to make follow-up attacks on Japan due to insufficient fuel stockpiles at the bases in China. Wolfe's replacement was Major General Curtis LeMay, a veteran of Eighth Air Force bombing attacks against Germany.|$|E

5|$|Philadelphia's major {{industries}} {{of the era}} were the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Westward expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Philadelphia keep up with nearby New York City in domestic commerce, as both cities fought for dominance in transporting iron and coal resources from Pennsylvania. Philadelphia's other local railroad was the Reading Railroad, but {{after a series of}} bankruptcies, it was taken over by New Yorkers. The Panic of 1873, which occurred when the New York City branch of the Philadelphia bank Jay Cooke and Company failed, and another panic in the 1890s hampered Philadelphia's economic growth. While the depressions hurt the city, its diverse array of industries helped it weather difficult times. It had numerous iron and steel-related manufacturers, including Philadelphian-owned <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>works</b> outside the city, most notably the Bethlehem Iron Company in the city by that name. The largest industry in Philadelphia was textiles. Philadelphia produced more textiles than any other U.S. city; in 1904 the textile industry employed more than 35 percent of the city's workers. The cigar, sugar, and oil industries also were strong in the city. During this time the major department stores: Wanamaker's, Gimbels, Strawbridge and Clothier, and Lit Brothers, were developed along Market Street.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>works</b> there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} heavy metal ions {{from the soil}} of <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>work</b> site with EDTA {{enhanced}} washing was investigated {{through a series of}} laboratory tests to examine the effect of EDTA concentration, washing time, washing cycles and physical sieving. The heavy metal species in the soil before and after EDTA washing were examined by the sequential extraction procedure. The results are based on comprehensive consideration of associated factors such as high heavy metal removal rates, low loss of soil mineral elements and proper pH value of washing solution, EDTA concentration was controlled around 0. 075 mmol g(- 1). Considering the heavy metal removal rates and its increasing extent, the washing time and cycles were kept at about 3 h and 3 cycles respectively. Screening out the soil with size of 1 - 2 mm from the buck soil reduced soil volume by 21. 7 %. However, the heavy metal removal rates were not significantly reduced. This made EDTA washing economically viable. Under the optimum conditions, a total of 91. 7, 35. 5 and 21. 4 % of Zn, Cd and As, respectively, could be removed from the soil, mainly came from the Fe/Mn fraction (48 - 82 %). With the lower initial concentration in contaminated soil, Cd and As were more tightly bound to soil particles, which resulted in greatly lower removal rates of Cd and As than Zn. The operationally defined fraction results indicated that heavy metals in the soil after EDTA washing occurred mainly in residue bound fraction (62 - 68 %) and lowest in exchangable fraction (lower than 0. 4 %), to explain that the heavy metal availability in the washed soil did not increase. The results implied that EDTA washing could be used to remediate heavy metal contaminated soil of the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>work</b> site. However, careful control of the process parameters of EDTA washing should be considered to minimize the mobility of the remaining heavy metals...|$|R

25|$|On 5 June 1944, B-29s raided Bangkok, {{in what is}} {{reported}} as a test before being deployed against the Japanese home islands. Sources do not report from where they launched, and vary as to the numbers involved—77, 98, and 114 being claimed. Targets were Bangkok's Memorial Bridge and a major power plant. Bombs fell over two kilometres away, damaged no civilian structures, but destroyed some tram lines and destroyed both a Japanese military hospital and the Japanese secret police headquarters. On 15 June 1944, 68 B-29s took off from bases around Chengdu, 47 B-29s bombed the Imperial <b>Iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Works</b> at Yawata, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. This was the first attack on Japanese islands since the Doolittle raid in April 1942. The first B-29 combat losses occurred during this raid, with one B-29 destroyed on the ground by Japanese fighters after an emergency landing in China, one lost to anti-aircraft fire over Yawata, and another, the Stockett's Rocket (after Capt. Marvin M. Stockett, Aircraft Commander) B-29-1-BW 42-6261, disappeared after takeoff from Chakulia, India, over the Himalayas (12 KIA, 11 crew and one passenger) This raid, which did little damage to the target, with only one bomb striking the target factory complex, nearly exhausted fuel stocks at the Chengdu B-29 bases, resulting in a slow-down of operations until the fuel stockpiles could be replenished. Starting in July, the raids against Japan from Chinese airfields continued at relatively low intensity. Japan was bombed on: 7 July 1944 (14 B-29s), 29 July (70+), 10 August (24), 20 August (61), 8 September (90), 26 September (83), 25 October (59), 12 November (29), 21 November (61), 19 December (36) {{and for the last}} time on 6 January 1945 (49).|$|E

Nearby Laoyao harbor, which was an important industrial port, was designated as the raid's secondary target. The selection of Yawata's steel works as the first target to be attacked was in accordance with a decision made by the Twentieth Air Force on 1April 1944 which assigned the highest priority to attacking Japan's steel and coke industry. It was decided to conduct the raid at night with each B-29 bombing individually as the aircraft lacked the range needed to conduct a more fuel-intensive formation flight between the forward air bases and Yawata.|$|E
