5000|$|For servers the {{technical}} {{limitations of the}} old ISA were too great, and in late 1988 the [...] "Gang of Nine", led by Compaq, announced a rival high performance bus - <b>Extended</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (EISA). This offered similar performance benefits to Micro Channel but with the twin advantage {{of being able to}} accept older ISA boards and being free from IBM's control.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Extended</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (in {{practice}} {{almost always}} shortened to EISA and frequently pronounced [...] "eee-suh") is a bus standard for IBM PC compatible computers. It {{was announced in}} September 1988 by a consortium of PC clone vendors (the [...] "Gang of Nine") as a counter to IBM's use of its proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) in its PS/2 series.|$|E
5000|$|Steve Gibson {{proposed}} that clone makers adopt NuBus. Instead, a group (the [...] "Gang of Nine"), led by Compaq, {{created a new}} bus, which was named the <b>Extended</b> (or Enhanced) <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture,</b> or [...] "EISA". (The 16-bit bus became known as <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture,</b> or [...] "ISA".) This provided {{virtually all of the}} technical advantages of MCA, while remaining compatible with existing 8-bit and 16-bit cards, and (most enticing to system and card makers) minimal licensing cost.|$|R

In 2016, a documentary film [...] "Silicon Cowboys" [...] was made based on the same.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} {{manufacturers}} balked at IBM's licensing terms {{to develop and}} sell compatible hardware, particularly as IBM demanded royalties on a per machine basis, and so {{in response to the}} PS/2, they developed the <b>Extended</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (EISA). Also the evolving Wintel architecture was seeing a period of dramatic reductions in price, and so these developments prevented the PS/2 from returning control of the PC market to IBM.|$|E
50|$|The 16-bit ISA bus {{was also}} used with 32-bit {{processors}} for several years. An attempt to extend it to 32 bits, called <b>Extended</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (EISA), was not very successful, however. Later buses such as VESA Local Bus and PCI were used instead, often along with ISA slots on the same mainboard. Derivatives of the AT bus structure were and still are used in ATA/IDE, the PCMCIA standard, Compact Flash, the PC/104 bus, and internally within Super I/O chips.|$|E

50|$|Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) vs. <b>Extended</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (EISA). Up to the {{introduction}} of MCA, personal computers had relied on a 16 bit expansion system which was later christened 'Industry Standard Architecture' (ISA). IBM introduced a new range of personal computers featuring a new 32 bit expansion system which they called MCA. It was at this point {{that the rest of the}} personal computer industry named the existing expansion system as ISA. IBM wanted substantial royalties from any manufacturer wishing to adopt the MCA system (largely in an attempt to recover lost royalties that they believed that they were owed due to the wholesale cloning of their original 'PC', a task that was greatly simplified by the 'off the shelf' nature of the design). IBM's competitors jointly responded by introducing the EISA expansion system which, unlike MCA, was fully compatible with the existing ISA cards. In the event, neither MCA nor EISA really caught on, and the PCI standard was eventually adopted instead.|$|E
5000|$|Companies like Dell {{improved}} the AT bus's performance, but in 1987, IBM moved {{to replace the}} AT bus with their proprietary Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) {{in an effort to}} regain control of the PC architecture and the PC market. (Note the relationship between the IBM term [...] "I/O Channel" [...] for the AT-bus and the name [...] "Micro Channel" [...] for IBM's intended replacement.) MCA had many features that would later appear in PCI, the successor of ISA, but MCA was a closed standard, unlike ISA (PC-bus and AT-bus) for which IBM had released full specifications and even circuit schematics. The system was far more advanced than the AT bus, and computer manufacturers responded with the <b>Extended</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (EISA) and later, the VESA Local Bus (VLB). In fact, VLB used some electronic parts originally intended for MCA because component manufacturers already were equipped to manufacture them. Both EISA and VLB were backwards-compatible expansions of the AT (ISA) bus.|$|E
5000|$|Compaq {{created the}} term [...] "Industry Standard Architecture" [...] (ISA) to replace [...] "PC compatible". The ISA bus was {{developed}} by {{a team led by}} Mark Dean at IBM as part of the IBM PC project in 1981. It originated as an 8-bit system. The newer 16-bit standard, the IBM AT bus, was introduced in 1984. In 1988, the [...] "Gang of Nine" [...] PC compatible manufacturers, including Compaq, proposed the 32-bit <b>Extended</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (EISA) standard and in the process retroactively renamed the AT bus to [...] "ISA" [...] to avoid infringing IBM's trademark on its PC/AT computer. IBM designed the 8 bit version as a buffered interface to the external bus of the Intel 8088 (16/8 bit) CPU used in the original IBM PC and PC/XT, and the 16-bit version as an upgrade for the external bus of the Intel 80286 CPU used in the IBM AT. Therefore, the ISA bus was synchronous with the CPU clock, until sophisticated buffering methods were developed and implemented by chipsets to interface ISA to much faster CPUs.|$|E

5000|$|Early IBM PC compatibles {{used the}} same {{computer}} bus as the original PC and AT models. The IBM AT compatible bus was later named the <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> bus by manufacturers of compatible computers. The term [...] "IBM PC compatible" [...] is now a historical description only, since IBM has ended its personal computer sales.|$|R
50|$|<b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ISA) is a retronym {{term for}} the 16-bit {{internal}} bus of IBM PC/AT and similar computers based on the Intel 80286 and its immediate successors during the 1980s. The bus was (largely) backward compatible with the 8-bit bus of the 8088-based IBM PC, including the IBM PC/XT as well as IBM PC compatibles.|$|R
50|$|IBM {{introduced}} {{what would}} retroactively {{be called the}} <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ISA) bus with the IBM PC in 1981; it was then called the PC bus. The IBM XT, introduced in 1983, used the same bus (with slight exception). The 8-bit PC and XT bus was extended {{with the introduction of}} the IBM AT, in 1984. This used a second connector for extending the address and data bus over the XT, but was backward compatible; 8-bit cards were still usable in the AT 16-bit slots. <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ISA) became the designation for the IBM AT bus after other types were developed. Users of the ISA bus had to have in depth knowledge of the hardware they were adding to properly connect the devices, since memory addresses, I/O port addresses, and DMA channels had to be configured by switches or jumpers on the card to match the settings in driver software.|$|R

50|$|The elderly <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ISA) bus uses edge-triggered interrupts, {{but does}} not mandate that devices {{be able to share}} them. The {{parallel}} port also uses edge-triggered interrupts. Many older devices assume that they have exclusive use of their interrupt line, making it electrically unsafe to share them. However, ISA motherboards include pull-up resistors on the IRQ lines, so well-behaved devices share ISA interrupts just fine.|$|R
50|$|The term Legacy Plug and Play, also {{shortened}} to PnP, {{describes a}} series of specifications and Microsoft Windows features geared towards operating system configuration of devices. The standards were primarily aimed at the IBM PC standard bus, later dubbed <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ISA). Related specifications are also defined for the common external or specialist busses commonly attached via ISA {{at the time of}} development, including RS-232 and parallel port devices.|$|R
5000|$|This ID {{code system}} was not {{integrated}} into the early <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ISA) hardware common in PCs when Plug and Play was first introduced. ISA Plug and Play caused {{some of the greatest}} difficulties that made PnP initially very unreliable. This led to the derisive term [...] "Plug and Pray", since I/O addresses and IRQ lines were often set incorrectly in the early days. Later computer buses like MCA, EISA and PCI (which was becoming the <b>industry</b> <b>standard</b> at that time) integrated this functionality.|$|R
50|$|Many early {{microcomputers}} (with a CPU generally on {{a single}} integrated circuit) were built with a single system bus, starting with the S-100 bus in the Altair 8800 computer system in about 1975.The IBM PC used the <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ISA) bus as its system bus in 1981. The passive backplanes of early models were replaced with the standard of putting the CPU and RAM on a motherboard, with only optional daughterboards or expansion cards in system bus slots.|$|R

50|$|The first Novell {{product was}} a {{proprietary}} hardware server {{based on the}} Motorola 68000 CPU supporting six MUX ports per board for a maximum of four boards per server using a star topology with twisted pair cabling. A network interface card (NIC) was developed for the IBM PC <b>industry</b> <b>standard</b> <b>architecture</b> (ISA) bus. The server was using the first network operating system (NOS) called ShareNet. Later, ShareNet was ported to run on the Intel platform and renamed NetWare. The first commercial release of NetWare was version 1.5.|$|R
50|$|The LPC bus was {{introduced}} by Intel in 1998 as a software-compatible substitute for the <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ISA) bus. It resembles ISA to software, although physically it is quite different. The ISA bus has a 16-bit data bus and a 24-bit address bus {{that can be used}} for both 16-bit I/O port addresses and 24-bit memory addresses; both run at speeds up to 8.33 MHz. The LPC bus uses a heavily multiplexed four-bit-wide bus operating at four times the clock speed (33.3 MHz) to transfer addresses and data with similar performance.|$|R
30|$|Several bus {{specifications}} like <b>Industry</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Architecture</b> or Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) {{have been}} implemented to support the communications between the CPU and the peripherals. Today, the PCI Express bus is used in most personal computers and servers. There are three main types of PCI Express devices. The root of the bus hierarchy, called the root complex, {{is connected to the}} CPU, thanks to the host bridge and to the first-level PCI Express children devices. These devices can be endpoints (so-called peripherals in the paper) and bridges. A bridge connects two different logical bus domains with an upstream and a downstream port.|$|R
