5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} Sherry and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory {{to find something}} to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of <b>getting</b> <b>information</b> about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly at the cost of her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration of flesh and teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E

25|$|Great {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} <b>getting</b> <b>information</b> back to headquarters and making troops independent within the plan, to allow a higher tempo ("The rate or rhythm of activity relative to the enemy".) of operations, by freeing attacking troops from the need to refer back for orders. Corps commanders planned the attack in the framework given by the army commander and planning in the Second Army followed the same system. In mid-June, the Second Army corps were asked to submit their attack plans and requirements to carry them out. When the II Corps boundary was moved south in early July, the Second Army attack became mainly a decoy, except for the 41st Division (X Corps), for which special liaison arrangements were made with II Corps and the covering artillery.|$|E

The squadron moved by the 22d, and on the 23d operations began from the new station. By early October, with the American infantry advancing on all points between the Argonne and the Meuse, German aircraft were concentrating all available resources to stop the Air Service from <b>getting</b> <b>information</b> about its rear areas. Enemy aircraft were constantly attacking squadron aircraft with a far higher intensity than what was experienced earlier, and the 91st brought down a number of enemy planes, far out of proportion to what might be expected from an observation squadron.|$|E

25|$|Operation Mongoose {{consisted}} of a program of covert action, including sabotage, psychological warfare, intelligence collection, {{and the creation of}} an internal revolution against the communist government. The U.S. still lacked the capability of effectively <b>getting</b> <b>information</b> to the majority of the Cuban people. They had a trade embargo, denial of bunkering facilities, increased port security, and control procedure on transshipment, technical data, and customs inspection. The U.S. also used diplomatic means to frustrate Cuban trade negotiations in Israel, Jordan, Iran, Greece, and possibly Japan. From the outset, Lansdale and fellow members of the SG-A identified internal support for an anti-Castro movement {{to be the most important}} aspect of the operation. American organization and support for anti-Castro forces in Cuba was seen as key, which expanded American involvement from what had mostly been economic and military assistance of rebel forces. Therefore, Lansdale hoped to organize an effort within the operation, led by the CIA, to covertly build support for a popular movement within Cuba. This was a major challenge. It was difficult to identify anti-Castro forces within Cuba and there lacked a groundswell of popular support that Cuban insurgents could tap into. Within the first few months, an internal review of Operation Mongoose cited the CIA's limited capabilities to gather hard intelligence and conduct covert operations in Cuba. By January 1962, the CIA had failed to recruit suitable Cuban operatives that could infiltrate the Castro regime. The CIA and Lansdale estimated that they required 30 Cuban operatives. Lansdale criticized the CIA effort to ramp up their activities to meet Operation Mongoose's expedient timelines. Robert McCone of the CIA complained that Lansdale's timeline was too accelerated and that it would be difficult to achieve the tasks demanded in such a short timeframe.|$|E

500|$|During the 1990s {{specialties}} {{for communicating}} to certain audiences and within certain market segments emerged, such as investor relations or technology PR. New internet technology and social media websites effected PR strategies and tactics. In April 1999, four managers from IBM, Sun Microsystems, National Public Radio and Linux Journal created [...] "The Cluetrain Manifesto." [...] The Manifesto established 95 theses {{about the way}} social media and internet technologies were going to change business. It concluded that markets had become [...] "smarter and faster than most companies," [...] because stakeholders were <b>getting</b> <b>information</b> from each other. The Manifesto [...] "created a storm" [...] with strong detractors and supporters. That same year, Seth Godin published a book on permission marketing, which advocated against advertising and in favor of marketing that is useful and educational. While initially controversial, by 2006 it became commonly accepted that social media had {{an important role in}} public relations.|$|E

500|$|With no {{knowledge}} of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza.

He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was [...] "actually fascinated by those [...] films that follow one person". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it [...] "goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are [...] "no straightforward answers". Morgan commented, [...] "I'm probably most proud that we avoided easy answers and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised." ...|$|E

He {{wanted to be able to}} tell the story and impact of his daughter's death, on his own terms. Titled, Kaja: 1988–2008, the book explores the sequence of events that led to his daughter's death, from her time studying French in Nice. Her early history of psychiatric treatment is discussed in the book. He recounts the difficulties in <b>getting</b> <b>information</b> about his daughter's death from government authorities. According to the author, there was a slow response in receiving help from the Foreign Ministry of Norway. In an interview with Politiken, he explained the motivation for writing the book: [...] "After the funeral I felt I had to do something relating to grief. This was my way to process the grief. The second issue was that I needed to transcribe the account to later tell my little daughter Oda." [...] He also said, [...] "I wanted to contribute to greater openness about suicide." [...] He acknowledged, [...] "Losing a child means that life is turned upside down. I believe that grief becomes heavier if you do not share it with anyone." [...] The book was written with input from other family members.|$|E
