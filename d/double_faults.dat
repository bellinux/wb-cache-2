25|$|Clijsters' first serve is not {{overwhelmingly}} powerful, but {{is placed}} well and earns her free points. When timed correctly, her serve {{can be considered}} a major weapon. Clijsters also possesses a strong second serve that is not easily attackable; however, she sometimes lacks confidence on serve and loses timing, resulting in a high number of <b>double</b> <b>faults</b> in some matches.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of Dubai, Dokic, {{hindered}} by illness, committed 41 unforced errors and 11 <b>double</b> <b>faults</b> to give victory to an in-form Flavia Pennetta losing 2–6, 2–6. Following the loss, Dokic travelled to Doha to participate at the qualifying draw of 2011 Qatar Ladies Open. She comfortably won her first match but lost in the second match to fellow Australian, Jarmila Groth.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since her}} {{shoulder}} operation Sharapova {{has been unable}} to control her serve. This has led to numerous faults, as she is unable to feel how much power she is generating. The new action led to an elbow injury, but under Thomas Högstedt it has improved but can still be erratic. This improvement in serving {{can be seen in the}} 2013 Australian Open and following tournaments where Maria Sharapova committed fewer <b>double</b> <b>faults</b> than in previous years.|$|E
50|$|On the x86 architecture, a <b>double</b> <b>fault</b> {{exception}} occurs if {{the processor}} encounters a problem {{while trying to}} service a pending interrupt or exception. An example situation when a <b>double</b> <b>fault</b> would occur is when an interrupt is triggered but the segment in which the interrupt handler resides is invalid. If the processor encounters a problem when calling the <b>double</b> <b>fault</b> handler, a triple fault is generated and the processor shuts down.|$|R

25|$|In {{her return}} from layoff in 2008 to 2009, she used an {{abbreviated}} motion, which was somewhat less powerful, and though producing aces, also gave {{a very high}} number of <b>double</b> <b>faults.</b> After her early loss at the 2009 US Open, Sharapova returned to a more elongated motion, similar to her pre-surgery serve. She has since been able to produce speeds greater than before, including a 121-mph serve hit at the Birmingham tournament in 2010 – the fastest serve of her career.|$|E
25|$|At the Qatar Telecom German Open in Berlin, Mauresmo lost in {{the third}} round to Julia Vakulenko of Ukraine, and at the Internazionali d'Italia in Rome, she {{lost in the}} second round to Australian Samantha Stosur, 7–5, 7–6(4), 6–7(7), after Mauresmo led 5–3 in the third set. Going into the French Open, Mauresmo had played only three tournaments since the end of February. Mauresmo lost to Czech Lucie Šafářová {{in the third round}}, 3–6, 6–7(4), {{committing}} eight <b>double</b> <b>faults</b> and 49 unforced errors.|$|E
25|$|Her injury {{forced her}} to miss Wimbledon warming up tournaments, but Dokic still {{appeared}} at Wimbledon. She lost against qualifier Tatjana Malek {{in the first round}} 6–3, 5–7, 2–6 after serving 16 <b>double</b> <b>faults.</b> Dokic was then diagnosed as suffering from glandular fever and had to withdraw from Swedish Open in Båstad. She was ordered to rest for another fortnight and planned to get back on court on hard-court tournaments leading up to 2009 US Open. However, she did not make any appearance at the 2009 US Open Series.|$|E

Verdasco saved break points in the fifth game for 3-2. Verdasco saved two more break points in the 11th game, leading to a tie-break. Verdasco won the early lead 4-2 but Murray recovered to reach 4-5 on serve. Verdasco won the next point before Murray <b>double</b> <b>faulted</b> to give Verdasco the set. In the third Verdaso save the only break point in the second. Verdasco <b>double</b> <b>faulted</b> to give Murray a 4-2 lead who held {{on to win the}} breaker 7-3.|$|R
25|$|Representing Australia for {{the first}} time in five years, Dokic {{received}} a wild card into the ASB Classic in Auckland. However, she lost her first round match to Julia Schruff, 5–7, 7–6, 6–1, hitting 51 unforced errors and 28 <b>double</b> <b>faults.</b> Dokic then earned a wildcard berth at the Australian Open after winning the wildcard playoff. She held a match point on her opponent Virginie Razzano's serve and hit a forehand winner which did catch the line, only to have the umpire overrule the ball out. She went on to lose the match, 3–6, 7–6, 6–1, hitting over 70 unforced errors.|$|E
25|$|After {{injuring}} {{herself in}} the quarterfinal match against Dementieva, Venus Williams defaulted to Serena in the semifinals. Although Venus told the tournament official hours beforehand {{that she would have}} to default, the official word was not given until 10 minutes before the scheduled start (in the hopes that Venus would change her mind), angering fans who had come to see the match. Consequently, during the final against Kim Clijsters two days later, the spectators jeered Serena from when she first took the court for warm-up through the final trophy presentation including cheering <b>double</b> <b>faults</b> and errors with no intervention from the tournament officials. Despite these attacks, Serena went on to win the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Representing Russia at the Beijing Olympics, Safina {{defeated}} world No. 1 Jelena Janković in {{the quarterfinals}} in three sets, making {{her the first}} player {{in the history of}} the WTA Tour to defeat three different reigning World No. 1 players in the same year. In the semifinals, she defeated Li Na in straight sets. In the gold medal match, Safina lost to Dementieva in three sets while serving 23 <b>double</b> <b>faults.</b> She went into the US Open as one of five women who could have taken the world No. 1 ranking, depending on their results in this tournament. However, she lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion Serena Williams. After this tournament, her ranking rose to a career high of world No. 5.|$|E
50|$|On the x86 {{computer}} architecture, {{a triple}} fault {{is a special}} kind of exception generated by the CPU when an exception occurs while the CPU is trying to invoke the <b>double</b> <b>fault</b> exception handler, which itself handles exceptions occurring while trying to invoke a regular exception handler.|$|R
50|$|Tim Henman {{defeated}} Carlos Moyà {{in round}} 1 after going down two sets {{to one in}} a match that lasted two days with a 5th set scoreline of 13-11. Henman failed to convert 6 match points before capitalizing from a <b>double</b> <b>fault</b> by Moya on the 7th match point.|$|R
50|$|When {{players of}} both teams commit a {{transgression}} simultaneously, {{it is called}} a <b>double</b> <b>fault.</b> The referee then tosses {{the ball into the}} air between two opposing players where the transgressions occurred. The two opposing players then attempt to gain possession of the ball by hitting or catching the ball on the descend.|$|R
25|$|Dokic's next {{scheduled}} tournament was Budapest, but {{she decided}} to withdraw to recover from a hamstring injury. The same injury forced her {{to withdraw from the}} tournament in Bad Gastein and Baku as well. Dokic then participated in Washington as the fourth seed, but her lack of match play saw her fall in the first round to China's Zhang Shuai. She played in San Diego, but was defeated in three tight sets to Ayumi Morita with her 15 <b>double</b> <b>faults</b> being highlighted as the main concern for the match. Since then, Dokic did not play any further matches due to a shoulder injury. Despite this setback, Dokic took part in the main draw of the US Open. She reached the second round but lost to Jelena Janković in straight sets.|$|E
25|$|Venus {{began her}} US Open series at the Rogers Cup {{where she was}} a finalist last year. She lost in the first round, 6–0, 6–3 to Sabine Lisicki. Her loss pushed her outside of the top 20. Her next tournament was at the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati. She {{made it to the}} second round and was set to play Ana Ivanovic, before she withdrew due to a virus. She was seeded 23rd for the US Open and played Monica Puig in the first round. She led 6–4, 5–3 and held three match points, but lost the second set. She managed to win the match 6–4, 6–7(7–9), 6–3. In the second round, she overcame 2 costly <b>double</b> <b>faults</b> in the second set to defeat fellow American Irina Falconi 6–3, 6–7(2–7), 6–2. She {{defeated}} 12th seed Belinda Bencic and qualifier Anett Kontaveit in straight sets in the third and fourth rounds, respectively. Venus played her sister, Serena, in the quarterfinals in their 5th meeting at the US Open and their 27th meeting overall. Venus lost the match in three sets (2–6 6–1 3–6).|$|E
25|$|Dokic {{began her}} 2012 season in Auckland where she {{lost in the}} first round 7–6, 6–1 to Mona Barthel. Then, she {{received}} a wildcard to compete in Sydney. In the first round, she defeated fellow Australian Isabella Holland 6–0, 6–0 to set up a clash against eight seeded Marion Bartoli in the second round where she lost 6–0 6–3. She also played doubles with Sofia Arvidsson where she reached the quarterfinals before losing to Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears. One week later, Dokic took part in the Australian Open. She began her campaign by defeating Anna Chakvetadze {{in the first round}} 6–2, 6–1. In the second round, she met Bartoli {{for the second time in}} two weeks. Dokic's nine <b>double</b> <b>faults</b> (some at crucial points) cost her and she lost 6–3, 6–2. Despite that loss, Dokic stated she had played much better than in Sydney. She also participated in doubles and mixed doubles competitions, partnering with Kateryna Bondarenko and Paul Hanley respectively, but lost in the first rounds of both.|$|E

25|$|Dokic {{traveled}} to Kuala Lumpur where she scored her biggest win {{of the year}} by upsetting world No. 5, 2010 French Open Champion, and top seed Francesca Schiavone 2–6, 7–6, 6–4 in the first round, despite serving 15 <b>double</b> <b>faults.</b> This is her first win against a top 5 player since 2003, where she defeated then world number one player Kim Clijsters in Zurich. She then defeated Japan's Kurumi Nara in the second round, 3–6, 7–6, 6–2, to advance to her second WTA quarterfinal this year. She reinforced this win by upsetting an in-form Bojana Jovanovski, the eighth seed, in straight sets 7–6,6–2. This victory saw Dokic advance to her first WTA semi-finals since Toray Pan Pacific Open in Japan in February 2004. Dokic faced a resurgent Michaëlla Krajicek of the Netherlands, who had defeated defending champion Alisa Kleybanova in the second round and prevailed 6–2, 6–3 to advance to her first WTA singles final since the Zürich Open in October 2003. She concluded the tournament by beating Lucie Šafářová 2–6, 7–6, 6–4 in the final after saving two championships points in the second set tiebreak and being down 1–3 in the final set. This was Dokic's first WTA title under Australian flag and first since June 2002 where she won the DFS Classic, in Birmingham. Her strong performance rose her ranking to world No. 61.|$|E
25|$|Receiving a bye in {{the first}} round at the Los Angeles, Azarenka fell to Maria Sharapova.

25|$|Li was an {{aggressive}} baseliner whose game was founded upon her quick reflexes, athleticism and powerful groundstrokes that achieved precision, placement and depth. Li's crosscourt forehand {{tended to be}} her favourite shot, hit with great accuracy and pace, although her backhand {{was said to be}} the more consistent and reliable groundstroke, both of which she was known to unleash unpredictably to all areas of the court to dictate play. She boasted an exceptional backhand down-the-line, which was very effective at producing winners or setting up a weak reply from the opponent. Many tennis analysts considered Li one of the cleanest and hardest hitting players on tour, capable of overpowering and outgunning opponents from the baseline. Although she did not possess an overwhelmingly powerful serve, it was very well placed, earning her aces or unreturnables on occasion, however it often became a liability when she lost confidence under pressure, resulting in many <b>double</b> <b>faults.</b> Li employed a solid defensive game combining great footwork, speed and lateral movement. Her ability to turn defense into offense was one of her biggest assets as she hit well on the run and scrambled around the court with ease. Having been an accomplished doubles player, she was comfortable when playing at the net, often moving forward {{to take advantage of a}} short ball or finish off an extended rally. Li's inconsistency was cited as her main weakness throughout her career, as she was prone to streaky and erratic play accompanied by a high unforced error count. Since her shots were usually hit hard and flat with minimal topspin or slice, her game lacked variety. Her emotions on court have hurt her game during tight moments. Under the tutelage of Carlos Rodríguez, Li adopted more of an all-round game, implementing a forehand with additional topspin and frequent net approaches into her arsenal, as well as improved consistency, mental stability, mobility and coordination.|$|E

40|$|Proper {{setting of}} process {{conditions}} in the melt spinning setup {{is one way to}} yield uniform quality of spinline tension. The optimum setting to give uniform spinline tension is determined using experiment plans in the Taguchi method and significant process parameters are also identified. When the setting shifts from the optimum, the spinline tension becomes non-uniform and downgrades product quality. This study aims to diagnose single or <b>double</b> <b>fault</b> conditions of those significant process parameters based on the spinline tension signal. The critical procedures of fault diagnosis are feature extraction and classification. The tension signal is decomposed into a wavelet packet tree of four resolution levels. Four entropies from the best-basis wavelet packet tree and the lowest entropy at level four are selected as features. The back-propagation neural network acts as a classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that the features and classifier actually work well to identify the single and <b>double</b> <b>fault</b> conditions with high accuracy in melt spinning...|$|R

The opening game of the 2nd set saw Dementiva save 3 break points, before being broken at the 4th opportunity. A battling hold in the third game, when she saved another break point. Dementieva then reeled off three games in a row. Venus recovered to brake again in the 11th game, with Dementieva once again producing a <b>double</b> <b>fault.</b> But the Russian broke straight back. Dementieva sealed the set with a 4th break point when Venus produced <b>double</b> <b>fault.</b> The Russian broke {{in the first and}} third games of the final set.
