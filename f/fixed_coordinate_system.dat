40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} the basic hypotheses and viewpoints on space-time {{of the special}} relativity {{as well as of}} the moving objects observation theory. It proposes a new concept called visual space–time. Also, the relationship among the moving <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> true space–time, <b>fixed</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> visual space–time and <b>fixed</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> true space–time has been established. From comparing the analysis, the author concluded that moving objects observation theory has solved the measurement problem of moving objects. Moving can not cause length change, time change or mass change. Nor is there light barrier. So the special relativity should be abandoned. Key words: special relativity, Lorentz-transformation, velocity of light, Einstein, moving objects observation theory In order to resolve measurement problem of moving objects, Einstein presented the special relativity a century ago 1 - 2. Now, this theory as well as its author Einstein has already been well-known all over the world. Universit...|$|R

Further, it was also found that the concept of intrinsic diffusion is an illusion in the diffusion history. All physical information in the given diffusion system is incorporated into the diffusivity. If we can know a diffusivity behavior in the given diffusion equation, the mathematical solution and/or numerical one at least is possible. In the diffusion problems, it is thus extremely dominant to know the diffusivity behavior. The diffusivity is defined by an interaction between a diffusion particle and the diffusion field near the diffusion particle itself. This indicates that the diffusivity should be essentially investigated in the quantum mechanics, since the behavior of a micro particle should be investigated by analyzing the Schrodinger equation.|$|E
