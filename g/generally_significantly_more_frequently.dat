40|$|Introduction. In {{the last}} two decades there has been an {{increase}} in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in both developed and in developing countries. Objective. To determine whether personal habits like smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption or physical inactivity are different between genders in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods. The study was conducted in Belgrade, during the period 2007 - 2008, and included newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes. We included 80 men and 99 women diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2, referred to the Primary Health Care Centre 'Savski venac'. A questionnaire was used to collect data on demographic and anthropometric characteristics, as well as data on healthy habits. The χI test and two-tailed t-test were used for data analysis. Results. The men were <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> engaged in industry and crafts, while the women worked <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> in administrative jobs. The men were married <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> than the women (p 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background Metastatic {{melanoma}} is {{an aggressive}} form {{of skin cancer}} with a high mortality rate and the fastest growing global incidence rate of all malignancies. The introduction of BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations has yielded significant increases in PFS and OS for melanoma. However, at present, no direct comparisons between different BRAF/MEK combinations have been conducted. In light of this, an indirect treatment comparison was performed between two BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapies for metastatic melanoma, dabrafenib plus trametinib and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, {{in order to understand}} the relative efficacy and toxicity profiles of these therapies. Methods A systematic literature search identified two randomized trials as suitable for indirect comparison: the coBRIM trial of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and the COMBI-v trial of dabrafenib plus trametinib versus vemurafenib. The comparison followed the method of Bucher et al. and analyzed both efficacy (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall response rate [ORR]) and safety outcomes (adverse events [AEs]). Results The indirect comparison revealed similar efficacy outcomes between both therapies, with no statistically significant difference between therapies for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 94, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 68 [*]−[*] 1. 30), PFS (HR 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 79 [*]−[*] 1. 40), or ORR (risk ratio [RR] 0. 90, 95 % CI 0. 74 [*]−[*] 1. 10). Dabrafenib plus trametinib differed significantly from vemurafenib plus cobimetinib with regard to the incidence of treatment-related AE (RR 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 87 [*]−[*] 0. 97), any AE grade ≥ 3 (RR 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 60 [*]−[*] 0. 85) or dose interruption/modification (RR 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 60 [*]−[*] 0. 99). Several categories of AEs occurred <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, while some occurred <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> with dabrafenib plus trametinib.

As there has been little research conducted at the kindergarten through twelfth grade levels regarding student attitudes about teacher characteristics, Sizemore's findings prompted replication. Stage II involved expanding Sizemore's original design by intro ducing three affective variables for analysis, namely, students' global self-esteem, students' in-school locus of control perceptions, and students' in-school self-esteem. The instruments used for measuring these affective variables were Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale, a modified version of Clifford and Clearys' Academic Achievement Accountability (AAA) locus of control measure, and a version of Rosenberg's self-esteem scale modified to measure in-school self-esteem. Self-esteem and locus of control variables were included because they offered some potential for explaining why students cited teacher warmth behaviors as important teacher characteristics. Stage I [...] replication results [...] Half of Sizemore's findings were replicated.

5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|R
