40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the influence of anisotropically shaped texture arrays on friction behaviour of an oil lubricated sliding contact, especially on directional friction control based on the diverging and converging characteristics of the textures. Experiments have been conducted on a TE 77 reciprocating cylinder-on-plate test rig, where steel rollers were used to slide against steel plate samples with or without textures. A mineral base oil was used to lubricate the contacts. Three geometries of dimples were designed and laser textured on the steel plate samples with varied 3 -dimensional features, including Square Flat (SF), Square slope (SS) and Triangular Flat (TF) shapes representing the shape in x-y (top view) and x-z (side view) planes respectively. These shapes were chosen to vary the converging and diverging properties of the lubricated contacts depending on the sliding direction. Relatively large dimple sizes (side length ~ 500 and depth ~ 10) have been used in this study to enable observation of the effect and easy control of the texturing process. The texture density has been kept at 10 % as most literature suggested. The large dimple sizes resulted that the dimples were not be fully covered by the contact area, i. e. the dimple sides were bigger than the Hertzian contact width of the roller-flat contacts. This has eliminated the ‘lift’ or ‘load bearing’ effect discussed in most papers thus focuses on other effects investigated in this study. The results show that beneficial effects of the anisotropic textures present in all lubrication regimes including the boundary, mixed and <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>lubrications,</b> especially under prevailing boundary lubrication conditions. Using high sampling rate for the friction data during the tests, it was able to study local friction effect due to individual dimple array especially at their leading and trailing edges. The results show that a local friction reduction is observed at the leading while an increase at the trailing edge. Overall directional friction effect of the anisotropic textures has been observed that the converging shape in both y-z plane and the x-y plane reduces friction. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} triangular shape dimples have a greater local frictional response at each dimple array, while the sloped bottom square dimples have a more significant overall directional fricition effect...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{limiting}} {{the rate at which}} wire can be drawn through tungsten-carbide or diamond dies is the severe die wear which may occur at hjgh speed. If true <b>hydrodynamic</b> (fluid-film) <b>lubrication</b> could be provided in the die, wear would probably be much reduced. I t is suggested that this can be done by supplying oil to the entry of the die at a pressure comparable with the yield stress of the wire. The necessary pressure can be conveniently generated by causing the wire to approach the die through a tube of diameter slightly larger than the wire diameter, sealed on to the inlet side of the die. Experimental work shows that the friction in the die itself can then be so reduced that, even when the drag in the tube is allowed for, the total drawing force is less than with the existing method of soap lubrication; and tests with steel dies have shown large reductions in wear. A theory of the behaviour of the inlet tube and of temperature distribution in the system is included...|$|R

50|$|Typically the lubricant-to-surface {{friction}} is {{much less}} than surface-to-surface friction in a system without any lubrication. Thus use of a lubricant reduces the overall system friction. Reduced friction has the benefit of reducing heat generation and reduced formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency. Lubricants may contain additives known as friction modifiers that chemically bind to metal surfaces to reduce surface friction even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant present for <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>lubrication,</b> e.g. protecting the valve train in a car engine at startup.|$|E
50|$|Lubricants are {{typically}} used to separate moving parts in a system. This separation has {{the benefit of}} reducing friction and surface fatigue, together with reduced heat generation, operating noise and vibrations. Lubricants achieve this in several ways. The most common is by forming a physical barrier i.e., {{a thin layer of}} lubricant separates the moving parts. This is analogous to hydroplaning, the loss of friction observed when a car tire is separated from the road surface by moving through standing water. This is termed <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>lubrication.</b> In cases of high surface pressures or temperatures, the fluid film is much thinner and some of the forces are transmitted between the surfaces through the lubricant..|$|E
50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>lubrication,</b> {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness.|$|E
