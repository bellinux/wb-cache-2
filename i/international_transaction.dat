During his majority opinion holding for the petitioner, Justice Potter Stewart noted that [...] "a colorable argument could be made" [...] that Wilko did not reach the 1934 Act due to differences in the corresponding sections of the statutes. The non-waiver provision was narrower, the private right of action only implied, and the 1934 Act only provided for federal jurisdiction. Stewart found those concerns irrelevant to the case, since it concerned an <b>international</b> <b>transaction</b> under which arbitration might be a better solution.|$|E
2500|$|Boutwell {{had sought}} finance {{some of the}} debt {{reduction}} through the placement of loans in Europe. [...] This idea was complicated by Civil War claims against the United Kingdom (the so-called Alabama Claims emanating from British support for the CSS Alabama and other Confederate privateers), {{and then by the}} outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War shortly after the financing bill was passed. [...] The latter prevented placement of offers in mainland European financial centers, and the unresolved Alabama issues prevented their placement in London. [...] Political pressure {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic resulted in the 1871 Treaty of Washington, after which Boutwell floated a loan in London. [...] The first loan offer unravelled, however, because Boutwell offered it to too many banks, but a second, reorganized attempt led by financier Jay Cooke succeeded in raising over $100 million. [...] It was the first time an American bank successfully engaged in this type of <b>international</b> <b>transaction.</b>|$|E

Mr. Parnell’s purpose {{was reported to have}} shifted during the week since the decree. On the Wednesday he had been at his stiffest, proudest, and coldest, bent on holding on at all cost. He thought he saw a way of getting something done for Ireland; the Irish people had given him a commission; he should stand to it, so long as ever they asked him. On the Friday, however (Nov. 21), he appeared, so I had been told, to be shaken in his resolution. He had bethought him that the government might possibly seize the moment for a dissolution; that if there were an immediate election, the government would under the circumstances be not unlikely to win; if so, Mr. Gladstone might be thrown for four or five years into opposition; in other words, that powerful man’s part in the great <b>international</b> <b>transaction</b> would be at an end. In this mood he declared himself alive to the peril and the grave responsibility of taking any course that could lead to consequences so formidable. That was the last authentic news that reached us. His Irish colleagues had no news at all. After this glimpse the curtain had fallen, and all oracles fell dumb.|$|E

50|$|In the 21st century, the status-quo of the {{international}} system is no longer monopolized by states alone. Rather, it is the presence of non-state actors, who autonomously act to implement unpredictable behaviour to {{the international}} system. Whether it is transnational corporations, liberation movements, non-governmental agencies, or international organizations, these entities have the potential to significantly influence the outcome of any <b>international</b> <b>transaction.</b> Additionally, this also includes the individual person as while the individual is what constitutes the states collective entity, the individual does have the potential to also create unpredicted behaviours. Al-Qaeda, {{as an example of a}} non-state actor, has significantly influenced the way states (and non-state actors) conduct international affairs.|$|E

However, the EU Regulation does not apply to all SEPA countries; the most significant difference is the inclusion of Switzerland in SEPA but not the EU. The rule of the same price applies, even if the transaction is sent as an <b>international</b> <b>transaction</b> instead of a SEPA transaction (common before 2008, or if any involved bank does not support SEPA transactions). The regulation 924/2009 does not regulate charges for currency conversion so charges for non-euro transactions can still be applied (if not banned by national law).|$|E

Statistically, the more payment options a merchant is able to offer, the likelihood of reaching more consumers increases.The various payment methods available world-wide is overwhelming, nevertheless the payment methods available in a specific market are influenced by the local laws, legislations, culture and level of development. For merchants this creates a challenge of adapting their systems to accept a wide range of payment methods in order to enter a market with their offerings.|$|E
