5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved <b>dosing</b> <b>regimen</b> maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{number of}} novel oral {{anticoagulants}} (direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors) are in clinical use for various indications. The <b>dosing</b> <b>regimens</b> differ between twice-daily and once-daily dosing {{for the prevention}} of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the availability of the results from four phase 3 studies (. 70, 000 patients), we explored whether twice-daily or once-daily dosing provides better risk-benefit balance among novel oral anticoagulants.

A short-term phase 1 study in healthy volunteers was conducted to evaluate the relative bioavailability, safety, and tolerability of mipomersen in 2 test <b>dose</b> <b>regimens</b> {{in reference to the}} 200 mg weekly <b>dose</b> <b>regimen.</b> Eighty-four adults were randomized to 1 of 3 cohorts (30 mg once daily, 70 mg 3 times weekly, or 200 mg once weekly) and then mipomersen or placebo (3 : 1 ratio) for 3 weeks of treatment. Comparable mipomersen post-distribution phase plasma concentrations were observed across the 3 <b>dose</b> <b>regimens</b> suggesting similar tissue exposure. Injection site reactions were reported, but did not lead to treatment discontinuation. The median incidence of these responses per injection was decreased by lowering the dose.

40|$|Inappropriate {{cortisol}} replacement {{has been}} proposed as a contributing factor in the increased morbidity and mortality associated with hypopituitarism. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the effect of three commonly prescribed hydrocortisone replacement regimens on predefined metabolic end points and quality of life (QoL) in male subjects with severe adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) deficiency with a view to identifying the most physiologic regimen. 10 hypopituitary men participated in a prospective, randomised, crossover, open protocol of 6 weeks on each of the following regimens: Dose A (20 mg AM, 10 mg PM), Dose B (10 mg AM, 10 mg PM), Dose C (10 mg AM, 5 mg PM). Results were compared between <b>dose</b> <b>regimens</b> and to healthy control subjects. The lowest <b>dose</b> <b>regimen,</b> <b>dose</b> C (10 mg/ 5 mg), was associated with a 24 hour serum cortisol profile that most closely approximated that of the control subjects, without any difference in QoL between doses. There were significant increases in serum markers of bone formation in the lower <b>dose</b> <b>regimen</b> <b>dose</b> C, with an 86 % increase in procollagen type I N-propeptide (PINP), and a 56 % increase in intact osteocalcin (OC[1 - 49]) compared to dose A, without concurrent increases in bone resorption markers. These findings reflect a more positive bone remodelling balance in the lowest <b>dose</b> <b>regimen,</b> resulting in net bone gain. Tissue exposure to cortisol was assessed by examining 24 hour urinary cortisol metabolites. Dose A (20 mg/ 10 mg) was associated with significantly higher total cortisol metabolites compared to the two other <b>dose</b> <b>regimens</b> and compared to healthy controls. We also demonstrated increased tissue cortisol exposure across all <b>dose</b> <b>regimens</b> compared to healthy controls; however it was highest with dose A. There was no difference between <b>dose</b> <b>regimens</b> or compared to controls in glucose or insulin metabolism or in 24 hour blood pressure. Dose C (10 mg/ 5 mg) was associated with a reduction in the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and a more physiological nocturnal blood pressure dip which may indicate a more favourable vascular status. This study demonstrates a lower <b>dose</b> hydrocortisone replacement <b>regimen</b> in severe ACTH deficiency is associated with a more favourable metabolic profile without adversely affecting QoL.

40|$|Successful {{treatment}} of many diseases {{depends on the}} level of drug concentration in blood and its maintenance {{over a period of time}} around a value considered as therapeutic. The <b>dose</b> <b>regimen</b> that minimizes the underexposure and overexposure around the target concentration maximizes efficacy and safety, resulting in increased chances of a successful patient recovery. We present a method of computer-assisted dose finding by explicit optimization of a target criterion. We develop a general theory for such <b>dose</b> <b>regimens</b> and propose criteria for their computation. This approach is likely to supersede "brute force" techniques exclusively based on simulation. In case of a combination of two drugs in a single dosing unit, it is crucial that the optimal combination ratio is identified during the developmental process and is taken forward to further trials or approval. The algorithm computes the optimal ratio along with the optimal <b>dose</b> <b>regimen.</b> If the interest is in restricting the concentration profile of the drug to a therapeutic range, we adapt the algorithm to determine the optimal <b>dose</b> <b>regimen.</b> In future, this work is intended to aid the development of fixed dose combinations, especially antimalarials and other anti-infectives. The methodology also has potential applications in randomized concentration-controlled trials where adherence to the target concentration is a fundamental requirement. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{conventional}} {{in vitro}} models simulate pharmacodynamics of antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, we propose a novel pharmacodynamic model of ofloxacin activity {{in the treatment of}} P. aeruginosa biofilm. MethodsP. aeruginosa biofilm carrying coupons were suspended in a continuous flow central compartment bioreactor (CCB). In the CCB, the pharmacokinetics of different ofloxacin <b>dosing</b> <b>regimens</b> were simulated. Samples from the coupons and the CCB were assessed for viability of the biofilm and the shedding planktonic cells, respectively, over 24 h. In addition, ofloxacin concentrations were assessed in each sample withdrawn for the CCB using bioassay method. ResultsThe microbiological outcomes on P. aeruginosa biofilm and the shedding planktonic cells in response to different ofloxacin <b>dosing</b> <b>regimens</b> were not parallel and this may explain the non-coincidence of microbiological and clinical outcomes with biofilm associated infections. ConclusionThe current study has introduced unprecedented novel dynamic model for the assessment of the microbiological outcome on both biofilm and shedding planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa in response to different <b>dosing</b> <b>regimens</b> of ofloxacin which in turn can simulate the clinical outcomes in biofilm associated infections of P. aeruginosa, e. g. cystic fibrosis.
