Because Constantin Film, who had acquired the rights to the series, weren't willing to spend more money than they already had on failed attempts (including a script by George A.

If they liked it, he would sell it to them as a Resident Evil film; if not, he would take it elsewhere and try to make it unrelated to the games. Anderson saw the film as a prequel of sorts to the first game in the series, and as such didn't put any characters from the games in it, a fact which was criticized by fans. Instead, the film stars Milla Jovovich as an original character named Alice. Jovovich, who is the only actor that reprised her role in all six films of the series, began dating with Anderson after the two met on this film, and they eventually had children and got married together. In comparison to Anderson's previous two films, Resident Evil was produced on a moderate budget of $33 million and became a commercial success of little over $100 million at the box office. The film also performed strongly on home video. Critically Resident Evil wasn't received well, although, similarly to Mortal Kombat, some reviews characterized it as one of the better attempts at adapting a video game.

The time the rockfowl spends incubating varies greatly, though it is mostly for {{less than five minutes}} at a time with nearly two hours between sessions. Both the male and female rockfowl incubate. When the incubating bird's mate comes, it gives a brief call that causes the incubating bird to leave the nest. In the two days prior to hatching, the adult rockfowl prods at the eggs, sometimes with food in its beak. Incubation lasts for 21 to 24 days. When the infants hatch, they hatch about a day apart. The adult rockfowl quickly remove the eggshell fragments from the nest. The newborn weighs only [...] after hatching, but it quickly gains weight. The eyes open and the tail begins to grow on the fifth day. During the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> food is brought to the nestlings three to six times an hour, peaking in the evening. Begging nestlings expose their beak and gape to their parent, though they do not make a sound. The second-hatched nestling often fails to gain weight and dies, and there is evidence suggesting that the adults cannibalize the remains. For the first ten days after hatching, one adult rockfowl stays and guards the nestlings while the other collects food; despite this, nests have been destroyed by chimpanzees and drills. The chicks leave the nest after 24 days. Infanticide has been recorded in this species, with rockfowl killing other rockfowl's young. In one case, a second pair of rockfowl moved onto a nest after killing the first pair's nestlings.|$|E

40|$|Orthodontic tooth {{movement}} is induced my mechanical stimuli and {{facilitated by the}} remodeling of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. The remodeling activities and the ultimately tooth displacement are the consequence of an inflammatory process. Vascular and cellular changes were the first events to be recognized and described. With the advancement of research techniques an important number of inflammatory mediators, growth factors, neuropeptides and metabolites of arachidonic acid have been detected in the surrounding periodontal tissue. Most of them are produced in sufficient amounts to diffuse into the gingival crevicular fluid and their analysis {{has been used to}} evaluate the local cellular metabolism that accompanies bone remodeling process during orthodontic tooth movement. Gingival inflammation, discomfort or pain and root resorption are common undesirable side effects of orthodontic treatment. Gingival health is compromised during orthodontic treatment because of alterations in the composition of bacterial plaque and consequently the development of gingivitis, especially when fixed orthodontic appliances are used. Discomfort or pain is reported by most patients during the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> or <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> treatment and comes from the compression of periodontal ligament after application of the orthodontic force. As for root resorption, {{it has been reported that}} almost all roots, shortly after the application of orthodontic force present histologically small areas of surface resorption. In most cases this resorption does not decrease the functional capacity of the involved teeth, but in other cases the degree of resoprtion may become important, resulting in an unfavourable crown/root ratio and thus less periodontal support for the tooth, decreasing its longevity. In the present thesis, the following questions are addressed: • What are the clinical and biochemical characteristics accompanying the inflammatory process of periodontal tissues around teeth subjected to forces by fixed orthodontic appliances? • Does the composition of gingival crevicular fluid change in relation to the type of force exerted on the periodontium (tension or compression) during the early phase of orthodontic treatment? • Does a common orthodontic procedure such as the placement of elastic separators result in discomfort or pain to the patients and is there an association between the expression of pain-related molecules in the GCF and the perceived intensity of pain? • Do the standardized clinical periodontal parameters obtained during orthodontic treatment could be related to the cervical root resorption observed after tratement? • What is the diagnostic accuracy of digitized periapical radiographs in detecting orthodontically induced apical root resorption? • Does the use of orthopantomograph can help the clinician to make the decision on continuation and /or possible modification of orthodontic treatment because of orthodontically induced root resorption...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentors: Dr. Vincent DeMarco and Dr. Jeffrey Skimming, Child HealthEach year {{approximately}} 30, 000 premature {{babies are}} {{delivered in the}} United States. Ten percent of these babies will develop pulmonary hypertension in the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> their lives due to incomplete development of their hearts. Some of them will live to a young age; others will die only weeks after their birth. Our laboratory {{is devoted to the}} study of pulmonary hypertension. To develop our study we looked to help our body enhance its own response to such a problem. What could that response be we asked? Well, what is the first thing you check when you think your sick? Your temperature of course. Most people do not realize that your body intentionally increases its temperature to help ward of sicknesses and injuries. Increasing an animal's body temperature above normal for a short period is known as heat shocking. Heat shocking causes cells in the body to produce heat shock proteins that act to protect cells from damage caused by various inflammatory agents. This kind of stress preconditioning with heat shock has been shown to increase survivorship during certain types of lethal forms of infection in animals. Endotoxin, an extract of bacterial cell coats, can cause infection-like symptoms in animals. Administration of this drug is an excellent model of pulmonary hypertension. Endotoxin causes cells in the lungs to overproduce the gas, nitric oxide, which causes lung injury and inflammation. These symptoms are, according to scientist today, the mediators of pulmonary hypertension pathology. Recently, studies from our laboratory and others have shown that nitric oxide itself formed within the lungs is a cause of lung injury. Furthermore, measurement of the amount of nitric oxide exhaled by the lungs is an easy and noninvasive method of evaluating the severity of this injury. In this experiment, our laboratory showed that stress preconditioning with heat shock twenty hours prior to infection with endotoxin can protect against lung injury. Also, results indicated that a level of nitric oxide produced in the lungs was raised to abnormally high in endotoxemic animals. However, in rats that were heat shock preconditioned showed only a low increase in nitric oxide due to endotoxin. With this data along with other results, we determined that heat shock preconditioning can protect against lung injury...|$|R
2500|$|The Battle of Cambrai showed {{continuity}} {{with the previous}} Franco-British offensives in 1917. Novel features, mainly {{in the use of}} artillery, tank-infantry co-operation, air power over the battlefield and the holding back of the assault divisions until just before the attack, resulted from the evolution of technique. The experience of trying to move heavy artillery forward during the advance to the Hindenburg line [...] in March was found particularly useful. Tanks were no longer unusual and their presence in large numbers, left artillery free for counter-battery neutralisation rather than destruction of barbed wire and other field fortifications, which made the surprise attack feasible, given the secret deployment of artillery reinforcements. The attempt to surprise the German defence precluded extensive work on transport and supply infrastructure behind the front, which caused the same sort of difficulties in maintaining momentum that crater fields did elsewhere in 1917. After the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> the battle became another wearing-out operation, using up German reinforcements as they arrived, which when suspended on 28 November, gave the Germans time to mass for a counter-offensive on 30 November. More German forces were available due the closure of the eastern front {{and the end of the}} period when German forces were pinned down by the battle in Flanders. The course of the German counter-offensive, which was the biggest German attack in the west since Verdun in 1916, demonstrated that the constraints on advances encountered by the British and French armies were not unique. The ground gained in the German attack of 30 November, was much less than intended and part of it was then lost to British counter-attacks. After this limited success, attritional fighting resumed, until the British abandoned the salient at Bourlon Wood.|$|E
