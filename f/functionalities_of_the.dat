Leon released the initial version within two months of having been assigned the job; after receiving positive feedback from the artists using the software, Leon kept updating various <b>functionalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> software over the years. This digital 3D film review software, itView, led Leon to get an Academy Award in 2016. Leon mentions working alone on the project for many years, and that he was over time given a team when the project achieved significant growth. In a 2016 media interview, Leon says that he worked on the itView technology for eight years as the chief contributor.|$|E

No responsibility {{can be held}} by London This project explores a curriculum’s ability to provide insight into <b>the</b> <b>functionality</b> <b>of</b> a microcontroller based educational system. As a case study, the project worked exclusively with the Stamps in Class Educational Kit. Human factors evaluation methods {{were used to assess}} the curriculum’s ability to provide insight into <b>the</b> <b>functionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. The factors preventing users from gaining insight into <b>the</b> <b>functionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system were isolated and discussed. Finally, solutions were provided in an attempt to eliminate or reduce <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors preventing users from gaining insight into <b>the</b> <b>functionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. Naturalistic observation and objective textual analysis revealed that four factors prevented users from gaining insight into <b>the</b> <b>functionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. First, frequent errors prevented users from completing the lessons. Second, a lack of text devoted to discussing <b>the</b> <b>functionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. Third, <b>the</b> invisibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system prevented users from observing the system in operation. Lastly, <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> a paper based curriculum prevented users from understanding <b>the</b> complex <b>functionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system...|$|R
