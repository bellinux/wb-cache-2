Several supporting characters from Conviction reappear, including Victor Coste, Patricia Caldwell, and Andriy Kobin. There is also a cameo from former 3rd <b>Echelon</b> agents Archer and Kestrel.|$|E
5|$|In early-1941 Stalin {{authorized}} the State Defense Plan 1941 (DP-41), which {{along with the}} Mobilization Plan 1941 (MP-41), called for the deployment of 186 divisions, as the first strategic <b>echelon,</b> in the four military districts of the western Soviet Union that faced the Axis territories; and the deployment of another 51 divisions along the Dvina and Dnieper Rivers as the second strategic <b>echelon</b> under Stavka control, which {{in the case of}} a German invasion was tasked to spearhead a Soviet counteroffensive along with the remaining forces of the first <b>echelon.</b> But on 22 June 1941 the first <b>echelon</b> only contained 171 divisions, numbering 2.6–2.9 million; and the second strategic <b>echelon</b> contained 57 divisions that were still mobilizing, most of which were still understrength. The second <b>echelon</b> was undetected by German intelligence until days after the invasion commenced, in most cases only when German ground forces bumped into them.|$|E
5|$|Hargest, {{with the}} rank of brigadier, left New Zealand with the Second <b>Echelon,</b> in which his brigade (which {{comprised}} the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Battalions) was the largest formation, in May 1940. Originally intended to join the First <b>Echelon</b> of 2NZEF then in Egypt, it was diverted en route to England following {{the threat of a}} German invasion. The brigade carried out training and guard duties in the area around Dover before being shipped to Egypt in early 1941.|$|E

5|$|Operation Badr {{called for}} an {{enlargement}} of the bridgeheads on October 8. To accomplish this, {{each of the five}} infantry divisions had to reorganize its forces. Mechanized infantry brigades in the second <b>echelon</b> of divisional lines were to advance between the two forward infantry brigades. Thus the mechanized brigade would form the first line, the two infantry brigades would form the second line, and the reserve armored brigade would constitute a third <b>echelon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The aircrews trained {{continuously}} until May. Each bombardier {{completed at}} least 50 practice drops of inert pumpkin bombs before Tibbets declared his group combat-ready. The ground support <b>echelon</b> of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945 to its {{port of embarkation}} at Seattle, Washington. On 6 May the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. An advance party of the air <b>echelon</b> flew by C-54 to North Field, Tinian, between 15 and 22 May. It was joined by the ground <b>echelon</b> on 29 May 1945, marking the group's official change of station. It was from Tinian that it carried out the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Caldwell assigns Fisher, his {{colleague}} Charlie Cole, CIA agent Isaac Briggs and Anna Grímsdóttir to Fourth <b>Echelon,</b> a new special-ops and counter-terrorism unit. Charged with stopping the Engineers, the group uses the cargo plane Paladin as its command center. Fourth <b>Echelon</b> first aims to secure Andriy Kobin, a CIA hostage believed to possess {{information on the}} Engineers. Fisher extracts him from a safe house in Benghazi, and learns that his associates have ties to the Engineers. Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold, he finds an executed U.S. soldier and learns from a video recording that the executioner is Majid Sadiq; a former MI6 agent, Sadiq demands the Fourth <b>Echelon</b> to stop interfering.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Hambrick and Mason (1984) {{researchers}} have devoted significant attention to exploring how the human side of managers, such as their backgrounds and psychological characteristics, influence the decisions they make (Nielsen 2010). However the upper <b>echelons</b> research {{in the last three}} decades has been equivocal {{in the light of the}} question “Do top executives really matter as much to company outcomes as the theory seems to presume?” This paper set to review the literature on upper <b>echelons</b> research and theory. Our review highlights that, (1) upper <b>echelons</b> theory is still relevant to strategic management today as it was three decades ago, and (2) in line with Hambrick (2007) top executives really matter to company outcomes as they make decisions and engage in behaviors that affect the health, wealth, and welfare of firms – but they do so as flawed human beings. Key concerns of our highlight are, (1) the concentration of upper <b>echelons</b> research in the United States of America and, (2) the near-absence of upper <b>echelons</b> research in Africa. Finally our review highlights a number of future research directions...|$|R

Nouri confirms that Sadiq {{is head of the}} Engineers, and says that Sadiq knows the identities of the Fourth <b>Echelon</b> leaders. Escaping from the prison, Briggs and Fisher reach the Paladin in Yucatán and escape when the plane is attacked by a Mexican drug cartel. Fourth <b>Echelon</b> restarts the plane with Kobin's help, and Sadiq executes a Blacklist attack on the largest U.S. gas reserve in Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|C Squadron {{completed}} its training in New Zealand and {{was attached to}} the Second <b>Echelon</b> of the 2NZEF, in adherence with plans to send one squadron of the regiment to Egypt with the Second <b>Echelon.</b> The squadron was diverted to Britain, while en route to Egypt, when Italy entered the war, and arrived on 16 June. The squadron was based near Aldershot and conducted further training there. C Squadron became part of the Second Echelon's Headquarters Covering Force, defending Britain against German invasion. In early September, the squadron was moved to Westwell, Kent; it underwent further training and was sent back to Aldershot in November. C Squadron left Britain for Egypt on 4 January 1941.|$|E

5|$|No.1 Wing was {{restructured}} from July 1944. On 1July, No.452 and No.457 Squadrons {{were transferred}} to No. 80 Wing RAAF, which had been formed to conduct offensive operations in the NEI {{under the command of}} Clive Caldwell. They were replaced by two British units; No.548 and No.549 Squadrons RAF. This put the wing in a unique position: all of its flying squadrons were now British units. The new RAF squadrons had been formed in Australia, {{as a result of a}} further meeting between H.V. Evatt and Winston Churchill in July 1943, at which Evatt had requested additional RAF units. They were formed from British pilots and Australian ground crew at Lawnton, Queensland on 15December 1943 but did not receive their Mark VIII Spitfires until April the next year. No.548 Squadron was initially stationed at Livingstone Airfield, and its air <b>echelon</b> arrived there on 10 June after a flight in which four Spitfires made forced landings when they ran low on fuel. No. 549Squadron's air <b>echelon</b> arrived at Strauss Airfield on 16 June and its rear <b>echelon</b> completed its movement from Queensland on 14 July. On 20July, two No.54 Squadron Spitfires operating out of Truscott Airstrip shot down a Dinah. This was the last Japanese aircraft to be destroyed over Northern Australia.|$|E

5|$|The five division-size bridgeheads {{consolidated}} {{themselves on}} Monday, October 8 into two army-size bridgeheads: the Second Army with its three divisions occupied El-Qantarah {{in the north}} to Deversoir in the south, while the Third Army with two divisions occupied {{the southern end of}} the Bitter Lakes to a point southeast of Port Tawfiq (at the far end of the canal). These two bridgeheads incorporated a total of 90,000 men and 980 tanks, dug in and entrenched. Each division deployed, in accordance with Operation Badr, two infantry brigades in its forward <b>echelon,</b> and one mechanized infantry brigade in the second <b>echelon.</b> In reserve was one armored brigade. The Egyptians had established anti-tank defences along their lines employing Sagger ATGMs, RPGs, B-10 and B-11 anti tank recoilless rifles.|$|E
