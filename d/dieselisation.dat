5|$|The Leader {{project was}} part of Bulleid's desire to modernise the steam {{locomotive}} based on experience gained with the Southern Railway's fleet of electric stock. Bulleid considered that attitudes towards the labour-intensity of steam operation had changed during the post-war period, favouring <b>dieselisation</b> and electrification. In an effort to demonstrate the continued potential of steam, Bulleid pushed forward the boundaries of steam-power, allowing it to compete with diesel and electric locomotives in terms of labour-saving and ease of operation.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when <b>dieselisation</b> and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dieselisation</b> {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were then {{followed by the}} T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{standard}} gauge experience, <b>dieselisation</b> of the CAR led to a reduction of 60% of operating costs over steam.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of the 1950s, British Railways were making a working profit, albeit a small one. However, Britain had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in terms of <b>dieselisation</b> and {{electrification}} of its railways. There were political as well as practical reasons behind the resistance to <b>dieselisation</b> in particular: the Labour Government of Clement Attlee did not want to significantly reduce the demand for domestically-produced coal in favour of imported oil, thus both affecting the balance of payments and potentially causing unemployment. Robin Riddles, who was effectively the British Railways' Chief Mechanical Engineer, disagreed with the <b>dieselisation</b> programme, arguing that it would be too expensive to import oil given the large amounts of domestically available coal. He continued to order steam locomotives on a large scale and from 1948 to 1953, 1,487 steam locomotives were built.|$|E
25|$|After the 1955 Modernisation Plan, the {{reduction}} in branch line work {{and the introduction of}} diesel shunters, the Western Region embarked on <b>dieselisation</b> programme which, along with a reduction in branch line work, reduced the demand for the services of the 5700s.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the {{destruction}} of most of the nation's infrastructure during the Second World War, and the cost of electrification and <b>dieselisation,</b> new steam locomotives were built in Japan until 1960. The number of Japanese steam locomotives reached a peak of 5,958 in 1946.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the K class was such that even in 1953, when <b>dieselisation</b> was already {{underway}} on Victorian Railways, the basic design of the K class was updated into the J class 2-8-0, the final class of steam locomotives to be introduced to the Victorian Railways.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 Queensland's new Country-Liberal {{government}} under Frank Nicklin commissioned consultants Ford, Bacon and Davis {{to report on}} the Railway Department's efficiency, facilities and operations. Their recommendations were numerous, and included a total abandonment of electrification in favour of <b>dieselisation,</b> and steam engines were phased out from 1960.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{nationalisation}} saw sweeping {{changes in the}} national railway network. A process of <b>dieselisation</b> and electrification took place, and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction, except for one narrow-gauge tourist line. Passengers replaced freight as {{the main source of}} business, and one-third of the network was closed by the Beeching Axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies.|$|E
25|$|The B {{class are}} {{a class of}} diesel {{locomotives}} built by Clyde Engineering, Granville for the Victorian Railways in 1952-1953. Ordered and operated by the Victorian Railways, they initiated the <b>dieselisation</b> {{of the system and}} saw use on both passenger and freight services, with many remaining in service today, both in preserved and revenue service. Some were rebuilt as the V/Line A class, while others have been scrapped.|$|E
25|$|While costing £80 per {{horsepower}} {{compared to}} £60 for steam, the new locomotives ran 130,000 miles per year, compared to 35,000 and 60,000 miles {{per year for}} main line steam locomotives. The Chief Engineers Office found that one B class did the work of three steam locomotives. Their success led to further <b>dieselisation,</b> with the delivery of the T class branch line units from 1955, and the single ended S class mainline units from 1957.|$|E
25|$|The Milwaukee Road enjoyed {{temporary}} success after World War II. Out {{of bankruptcy}} {{and with the}} wartime ban on new passenger service lifted, the company upgraded its trains. The Olympian Hiawatha began running between Chicago and the Puget Sound over the Pacific Extension in 1947, and the Twin Cities Hiawathas received new equipment in 1948. <b>Dieselisation</b> accelerated and was complete by 1956. In 1955, the Milwaukee took over from the Chicago and North Western {{the handling of the}} Union Pacific's Overland Route streamliners between Chicago and Omaha.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dieselisation</b> in Malaya began {{immediately}} after MR's formation with {{the launch of}} its first diesel engine, a Class 15 shunter, in 1948. Efforts by MR to fully convert to diesel power between the 1950s and 1970s effectively drove steam locomotives out of service - with whatever left of the fleet massively retired in 1972. KTM drew its diesel rolling stock from a multitude of locomotive companies from England, Japan, Canada, and more recently, India, Germany and China. The company had also ventured {{in the use of}} DMUs (railbus, railcars); none of these services survived.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dieselisation</b> {{began in}} the late 1940s with {{shunting}} locomotives. The first mainline diesel locomotives, the English Electric DF class, was introduced in 1954, but it wasn't until the introduction of the DA class the following year that steam began to be seriously displaced in the North Island. The last steam locomotive to be built by NZR, JA 1274, was introduced into service in December 1956, and by 1967, steam had all but disappeared from the North Island. Steam remained in the South Island until November 1971, when the last seven JA locomotives that worked the Main South Line were withdrawn from revenue service, steam in the South Island having been displaced by the Dj class locomotive.|$|E
25|$|Part of the Contract with BRCW stipulated that, {{in view of}} its 42 {{years of}} {{experience}} in loco design, Sulzer were to accept full responsibility for the design and performance of the completed loco (6). The CR had knowledge of Sulzer since the appointment of Deane as its Engineer in Chief of Construction of the Trans-Australian line. Deane had proposed {{in the early days of}} the TAR that <b>dieselisation</b> was the way to go, and had considered early Sulzer designs then. (Some have suggested that the CR worked with the South Australian Railways to trial diesel traction)., However, the technology was not developed enough to be reliable. Deane was a generation ahead of his time.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{appeared to}} endorse the 1955 programme (costing £1.2billion), but did so largely for political reasons. This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives. Not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs. The <b>dieselisation</b> programme gave contracts primarily to British suppliers, who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture, and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs, {{and a lack of}} standardisation. At the same time containerised freight was being developed. The marshalling yard building programme was a failure, being based on a belief in the continued viability of wagon load traffic in the face of increasingly effective road competition, and lacking effective forward planning or realistic assessments of future freight.|$|E
25|$|After 1945, {{problems}} associated with post-war reconstruction {{and the availability of}} cheap domestic-produced coal kept steam in widespread use throughout the two following decades. However the ready availability of cheap oil led to new <b>dieselisation</b> programmes from 1955, and these began to take full effect from around 1962. Towards the end of the steam era, steam motive power fell into a state of disrepair. The last steam locomotive built for mainline British Railways was BR Standard Class 9F 92220 Evening Star, which was completed in March 1960. The last steam-hauled service trains on the British Railways network ran in 1968, but the use of steam locomotives in British industry continued into the 1980s. In June 1975, there were still 41 locations where steam was in regular use, and many more where engines were maintained in reserve in case of diesel failures. Gradually, the decline of the ironstone quarries, steel, coal mining and shipbuilding industries – and the plentiful supply of redundant British Rail diesel shunters as replacements – led to the end of steam power for commercial uses.|$|E
25|$|The rapid <b>dieselisation</b> and {{electrification}} of Victorian Railways' mainline {{operations in}} the 1950s meant that the X class was rendered obsolete as the new B class diesel-electrics and L class electrics proved their superiority over steam for heavy freight work. Withdrawals commenced in 1957 and accelerated with the delivery of the S class diesel-electric locomotives from August that year, with the diesel fleet by then large enough for the X class to be displaced from mainline goods haulage. A report comparing total operating costs per mile (including fuel, oil, crewing, maintenance, depreciation and interest) for locomotives in freight service found an S class diesel-electric cost 68.41 pence per mile versus 261.01 pence per mile for the X class steam locomotive. The X class locomotives were increasingly relegated to short-hop transfer goods haulage, a role that as mainline goods locomotives they were unsuitable for. On 12 April 1957 X43 became {{the first of the}} class to be scrapped, {{and by the end of}} 1960 all were withdrawn and all but one had been scrapped.|$|E
500|$|Repairs to {{the class}} were {{undertaken}} at Crewe, Swindon and Doncaster Works until the financial constraints of the British Railways Modernisation Plan in terms of expenditure on steam began to preclude the regular [...] of locomotives. During the mid-1960s s were carried out exclusively at Crewe Works. The first locomotive to be withdrawn from service was number 70007 [...] "Coeur-de-Lion" [...] in 1965, and the entire class was gradually transferred to Carlisle Kingmoor and Glasgow Polmadie depots as steam was displaced by the [...] <b>dieselisation</b> of British Railways. A succession of bulk withdrawals began in 1967, and the last, of number 70013 [...] "Oliver Cromwell", took place in 1968, {{at the very end}} of steam operation in Britain. Subsequently, that locomotive was selected to represent the class in the National Collection. Only 70000 [...] "Britannia", which was privately preserved, saw main line service during the preservation era – until 2008, when 70013 [...] "Oliver Cromwell"'s restoration was completed, and she worked part of the [...] "15 Guinea Special" [...] – a special train run to commemorate the final BR steam working in 1968. 70013 is now to be found operating main line railtours over the Network Rail system.|$|E
500|$|In August 1958, number 72009 {{was tested}} on the Eastern Region, being based at Stratford MPD, though a {{preference}} for the Britannias meant that this sojourn was short-lived, lasting only a month. The locomotive was utilised on services from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, Clacton, and Harwich. [...] At first they were mistakenly allocated Class 7 duties, in which the Clans, although capable, {{were not able to}} keep to their allotted timings. [...] This was part of the trials for the West Highland Line services mentioned earlier, but the locomotive was rejected for such duties {{on the grounds that they}} were [...] "no better than a good B1". [...] The result of these trials was that as both Standard Class 7 and 8 locomotives were moved north in 1961 after <b>dieselisation</b> started in earnest, the Clans were downgraded to secondary work. Maintenance was initially undertaken at Crewe Works, but responsibility was transferred to Cowlairs Works in the spring of 1958. [...] More varied work was allocated to them as their reliability improved, including working portions of the Thames-Clyde Express and the Queen of Scots Pullman. They also deputised for the many failed diesel locomotives that plagued the network at the time, and were extensively used on freight workings.|$|E
2500|$|By 1970, steam {{locomotives}} {{had been}} almost entirely withdrawn from New Zealand. [...] The North Island had been completely dieselised {{by the end of}} 1967, and the 1968 introduction of the DJ class had led to the <b>dieselisation</b> of almost all of the South Island's services.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the booming}} post-war Japanese economy, steam {{locomotives}} were gradually withdrawn from main line service {{beginning in the}} early 1960s, and were replaced with diesel and electric locomotives. They were relegated to branch line and sub-main line services for several more years until the late 1960s, when electrification and <b>dieselisation</b> began to increase. From 1970 onwards, steam locomotion was gradually abolished on the JNR: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the line, small tank {{locomotives}} such as the F class were used to run trains from the junction in Riversdale, but in the later years, considerably larger tender locomotives such as the A class were used. [...] Apart from the 1926-31 experiment with the Model T Ford railcars, the line was always operated by steam locomotives; it closed before <b>dieselisation</b> began in Southland to any substantial degree.|$|E
2500|$|... 130 of {{the class}} of 155 were built at Brighton, 15 (80000–80009, 80054–80058) at Derby Works and 10 (80106–80115) at Doncaster Works between 1951 and 1956. The first to emerge was 80010 from Brighton in 1951. Fifteen that were due to be {{constructed}} in 1957 were cancelled due to impending <b>dieselisation,</b> and the last five would have been too had they not been at an advanced stage of construction when the order came to cancel them.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1967 <b>dieselisation</b> {{began in}} earnest {{with the arrival of}} DSC class and DJ class locomotivess. [...] A year later, the WW class had been largely {{replaced}} by DSCs beyond Waimangaroa. [...] By mid-1969 steam power had ended, and DJ locomotives, joined by the DC class in the 1980s, became the predominant motive power. [...] With the de-electrification of the Otira Tunnel on the Midland Line {{in the latter half of}} the 1990s, motive power changed to powerful DX class locomotives modified to operate through the tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1875, three C class 0-4-2T tank {{locomotives}} {{were shipped}} to Westport in readiness {{for the opening}} to Fairdown. [...] It soon became apparent that greater motive power was required, and in 1898 four WB class tanks were delivered. [...] Three decades later they were followed by WW class tank locomotives, {{the first of which}} arrived in 1929, which were the mainstay until <b>dieselisation.</b> [...] However, the WWs were limited on the steep 1 in 33 gradient beyond Seddonville to the Mokihinui Mine, capable of hauling only 180 tons. [...] Occasionally other steam locomotives operated, including UC class tender locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, {{there were}} four Leeds-Wetherby-Harrogate weekday {{services}} and twelve stopping services to Wetherby, with most services continuing to [...] and Church Fenton. For a while a - route ran through Wetherby station. The line went into decline under British Railways despite <b>dieselisation</b> in 1958, eliminating the problem of trackside fires. By the end of 1963, Leeds to Wetherby services {{had been reduced to}} four on weekdays together with an extra service on Saturdays. At the same time, long-distance passenger services had increased, with two overnight services being transferred to the line in 1959 and during 1961–1963 two [...] to Liverpool diesel expresses each way used the route.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1960, the Bundesbahn in West Germany {{began to}} phase out all steam-hauled trains {{over a period of}} ten years, but still had about 5,000 of them in running condition. Even though DB were very {{assertive}} in continuing the electrification on the main lines – in 1963 they reached [...] of electrified routes – and <b>dieselisation</b> with new developed stock, they had not completely removed steam locomotives within the ten-year goal. In 1972, the Hamburg and Frankfurt departments of the DB rail networks became the first to no longer operate steam locomotives in their areas. The remaining steam locomotives began to gather in rail yards in Rheine, Tübingen, Hof, Saarbrücken, Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck and others, which soon became popular with rail enthusiasts.|$|E
2500|$|By 1953 the new {{mainline}} diesels {{were running}} [...] a week, {{four times as}} far as the best steam locomotives. An hour had been cut from long-distance passenger trains to Adelaide, Bairnsdale, Warrnambool, Mildura, and others were also sped up with the delivery of further locomotives. Electrification of the Gippsland line was completed to Warragul in 1954 and to Traralgon in 1956 at a total cost of £6.3 million, but electrification did not spread to the other country railways as originally intended by Operation Phoenix, as the new diesel locomotives were more cost effective than the electrics. <b>Dieselisation</b> of the Victorian Railways continued, with the T class branchline locomotives delivered from 1955. Operation Phoenix was also the peak of capital spending on the Victorian railways, the expenditure during 1950-51 was not exceeded until 1984-85.|$|E
2500|$|R719 and 748 were {{converted}} to oil-firing during the mid-1950s using oil tanks and burner equipment salvaged from the four scrapped S class steam locomotives. They performed very well and were [...] favourites among crews for their clean, cinder-free running. The reduced maintenance associated with their oil-fired operation meant they also had the highest availability {{of any of the}} R class and as such recorded the highest mileages of any of the class. [...] However, rising fuel oil costs and the ongoing <b>dieselisation</b> program on the VR precluded any further locomotives from being converted. R743 {{was in the process of}} conversion to oil firing as part of a major overhaul in February 1957 when instructions were issued to halt the conversion program and was returned to service as a coal fired locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States on the Southern Pacific Railroad, {{a series}} of cab forward {{locomotives}} were produced with the cab and the firebox {{at the front of}} the locomotive and the tender behind the smokebox, so that the engine appeared to run backwards. This was only possible by using oil-firing. Southern Pacific selected this design to provide air free of smoke for the engine driver to breathe as the locomotive passed through mountain tunnels and snow sheds. Another variation was the Camelback locomotive, with the cab situated halfway along the boiler. In England, Oliver Bulleid developed the SR Leader class locomotive during the nationalisation process in the late 1940s. The locomotive was heavily tested but several design faults (such as coal firing and sleeve valves) meant that this locomotive and the other part-built locomotives were scrapped. The cab-forward design was taken by Bulleid to Ireland, where he moved after nationalisation, where he developed the [...] "turfburner". This locomotive was more successful, but was scrapped due to the <b>dieselisation</b> of the Irish railways.|$|E
2500|$|The Ohai Railway Board used {{locomotives}} {{bought from}} the Railways Department as motive power - initially one C and two FA class locomotives, later {{replaced by an}} X class tender engine and a WAB class tank locomotive. [...] Upon <b>dieselisation</b> in the 1960s, small diesel shunters such as a DSA class were used, and then a DJ class locomotive was employed. [...] In the early 1990s the Ohai line was incorporated into the national network and the line beyond Wairio {{became known as the}} Ohai Industrial Line. [...] The motive power used on the line from this stage was the same as that employed to haul the train from Invercargill. [...] Presently, one train runs every weekday from Invercargill and return, arriving at Ohai at 9.30am and leaving two hours later. [...] This service operates on Saturdays and Sundays when required. [...] In June 2007, the Southland District Council adopted as part of the Otago Regional Land Transport Strategy a provision to upgrade the Ohai line and maintain it as a viable alternative to road for bulk freight.|$|E
2500|$|The Sclass was {{the first}} {{casualty}} of the Victorian Railways <b>dieselisation</b> program, which began in earnest with the delivery of B class mainline diesel electric locomotives in 1952. With their very limited route availability due to their high axle load, and the maintenance costs associated with their age and relatively high mileage, the decision {{was taken by the}} Victorian Railways Commissioners to withdraw from service and scrap the Sclass locomotives as mechanical condition dictated. First to go was S301 in September 1953 with worn cylinders, being recorded as scrapped on the 16 October 1953. Usable parts were stored for use in maintaining the three remaining Sclass locomotives while they remained in service, however the end was drawing near. Following successful trials, Bclass locomotives replaced the Sclass locomotives on the Spirit of Progress from April 1954 onwards. The superseded locomotives were rapidly withdrawn and scrapped, with S302 being recorded as scrapped on 2 July 1954 and S303 being recorded as scrapped on 28 May 1954. In June 1954 the last remaining example, class leader S300 was withdrawn, being recorded as scrapped three months later on 17 [...] September 1954.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most obvious}} theme {{relating}} to British Railways was {{the decline of}} steam locomotion and its replacement with diesels. The first real instance of {{this was in the}} book Duck and the Diesel Engine (1958) in which an unpleasant diesel shunter arrives, causes trouble and is sent away. This theme may have been visited again in The Twin Engines (1960), in which an engine is ordered from Scotland, and two arrive, implying the other went to Sodor with his brother to avoid being scrapped. [...] The 1963 volume Stepney the [...] "Bluebell" [...] Engine explained that steam engines were actually being scrapped to make way for these diesels, and again featured a diesel getting his comeuppance. The book Enterprising Engines was published in 1968, the year when steam finally disappeared from British Railways, and was the most aggressive towards <b>dieselisation</b> and Dr Beeching's modernisation plan. It features yet another arrogant diesel who is sent away, an additional one who stays on the Island of Sodor, a visit by the real Flying Scotsman locomotive, a steam engine, Oliver, making a daring escape to Sodor, and Sir Topham Hatt making a declaration that the steam engines of his railway will still be in service.|$|E
2500|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} {{appeared on the}} Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1925 and on the New York Central in 1927. Since then, {{diesel locomotive}}s {{began to appear in}} mainline service in the United States in the mid-1930s. The diesel engines reduced maintenance costs dramatically, while increasing locomotive availability. On the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad the new units delivered over [...] a year, compared with about [...] for a mainline steam locomotive. World War II delayed <b>dieselisation</b> in the US. In 1949 the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad became the first large mainline railroad to convert completely to diesel locomotives, and Life Magazine ran an article on 5 December 1949 titled [...] "The GM puts all its steam engines to torch, becomes first major US railroad to dieselize 100%". The Susquehanna was one of the earliest railroads in America to fully dieselize by 1947 and retiring their steam locomotives by 1949. The final 2-8-4 Berkshire built in the world was Nickle Plate Road's 779 built in 1949. [...] The last steam locomotive manufactured for general service was a Norfolk and Western 0-8-0, built in its Roanoke shops in December, 1953. In Spring of 1960, Norfolk and Western Y6b 2190 and S1 290 doused their fires for the last time in a Williamson, West Virginia roundhouse. The Age of Steam was over that ended steam locomotive common carrier service in the United States. 1960 is normally considered the final year of regular Class 1 main line standard gauge steam operation in the United States, with operations on the Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Norfolk and Western and Duluth Missabe and Iron Range Railroads, as well as Canadian Pacific operations in Maine. Union Pacific did not retire their final steam locomotives however, until 1963 and 1964 respectively. Within the 10 year period between 1960 and 1970, 47,000 common carrier steam locomotives were replaced by over 30,000 more modern, sleek-looking diesels. Full USA dieselization was finally achieved by 1971 starting a new chapter in American Railroading.|$|E
