5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{offensive}} began and Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because {{of the dangers of}} the bomb exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was split open. The operations <b>did</b> <b>last</b> long and by August 1944 the Mosquitoes were back on bomber support missions.|$|E
25|$|In Anthony Horowitz's detective series, The Diamond Brothers, {{the case}} I Know What You <b>Did</b> <b>Last</b> Wednesday {{pays homage to}} And Then There Were None; protagonist Nick Diamond accompanies his brother Tim to a school reunion on a lonely island where the various guests start dying {{in a manner that}} {{reflects}} back to a subject that they came first in at school (the person who came first in chemistry is poisoned, the one who came first in geography is crushed by a globe, etc.), with the killer revealed at the conclusion to be a former schoolfriend who came second in everything.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Kaidu, the Chatagai ruler Duwa {{initiated}} a peace proposal and persuaded the Ögedeids to submit to Temür Khan. In 1304, all khanates approved a peace treaty and accepted Yuan emperor Temür's supremacy. This established the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty over the western khanates. While this supremacy based on nothing like the same foundations {{as that of the}} earlier Khagans (such as the continued border clashes among them) and each of the four khanates continued to develop separately and function as different states, the nominal supremacy <b>did</b> <b>last</b> for a few decades.|$|E

25|$|This era in Horowitz's career {{also saw}} Adventurer (1987) and Starting Out (1990) published. However, the most major release of Horowitz's early career was The Falcon's Malteser (1986). This book {{was the first}} in the {{successful}} Diamond Brothers series, and was filmed for television in 1989 as Just Ask for Diamond, with an all star cast that included Bill Paterson, Jimmy Nail, Roy Kinnear, Susannah York, Michael Robbins and Patricia Hodge, and featured Colin Dale and Dursley McLinden as Nick and Tim Diamond. It was followed in 1987 with Public Enemy Number Two, and by South by South East in 1991 followed by The French Confection, I Know What You <b>Did</b> <b>Last</b> Wednesday, The Blurred Man and most recently The Greek Who Stole Christmas.|$|E
25|$|Ghostface {{has been}} parodied and {{referenced}} numerous times in media following his {{appearance in the}} Scream series of slasher films, most prominently in the parody film Scary Movie (2000) where a killer dressed as Ghostface commits a series of murders and is later revealed to be several people as in Scream. In the parody film Shriek If You Know What I <b>Did</b> <b>Last</b> Friday the Thirteenth (2000), a killer wearing a Jason Voorhees-style hockey mask is set on fire, his mask melting to resemble that of Ghostface. The film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) features Ghostface, as Shannen Doherty and Craven provide cameos as themselves making the then non-existent Scream 4, but Doherty objects when Ghostface {{turns out to be}} played by the orangutan, Suzann.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time, Kaidu and Duwa of the Chagatai Khanate mobilized a large army to attack Karakorum (then under Yuan control) around 1300 during {{the final stage of}} the Kaidu–Kublai war. The Yuan army {{suffered}} heavy losses while both sides could not make any decisive victory in September. Duwa was wounded in the battle and Kaidu died soon thereafter. After that, Duwa, Kaidu's son Chapar, Tokhta of the Golden Horde and Ilkhan Oljeitu (Ghazan's successor) negotiated peace with Temür Khan in 1304 in order to maintain trade and diplomatic relations, and agreed him to be their nominal overlord. This established the nominal suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty over the western khanates. However, the peace was short-lived. The fighting between Duwa and Chapar soon broke out over the question of territory. Temür backed Duwa and sent a large army under Khayisan in the fall of 1306, and Chapar finally surrendered. The territory controlled by Chapar was divided up by the Chagataids and the Yuan dynasty. The nominal supremacy of the Yuan, while based on nothing like the same foundations as that of the earlier Khagans (such as the continued border clashes among them), <b>did</b> <b>last</b> for a few decades, until the Yuan dynasty fell in China (1368). The four khanates continued to interact with one another {{in the first half of}} the 14th century, but they did so as sovereign states. They formed alliances, fought one another, exchanged envoys, and traded commercial products. In the case of the Yuan dynasty based in China and the Ilkhanate based in Iran, there was an extensive program of cultural and scientific interaction. But they never again pooled their resources in a cooperative military endeavor.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the film Viva Las Vegas (1964). The panic and smoke cloud generated from the implosion of Mr Burns' casino is reminiscent of the 1997 disaster film Dante's Peak, and the Simpson family's escape from the smoke cloud is {{a reference to}} a scene in the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day. Outside Rev. Lovejoy's church is a notice that today's sermon will be 'He Knows What You <b>Did</b> <b>Last</b> Summer', which is {{a reference to the}} title of the 1997 slasher film I Know What You <b>Did</b> <b>Last</b> Summer. As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas, a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film Mars Attacks! can be heard. The Comic Book Guy's license plate is NCC-1701, which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise, a fictional starship from the Star Trek media franchise. He also has a bumper sticker which reads [...] "my other car is the Millennium Falcon" [...] which was given to him by somebody who looked like the actor Harrison Ford; the Millennium Falcon was the ship used by Ford's character Han Solo in the Star Wars film series. The line Homer gives after Ned signs the contract is a reference to the 1997 film The Game.|$|E

500|$|Killing Mr. Griffin {{was first}} {{published}} in April 1978 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. In October 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content. Killing Mr. Griffin, along with I Know What You <b>Did</b> <b>Last</b> Summer and Don't Look Behind You, were the first group of ten different titles that were updated and reissued with these changes. An audiobook was released by Listening Library in 1986, and another, read by Ed Sala, was released by Recorded Books in 1998. A reviewer from AudioFile felt that Sala's narration was effective, although occasionally he [...] "seems to lose concentration and expression." [...] A 2010 audiobook, narrated by Dennis Holland, was published by Hachette Audio and features the modernized text.|$|E

The Daily Texan predicted that the game could hurt Young's chances for the Heisman, but they also quoted UT head coach Mack Brown as saying [...] "Looking at the numbers from what Reggie Bush <b>did</b> <b>last</b> week and Vince did today, Reggie probably leads, but next week, Vince plays at noon, and Reggie at 3, so I think voters will wait and watch to see what happens." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of I Know What You <b>Did</b> <b>Last</b> Summer, on a foggy evening with a full moon, the Simpsons are driving down a coastal road when Marge accidentally smashes into Ned Flanders, killing him.

Shortly after Ned's funeral, the family finds the phrase [...] "I Know What You Did!" [...] written in blood {{everywhere}} they go.

Fellow Barcelona player Giovanni van Bronckhorst was emotional as he won against his former club: [...] "It's special to win the final, and even more special to do it against your old team". Samuel Eto'o, scorer of Barcelona's first goal, cited Liverpool's comeback against Milan as inspiration for Barcelona's victory: [...] "After having seen what Liverpool <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year, we told ourselves not to throw in the towel.

Rolling Stone described the record as [...] "saturated with retro vibes"; its songs [...] "split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year." ...|$|E
