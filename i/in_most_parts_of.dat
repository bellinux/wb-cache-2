5|$|A Sanskrit scholar Vijnaneshwara {{became famous}} {{in the field of}} legal {{literature}} for his Mitakshara, in the court of Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the most acknowledged work in that field, Mitakshara is a treatise on law (commentary on Yajnavalkya) based on earlier writings and has found acceptance <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> modern India. An Englishman Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system.

5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian vulture {{populations have}} {{declined}} <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> its range. In Europe {{and most of}} the Middle East, populations in 2001 were half of those from 1980. In India, the decline has been rapid with a 35% decrease each year since 1999. In 1967–70, the area around Delhi was estimated to have 12,000–15,000 of these vultures, with an average density of about 5 pairs per 10km2. The exact cause of the decline is not known, but has been linked {{with the use of the}} NSAID Diclofenac, which has been known to cause death in Gyps vultures.|$|E
5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the world. Originally, people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Sugarcane {{was a native of}} tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea. One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in Chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century BC that state that the use of sugarcane originated in India.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the barn}} owl has been much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet have been made <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and {{a great variety of}} other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms {{do not seem to be}} consumed.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} Pennsylvania arrived from Asia between 12000BCE and 8000BCE, when the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age were receding.

Archeological discoveries at the Memorial Park Site 36Cn164 near {{the confluence of the}} West Branch Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek collectively span about 8,000years and represent every major prehistoric period from the Middle Archaic to the Late Woodland period. Prehistoric cultural periods over that span included the Middle Archaic starting at 6500 BCE; the Late Archaic starting at 3000 BCE; the Early Woodland starting at 1000 BCE; the Middle Woodland starting at 0 CE; and the Late Woodland starting at 900 CE.

5|$|The papal legate convoked the synod of the Hungarian prelates, who {{declared}} the monarch inviolable in December 1308. They also urged Ladislaus Kán {{to hand over}} the Holy Crown to Charles. After Kán refused to do so, the legate consecrated a new crown for Charles. Thomas II, Archbishop of Esztergom crowned Charles king with the new crown in the Church of Our Lady in Buda on 15 or 16June 1309. However, most Hungarians regarded his second coronation invalid. The papal legate excommunicated Ladislaus Kán, who finally agreed to give the Holy Crown to Charles. On 27August 1310, Archbishop Thomas of Esztergom put the Holy Crown on Charles's head in Székesfehérvár; thus, Charles's third coronation was performed in full accordance with customary law. However, his rule remained nominal <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Charles {{came to the}} Kingdom of Hungary {{upon the}} {{invitation}} of an influential Croatian lord, Paul Šubić, in August 1300. AndrewIII died on 14January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus Kán, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27November 1308, but his rule remained nominal <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27August 1310.|$|E
