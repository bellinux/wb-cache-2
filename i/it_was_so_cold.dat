25|$|The pilot episode (1979) {{and first}} two series (1980–1981) were all filmed during early spring before the holiday camp was {{opened to the}} public for the summer. This is {{noticeable}} during outdoor scenes, because most of the trees on the camp site are bare. Since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> during filming a lot of the outdoor scenes, the cast were continuously complaining about having to appear in summer clothing, and Jeffrey Holland was treated for hypothermia during the first series because his character spent most of the time in the swimming pool.|$|E

The following year, at Trent Bridge (when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that KS Ranjitsinhji kept {{his hands in his}} pockets and fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.|$|E
25|$|Wanyan Heda's army {{still had}} more than 100,000 men after the battle at Mount Yu, and the Mongols adopted a {{strategy}} of exhausting the enemy. The Jin troops had little rest {{all the way from}} Dengzhou, and had not eaten for three days because of the severing of their supply lines. Their morale was plummeting and their commanders were losing confidence. When they reached Three-peaked Hill, a snowstorm suddenly broke out, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that the faces of the Jin troops went as white as corpses, and they could hardly march. Rather than attack them when they were desperate with their backs to the wall, the Mongols left them an escape route and then ambushed them when they let down their guard during the retreat. The Jin army collapsed without a fight, and the Mongols pursued the fleeing Jin troops relentlessly. Wanyan Heda was killed, and most of his commanders also lost their lives. After the Battle of Three-peaked Hill, Kaifeng was doomed and Emperor Aizong soon abandoned the city and entered Hebei Province in a vain attempt to reestablish himself there. Thousands of people offered a stubborn resistance to the Mongols, who entrusted the conduct of the attack to Subutai, the most daring of all their commanders. Emperor Aizong was driven south again, and by this time Kaifeng had been taken by the Mongols so he established his new capital at Caizhou (present-day Runan County, Henan Province). Subutai wished to massacre the whole of the population. But fortunately for the Khitans, Yelü Chucai was more humane, and under his advice Ögedei Khan rejected the cruel proposal.|$|E

25|$|The phrase three dog night, meaning <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> {{you would}} need three dogs in bed with you to keep warm, {{originated}} with the Chukchi people of Siberia, who kept the Siberian husky landrace dog that became the modern purebred breed of Siberian Husky.|$|R
2500|$|The {{camp was}} hastily built at an {{elevation}} of , {{so it was not}} well suited for the harsh winters typical of Oregon's high desert country. [...] As a result, the men had a very difficult winter. [...] It was reported that on several occasions, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> inside the camp building the entire detachment had to march around the parade ground all night to keep from freezing. [...] One sergeant did freeze to death during a winter snow storm.|$|E
2500|$|At the Church Family of Shakers near New Lebanon, New York, Nicholas Bennet {{wrote in}} May 1816, [...] "all was froze" [...] and the hills were [...] "barren like winter". Temperatures went below {{freezing}} {{almost every day}} in May. The ground froze on June 9. On June 12, the Shakers had to replant crops destroyed by the cold. On July 7, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold,</b> everything had stopped growing. The Berkshire Hills had frost again on August 23, as did much of the upper northeast.|$|E
2500|$|Severe frosts {{occurred}} every month; June 7th and 8th snow fell, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that crops {{were cut}} down, even freezing the roots .... In the early Autumn when corn {{was in the}} milk it was so thoroughly frozen that it never ripened and was scarcely worth harvesting. Breadstuffs were scarce and prices high and the poorer class of people were often in straits for want of food. It must be remembered that the granaries of the great west had not then been opened to us by railroad communication, and people were obliged to rely upon their own resources or upon others in their immediate locality.|$|E

2500|$|Alejandro Valverde {{said that}} he had been mistaken in his belief that the Côte de la Rue Naniot would not be decisive. It was his worst {{performance}} in the race since 2012, but he {{said that he}} felt he was in strong form ahead of the Giro d'Italia. Dan Martin said that the weather conditions had forced the riders to ride in a conservative manner, since nobody could attack when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold.</b> Both he and Julian Alaphilippe blamed the weather for their failure to be in the final selection. Alaphilippe said [...] "This {{is the first time in}} my life I had to do a race in such bad weather. We riders have a dog’s life sometimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin Burgess's {{memories}} of Gresham's during the freezing months of January to March 1947, the coldest British winter on record, are quoted at length in I Will Plant Me a Tree (2002). Not {{only was the}} winter icy cold, but because of fuel shortages the school was unheated. Burgess recalls that [...] "Periods were held in full overcoats and scarves and gloves. If it happened now the School would be closed, but such a step was not even thought of then. In any case, the roads were blocked... One day the School was called out to dig out a farm, {{or was it a}} small village? Hurrah! No periods! In the afternoon everyone prayed there would be periods, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold.</b> A man had died." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 15th Hussars charged, {{over about}} [...] of snowy, frozen ground, {{shouting}} [...] "Emsdorf and Victory!" [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> the hussars wore their pelisses, {{rather than having}} them slung over their shoulders, and many had cloaks over all. Eyewitnesses also spoke of numbed hands hardly able to grasp reins and sabres. The impact when the hussars met the chasseurs was terrible, as one British officer recorded: [...] "horses and men were overthrown and a shriek of terror, intermixed with oaths, groans and prayers for mercy issued from the whole extent of their front." [...] The impetus of the British hussars carried them {{through the ranks of}} the chasseurs and into those of the dragoons behind. The French force was broken, and it routed eastwards with the British in pursuit. Many French cavalrymen (though the chasseurs were largely of German origin) were taken prisoner at very little cost to the 15th Hussars. Two French lieutenant colonels were captured and the chasseurs, who lost many men captured, ceased to exist as a viable regiment. The 10th Hussars came up during the pursuit, however, they were initially mistaken for French cavalry. This caused the 15th Hussars to break off their pursuit to re-form, ending the action.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2003, EastEnders made {{headlines}} in the UK press after they screened a kiss between Kelly and Zoe. The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now. When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss." [...] The episode featuring their kiss attracted [...] 9.5million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience.|$|E
