5|$|A {{tradition}} {{going back}} at least to Menander (Fr. 258 K) suggested that Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs <b>for</b> <b>love</b> of Phaon, a ferryman.

The legend may have resulted in part from a desire to assert Sappho as heterosexual.|$|E

5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry <b>for</b> <b>love.</b> The books were set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E
