500|$|Central to Colbert's {{personality}} is his rigid belief that [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> right, and [...] anyone else says {{could possibly be}} true", regardless of any evidence to the contrary. He discussed this in the Reports first Wørd segment, using the term [...] "truthiness" [...] as he explained what he perceives to {{be the difference between}} [...] "those who think with their head and those who know with their heart". He has further gone on to ascribe [...] "truthiness" [...] to other institutions including Wikipedia, which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to [...] "change reality". Colbert believes that if a majority of people want something to be true, that thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at global warming, Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the box office success of An Inconvenient Truth, a sign that [...] "the free market has spoken".|$|E

2500|$|Blagojevich {{had been}} under {{investigation}} for corrupt activity for 4 years, {{as part of a}} broader federal investigation by Fitzgerald, code-named Operation Board Games, that had been going on for three years. [...] To date, 15 people have been charged in connection with the investigation. Blagojevich had long been suspected to be a target of the investigation, but it was confirmed by U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve that he was the [...] "Public Official A" [...] referred to in the federal indictment of Tony Rezko. Just before the 2008 United States general elections on November 4, 2008, Federal investigators were granted authority to tape Blagojevich's conversations. On December 8, 2008, in a press conference, Blagojevich claimed [...] "whether you tape me privately or publicly, I can tell you that whatever <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> always lawful and the things I'm interested in are always lawful." [...] He further stated that [...] "if anybody wants to tape my conversations, go right ahead, feel free to do it. I appreciate anybody who wants to tape me openly and notoriously; and those who feel like they want to sneakily, and wear taping devices, I would remind them that it kind of smells like Nixon and Watergate." [...] After a meeting between Blagojevich and [...] Jesse Jackson Jr. regarding the Senate seat, when asked his thoughts on being the subject of federal tapings, Blagojevich stated, [...] "I don't believe there's any cloud that hangs over me. I think there's nothing but sunshine hanging over me." ...|$|E
