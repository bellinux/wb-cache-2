40|$|International audienceTwo {{series of}} porphyrinic {{cellulose}} laurate <b>esters</b> <b>plastic</b> films, where the photosensitizers are covalently {{linked to the}} cellulosic polymer have been synthesised by using a "one-pot, two-step" esterification reaction. The photosensitizers were first covalently bounded to the cellulosic polymer using either 4 - or 11 -carbon spacer arms. The porphyrinic plastic films were then obtained by a second esterification with lauric acid. The reaction was studied according to reaction time, temperature, lauric acid amount, pyridine playing the role proton trapping base. Para-toluenesulfonylchloride has been {{proved to be a}} powerful activating agent for this reaction. The drawback of the steric hindrance of the porphyrinic macrocycle towards cellulosic hydroxyl groups has been overcome by increasing the number of carbon of spacer arms from 4 - to 11 -carbons. The photobactericidal activity of these materials was evaluated against Gram positive and Gram negative strains bacteria. First results show that these new plastic films display photobactericidal activity for porphyrin grafting percentage higher than 0. 16, whereas the non-porphyrinic control allowed full growth of bacteria. These materials could be an alternative in order to overcome the growing bacterial multiresistance to classical antibiotics...|$|R

50|$|TME is an {{intermediate}} {{in the production}} of alkyd and polyester resins, powder coating resins, synthetic lubricants based on polyol <b>esters,</b> stabilizers for <b>plastics,</b> plasticizers, and pigment coatings based on titanium dioxide. Trimethylolethane based resins have superior weatherability and resistance to alkali and heat. Trimethylolethane is used in some phase change materials. The typical composition is then 63 wt.% TME with 37 wt.% water. The mixture has melting point of 29.8 °C and heat of fusion 218 kJ/kg. Nitration of trimethylolethane gives trimethylolethane trinitrate, an explosive, monopropellant, and energetic plasticizer.|$|R
40|$|Acidic liquids such as verjuice, {{lemon juice}} and vinegar are {{frequently}} consumed in Iran. Different kinds of acidic liquids are packaged in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. There is evidence indicating that phthalates can leach from PET and HDPE bottles into their contents. In this work the effect of storage time, temperature and bottle type on the migration of phthalates from packaging materials into acidic liquids is studied by analyzing the samples stored under different conditions, before storage and after 2, 4 and 6 months of storage. The determined mean phthalate concentrations in μg/L were: < 0. 04 to 0. 501 in verjuice, < 0. 04 to 0. 231 in {{lemon juice and}} < 0. 04 to 0. 586 in vinegar. The highest concentrations of diethyl phthalate (DEP) and diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP) were found in PET and HDPE bottles, respectively. Results of analyses before and after storage indicate that under some storage conditions, the concentrations of DEP, DEHP and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) increased in acidic liquids. The possible migration of phthalic acid <b>esters</b> from <b>plastic</b> packaging materials into the contents was indicated {{by the results of}} the present study...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ubiquitous}} use of phthalate <b>esters</b> in <b>plastics,</b> building material, medical devices, {{personal care}} products and food packaging materials results in a widespread exposure of general population. This study reports measurement of urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites in France and provides a first assessment of the exposure of French pregnant women to this chemical class. For {{the majority of the}} phthalate metabolites, concentrations measured in urine were similar to those reported in previous studies except for two phthalates that were characterized by high concentrations of metabolites if compared to previous European and American studies: DiNP (Di-iso-nonylphthalate) and DEHP (Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate). In a second part of the study, a pharmacokinetic model was used in order to gain understanding on exposure to DEHP. A high concentration of the primary metabolite of DEHP, MEHP (Mono(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate), was thus identified probably because of a very recent exposure to perfusion materials at the hospital. Pharmacokinetics modelling highlighted that gathering data on the time gap between exposure and biomonitoring is an essential information requirement for reconstructing the dose of non persistent pollutants. Information about exposure pathway is also crucial for conducting effective reverse dosimetry...|$|R
40|$|Many {{chemicals}} {{have the}} ability to attack on plastics as solvents and can lead to failure. In some cases, the source of the solvent is not well defined. In this study, the effect of biodiesel, a fatty acid methyl <b>ester,</b> on various <b>plastics,</b> namely polyamide 6 (PA 6), polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene- styrene (ABS) and ABS/PC plastic blends was studied. Various feedstocks of biodiesel were also studied, including, soy bean oil (new and used), animal fat (tallow), corn oil as well as choice white grease. The plastics samples were tested under ASTM standard where a predefined strain is applied to the samples prior to exposure to the solvent (biodiesel). It was found that under the majority of combinations, other than PA 6, cracking was seen within 12 hours, and with ABS/PC and PC cracking was seen in minutes. Thus, {{it has been shown that}} biodiesel can be a degrading solvent for engineering plastics, such as PC, ABS and ABS/PC blends...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} wave propagation of thick, layered composites containing degraded bonds is investigated. A theoretical one-dimensional model of three attenuative viscoelastic layers containing two imperfect interfaces is introduced. Elastic material properties and measured 'values of ultrasonic phase velocity and attenuation {{are used to}} represent E-glass and vinyl <b>ester</b> resin fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> (FRP) laminate, syntactic foam, and resin putty materials in the model. The ultrasonic phase velocity in all three materials is shown to be essentially constant {{in the range of}} 1. 0 to 5. 0 megahertz (MHz). The attenuation in all three materials is constant or slightly increasing in the range 1. 0 to 3. 0 MHz. Numerical simulation of the model via the mass- spring-dashpot lattice model reveals the importance of the input signal shape, wave speed, and layer thickness on obtaining non-overlapping, distinct return signals in pulse-echo ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation. The effect of the interface contact quality on the reflection and transmission coefficients of degraded interfaces is observed in both the simulated and theoretical results. by Peter D. Small.

40|$|Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) is {{a sample}} {{preparation}} and introduction technique in which analytes are extracted {{into a small}} volume of extracting phase coated on a fused silica fibre and subsequently desorbed within the analytical instrument. This technique was investigated for the extraction of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from aqueous matrices and for the determination of phthalate <b>ester</b> leaching from <b>plastic</b> items. Using a 100 |am PDMS fibre and GC-MS analysis, VOCs could be determined in water samples at the low parts per billion level. This was found to match Purge and Trap-GC-MS detection limits for most VOCs but with the additional advantage of easier operation, shorter analysis times and potential on-site sampling.

40|$|Phthalic {{acid esters}} are {{presently}} {{being used in}} amounts and products that can easily, although inadvertently, contribute to environmental pollution. As plasticizers, phthalic acid esters are added to synthetic plastic resins to impart flexibility to the finished product, improve workability during fabrication, and extend or modify properties not present in the original resins (1). Plastic formulations may contain up to 60 % of plasticizers (2). Phthalic acid esters are {{the most widely used}} plasticizers, particularly in poly-(vinyl chloride) plastics. More than 800 million pounds of these plasticizers were produced in 1969 (1). Di-n-butyl and di- 2 ethylhexyl phthalates are used as plasticizers and also as an insect repellant and orchard acaricide, respectively (3). Phthalic acid esters have been identified as environmental contaminants because of their discovery in soil (4), a deep sea jellyfish (5), aquatic organisms and water (6), and bovine tissues (7, 8). The acute toxicities of various phthalic acid esters have been determined in mammals and birds and the compounds were found to have a very low order of toxicity (3, 9 - 12). Teratogenic effects of phthalic acid esters have been demonstrated in rats (13). Problems of phthalic acid <b>esters</b> leaching from <b>plastics</b> used in human medical practices have also been reported (14 - 17).

40|$|Plastics are manmade long chain {{polymeric}} molecules {{which are}} resistant against microbial attack and {{become part of}} parcel of today life. It {{turns out to be}} imperative component in agriculture as different plastics are used for various purposes namely plasticulture, polyhouses, mulches, packaging container, shrink film wrappers, etc. Plastics have replaced paper and cellulose-based products for packaging because of their strength, lightness, resistance to water and most water borne microorganism. Nowadays a wide variety of synthetic polymers are produced worldwide to the extent of ~ 140 million tonnes every year. Remarkable of these polymers are introduced in the ecosystem as industrial waste products every year. The dramatic increase in production and lack of biodegradability of commercial polymers, particularly commodity plastics used in packaging, industry and agriculture, focused public attention on a potentially huge environmental accumulation and pollution problem that could persist for centuries. Because of their persistence in our environment, several communities are now more sensitive to the impact of discarded plastic on the environment, including deleterious effects on wildlife and on the aesthetic qualities of cities and forests. In addition, the burning of polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastics produces persistent organic pollutants (POPs) known as furans and dioxins. In order to find alternatives, a new material has been developed known as bioplastic. Bioplastics are long chain of monomers joined with each other by <b>ester</b> bonds.

40|$|Phthalate esters (PEs) {{belong to}} a class of organic {{compounds}} used as plasticisers in plastic materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and so on, including those used in the food packaging industry. Phthalate plasticisers are not chemically bound to plastic materials and hence, migrate into items such as foodstuffs they house. The study aimed at investigating the prevalence of selected phthalate <b>esters</b> from <b>plastic</b> wrappers into food {{as well as the}} presence of food and/or pathogenic microorganisms. Plastic-wrapped cheese, vienna sausages and polony samples purchased from commercial stores in the four regions of Pretoria (Tswane), South Africa, were analysed for the presence of plasticisers; di- 2 -ethylhexyl adipate (DEHA), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzyl-butyl phthalate (BBP), di-butyl phthalate (DBP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP). Soxhlet extraction using hexane with florisil column cleanup was carried out. Analysis of PEs was by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID). Microbiological investigations were performed using standard methods. The concentrations of PEs detected in food samples ranged from below detection limit (bdl) to 4. 7003 μg/kg. However, DBP, DMP and BBP were predominantly present with more PEs detected in cheese compared to polony and vienna. In polony samples, DBP levels ranged from 0. 0412 to 0. 611 μg/kg, in cheese, ranged from 0. 049 to 0. 256 μg/kg and in vienna DBP ranged from 0. 074 to 0. 209 μg/kg. The phthalate DMP ranged from 0. 072 to 4. 700 μg/kg in cheese, 0. 056 to 0. 241 μg/kg in polony and 0. 092 to 0. 816 μg/kg in vienna. The DEHA detected in cheese and polony was 0. 120 μg/kg and 0. 075 μg/kg respectively and no DEHA was detected in vienna sausages. For microbiological analysis, the total microbial activity (TMA) ranged from 6. 8 x 104 to 1. 03 x 108 cfu/g; coliforms ranged from no growth to 2. 62 x 106 cfu/g; yeast ranged from no growth to 1. 49 x 107 cfu/g; and mould ranged from no growth to 9. 2 x 104 cfu/g. The results revealed that microbial activity was high in each sample type but revealed the absence of pathogens. Results revealed incidences of PEs in foods wrapped or packaged in plastics, which gave cause for concern and showed the need for proper monitoring and inspection of the levels of organo-microbial entities in the South African food wrapped in plastic wrappers.
