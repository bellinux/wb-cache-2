5|$|Eyre {{is thought}} to have been passing through the Toolinna Cove sand patch at the time of writing. B.epica and B.media are the only Banksia species that occur at that location, and both have a form and habit that accords with Eyre's description. As he did not collect specimens, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> what species he saw.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} made it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> who {{had made}} the first kill, which would be the first North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war. Later research indicated Hudson had successfully shot down the first aircraft. The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|North and South Korean forces {{suffered}} {{heavily in}} the battle, each side inflicted large numbers of casualties on one another. The exact numbers of casualties are <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine.</b> Both sides {{are known to have}} suffered heavily. Following the counterattack at Inchon, the North Korean units in the sector fled back North, {{no more than a few}} thousand troops from the NK 5th and 12th divisions were known to have returned to North Korea. US Casualties, in the meantime, were relatively light.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference {{between male and female}} head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how.|$|E

5|$|The Tempest {{is thought}} by most {{scholars}} {{to have been}} written in 1610–11, and is generally accepted as the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone, although some have questioned either or both assertions. Scholars also note that it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if the play was written before, after, or {{at the same time}} as The Winter's Tale, the dating of which has been equally problematic. Edward Blount entered The Tempest into the Stationers' Register on 8 November 1623. It was one of 16 Shakespearean plays that Blount registered on that date.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} analysis that would definitively identify the dyes used in ancient textiles {{has rarely been}} conducted, and even when a dye such as indigo blue is detected it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> which of several indigo-bearing plants was used. Nevertheless, based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites, reds, blues, and yellows from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E

5|$|The North Korean 4th and 9th Divisions {{were almost}} {{completely}} {{destroyed in the}} battles at Naktong Bulge. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men {{at the beginning of}} the offensive on September 1. The 4th Division numbered 5,500. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The exact number of North Korean casualties at Yongsan is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine,</b> but a substantial amount of the attacking force was lost there. All of NK II Corps was in a similar state, and the North Korean army, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen, {{driving a}} Lancia Delta S4, {{died in a}} crash on 2 May 1986 while leading the Tour de Corse rally in Corsica. His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} and the only remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the cause of the}} crash. Within hours of the crash, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E
5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E

In the sample with y[*]=[*] 0.10, there is no region with the linear temperature dependence of the magnetization square.

50|$|The {{exact age}} of this taxon is uncertain. It was {{originally}} interprereted as living during the Late Triassic (Norian age), around 210 million years ago; however, Olsen, Kent & Whiteside (2010) stated {{that there is}} no independent geochronological support for its assumed age, and the available data makes it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> conclusively <b>determine</b> whether Eocursor is of Triassic or Early Jurassic (potentially as young as Sinemurian) age.|$|R
50|$|Evolutionary {{psychologists have}} theorized that taboos against female {{promiscuity}} evolved {{on the basis}} of paternity anxiety. DNA tests being yet to be invented, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> accurately <b>determine</b> paternity, unlike maternity. A male risked spending paternal investment on offspring who carried genetic material of another male rather than of his own. Evolutionarily, this translated into sexual jealousy and complex preventive customs (e.g., female genital mutilation, menstrual taboos).|$|R
5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic equator is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about {{the location of the}} galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium {{is known}} from {{isolated}} teeth, {{the assignment of}} some of which is controversial. The material from the Los Alamitos Formation, which is mostly in the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia (MACN) in Buenos Aires, with one tooth in the Museo de La Plata (MLP) in La Plata, Argentina, has been thoroughly described; while there are additional Ferugliotherium fossils from the La Colonia Formation, {{they have not been}} described in detail. Although the fragmentary nature of the known fossils of Ferugliotherium makes it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> its dental formula with certainty, Gurovich suggested that it had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars {{on each side of the}} lower and upper jaws. However, on the basis of comparisons with Sudamerica, which is known to have had four lower molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or molars) in its lower jaw, Pascual and Ortiz-Jaureguizar suggested in 2007 that Ferugliotherium may also have had four lower molars.|$|E

5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus {{is just a}} very large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous differences {{in the construction of}} the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E
5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the species' relationships. It {{has been suggested that}} the closest mainland relative of the Cuban macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. The Cuban macaw is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two also share a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception {{have suggested that}} home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points {{out that it is}} <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E

If specific indicators are not used, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> quantify the effect of a program upon the target group.
