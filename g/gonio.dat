25|$|Archeologists say the {{territory}} has been inhabited since the Neolithic Age. Occupied by an ancient Georgian tribe of Moskhs from ancient times, {{the territory}} of Adjara was a province of Colchis from the 7th to 3rd centuries BC. Part of the area formed a county (saeristavo) within the Kingdom of Iberia in the late 4th century BC. Colonized by Greek merchants in the 5th and 4th century BC, the coastal Adjara later came under Roman rule. Bathus (Bathys) (the present day Batumi) and Apsaros (Apsaruntos) (modern <b>Gonio)</b> were the key cities and fortresses at that time. Archeological excavations have revealed ruins of a rich ancient town at Pichvnari near the present day town of Kobuleti. In the 2nd century AD, Bathus was an important military base for Roman legions. Apsaros was famous for its theatre.|$|E
2500|$|The early Christian era in Adjara {{was linked}} with names of Saint Andrew, Saint Simon the Canaanite and Matata. Saint Matthias {{is said to}} be buried in the <b>Gonio</b> {{fortress}} near Batumi.|$|E

2500|$|Roman {{presence}} was huge in coastal Georgia, where some Roman forts were defended for centuries by legionaries (and had even some Roman colonists {{living in the}} related cities). The fortress of <b>Gonio,</b> in the ancient Colchis city of [...] "Apsaros", is considered by some scholars (like Theodore Mommsen) {{to have been the}} center of Roman power in western Georgia since the 2nd century AD.|$|E
2500|$|In the 11th century, Adjara {{became a}} part of the unified Georgian Kingdom and was governed by rulers of Samtskhe-Saatabago. The region was ravaged by Seljuks in the 11th century and by Mongols in the 13th century. After the {{disintegration}} of Georgian monarchy and subsequent internal wars, Adjara was passed from hands to hands until it {{became a part}} of the Principality of Guria in 1535. The Genoese established one of their Black Sea trading [...] "factories" [...] at the fortified town of <b>Gonio</b> at that time.|$|E
2500|$|According to Georgian Orthodox Church tradition, {{the first}} preacher of the Gospel in Colchis and Iberia (modern-day Western and Eastern Georgia) was the apostle Andrew, the First-called. According to the {{official}} church account, Andrew preached across Georgia, carrying with him an acheiropoieta of the Virgin Mary (an icon believed to be created [...] "not by human hand"), and founded Christian communities {{believed to be the}} direct ancestors of the Church. However, modern historiography considers this account mythical, and the fruit of a late tradition, derived from 9th-century Byzantine legends about the travels of St. Andrew in eastern Christendom. Similar traditions regarding Saint Andrew exist in Ukraine, Cyprus and Romania. Other apostles claimed by the Church to have preached in Georgia include Simon the Canaanite (better known in the West as Simon the Zealot) said to have been buried near Sokhumi, in the village of Anakopia, and Saint Matthias, said to have preached in the southwest of Georgia, and to have been buried in <b>Gonio,</b> a village not far from Batumi. The Church also claims the presence in Georgia of the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus, coming north from Armenia.|$|E
2500|$|The name of Colchis first {{appears in}} Aeschylus and Pindar. The earlier writers only speak about {{it under the}} name of Aea (Aia), the {{residence}} of the mythical king Aeëtes: [...] "Kolchian Aia lies at the furthest limits of sea and earth," [...] wrote Apollonius of Rhodes. The main river was the Phasis (now Rioni), which was according to some writers the south boundary of Colchis, but more probably flowed through the middle of that country from the Caucasus west by south to the Euxine, and the Anticites or Atticitus (now Kuban). Arrian mentions many others by name, but they would seem to have been little more than mountain torrents: the most important of them were Charieis, Chobus or Cobus, Singames, Tarsuras, Hippus, Astelephus, Chrysorrhoas, several of which are also noticed by Ptolemy and Pliny. The chief towns were Dioscurias or Dioscuris (under the Romans called Sebastopolis, now Sukhumi) on the seaboard of the Euxine, Sarapana (now Shorapani), Phasis (now Poti), Pityus (now Pitsunda), Apsaros (now <b>Gonio),</b> Surium (now Vani), Archaeopolis (now Nokalakevi), Macheiresis, and Cyta or Cutatisium or Aia (now Kutaisi), the traditional birthplace of Medea. Scylax mentions also Mala or Male, which he, in contradiction to other writers, makes the birthplace of Medea.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the archaeological}} data, the oldest {{settlement}} in <b>Gonio</b> dates back VIII-VII BC. In {{the first century}} AD, the fortress Apsarunti was built in <b>Gonio.</b> After XII century it called <b>Gonio</b> Fortress. From 1547 to 1878 <b>Gonio</b> was occupied by Ottomans. After the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-1878 <b>Gonio</b> became Georgian again. According to the Treaty of San Stefano <b>Gonio,</b> {{as well as the}} whole Adjara, was given to Russian Empire. <b>Gonio,</b> as village became the part of Batumi district. At the same time it was the center of <b>Gonio</b> police. From 1930 <b>Gonio</b> was a part of Khelvachauri region. In 2011, after Batumi expanded borders, it got into the administrative boundaries of the city.|$|E

5000|$|The Gama name also {{appeared}} in catalogs of the Czech company known as <b>Gonio</b> that produced pressed tin 1:24 scale military vehicles about 2000. The address printed on the company literature shows the name as [...] "Gama, a.s. Ceske Budejovice" [...] {{which appears to be}} a continuation of production within the <b>Gonio</b> factory in Trhove Sviny. <b>Gonio</b> had made models in the early 1990s and later, about 2003, was taken over by Kaden models (Fage, no date). The story of how the Gama name came to be applied to <b>Gonio</b> and, later, Kaden, is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|Kaden {{also took}} over the {{production}} of <b>Gonio,</b> another model company from the Czech Republic that had earlier produced a large range of high quality 1:24 scale military vehicles in pressed tin which Kaden developed further. <b>Gonio</b> had operated from Tovarni 560, 374 15 in Trhove Sviny. No new models were made, but Kaden continued many variations, including the Long Range Desert Group Jeep which was shown {{in the last of}} the <b>Gonio</b> price lists, but which finally arrived in the later Kaden Red box, rather than the <b>Gonio</b> Blue packaging. Vehicles like the Kubelwagen came out with material covered plastic roofs. Some items shown in catalogues have never seen the light of day. Apparently, however, Kaden has ceased producing the <b>Gonio</b> range.|$|E

However, the king of Imereti, indignant at Rostom's earlier decline of a combined attack on Mingrelia, disrupted the nascent Dadiani-Gurieli accord. Left to his own devices, Rostom attacked, pushed the Ottoman forces beyond the Chorokhi and forced them to evacuate Batumi, but he failed to prevent the loss of Adjara and Chaneti; the <b>Gonio</b> fortress became an important Ottoman outpost in southwestern Georgia.|$|E

There is also a reference to the ancient name of the site in Appian’s Mithridatic Wars (II century AD). In the II century AD it was a well-fortified Roman city within Colchis.|$|E
5000|$|Vakhtang was {{installed}} as prince-regnant of Guria by the neighboring ruler, Mamia IV Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, who had invaded Guria and expelled his brother-in-law Giorgi II Gurieli in 1583. Prior to his accession, Vakhtang was {{in possession of}} the canton of Kobuleti. Giorgi Gurieli fled to Constantinople to solicit the Ottoman support. He was in the Ottoman-controlled town of <b>Gonio</b> in 1587, when Vakhtang died, enabling Giorgi to reclaim Guria {{with the help of}} the Ottoman government.|$|E
5000|$|According to Nicephorus (Historia eccl., 2, 40), Matthias first preached the Gospel in Judaea, then in Aethiopia (the {{region of}} Colchis, now in modern-day Georgia) {{and was there}} stoned to death.

50|$|Plotting {{the angle}} of the target was a simple process of taking the <b>gonio</b> reading and setting a {{rotating}} straightedge to that value. The problem was determining where along that straightedge the target lay; the radar measured the slant range straight-line distance to the target, not the distance over the ground. That distance was affected by the target's altitude, which had to be determined by taking the somewhat time-consuming altitude measurements. Additionally, that altitude was affected by the range, due to the curvature of the Earth, as well as any imperfections in the local environment, which caused the lobes to have different measurements depending on the target angle.|$|E
50|$|Ancha's diocesan {{territory}} covered much of Klarjeti, {{including the}} Artanuji area, {{the entirety of}} the Nigali valley and extended up to <b>Gonio</b> in what is now Adjara, Georgia. The bishopric’s rise in prominence was closely related to the activities of the Twelve Lavras of Klarjeti, supervised by the archimandrite Gregory of Khandzta (759 -861), and later taken over by the bishop of Ancha himself. As of the 14th century, the bishop of Ancha - titled as Ancheli - ranked as the 3rd, after the bishops of Ishkhani and Atskuri, in the ecclesiastic hierarchy of the Principality of Samtskhe and as the 11th, between the bishops of Ishkhani and Tbeti, in the hierarchy of the kingdom of Georgia.|$|E
