The first witch, Asha, suffers from an incurable disease. The second, Altheda, endures poverty and powerlessness due to a robbery. The third, Amata, is distraught after being left by her beloved.

5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E

5|$|Route 3 was the {{inspiration}} for a story in The New Yorker in 2004 by Ian Frazier. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> Frazier describes a bus journey along the route, mentioning scenes along the road such as traffic congestion, the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and the Tick Tock Diner off Route 3 in Clifton. He also described a walking journey he once took into New York City along Route 3, encountering heavy, noisy traffic speeding by and debris {{along the side of}} the road.|$|E

It was alleged that his father-in-law Germanus had bribed his executioner, a leading Phocas supporter named Alexander, to spare his life. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> Theodosius then fled, eventually reaching Lazica, where he died. Theophylact Simocatta {{reports that he}} thoroughly investigated these rumours and found them false.|$|E

The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town.

5|$|Hergé's next Adventure of Tintin {{would be}} The Secret of the Unicorn, serialised in Le Soir from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had {{introduced}} many elements {{from the work}} of Jules Verne into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. The Secret of the Unicorn marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in Red Rackham's Treasure, serialised in Le Soir from February 1943; <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following Red Rackham's Treasure, Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled Dupont et Dupond, détectives ("Thomson and Thompson, Detectives"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.|$|E
5|$|Secret Service {{operative}} James Bond, {{code name}} 007, {{is assigned to}} apprehend a hero of the Second World War implicated in a murder involving a cache of Nazi gold. Bond appears only briefly <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> which is told mostly in flashback {{from the perspective of}} Major Dexter Smythe, the man Bond has been sent to bring in. Smythe remained in Europe after the war, found the gold {{with the help of a}} mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself. Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of a glacier and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef – including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' octopus that Smythe feeds and talks to.|$|E
5|$|The Seven Crystal Balls was a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé concluded the arc begun <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> with Prisoners of the Sun, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have ranked The Seven Crystal Balls {{as one of the}} best Adventures of Tintin, describing it as the most frightening instalment in the series. The story was adapted for the 1969 Belvision film, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable difference <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing {{to come to the}} same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E
5|$|The series {{introduced}} Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, here {{depicted as}} a famous Hollywood film director. It {{is only in the}} successor volume, The Blue Lotus, that he is also revealed as the head of an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East, Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham's Treasure.|$|E

25|$|This is not {{the first}} time that the theme of a {{relationship}} between Beowulf and Grendel's mother was explored. In Gaiman's 1998 collection of short stories, Smoke and Mirrors, the poem Bay Wolf is a retelling of Beowulf in a modern-day setting. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> Beowulf as the narrator is ambiguous about what happened between Grendel's mother and himself.|$|E
