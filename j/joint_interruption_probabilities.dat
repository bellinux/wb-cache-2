30|$|In general, the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> is not independent. Indeed, {{when the}} traffic load is high, {{whenever}} a SU is interrupted {{due to the}} arrival of a PU, it is highly probable that the next arrival of a PU also causes the interruption of another secondary session because resource occupancy conditions at the different time instants (primary arrival epochs) are not independent.

30|$|Several {{interesting}} observations can {{be extracted}} from Figs.  5, 6, and 7. For instance, from Fig.  5, {{it is observed}} that, when CDT and UST are modeled by the (unrealistic) exponential distribution and for any value of the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability,</b> the corresponding mean, CoV, and Sk of both CHTn and CHTh have the same value (this scenario {{is represented by the}} solid-red and dashed-red lines in Fig.  5). This is an expected behavior that validates our mathematical formulation and can be explained as follows. Due to the memory-less property of the exponential distribution, when CDT (UST) is exponentially distributed, the residual CDT (residual UST) is also exponentially distributed with the same parameter [12]. Thus, the random variables that represent CHTn and CHTh (whose probability distributions are given by Eqs. (12) and (35), respectively) are also exponentially distributed with the same expected value, and therefore, the CoV and Sk are, respectively, 1 and 2 for both CHTn and CHTh. Also, from Figs.  5 a, 6 a, and 7 a, it is observed that the mean value of both CHTn and CHTh is a monotonically decreasing function of the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability.</b> It is an intuitively understandable behavior {{due to the fact that}} as the <b>probability</b> of <b>interruption</b> increases, more ongoing secondary calls are prematurely terminated in detrimental of the mean value of both CHTn and CHTh.|$|R

30|$|Now let us {{study the}} impact of the {{variability}} of both UST and CDT on CHT statistics. To this end, it is important to notice that the CoV of the Erlang, exponential, and hyper-exponential/hyper-Erlang distributions are, respectively, smaller than 1, equal to 1, and larger than 1. Thus, the variability of UST increases as its probability distribution moves from the Erlang to the exponential and from the exponential to the hyper-exponential/hyper-Erlang. The same observation applies for the CDT. Considering this fact, the following observation can be extracted from Figs.  5, 6, and 7. Figures  5, 6, and 7 show that, in general terms, as the variability of the UST (CDT) increases (decreases), the mean value of the CHTn decreases {{and at the same time}} the mean value of the CHTh increases. This behavior can be explained as follows. First, note that as the CoV of UST (CDT) increases, the variability of UST (CDT) increases; that is, the values of UST (CDT) spread out over a larger range with respect to its mean value. Consequently, the service time (cell residence time) of calls that end their service in the cell where they were originated is, in general, considerable smaller (greater) than the mean UST (CDT), resulting in a diminution (increase) on the mean value of the CHTn. On the other hand, the service time (cell residence time) of calls that are handed off to another cell is, in general, considerably greater (lower) than the mean UST (CDT), resulting in an augment (diminution) on the mean value of the CHTh. The combined effects of these facts lead us to the behavior explained above and observed in Figs.  5, 6, and 7. Many others interesting observations can be extracted from Figs.  5, 6, and 7; however, the most important ones are summarized as follows. The mean values of both CHTn and CHTh are strongly sensitive to the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability.</b> For instance, when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed and the CDT is exponential distributed (notice that this scenario corresponds to the green lines of Fig.  5 a), the mean value of CHTn (CHTh) decreases from 77.35 to 53.057  s (101 to 55.4  s) as the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> goes from 0.001 to 0.1. Similar behaviors are observed when the CDT is modeled by either an Erlang or a hyper-exponential distribution. Also, from Figs.  5, 6, and 7, it is evident that the first three moments of both CHTn and CHTh are highly sensitive to the probability distribution of both CDT and UST. Thus, selecting a suitable model that effectively captures the realistic statistics of both CDT and UST is of paramount importance when analyzing the performance of mobile cognitive radio cellular networks.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Figs.  5 a, 6 a, and 7 a show that, {{for a given}} CDT {{probability}} distribution and for a given value of the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability,</b> the quantitative difference between the mean value of the CHTn when the UST is hyper-exponentially distributed and the mean value of the CHTn when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed is small but not negligible (differences not greater than 6.6 % are found). Referring to the CoV {skewness} of the CHTn, Figs.  5 b, c, 6 b, c, and 7 b, c show important differences between the case when the UST is hyper-exponential and the case when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed (differences up to 12.75 and 15.20 % are observed for the CoV and Sk, respectively). Similar results are obtained when the CHTh is considered. Due {{to the fact that}} both distributions (i.e., hyper-exponential and hyper-Erlang) for modeling the UST have the same first three standardized moments, we conclude that the (not negligible) quantitative difference among the mean value, CoV, and Sk of both CHTn and CHTh when the UST is hyper-exponentially distributed compared to the case when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed is due to moments higher than the third one. Analyzing the impact of moments of UST (and CDT) higher than the third one on channel holding time statistics represents a topic of our current research.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{teletraffic}} {{performance and}} channel holding time characterization in mobile cognitive radio cellular networks (CRCNs) under fixed-rate traffic with hard-delay constraints are investigated. To this end, {{a mathematical model}} to capture the effect of interruption of ongoing calls of secondary users (SUs) due {{to the arrival of}} primary users (PUs) is proposed. The proposed model relies on the use of an independent potential interruption time associated with the instant of possible interruption for each ongoing call in every visited cell. Then, a Poisson process is used to approximate the secondary users’ call interruption process due to the arrival of PUs. Based on this model and considering that unencumbered service time (UST) and cell dwell time (CDT) of SUs are independent generally distributed random variables, analytical formulae for both the probability distributions of channel holding times and inter-cell handoff attempts rate are derived. Also, a novel approximated closed-form mathematical expression for call forced termination probability of SUs is derived under the restriction that the UST is exponentially distributed. Additionally, by considering all the involved time variables exponentially distributed and employing fractional channel reservation to prioritize intra- and inter-cell handoff call attempts over new call requests, a queuing analysis to evaluate the call-level performance of CRCNs in terms of the maximum Erlang capacity is developed. The accuracy of our proposed mathematical models is extensively investigated under a variety of different evaluation scenarios for all the considered call-level performance metrics. Numerical results demonstrate that channel holding time statistics are highly sensitive to both <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> of ongoing secondary calls and type of probability distribution functions used to model CDT and UST. From the teletraffic perspective, numerical results reveal that the system Erlang capacity largely depends on the relative value of the mean secondary service time to the mean primary service time and the primary channels’ utilization factor. Also, the obtained results show that there exists a critical utilization factor of the primary resources from which it is no longer possible to guarantee the required quality of service of SUs and, therefore, services with hard-delay constraints cannot be even supported in CRCNs.|$|R

The accuracy, applicability, and robustness of our proposed mathematical models were extensively investigated under a variety of different evaluation scenarios for all the considered call-level performance metrics. Although numerical results are extracted from particular scenarios with certain set of parameter values, our contribution clearly shows that there exist relevant sensitive issues concerning interruption time (IT), cell dwell time (CDT), unencumbered service time (UST), and certain parameters of the primary network (i.e., mean service time, channels usage) that significantly influence the performance of the secondary network. Numerical results reveal that the first three standardized moments of both CHTn and CHTh are highly sensitive to both <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> and type of probability distribution functions used to model CDT and UST. From the teletraffic point of view, numerical results demonstrate that system Erlang capacity strongly depends on the relative value of the mean secondary service time to the mean primary service time, users’ mobility, whether or not spectrum handoff (SH) is used, and the primary channel utilization factor. Furthermore, numerical results reveal that there exists a critical utilization factor of the primary resources from which it is no longer possible to guarantee the required QoS of SUs and, therefore, delay sensitive services cannot be even supported in CRCNs. Thus, it is of paramount importance to develop mechanisms that effectively mitigate the adverse effects of service interruption of SUs in cognitive radio networks.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of replacing the traditional steel reinforcement with {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) cages in precast concrete tunnel segmental lining {{has been shown}} by the authors in previous papers. The use of GFRP rebars as structural reinforcement in precast tunnel segments, allows several advantages in terms of structural durability or in cases of temporary lining {{that will have to be}} demolished later. Furthermore, this reinforcement type can be a suitable solution to create dielectric <b>joints,</b> ensuring the <b>interruption</b> of possible stray currents, which often lead to corrosion problems. Nevertheless, this peculiar application requires curvilinear shape of the reinforcement, and then different production process and rebar geometries. In the present work, a suggestion for the optimization of the GFRP reinforcement for tunnel segment is given. Four different GFRP cage typologies are analysed and applied as a reinforcement in full-scale tunnel segments. Both bending and point load tests are developed and the structural performances of the specimens are compared and discussed. Finally, the best solution, in terms of cost-benefit analysis is proposed...|$|R
50|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.Some are prone to dislocation of the kneecaps, inherited eye diseases, deafness and Legg Perthes—a disease of the hip joints of small dog breeds. Prone to mast cell tumors.Legg-Calvé-Perthes syndrome, also called Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, is where the ball section of the femur in the hip <b>joint</b> deteriorates following <b>interruption</b> of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6-12 months of age and has been documented in a variety of other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|R
40|$|With the {{explosion}} of consumer demand, media streaming will soon be the dominant type of Internet traffic. Since such applications are intrinsically delay-sensitive, the conventional network control policies and coding algorithms may not be appropriate tools for data dissemination over networks. The major issue with design and analysis of delay-sensitive applications {{is the notion of}} delay, which significantly varies across different applications and time scales. We present a framework for studying the problem of media streaming in an unreliable environment. The focus of this work is on end-user experience for such applications. First, we take an analytical approach to study fundamental rate-delay-reliability trade-offs in the context of media streaming for a single receiver system. We consider the <b>probability</b> of <b>interruption</b> in media playback (buffer underflow) as well as the number of initially buffered packets (initial waiting time) as the Quality of user Experience (QoE) metrics. We characterize the optimal trade-off between these metrics as a function of system parameters such as the packet arrival rate and the file size, for different channel models. For a memoryless channel, we model the receiver's queue dynamics as an M/D/ 1 queue. Then, we show that for arrival rates slightly larger than the play rate, the minimum initial buffering required to achieve certain level of <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> remains bounded as the file size grows. For the case where the arrival rate and the play rate match, the minimum initial buffer size should scale as the square root of the file size. We also study media streaming over channels with memory, modeled using Markovian arrival processes. We characterize the optimal trade-off curves for the infinite file size case, in such Markovian environments. Second, we generalize the results to the case of multiple servers or peers streaming to a single receiver. Random linear network coding allows us to simplify the packet selection strategies and alleviate issues such as duplicate packet reception. We show that the multi-server streaming problem over a memoryless channel can be transformed into a single-server streaming problem, for which we have characterized QoE trade-offs. Third, we study the design of media streaming applications in the presence of multiple heterogeneous wireless access methods with different access costs. Our objective is to analytically characterize the trade-off between usage cost and QoE metrics. We model each access network as a server that provides packets to the user according to a Poisson process with a certain rate and cost. User must make a decision on how many packets to buffer before playback, and which networks to access during the playback. We design, analyze and compare several control policies. In particular, we show that a simple Markov policy with a threshold structure performs the best. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal control policy as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a probabilistic constraint. We present the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for this problem by expanding the state space, and exploit it as a verification method for optimality of the proposed control policy. We use the tools and techniques developed for media streaming applications in the context of power supply networks. We study the value of storage in securing reliability of a system with uncertain supply and demand, and supply friction. We assume storage, when available, can be used to compensate, fully or partially, for the surge in demand or loss of supply. We formulate the problem of optimal utilization of storage with the objective of maximizing system reliability as minimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite horizon. We show that when the stage cost is linear {{in the size of the}} blackout, the optimal policy is myopic in the sense that all shocks are compensated by storage up to the available level of storage. However, when the stage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to curtail some of the demand and allow a small current blackout in the interest of maintaining a higher level of reserve to avoid a large blackout in the future. Finally, we examine the value of storage capacity in improving system's reliability, as well as the effects of the associated optimal policies under different stage costs on the probability distribution of blackouts. by Ali ParandehGheibi.
