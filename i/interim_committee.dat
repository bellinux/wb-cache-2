5|$|In May 1945 an <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> {{was created}} to advise and report on wartime and postwar {{policies}} {{regarding the use of}} nuclear energy. The <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, {{before the}} <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> was formed, Bush, Conant and Irvin Stewart had {{produced}} {{a proposal for}} legislation to control nuclear energy. Conant submitted the proposals to the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> at its meeting on July 9, 1945. Harrison brought in two experienced lawyers, Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury {{to take up the}} job of drafting the legislation. Their draft bill would have created a nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, to operate facilities, to conduct research and to regulate all forms of nuclear energy. The Royall-Marbury bill was reviewed by the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. The bill was forwarded to the President in August. The <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> met again on September 28 to discuss legislative strategy. The Royall-Marbury bill was introduced into the United States Congress by the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, Andrew J. May, and the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, Senator Edwin C. Johnson on October 3. It then became known as the May-Johnson bill.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> {{was created}} to advise on wartime and postwar use of nuclear energy. The {{committee}} was chaired by Stimson, with James F. Byrnes, a former US Senator soon to be Secretary of State, as President Harry S. Truman's personal representative; Ralph A. Bard, the Under Secretary of the Navy; William L. Clayton, the Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush; Karl T. Compton; James B. Conant; and George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and president of New York Life Insurance Company. The <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee,</b> the scientific panel offered its opinion {{not just on the}} likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its probable military and political impact.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> {{held its}} first meeting on 9 May 1945. Stimson began by {{outlining}} its broad terms of reference, which included advising the President on wartime controls {{and the release of}} information, and making recommendations on post-war controls and policies related to nuclear energy, including legislation. The <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military use of nuclear weapons but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime use of nuclear weapons and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the Interim Committee's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|As Representative Mark Larson {{neared the}} end of his term-limited tenure in the Colorado House of Representatives, Roberts began to work with him on {{learning}} the legislative process, in preparation for seeking elected office herself. She instigated a bill, introduced by Larson and eventually signed into law, to require that remains be handled in accordance with the wishes of the deceased. She also lobbied the legislature, unsuccessfully, for the creation of an <b>interim</b> <b>committee</b> to study palliative care.|$|E
50|$|<b>Interim</b> <b>committees</b> fulfill {{essentially}} the same functions as standing committees and are differentiated from standing committees in that they meet during the interim between legislative sessions to discuss bills, to study issues, and to recommend bills for consideration. <b>Interim</b> <b>committees</b> may take the same actions on a bill as a standing committee.|$|R

5|$|Foreseeing {{another war}} in Europe, Szilard {{moved to the}} United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of {{creating}} a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating {{a demonstration of the}} atomic bomb, but the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> chose to use them against cities without warning.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Roberts sat on an <b>interim</b> <b>committee</b> {{dealing with}} hospice and palliative care issues, and carried legislation originating from that committee during the 2010 session, including two bills that clarified policies surrounding end-of-life care and advance directives. Other legislation that Roberts carried in 2010 included {{a bill to}} allow voluntary income tax contributions to support 2-1-1 services, and she fought against cuts to the Native American tuition waiver program at Fort Lewis College. Roberts {{was one of only}} three Republican House members to vote in support of Colorado's 2010 budget, after successfully sponsoring an amendment that removed restrictions on Fort Lewis College's ability to set its own out-of-state tuition rates.|$|E
5|$|Although the Vice President Henry A. Wallace {{had been}} {{involved}} in the Manhattan Project since the beginning, his successor, Harry S. Truman, was not briefed on the project by Stimson until April 23, 1945, eleven days after he became president on Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. On May 2, 1945, Truman approved the formation of the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee,</b> an advisory group that would report on the atomic bomb. It consisted of Stimson, James F. Byrnes, George L. Harrison, Vannevar Bush, James Bryant Conant, Karl Taylor Compton, William L. Clayton, and Ralph Austin Bard, advised by scientists Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Arthur Compton. In a June 1 report, the Committee concluded that the bomb should be used as soon as possible against a war plant surrounded by workers' homes and that no warning or demonstration should be given.|$|E

5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E
5|$|The May-Johnson bill soon {{ran into}} difficulties. Although the <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> was {{discharged}} in November, it met {{one more time}} in December to discuss amendments to the May-Johnson bill. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative Senate bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control of atomic energy. In 1946, several major revisions were made to the McMahon bill in order to appease the more conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed both the Senate and the House without major modifications. On August 1, 1946, Truman signed the McMahon bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{initiative}} for a cross-fjord ferry services {{was taken by}} Arthur Selvig, leader of the merchants' association in Levanger. In January 1955, he invited members of the municipal councils {{on both sides of}} the fjord to establish a company. The meeting was held in Levanger, and the representatives from Mosvik took two days to get to the meeting. An <b>interim</b> <b>committee</b> was appointed, which was to cooperate with Innherreds Aktie Dampskibsselskab to persuade them not purchase a new ship, and also to consider purchase of a combined car- and cargo-ferry, or alternatively a conventional vessel. At the time, National Road 755 between Mosvik and Leksvik was being constructed and would be competed by the end of the decade; however, it would take longer before Mosvik would be connected to Venneshamn. The committee suggested the route Venneshamn–Kjerringvik–Vangshylla–Ytterøy–Levanger be established. The municipal council of Ytterøy voted to place the ferry quay at Hokstad, which was serving as the municipal center.|$|E

Later that same year, Agashe was denied participation in the annual general meeting of the BCCI due to alleged factional disputes by then BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya. He was later denied his right to vote in the Board's elections that year because the alleged factionalism in the MCA saw Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar losing by one vote to the post of the BCCI's president. Agashe moved court countermanding the elections, alleging that the absence of his vote ensured an unfair victory to Dalmiya nominee Ranbir Singh Mahendra. The Madras High Court stated a prima facie case against the elections, with Agashe expressing satisfaction with the court's decision.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> on Un-American Activities, most {{commonly}} known as the Canwell Committee, (1947-1949) was a special investigative committee of the Washington State Legislature which in 1948 investigated the influence of the Communist Party USA in Washington state. Named after its chairman, Albert F. Canwell, the committee concentrated upon communist influence in the Washington Commonwealth Federation and its relationship to the Democratic Party in Washington, as well alleged Communist Party membership of certain faculty members at the University of Washington in Seattle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Interim</b> <b>Committee</b> {{included}} {{members of}} both the Washington House of Representatives and the State Senate.
