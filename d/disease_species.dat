Serum was collected from: 29 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 18 patients with ulcerative colitis alone, 19 patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction of other causes, and 42 healthy control subjects. Bile duct antibodies reacted with an antigen localised to the small and large intrahepatic bile ducts. When blood group A human liver was used they were detected in 34 % of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. They were not detected when blood group O human liver was used. Bile duct antibodies that reacted with obstructed and normal rabbit liver were detected in 34 % and 17 % respectively of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis but were also present in similar proportions of control subjects. Colon antibodies that reacted with human and rabbit colon were found in 52 % and 24 % respectively of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Absorption studies using blood group substances A and B abolished the reactivity of bile duct antibodies with human and rabbit liver and that of colon antibodies' with rabbit colon. Colon antibodies that reacted with human colon were not absorbed. Absorption studies using isolated peripheral white blood cells did not affect reactivity of bile duct or colon antibodies. We conclude that bile duct antibodies are <b>disease,</b> <b>species,</b> and tissue non-specific and react with blood group A/B antigens present in human and rabbit bile ducts and rabbit colon.

40|$|Effective {{ecological}} arthropod {{and disease}} management begins with design {{and management of}} a farming system that avoids or suppresses pests and diseases. Such a system requires few external inputs. Knowing which pests and diseases are prevalent in your area allows you to implement strategies to manage them before they occur. By anticipating likely pest and <b>disease</b> <b>species</b> for crops you intend to grow, you can identify them correctly when they do appear. Before you select varieties and plant your crop, look up common pests that affect the crop in your area.

40|$|C. I. M. and T. Y. S. contributed {{equally to}} this article. ABSTRACT Phylogenomic footprinting is an {{approach}} for ab initio identification of genome-wide regulatory elements in bacte-rial species based on sequence conservation. The statistical {{power of the}} phylogenomic approach depends {{on the degree of}} se-quence conservation, the length of regulatory elements, and the level of phylogenetic divergence among genomes. Building on an earlier model, we propose a binomial model that uses synonymous tree lengths as neutral expectations for determining the sta-tistical significance of conserved intergenic spacer (IGS) sequences. Simulations show that the binomial model is robust to varia-tions in the value of evolutionary parameters, including base frequencies and the transition-to-transversion ratio. We used the model to search for regulatory sequences in the Lyme <b>disease</b> <b>species</b> group (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) using 23 genomes. The model indicates that the currently available set of Borrelia genomes would not yield regulatory sequences shorter than five bases, suggesting that genome sequences of additional B. burgdorferi sensu lato species are needed. Nevertheless, we show that previously known regulatory elements are indeed strongly conserved in sequence or structure across these Borrelia species. Fur...|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} lifecycle of obligate intracellular bacteria {{presents a}} superb {{opportunity to develop}} understanding {{of the interaction between}} the bacteria and host under the pretext that disruption of these processes will likely lead to death of the pathogen and prevention of associated <b>disease.</b> <b>Species</b> of the genus Rickettsia contain some of the most hazardous of the obligate intracellular bacteria, including Rickettsia rickettsii and R. conorii the causative agents of Rocky Mountain and Mediterranean spotted fevers, respectively. Spotted fever group Rickettsia species commonly invade and thrive within cells of the host circulatory system whereby the endothelial cells are severely perturbed. The subsequent disruption of circulatory continuity results in much of the severe morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases, including macropapular dermal rash, interstitial pneumonia, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, and other multisystem manifestations. This review describes current knowledge of the essential pathogenic processes of adherence to and invasion of host cells, efforts to disrupt these processes, and potential for disease prevention through vaccination with recently identified bacterial adherence and invasion proteins. A more complete understanding of these bacterial proteins will provide an opportunity for prevention and treatment of spotted fever group Rickettsia infections...|$|E

40|$|Although thrips are {{globally}} important crop {{pests and}} vectors of viral <b>disease,</b> <b>species</b> identifications are {{difficult because of}} their small size and inconspicuous morphological differences. Sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI- 5 ' (DNA barcode) region has proven effective for the identification of species in many groups of insect pests. We analyzed barcode sequence variation among 471 thrips from various plant hosts in north-central Pakistan. The Barcode Index Number (BIN) system assigned these sequences to 55 BINs, while the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery detected 56 partitions, a count that coincided {{with the number of}} monophyletic lineages recognized by Neighbor-Joining analysis and Bayesian inference. Congeneric species showed an average of 19 % sequence divergence (range = 5. 6 % - 27 %) at COI, while intraspecific distances averaged 0. 6 % (range = 0. 0 % - 7. 6 %). BIN analysis suggested that all intraspecific divergence > 3. 0 % actually involved a species complex. In fact, sequences for three major pest species (Haplothrips reuteri, Thrips palmi, Thrips tabaci), and one predatory thrips (Aeolothrips intermedius) showed deep intraspecific divergences, providing evidence that each is a cryptic species complex.

Disease can be transmitted by the inhalation of spores or by direct inoculation on disrupted skin or mucosa. For rare diseases such as zygomycosis, two or more cases occurring in a short time should be investigated as a probable epidemic. Twelve hospital outbreaks and two pseudoepidemics caused by Zygomycetes have been cited in the English literature. The first epidemic was recorded in 1977 and the last in 2008. Outbreaks {{have been reported in the}} USA, the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Cases have included cutaneous, disseminated, pulmonary and rhinocerebral <b>disease.</b> <b>Species</b> identified have included Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus rhizopodiformis, Rhizopus microsporus, Rhizopus spp., Absidia corymbifera and Rhizomucor pusillius.

Strains RM- 1 - 138 and RL- 1 - 178 of S. philanthi and SS- 2 - 243 of S. mycarofaciens, isolated from the rhizosphere soil of chili peppers grown in southern Thailand, have shown a good efficacy to control Sclerotium roljsii, Ralstonia solanacearum and Rhizoctonia solani but their effect against B. cinerea is not known. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of the three strains of Streptomyces spp. against B. cinerea in vitro and on tomato plants. Results indicated that the three strains inhibit the growth of B. cinerea in Petri plates and have a significant protective efficacy, although variable between strains of Streptomyces spp., against B. cinerea on tomato plant. To assess the possible variability in susceptibility to these antagonistic strains in populations of B. cinerea, the protective efficacy of these bacteria were evaluated against 41 strains differing in their geographic origin, host of isolation and level of aggressiveness. Results based on confrontation tests in Petri plates suggest a diversity in the sensitivity of the different strains of B. cinerea to these biological control agents. The relevance of these results to ensure durability of the efficacy of these biological control agents will be discussed...|$|E

Rodents prey on birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates, and {{indirectly}} effect native wildlife by destroying plants, competing for food, and transmitting <b>disease.</b> <b>Species</b> such as Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), black rats (R. Rattus), and Polynesian rats (R. exulans) {{have caused the}} extinction of several species of native birds, mammals, and lizards (Atkinson 1985). For example, {{less than a decade}} after black rats were accidently introduced to Big South Cape Island in New Zealand in the early 1960 s, one bat species- the greater short-tailed bat (Mystacina robusta) - and five bird species, including the South Island snipe (Coenocorypha iredalei), went extinct (Bell 1978). To protect natural resources from rodents, biologists and landowners have typically applied anticoagulant rodenticides through bait stations. Though such stations can effectively eradicate rodents in small areas, they have not been feasible or effective in larger areas or on inaccessible islands. In 2005, USDA-APHIS Wildlife Services, in collaboration with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and two private companies, achieved a breakthrough in large-scale rodent eradication by developing and registering three new anticoagulant rodenticide products- Diphacinone 50 Conservation, Brodifacoum 25 W Conservation, and Brodifacoum 25 D Conservation- for broadcast application, both by hand or by air.

40|$|Background: Non-tuberculous {{mycobacteria}} (NTM) {{are emerging}} as important pathogens. Their treatment also {{differs from that}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In India, any datum on them is scarce as species identification and drug susceptibility are not performed in most laboratories. Susceptibility also differs from one geographic area to another, and in our country, there are no data even to guide the clinicians to start treatment empirically. Methodology: The present study endeavours to generate drug susceptibility data on NTM isolated from sputum samples collected and stored from 6445 symptomatics for pulmonary tuberculosis during a prevalence survey and from specimens received from the hospital. Isolates were not necessarily associated with the <b>disease.</b> <b>Species</b> were identified and antibiotic susceptibility was performed using micro-broth dilution technique as per the standard Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Results: A total of 65 NTM with 11 species were identified, of which 27 belonged to Mycobacterium fortuitum complex, 14 Mycobacterium gordonae, 9 Mycobacterium avium, 7 Mycobacterium flavescens, 4 Mycobacterium scrofulaceum and one each of others. Sensitivity to amikacin for M. fortuitum was 95. 22 % (20 out of 21), followed by ciprofloxacin (76. 19 %) and clarithromycin (71. 42 %). All the 9 M. avium isolates, 11 of M. gordonae (78. 57 %), 5 of M. flavescens and 2 of M. scrofulaceum were sensitive to clarithromycin. All NTM were resistant to first-line antitubercular drugs except 8, which were sensitive to streptomycin. Conclusions: Drug sensitivity of NTM varies from species to species.

We also reviewed the reported cases and case series of NTM BSI by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Wanfang databases. Data of normal distribution were expressed by mean ± standard deviation (SD). Data of nonnormal distribution were expressed by median and interquartile range (IQR). Results: Among the ten patients with NTM BSI, the median age was 51 years (IQR 29 – 57 years) and three patients were males. Eight patients were immunocompromised, with underlying diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (one patient), rheumatic diseases (two patients), breast cancer (one patient), myelodysplastic syndrome (two patients), and aplastic anemia (two patients). Other organ(s) involved were lung (two patients), endocardium (two patients), brain, spinal cord, and soft tissue (one each patient). The median lymphocyte was 0. 66 × 109 /L (IQR 0. 24 – 1. 93 × 109 /L). The median cluster of differentiation 4 (CD 4) cell count was 179 /mm 3 (IQR 82 – 619 /mm 3).
