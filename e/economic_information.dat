2500|$|The Auroux laws (1982) {{increased}} {{the rights of}} trade unions and employees in the workplace, covering collective bargaining, representation, information, health and safety, and unfair dismissal. The Auroux Laws included a requirement that half of all overtime worked in excess of 130 hours per year must be compensated by additional time off, while trade union delegates became entitled {{to an increase in}} paid time off for union activities and to increased protection against dismissal. In addition, an Auroux Law of November 1982 established an obligation to negotiate real wages and hours once a year {{at the level of the}} firm, and to negotiate real wages once a year and to revise job classifications once every five years at the national industry level. Mandatory collective bargaining at the firm level of industry was introduced, while the laws also strengthened the rules on health and safety in the workplace, bestowing more rights upon the Comites d’hygiene et securite (though not the right to stop production in case of extreme danger), while also granting working-class representatives release time, training for involvement [...] in the comite d’entreprise and other representative bodies in the firm, recourse to expert consultants. Unions acquired rights to organise, to hold meetings in firms, and to call in outside speakers to address the workers. Worker representation on the comite d’rentreprise was increased and the comite was provided with additional powers, such as the right to obtain confidential <b>economic</b> <b>information</b> from the firm to use in advising it on policy. In spite of these positive changes, however, the comite d'entreprise remained a consultative body with little influence on economic policy, while only large firms were required to provide their comite d’enterprises with <b>economic</b> <b>information.</b> This meant that almost two-thirds of the workers were excluded from exercising this oversight function.|$|E

The challenge lies in understanding and developing the potential of an effects-based approach to operations. Resistance to this kind of approach may be warranted when individuals mischaracterize EBO as (1) requiring complete knowledge of an adversary’s intentions, (2) discounting the enemy’s human dimension, and (3) being overly dependent on centralization to succeed. With an accurate understanding of the intent of EBO, none of these assertions has any validity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to Truman's expectations, however, Martin {{guarded the}} Fed's independence, not just through Truman's {{administration}} but also through the four administrations that would follow. To the present day, his term as Chairman {{is the longest}} term the Board of Governors has seen. Over nearly two decades, Martin would achieve global recognition as a central banker. He was able to pursue independent monetary policies while still paying heed to the desires of various administrations. Although the objectives of Martin's monetary policy were low inflation and economic stability, he rejected {{the idea that the}} Fed could pursue its policies through the targeting of a single indicator and instead made policy decisions by examining a wide array of <b>economic</b> <b>information.</b> As Chairman, he institutionalized this approach within the proceedings of the FOMC, gathering the opinions of all governors and presidents within the System before making decisions. As a result, his decisions were often supported by unanimous votes on the FOMC. The job of the Federal Reserve, he famously said, is [...] "to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going," [...] that is, raise interest rates just when economy reaches peak activity after a recession.|$|E

The Sunday Age, however, supported The Coalition, rejecting the their weekly's counterpart editorial that Labor had vision and that the election amounted to choosing a lesser evil, noting that during the election campaign a [...] "genuine contest of ideas [...] not materialised", that [...] "the campaign [...] contained no vision or policy clarion call commanding our attention and demanding our vote" [...] and subsequently that [...] "in the absence of policies and detailed <b>economic</b> <b>information,</b> voter decisiveness will depend on one issue: trust."
