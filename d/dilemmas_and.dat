5|$|When the Supercopa Sudamericana {{was created}} in 1988, a new {{continental}} Super Cup competition in South America became viable. CONMEBOL named the new competition Recopa Sudamericana after the defunct Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes played in 1970 and 1971. The Recopa Sudamericana, disputed between the winners of South America's two premier club competitions, is not related chronologically to the Recopa Sudamericana, created in 1968 which was contested between former South American winners of the Intercontinental Cup, Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes, disputed among Cup winners of South America. The first edition was played in 1989 and pitted Uruguayan club Nacional and Argentinian side Racing. Played on two legs, Nacional managed to win the trophy after winning 4–1 on points. Due to schedule <b>dilemmas</b> <b>and</b> political issues, the 1990 edition was played in Miami between Atlético Nacional and Boca Juniors with the latter winning 0–1. Olimpia of Paraguay would win the Recopa Sudamericana without the need to dispute a match as the Decano won both the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana. CONMEBOL declared Olimpia the automatic winners of the 1991 competition.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in relative secrecy compared to the press that its predecessor possessed. The recording sessions inspired lyricism that related to decaying relationships, moral <b>dilemmas,</b> <b>and</b> societal shortcomings, many with a political edge. It is the first Fall Out Boy album with lyrics that are less autobiographical. The album's style moved away from early emo power chords and toward a wider variation in genre. Fall Out Boy recruited several guest artists for Folie à Deux, as well as employing instruments and recording techniques previously unfamiliar to the group. To promote the album, the band launched a viral campaign based around a Big Brother-type organization named [...] "Citizens For Our Betterment" [...] (CFOB) and embarked on an extensive tour schedule.|$|E
500|$|Although Tomb Raider III {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} critics, {{it did not}} fare {{as well as its}} two predecessors. Edge considered Tomb Raider III [...] "a valid addition to the growing franchise", stating that it offers more attractive graphics and more innovation than Tomb Raider II, while Computer and Video Games described it as [...] "a perfect mix of the exploration and puzzles of the original, and the more-to-shoot nature of the sequel." [...] Other critics, however, felt that the game failed to change the same tried and tested formula. In its 1998 review, IGN said that Tomb Raider III [...] "solves none of its original <b>dilemmas,</b> <b>and</b> as it stands now, the exploration-adventure genre—one that was revolutionized by Tomb Raider—is in the exact spot it was two years ago." ...|$|E

[...] The song also served as an introduction to the character, even though he was featured in many other movies before - hence the title [...] "You Know My Name" [...] - dealing with Bond's action such as his first assassination, [...] "introducing himself to what may be {{the rest of his life}} and how he will live it and what it will mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to its {{commercial}} and critical success, Square Enix released a direct sequel to Final Fantasy X in 2003, titled Final Fantasy X-2. The sequel is set {{two years after}} the conclusion of Final Fantasy X, establishing new conflicts and <b>dilemmas</b> <b>and</b> resolving loose ends left by the original game. Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 3.96 million units versus 6.6 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title's popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII, another well-received Final Fantasy game. In 2013, after the release of the HD Remaster, Nojima stated {{that he would like to}} see a second sequel to X, and if there were demand for it, it could happen.

500|$|A {{central part}} of Fall Out Boy's sound {{is rooted in the}} band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, who {{commonly}} uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories. Wentz stated, [...] "I write about what I’m going through most of the time, or what I imagine people are going through most of the time." [...] He draws inspiration from authors such as Charles Bukowski, Ernest Hemingway, and JT LeRoy, as well as rappers such as Lil Wayne, who he described as his primary influence while writing Infinity on High. On Fall Out Boy's earlier works, Wentz wrote primarily about love and heartbreak. Themes addressed on From Under the Cork Tree include narcissism and megalomania, while many tracks on Infinity on High discuss {{the ups and downs of}} fame. While writing Folie à Deux, he explored moral <b>dilemmas</b> <b>and</b> societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E

500|$|Pete Wentz {{was once}} again the primary lyricist of the band during the {{production}} of the album. Stump said that Wentz [...] "totally outdid himself on this record. He doesn't even know how good his lyrics are here." [...] Wentz, despite many recent personal developments (marriage to Ashlee Simpson, birth of his son, Bronx), desired to shift the focus away from himself and turn it outward onto the world. For the first time on a Fall Out Boy album, Folie is rarely autobiographical, as the band believed the format was [...] "losing its luster" [...] because [...] "everyone was doing it." [...] The songs on the album explore decaying relationships, moral <b>dilemmas,</b> <b>and</b> societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. Stump tagged Folie à Deux as a [...] "message record" [...] that takes aim at [...] "the materialistic dance between any two parties obsessed with each other, whether it's teenage girls and handbag makers, politicians and lobbyists or tabloids and stars." [...] Folie à Deux also dissects how self-motivated American culture is, and many of the lyrics are intended to be satirical. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers also {{commented on}} the {{accompanying}} alternate reality game. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times, praised the album and game concept as [...] "a total marriage of the pop and gamer aesthetics that unlocks the rusty cages {{of the music industry}} and solves some key problems facing rock music as its cultural dominance dissolves into dust." [...] In relation to the declining music industry, Joseph Jaffe of Brandweek commented that such [...] "mysterious marketing measures [...] are what's desperately needed to gain attention in this uncertain era of distribution <b>dilemmas</b> <b>and</b> sagging sales", also commending acts such as Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead for being [...] "more innovative than marketers". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, comparing it to The X-Files and calling it [...] "A sci-fi concept album whose end-of-days, paranoia-drenched story line has been disseminated via the Internet". It also stated: [...] "Amid its carefully calibrated sonic assaults, Year Zero has a number of tracks that will stop you in yours. Sometimes, it's a matter of dropping the volume [...] Even his use of electronics has shifted to a new level [...] Is the truth in here? Dunno, but Reznor's claim that 'I got my violence in high def ultra-realism' sounds like gospel to us." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for The Boys from Baghdad High were {{generally}} favourable. The Huffington Post said that giving the video cameras {{to the students}} was an excellent idea because the depiction of their school-life versus the increasing danger was captured [...] "with neutral equality [...] that the film is able to capture the interiority of its subjects more acutely than a straight-forward examination of violence would". Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent said, [...] "its storyline was governed not by a tick-list of stock narrative <b>dilemmas</b> <b>and</b> secrets but the cruel uncertainties that occupation and insurgency have brought to Baghdad." [...] Time Out New York gave the film five out of five stars, and PopMatters rated it 8 out of 10. The Washington Posts Paul Farhi said, [...] "HBO has carved a niche as the TV home {{of some of the}} most compelling programs about the Iraq war ... Baghdad High does no harm to HBO's burgeoning war cred." [...] Variety, The Christian Science Monitor, LA Weekly, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the film. At the Question-and-Answer session following a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, one audience member, a new recruit to the United States Marine Corps, told Ali, who had also attended, [...] "I finally know what life is like behind those walls and what you guys are like, and it's been really, really fantastic." ...|$|E

Stan and Kyle are best friends, and their relationship, which is {{intended}} to reflect the real-life friendship between Parker and Stone, is a common topic throughout the series. The two do have their disagreements, but always reconcile without any long-term damage to their friendship. As {{is the case with}} his other friends and classmates, Stan is frequently at odds with Cartman, resenting Cartman's behavior and openly mocking his weight. Stan also shares a close friendship with Kenny, while Kenny professes that Stan is one of [...] "the best friends a guy could have". Stan can understand Kenny's muffled voice perfectly, and typically exclaims the catchphrase [...] "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!", following one of Kenny's trademark deaths, allowing Kyle to follow up with [...] "You bastards!" [...] Stan is the only character in the group to have had a steady girlfriend, Wendy Testaburger, and their relationship was a recurring topic in the show's earlier seasons. Despite reconciling and declaring to be a couple again in the season 11 (2007) episode [...] "The List" [...] after Wendy had dumped him in the season seven (2003) episode [...] "Raisins", their relationship has received relatively less focus in recent seasons. As a running gag, a nervous Stan often vomits whenever Wendy approaches to kiss or speak to him. In many episodes, Stan contemplates ethics in beliefs, moral <b>dilemmas,</b> <b>and</b> contentious issues, and will often reflect on the lessons he has attained with a speech that often begins with [...] "You know, I learned something today...".|$|E
2500|$|The Navya {{movement}} {{was not without}} its critics. [...] The doubt, <b>dilemmas</b> <b>and</b> indecision in every turn of the plot resulted in increasingly sophisticated and complex narrations, which some readers found uninteresting. [...] It was derided as an intellectual exercise {{of the middle class}} intelligentsia; in its extreme sophistication, it was thought to have lost its touch with realities of life. [...] This led to a gradual waning of the Navya school as it was supplanted by emerging waves of Navyottara, Bandaya (protest) and Dalit schools.|$|E

[...] A number of these short novels recounted the [...] "secret history" [...] of a famous event (like Villedieu's Annales galantes), linking the action to an amorous intrigue; these were called histoires galantes. [...] Some of these short novels told stories of the contemporary world (such as Préchac's L'Illustre Parisienne).|$|E

2500|$|The book {{is popular}} in {{elementary}} schools as a historical-fiction novel. Many study units and teaching guides are available. including a study guide by the author. It {{has been used as}} a tool in scholarly work on childhood education and development. Fondrie cites it as an example in a discussion of how to bring up and discuss issues of race and class among young students. McGinley and Kamberlis use it in a study of how children use reading and writing as “vehicles for personal, social, and political exploration.” [...] Along the same lines, Lehr and Thompson examine classroom discussions as a reflection of the teacher’s role as cultural mediator and the response of children to moral <b>dilemmas,</b> <b>and</b> Enciso studies expressions of social identity in the responses of children to Maniac Magee.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concerns}} of the nouvelle classique (love, psychological analysis, moral <b>dilemmas</b> <b>and</b> social constraints) are also apparent in the anonymous epistolary novel Lettres d'une religieuse portugaise (Letters of a Portuguese Nun) (1668), attributed to Guilleragues, which were a sensation when they were published (in part because of their perceived authenticity). [...] These letters, written by a scorned woman to her absent lover, were a powerful representation of amorous passion with many similarities {{to the language of}} Racine. [...] Other epistolary novels followed by Claude Barbin, Vincent Voiture, Edmé Boursault, Fontenelle (who used the form to introduce discussion of philosophical and moral matters, prefiguring Montesquieu's Lettres persanes in the 18th century) and others; actual love letters written by noble ladies (Madame de Bussy-Lameth, Madame de Coligny) were also published.|$|E
