2500|$|Hill did {{not pass}} his driving test until he was 24 years old, and he himself {{described}} his first car as [...] "A wreck. A budding racing driver should own such a car, as it teaches delicacy, poise and anticipation, mostly the latter I think!" [...] He had been interested in motorcycles but in 1954 he saw an advertisement for the Universal Motor Racing Club at Brands Hatch offering laps for 5 shillings. He made his debut in a Cooper 500 Formula 3 car and was committed to racing thereafter. Hill joined Team Lotus as a mechanic soon after but quickly talked {{his way into the}} cockpit. The Lotus presence in Formula One allowed him to make his debut at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix, retiring with a <b>halfshaft</b> failure.|$|E
2500|$|The B31's first {{appearance}} of 1976 {{came in the}} 300 km of Nürburgring, which was the opening round of the World Sportscar Championship (WSC); although three cars were entered, neither finished the race, as Manrico Zanuso's B31 blew its 3-litre Cosworth DFV V8 engine {{before the start of}} the race, Tony Charnell crashed his 2-litre Cosworth FVC straight-four engined B31 out of the race, whilst Peter Smith and John Turner did not actually attend the race. For the 4 Hours of Monza, five B31s were entered; John Blanckley entered Zanuso and Raymond in a DFV-engined B31, Hay Seech entered Bob Marsland and Alois Müller in a Hart-engined B31, Anastasio partnered [...] "Tambauto" [...] in a 1.3-litre Cosworth-engined B31, Smith and Turner drove a 2-litre Cosworth-engined B31, and Claudio Francisci and Biaggio Cammarone drove another 1.3-litre Cosworth B31. However, the cars of Smith/Turner and Francisci/Cammarone did not attend the race, and neither of the other three B31s finished; the Hay Seech car blew its engine after 72 laps, the Anastasio/"Tambauto" [...] car blew its engine after 64 laps, and the John Blanckley car suffered a cooling system failure after 28 laps. The third round of the WSC, which was the 500 km of Imola, saw only one B31 entered; Blanckley entered himself and Zanuso in a DFV-engined B31, but retired again, this time due to gearbox failure after 52 laps. For the Coppa Florio Pergusa, Francisci and Bruno Del Fante entered the only B31 of the event, a 1.3-litre Cosworth-engined car; the team failed to make the start of the race. At the 500 km of Dijon, Blanckley and Raymond drove their DFV-engined B31, but retired once again, after 105 laps. At the 200 miles of Salzburgring, it was a similar story; Zanuso and Blanckley retired the DFV-engined car due to a <b>halfshaft</b> failure. As this was the final round of the WSC season, it meant that no B31 had finished a race in the series; although B31s were used to win a non-championship race at Zolder, a, Interserie race at Zolder, and the Thruxton round of the British Sports Car Championship during the 1976 season.|$|E

50|$|A related {{development}} {{is the use of}} an epicyclic hub gearbox. This is mounted in-line with the <b>halfshaft,</b> so that there is no change in ride height. They are often used for large and heavy vehicles, where the wheel diameter already gives adequate ground clearance. The reduction gearbox allows the halfshafts to turn faster than the wheels, thus requiring less torque for the same power. This permits a smaller and lighter <b>halfshaft</b> and internal drivetrain.|$|E

50|$|In {{his rookie}} start on March 26, 2006 at Homestead-Miami Speedway in the No. 26 New York Stock Exchange Dallara Honda, Andretti started 13th but broke a <b>halfshaft</b> {{in his first}} pitstop, {{eliminating}} him from the race.|$|E
5000|$|The Type 53 was {{notoriously}} {{difficult to}} steer. At the Type 53's {{debut in the}} 1932 Monaco Grand Prix, Albert Divo, noted for his size and strength, was chosen to drive the car, but he gave up during practice after exhausting himself. [...] In June 1932, Jean Bugatti rolled a Type 53 at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb. The hard steering was attributed to not having constant-velocity joints for the front <b>halfshafts</b> and to unequal-length <b>halfshafts</b> without matching torsional characteristics. [...] Modern tests, however, have shown the car to be quite tractable at speed.|$|R
50|$|This {{constant}} mesh, sequential-shift, 5 speed gearbox {{combined with}} ZF limited-slip differential in the transaxle configuration was compact, light (85 lbs including inboard brakes and <b>halfshafts)</b> and quick shifting, but the reliability problem {{had been carried}} over from the F1 and F2 Lotus 12 single seater.|$|R
5000|$|As cars {{increased}} in speed after World War I, {{the use of}} a dropped front beam axle became almost universal, so as to lower the mass of their heavy front-mounted engines, improving stability when cornering. Rear axles were also beam axles, but needed to remain straight as they contained the <b>halfshafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the first}} two {{examples}} of Lotus 12 had De Dion rear suspension, it also introduced a new suspension configuration with {{what came to be}} called [...] "Chapman struts" [...] in the rear, essentially a MacPherson strut with a fixed length <b>halfshaft</b> with universal joints on the ends utilised as a suspension arm.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} use of 4.40 x 10 tires all around and an {{increase}} in front track from 108 cm to 111 cm, the front suspension and steering were the same as that on the KR200. The rear suspension was fully independent, with universal joints at both ends of each <b>halfshaft,</b> located by lower wishbones and coil springs with concentrically mounted shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was by {{double wishbone}} arms with outboard coil/damper unit. Unlike Chapman's former designs where {{the ends of}} anti-roll bar acted as a leg of the upper wishbone, the 18 had a separate front anti-roll bar. The rear suspension was by upper and lower radius arms with reversed lower wishbone, where the fixed-length <b>halfshaft</b> acted as the upper link. The coil/damper unit was also mounted outboard in the rear, and the 18 sometimes ran with and without the rear anti-roll bar.|$|E
5000|$|The Tg500's most {{noticeable}} difference from other Kabinenrollern is its pair of rear wheels. These were driven by <b>halfshafts</b> with universal joints {{at both ends}} and a sliding spline allowing {{the length of the}} shaft to vary, accommodating changes in camber angle. The wheels were suspended by control arms and coil springs with concentric hydraulic shock absorbers. The rear track was 41.1 in ...|$|R
50|$|Constant-velocity joints (AKA homokinetic or CV joints) allow a {{drive shaft}} to {{transmit}} power through a variable angle, at constant rotational speed, without an appreciable increase in friction or play. They are mainly used in {{front wheel drive}} vehicles, and many modern rear wheel drive cars with independent rear suspension typically use CV joints {{at the ends of}} the rear axle <b>halfshafts</b> and increasingly use them on the drive shafts.|$|R
50|$|Portal axles (or portal gear) are an offroad {{technology}} {{where the}} axle tube {{is above the}} center of the wheel hub and where there is a reduction gearbox in the hub. This gives two advantages: ground clearance is increased, particularly beneath the low-slung differential housing of the main axles; and secondly the hub gearing allows the axle <b>halfshafts</b> to drive the same power but at reduced torque (by using higher shaft speed). This reduces load on the axle crownwheel and differential.|$|R
50|$|The French Grand Prix {{took place}} on the tight and twisty Le Mans Bugatti circuit, and Stewart again opted for the more nimble P261 while Spence took Stewart's 8303 chassis and Spence's 8302 chassis was entered by Reg Parnell Racing with Chris Irwin driving. Irwin out-qualified Stewart taking 9th place on the grid, while Spence was a second slower in twelfth. In the race Spence {{completed}} nine laps before a <b>halfshaft</b> broke, while Irwin was running fourth when and engine problem put him out, although he was still classified in fifth place.|$|E
50|$|Going {{into the}} season finale at Tamiami Park, Rahal held a scant 3-point lead over Andretti. Neither driver was a factor at Miami, and just past the halfway point, Andretti dropped out with a broken <b>halfshaft.</b> Rahal {{effectively}} clinched the championship when Andretti dropped out. Roberto Guerrero won the pole and dominated the race, leading the first 111 laps. But on the final lap, his car sputtered and {{he ran out of}} fuel. Al Unser, Jr. slipped by to steal the victory, his lone win of 1986. Unser, Jr. won from 19th starting position, the furthest back any driver had won a CART road/street course race at the time.|$|E
50|$|For 1973, The Surtees team updated the TS14 {{into the}} TS14A {{and the driver}} line up was former {{motorcycle}} champion, Englishman Mike Hailwood and Brazilian José Carlos Pace. The first race of 1973 was the 1973 Argentine Grand Prix and both drivers retired on the same lap, Hailwood with suspension failure and Pace with a broken <b>halfshaft.</b> At Brazil the Englishman retired with a broken gearbox and the Brazilian at his home track retired with suspension failure. At the South African Grand Prix, both drivers retired with accidents, Pace had a flat tyre and Hailwood crashed with Clay Regazzoni's BRM. Regazzoni's car burst into flames with the unconscious Swiss driver at the wheel. Hailwood dived into the flames, undid Regazzoni's belts and managed to drag him clear. Hailwood was later awarded the George Medal for his bravery. Regazzoni was rushed to hospital but he had only minor burns. Both drivers retired at Spain, the Englishman with an oil leak and the Brazilian with a broken <b>halfshaft.</b> The Belgian Grand Prix saw Pace finished eighth and Hailwood retire with an accident. At Monaco, the Englishman finished eighth and the Brazilian retired with a broken <b>halfshaft.</b> The Swedish Grand Prix saw Hailwood retire with a tyre problem and Pace finished 10th, At France, the Englishman retired with an oil Leak and the Brazilian finished 13th. The British Grand Prix saw Jochen Mass join Pace and Hailwood for a one off drive but all were eliminated in a first lap crash with Jody Scheckter (McLaren), Jean-Pierre Beltoise (BRM), Andrea de Adamich (Brabham), Roger Williamson (March) and the Shadow cars of George Follmer (Works Shadow), Jackie Oliver (Works Shadow) and Graham Hill (privateer Shadow) all involved. Hill {{was the only one}} able to drive away from the scene. At Holland, the Englishman retired with an electrical problem and the Brazilian finished seventh. The German Grand Prix saw Mass rejoin the team for a one off drive alongside Pace and Hailwood and all three drivers finished, Pace fourth, Mass seventh and Hailwood 14th. At Austria, the Englishman finished tenth and the Brazilian third. The Italian Grand Prix saw Hailwood seventh and Pace retired with a tyre problem. At Canada, the Englishman finished ninth and the Brazilian retired with wheel problems. The United States Grand Prix saw Mass rejoin the team for a one off drive alongside Pace and Hailwood and all three drivers retired, Pace and Hailwood had suspension failure and Mass with engine failure.|$|E
50|$|In {{this new}} {{front-wheel-drive}} design, the first for Toyota, {{the engine is}} mounted longitudinally. The transmission is mounted under the floorpan, {{as is the case}} in a rear-wheel-drive car. Unlike a rear-wheel-drive car, the transmission has a ring and pinion gear on the front part of the transmission, underneath the engine. The engine, transmission and differential are located a little to the side from the centre line of the car, but still roughly in the centre. <b>Halfshafts</b> then extend from the transmission to the front wheels.|$|R
50|$|Terlingua {{start with}} a Whipple {{supercharger}} mated to the new 5.0 L V8 Mustang GT producing over 750 hp and give it an exclusive Shelby by Eibach sway bar and adjustable coil overs. Terlingua also includes Ford Performance's upgrades like <b>halfshafts,</b> a short throw shifter and the aggressive sounding Borla Exhaust with black tips. The car also added the Brembo big brake kit for race track proven performance, and with 20” WELD racing wheels, tons of Shelby-designed carbon fiber components and the distinct Terlingua Racing Team badging.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the weight}} bias of the GT-R LM heavier {{in the front}} and power {{primarily}} directed at the front axle, the wheels are offset to balance the car. Tyres in the front are 14 in wide, while the rear tyres are only 9 in wide. [...] Cooling for the engine, gearbox, and flywheel systems is located in the nose of the car, allowing the bodywork around the cockpit to be utilized as airflow tunnels. The use of the tunnels required the turbochargers to be placed on top of the engine, exhausting out the top of the bodywork in front of the windshield. The rear drivetrain is designed without traditional <b>halfshafts</b> that would be required to traverse the tunnels, opting instead for the epicyclic gearing system to work around the tunnels.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was {{a typical}} double wishbone arms with outboard coil/damper unit using the Triumph upright made by Alford & Alder, Triumph Herald rack and pinion steering, and outboard Girling non-ventilated disc brake. The rear had the top link with lower reversed wishbone, top and bottom radius arms with the top arm {{at the height of}} the <b>halfshaft,</b> combined with the outboard disc brakes and coil/damper unit. Unlike the arrangement for Lotus 20 suspension, the halfshafts had Metalastic rubber 'doughnuts' on the inside, carrying no cornering (side) forces. The side forces are carried by the lower wishbone, together with the top 'I' arm link, which connects the tail end of the upper side tube in the frame with the extended top end of cast alloy upright.|$|E

50|$|Rutan {{was very}} {{successful}} in the Little Le Mans touring car race. Rutan won the first event in 1957 in a Volvo PV444 he shared with Art Riley. The duo again won the same race, in the same car, in 1958. In 1959 Rutan and Riley were leading the race when their clutch broke. Riley, who drove the Volvo PV444 at that point, pulled over. Realizing {{he could make it}} to the pits he got a push from spectators to continue. The team got disqualified for the outside assistance. Not competing the race in 1960, Rutan and Riley returned in 1961. The duo again dominated the race, this time in a Volvo PV544, despite clutch problems. In 1962 Rutan and Riley were on their way for a third place overall, first in class, until the <b>halfshaft</b> of the PV544 broke. The Little Le Mans race folded after the 1962 edition.|$|E
50|$|Double Cardan joints {{are similar}} to double Cardan shafts, except that {{the length of the}} {{intermediate}} shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and <b>halfshafts</b> of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation. This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.|$|R
50|$|Hub {{gearboxes}} {{are found}} on many large quarrying dump trucks {{and they were}} also an iconic feature of the Alvis FV600 chassis vehicles, such as the Stalwart and Saracen. The FV600 used {{a version of the}} DAF H-drive, with a single differential between sides and all wheels on each side linked by an internal driveshaft and bevel gearboxes to the <b>halfshafts.</b> This has no differential axle between wheel stations on each side and so 'wind-up' was a regular problem for these vehicles when driven on roads. If individual wheels were out of phase with their neighbours, possibly caused by cornering or slightly varying tyre diameter, this could place a considerable force on the gearbox, leading to breakages. For this reason, it was regular practice when driving on tarmac to bump the vehicle over a kerb or other object at times, to allow this wind-up to be released. On slippery surfaces like sand or mud there is enough slippage between the tyres & ground to dissipate the tension.|$|R
5000|$|Debuting in {{the spring}} of 2002, the 2003 Cobra came with a supercharged, 32-valve DOHC, 4.6-liter V8 engine rated at [...] and [...] of torque. Code-named [...] "Terminator" [...] by the SVT {{development}} crew led by John Coletti, numerous improvements were made to the powertrain and driveline to handle the power increase from the previous model's set-up. A cast-iron block was used, instead of the previous Teksid aluminum unit, with stronger internals including forged Zolner pistons and Manley H-beam connecting rods that were modified with a wrist pin oiling hole by the SVT engineers. These upgrades were critical in order to support the [...] of boost delivered from the stock Eaton M-112 roots-type supercharger. Other improvements included the use of a lightweight aluminum flywheel connected to a Tremec T-56 six-speed transmission, 3.55:1 rear axle ratio, and stronger 31-spline <b>halfshafts</b> with revised upper and lower control arms. These modifications enabled the Cobra to go 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds and do the quarter mile in 12.67 seconds at 110.11 mph. Although electronically-governed to a top speed of 153 mph, a factory-stock Terminator Cobra can reach a top speed of just under 180 mph if the governor is removed.|$|R
