40|$|This paper {{examines}} the evolution {{and development of}} institutions involved {{in the establishment of}} <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves.</b> It focuses on the different actors, organisations and projects concerned with <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> in Rondonia in western Amazonia, Brazil. <b>Extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> are supported by a wide range of different actors and agencies, within a rapidly evolving institutional context. <b>Extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> are widely seen as a means of integrating forest conservation and local socio-economic development. As such, they have gained the support to the international environmental movement, multilateral and state development organisations, and grassroots community and producer organisations. These institutions represent a vast array of diverse interest which range from conservation of biodiversity, economic and social cohesion, and regional and national development. <b>Extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> are promoted as a means to achieve each of these objectives. However these ends are not necessarily complementary or compatible, and the integration of conservation and development is by no means easy to achieve. Whilst the various actors and institutions claim mutual and complementary interest, they form shifting alliances and coalitions in order to further their interests. This paper maps these institutions and interests and describes how alliances have been formed and broken, and how this has contributed to the currently observed implementation of <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves.</b> It analyses how the evolving institutions have been able to forward sustainable development in Amazonia and who benefits from alliances and coalitions. The paper argues that <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> are constrained by the dissonance or misfit in discourses and underlying worldviews, reflected by the aims and objectives of the institutions which promote, oppose and lose or benefit from their implementation. This misfit is overcome, in part, by alliances formed between the different institutions, and in part by the creation of new institutions and projects...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the understanding of partnerships for the conservation and sustainable use of tropical forests involving various stakeholders at different levels or scales. It focuses on <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> in Brazilian Amazonia and the partnerships and interactions that have evolved between local populations and NGOs (national and international), government agencies and international donors for their creation, implementation and management. <b>Extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> are protected areas designated for the sustainable use of natural resources by the resident population. They aim to achieve multiple goals including conserving biodiversity, satisfying the basic needs of the population and strengthening social organisation as a means to guarantee their participatory management. The paper concludes that partnerships have {{played an important role in}} the formal creation of <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> as a new management regime relying on collective action between individuals and organisations. However, it also argues that different actors become involved in <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> as a means to achieve different goals, which are not always complementary or even compatible. Partnerships are affected by a number of unconstructive dynamics and incentive structures, which emerge when there are significant power inequalities between the different actors, including inequalities related to access to financial resources...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{tendency}} in research on common property to neglect the influence that national and international developments might have in resource conservation. The environmental literature, on the other hand, suggests {{that the creation of}} <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> in Brazilian Amazonia in 1990 and thus the recognition of the rubber tappers' common property rights to their forests have been influenced by such developments. <b>Extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> have also been {{considered one of the most}} important initiatives of the Brazilian government to address the problem of deforestation in Amazonia. Attempts at examining their capacity to ensure resource conservation through the theory on common property have been, however, relatively scarce. This thesis thus examines <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> using the theory of common property as a theoretical framework and includes in the analysis a wider range of factors than those usually considered in the existing literature on common property regimes. The thesis reviews the evolution of national and international developments in relation to Amazonia during the 1980 s and, against this background, it examines the process that led to the establishment of <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves.</b> The thesis then proceeds to explore the property rights institutions of the Chico Mendes drawing on the evidence collected through semi-structured interviews with the reserve inhabitants. The research conducted identifies local, national and international factors which have influenced the capacity of the rubber tappers to ensure the sustainable use of their resources before and after the creation of <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves.</b> The evidence and analysis presented suggests that the capacity of the Chico Mendes Reserve to promote the sustainable use of the forest is limited. There are indications, however, that the reserve inhabitants could develop mechanisms to conserve their resources if external support continues but, at the same time, does not hinder their autonomy and interest in managing the forest. The thesis concludes by suggesting that developments in the national and international arenas can play a crucial role in relation to common property institutions...|$|R

40|$|Tropical forests contain {{much of the}} world’s biodiversity, {{yet their}} rate of decline is increasing. The {{strategy}} most frequently used to protect this biodiversity is to make parks and reserves. While {{there is a great}} deal of research on the effectiveness of parks for protecting biodiversity, there is little research on how well <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> conserve biodiversity. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of four forest reserves in western Uganda at maintaining popula-tions of primates and compare census data from the reserves to data from the neighbouring well-protected Kibale National Park. The relative abundance of the five most common primates in the park was approximately four times that of the forest reserves. In the forest reserves, evidence of new human encroachment was seen every 500 m, while in the park it was seen every 100, 000 m. Two recommendations emerge from our research: (i) for forest reserves, such as those studied here, to have conservation value for primates, extraction must be reduced and (ii) until the long-term viability of the populations in forest reserves can be ascertained, they should not be considered in estimates of the sizes of endangered species protected ranges.

40|$|<b>Extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> {{account for}} a {{significant}} proportion of the remaining intact forest within Brazilian Amazonia. Managers of <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> need to understand the livelihood strategies adopted by rural Amazonians in order to implement projects that benefit the livelihoods of local residents whilst maintaining forest integrity. Whilst resident populations are often descended from immigrant rubber-tappers, dynamic economic and social conditions have led to a recent diversification of land-use practices. This two-year study in two large contiguous <b>extractive</b> <b>reserves</b> encompassing both unflooded (terra firme) and seasonally flooded (várzea) forest, shows the degree to which local livelihood strategies of different settlements are heterogeneous. Extractive offtake of forest products and fish catches and agricultural activities, together with income from sales, for 82 households in 10 communities were quantified in detail by means of weekly surveys. The survey data were combined with interviews to examine the demographic and wealth profile, and engagement in alternative activities, in 181 households across 27 communities. All households and communities were engaged in all three subsistence activity types, but there was large variation in engagement with income-generating activities. Households within a community showed considerable congruence in their income-generating activity profiles, but there was significant variation between communities. Yields from agriculture and fishing were more temporally stable than extraction of highly-seasonal forest products. Generalized linear mixed models showed that forest type was consistently important in explaining yields of both agrarian and extractive products. Communities with greater access to terra firme forest were inherently more agricultural, and strongly committed to manioc production. Communities with greater access to flooded forest, however, showed a greater dependence on fishing. Conservation should be more attuned to the diversity and dynamism of livelihood strategies in protected areas; in particular, reserve managers and policy makers should account for the effect of local variation in physical geography when designing sustainable development projects...|$|R
