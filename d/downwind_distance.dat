As a result, turbulent vertical mixing is weaker in the lee of the barrier than it is upwind, and interesting secondary microclimatic effects result. For instance, by day sensible heat rising from the ground due to the absorption of sunlight (see surface energy budget) is mixed upward less efficiently in the lee of a windbreak, with the result that air temperature near ground is somewhat higher in the lee than on the windward side. Of course this effect is attenuated with increasing <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> and indeed, beyond about 8H downstream a zone may exist that is actually cooler than upwind.|$|E

40|$|The steady-state, {{three-dimensional}} {{transport equation}} for inert pollutant dispersion {{in the atmosphere}} is solved analytically to obtain expressions for pollutant concentrations from both a point source and a rectangular area source. The results of this analysis have application to numerical grid models in which the smallest resolvable source {{is the size of}} a single grid. The concentrations at ground level along the plume centerline from the two types of sources are in close agreement with each other at distances greater than 10 km downwind when the horizontal dimension of the rectangular source is not less than 100 m. The dimension of the source in the vertical direction is held constant at 50 m. Similar results are obtained for concentrations along the plume centerline at the effective stack height. When the size of the source in the crosswind direction is increased to 1 km, good agreement between the two concentrations is obtained for <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> over 60 km for the ground level case and over 140 km for the concentration at stack height level. For the horizontal dimension equal to 10 km, good agreement between the two cases is only obtained at extremely large <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> at both the stack height and ground levels...|$|R

50|$|Severe local fallout {{contamination}} {{can extend}} {{far beyond the}} blast and thermal effects, {{particularly in the case}} of high yield surface detonations. The ground track of fallout from an explosion depends on the weather from the time of detonation onwards. In stronger winds, fallout travels faster but takes the same time to descend, so although it covers a larger path, it is more spread out or diluted. Thus, the width of the fallout pattern for any given dose rate is reduced where the <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> is increased by higher winds. The total amount of activity deposited up to any given time is the same irrespective of the wind pattern, so overall casualty figures from fallout are generally independent of winds. But thunderstorms can bring down activity as rain more rapidly than dry fallout, particularly if the mushroom cloud is low enough to be below ("washout"), or mixed with ("rainout"), the thunderstorm.|$|E
50|$|In essence, {{when the}} wind {{encounters}} a porous obstacle such as a windbreak or shelterbelt, air pressure increases (loosely speaking, air piles up) on the windward side and (conversely) air pressure decreases on the leeward side. As a result, the airstream approaching the barrier is retarded, and a proportion of it is displaced {{up and over the}} barrier, resulting in a jet of higher wind speed aloft. The remainder of the impinging airstream, having been retarded in its approach, now circulates through the barrier to its downstream edge, pushed along by the decrease in pressure across the shelterbelt's width; emerging on the downwind side, that airstream is now further retarded by an adverse pressure gradient, because in the lee of the barrier, with increasing <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> air pressure recovers again to the ambient level. The result is that minimum wind speed occurs not at or within the windbreak, nor at its downwind edge, but further downwind - nominally, at a distance of about 3 to 5 times the windbreak height H. Beyond that point wind speed recovers, aided by downward momentum transport from the overlying, faster-moving stream. From the perspective of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations these effects can be understood as resulting from the loss of momentum caused by the drag of leaves and branches and would be represented by the body force fi (a distributed momentum sink).|$|E
40|$|An {{engineering}} approach to analyze PM dry deposition due to gravitational settling is summarized in this paper. Particle horizontal settling distance is determined based upon wind speed and particle terminal settling velocity. New PSD in the downwind plume is calculated based upon particle horizontal settling distance and source PSD. Results {{of this research}} indicate that change of PSD in the downwind plume {{is a function of}} wind speed, <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> and source PSD. Both MMD and GSD in the downwind plume decrease with increase of <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> and source MMD. When the MMD of the source is high, there was a big change in the MMD and GSD of the dust in the downwind plume. Likewise, there was a big change in the MMD and GSD of dust in the downwind plume as <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> is increased. However, the change of wind speed has an inverse impact on the change of downwind PSD. MMD and GSD in the downwind plume decrease with decrease of wind speed. Gravitational settling causes significant change of MMD and GSD in the downwind plume and thus, has significant impact on the PM 10 sampling error problems. Future research is needed to quantify this impact for more accurate PM 10 measuremen...|$|E
40|$|A model, {{called the}} Community Assessment Model for Odor Dispersion (CAM), was {{developed}} to predict receptor odor exposure from multiple swine production sources. The intended use of CAM {{was to provide a}} tool for evaluating the odor exposure to receptors in a community when siting new swine production systems and how a change in odor control technologies alters the odor exposure to receptors. CAM can handle up to 20 swine production sources with up to 100 receptors in a community of any size. The model incorporates historical average local weather data, coordinate locations of all sources and receptors, ground and above-ground area sources, seasonal variations in odor emission, source production footprint and orientation, and documented proven odor mitigation technologies. CAM does not predict the influence of calm conditions(wind speeds = 1. 03 m/s), topography, or obstruction downwash. CAM predicts the number of hours of exposure to weak (2 : 1) and greater or identifiable (7 : 1) and greater odors and these are used to assess a siting decision. CAM was compared against field collected odor concentration data and was found, using a technique of quantile-quantile plots, to over-predict observed odor concentrations by 1. 49 for <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> between 152 and 1524 m in one comparison study. In a second comparative study, CAM over-predicted observed odor concentrations by 1. 91, 1. 31, and 1. 35 for <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> of greater than 150, 275, and 300 m, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract approved: Four buoyant plumes were {{produced}} within a laboratory convec-tively mixed layer {{from a source}} height of about z = 0. 15 h, where h is {{the height of the}} convectively mixed layer. The projected images of these plumes in the X-Z plane were analyzed using a densitometer (photomultiplier tube) to calculate dimension-less crosswind integrated concentration values. These values were examined at regular intervals of non-dimensionalized heights and <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> to calculate center-of-mass heights, approximate plume limits, and touchdown distances. The plume buoyancy values were expressed in dimensionless terms as the parameter F. The touchdown distances are greatest and the surface inte-grated crosswind concentrations are smallest for the three most buoyant plumes. The highest center-of-mass and plume limit positions are also associated with the most buoyant plumes. The surface crosswind integrated concentration values for even the Redacted for Privacy least buoyant plumes are much smaller than for non-buoyant plumes from previous studies. Touchdown distances for buoyant plumes from this data set agree with data from Willis and Deardorff (1983); however, the centerline and lower plume limits are at greater heights for this study. Vertical profiles of crosswind integrated concentration values indicate that the least buoyant plume has a bimodal distribution near the stack then becomes uniform at greater distances. The vertical profiles for the three nst buoyant plumes show the high-est concentration values are present in {{the upper part of the}} mixed layer at ncst <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> examined in this study. This distribution of effluent is also indicated by the vertical center-of-mass heights being larger than the plume centerline calculated from the average of the lower and upper plume limits...|$|R

Because much of the growth in CO 2 emissions will originate from cities, {{there is a need}} to develop, assess, and improve measurement and modeling strategies for quantifying and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions from large urban centers. In this study the uncertainties in an aircraft-based mass balance approach for quantifying carbon dioxide and methane emissions from an urban environment, focusing on Indianapolis, IN, USA, are described. The relatively level terrain of Indianapolis facilitated the application of mean wind fields in the mass balance approach. We investigate the uncertainties in our aircraft-based mass balance approach by (1) assessing the sensitivity of the measured flux to important measurement and analysis parameters including wind speed, background CO 2 and CH 4, boundary layer depth, and interpolation technique, and (2) determining the flux at two or more <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> from a point or area source (with relatively large source strengths such as solid waste facilities and a power generating station) in rapid succession, assuming that the emission flux is constant. When we quantify the precision in the approach by comparing the estimated emissions derived from measurements at two or more <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> from an area or point source, we find that the minimum and maximum repeatability were 12 and 52 %, with an average of 31 %. We suggest that improvements in the experimental design can be achieved by careful determination of the background concentration, monitoring the evolution of the boundary layer through the measurement period, and increasing the number of downwind horizontal transect measurements at multiple altitudes within the boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|Field {{observations}} of scaled wind speed and sand transport {{recovery in the}} lee of a nebka within a field of nebkhas and then subsequently for the nebkha denuded of its vegetation cover were collected. The measurements of wind speed at 0. 4 times the element height indicate that for both conditions wind speed recovery in the lee is exponential. The porous vegetation cover influences the rate of this recovery being more gradual for the vegetated form. The return to equilibrium wind speed occurs in both cases at approximately eight element heights. For either case the recovery of shear stress and the return to a constant value occurs much closer to the bluff body form than has been described for porous fences. The recovery of sand transport in the lee appears to be more rapid for the un-vegetated condition, which corresponds to the observed faster rate of wind speed increase. The observations did not show a continual increase in saltation flux with increasing <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> due to the increasing shear stress downwind and the increase that may be expected due to the fetch effect. The change in saltation flux with <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> was controlled by the sediment supply, which diminished with <b>downwind</b> <b>distance.</b> The interaction of a changing shear stress and the zone of influence created by the wind as it interacts with the roughness dimensions, along with the distribution of sediment available for transport bring increased complexity to modeling sand flux for this type of environment over different temporal scales...|$|E

Diffusion characteristics were studied and included both the vertical and lateral mean concentrations and concentration fluctuation intensity at various downwind distances.

Many researchers have developed local-scale atmospheric dispersion models using building-resolving computational fluid dynamics.

In this study, we carried out Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) of plume dispersion within various urban areas {{with a wide range}} of obstacle density and building height variability. The difference of centerline mean and r. m. s. concentration distributions among various complex urban surface geometries becomes small for <b>downwind</b> <b>distances</b> from the point source greater than 1. 0 km.

40|$|In this study, large-eddy {{simulations}} {{are performed}} {{to investigate the}} flow inside and around large finite-size wind farms in conventionally-neutral atmospheric boundary layers. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} characterizing the different farm-induced flow regions, including the induction, entrance and development, fully-developed, exit and farm wake regions. The wind farms extend 20 km in the streamwise direction and comprise 36 wind turbine rows arranged in aligned and staggered configurations. Results show that, under weak free-atmosphere stratification (Γ = 1 K/km), the flow inside and above both wind farms, and thus the turbine power, do not reach the fully-developed regime even though the farm length is two orders of magnitude larger than the boundary layer height. In that case, the wind farm induction region, affected by flow blockage, extends upwind about 0. 8 km and leads to a power reduction of 1. 3 % and 3 % at the first row of turbines for the aligned and staggered layouts, respectively. The wind farm wake leads to velocity deficits at hub height of around 3. 5 % at a <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> of 10 km for both farm layouts. Under stronger stratification (Γ = 5 K/km), the vertical deflection of the subcritical flow induced by the wind farm at its entrance and exit regions triggers standing gravity waves whose effects propagate upwind. They, in turn, induce a large decelerating induction region upwind of the farm leading edge, and an accelerating exit region upwind of the trailing edge, both extending about 7 km. As a result, the turbine power output in the entrance region decreases more than 35 % with respect to the weakly stratified case. It increases downwind as the flow adjusts, reaching the fully-developed regime only for the staggered layout at a distance of about 8. 5 km from the farm edge. The flow acceleration in the exit region leads to an increase of the turbine power with <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> in that region, and a relatively fast (compared with the weakly stratified case) recovery of the farm wake, which attains its inflow hub height speed at a <b>downwind</b> <b>distance</b> of 5 km...|$|E
