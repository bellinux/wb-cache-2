In this paper, we test {{the effects of}} varying ground resolution on the calculated carbon balance of a boreal peatland consisting of hummocks (<b>dry),</b> <b>lawns</b> (intermediate) and flarks (wet surfaces). The generalizations in lower resolution imagery led to biased area estimates for individual micro-site types. While areas of lawns and hummocks were stable below a threshold resolution of ~ 60 cm, the maximum of the flark area was located at resolutions below 25 cm and was then decreasing with coarsening resolution. Using a resolution of 100 cm instead of 6 cm led to an overestimation of total CO 2 uptake of the studied peatland area (approximately 14 600 m 2) of ~ 6 % and an underestimation of total CH 4 emission of ~ 11 %. To accurately determine the surface area of scattered and small-sized micro-site types in heterogeneous ecosystems (e. g. flarks in peatlands), a minimum ground resolution appears necessary.

40|$|Plant-mediated methane (CH 4) {{transport}} and {{the contribution of}} recent photosynthates to methanogenesis were studied on two dominating vascular plant species – Eriophorum vaginatum and Scheuchzeria palustris – at three types of microrelief forms (hummocks – E. hummocks, lawns – E. lawns and hollows – S. hollows) of a boreal natural minerogenic, oligotrophic fen in Eastern Finland. 14 C-pulse labeling of mesocosms with shoots isolated from entire belowground peat under controlled conditions allowed estimation of plant-mediated CH 4 flux and contribution of recent (14 C) photosynthates to total CH 4. The results showed (i) CH 4 flux increased in the order E. hummocks ≤ E. lawns S. hollows corresponding to the increasing water table level at the relief microforms as adjusted to field conditions. (ii) Plant-mediated CH 4 flux accounted for 38, 31 and 51 % of total CH 4 at E. hummocks, E. lawns and S. hollows, respectively. (iii) Contribution of recent photosynthates to methanogenesis accounted for 0. 03 % for E. hummocks, 0. 06 % for E. lawns and 0. 13 % for S. hollows of assimilated 14 C. Thus, microsites with S. palustris were characterized by higher rates of transported CH 4 from the peat column to the atmosphere when compared to E. vaginatum of <b>drier</b> <b>lawns</b> and hummocks. Contribution of recent photosynthates to methanogenesis was dependent on the plant biomass within-species level (E. vaginatum at hummocks and lawns) but was not observed between species: smaller S. palustris had higher flux of 14 CH 4 as compared to larger E. vaginatum.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the midday (10 : 00 - 16 : 00) growing season (April - October) surface cover CO 2 relationships with different canopy closures and microtopography (lawn and depression) in a forested upland - peatland - pond complex in the Western Boreal Plain, north - central Alberta, Canada. A dynamic - closed chamber technique was used to: evaluate the relative contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration and photosynthesis and assess the relative roles of substrate, plant communities, hydrology, and microclimates on CO 2 exchange. Large differences were observed among the forest floors of landscape units with different canopy covers with respect to midday total respiration (Rtot= vegetation respiration (Rveg) + soil respiration (Rsoil)) and gross ecosystem production (GEP), and the seasonal pattern of GEP and Rtot. Highest rates of Rtot followed the general progression of riparian 3 ̆e upland 3 ̆e open peatland 3 ̆e covered peatland, with high Rsoil contributions. Strong correlations were observed between C:N, soil temperature, moisture and Rtot. Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) controlled GEP, which was highest in the open and covered peatland. GEP and Rtot were highest {{in the middle of}} the growing season when soil and air temperatures were warmest, in addition Rveg contributed more to Rtot during this time, however Rsoil dominated the flux. Small differences were observed between lawn and depression sites in terms of net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE). The general trend was for warmer, <b>drier</b> <b>lawn</b> sites to have higher GEP and Rtot than the topographically lower, cooler and wetter depressions. The moisture and temperature differences between microtopography drove differences in the productivity of species but did not drive differences in vegetation distribution. This study demonstrated that degrees of spatial and seasonal temporal variability as well as controlling environmental factors on CO 2 exchange cannot necessarily be extrapolated to a sub - humid region, such as Canada’s Western Boreal Plain. In addition, forest floors of different land cover units, and microtopography should be taken into account when discussing understory contributions to CO 2 exchange...|$|R

40|$|The ‘Conseil Général du Département du Nord’ is {{the manager}} of 480 ha of Flemish dunes located at the far North of France. These spaces, {{initially}} preserved {{by the action of}} the ‘Communauté Urbaine de Dunkerque’ are now the property of the ‘Conservatoire de l’Espace Littoral et des Rivages Lacustres’. Characterised by an aelian dynamism and by the winter flooding of their damp depressions, these systems had represented a very high patrimonial richness before man, by these actions (the pumping of the aquifers, the parcelling out of dune massifs, the fixation of sand by plantations, the destruction of rabbits), reduced to nothing the natural expression of perturbations (storms, floods, important sandbanks) and made dune massifs become wastelands and low marshes and <b>dry</b> <b>lawns</b> disappear. The first step for preservation was the in extremis safeguard and the maintenance by secateurs (1989) then by motor scythes (1992) of micro-habitats with a high richness over a 2 ha total surface lost in very important pre-forested systems. Rapidly, the objectives of preservation obliged us to put into practice the restoration of natural environments by stripping and clearing the ground (1994 and 1997). But these operations of a large scale (10 ha) were always based on a ‘fixist’ and ‘museographical’ approach to the environment (the maintenance of a representative sample of habitats). The management which consists of stopping certain pioneer and post-pioneer stages of vegetation can in fact correspond to a counter-natural step as these dune systems make the proof of a very high dynamism and permanent evolution. Today the management of dune space is done by bulldozers: first the pre-forested vegetation is totally destructed (16 ha in 2004) leaving systems of bare sand freely evolving and accepting their spontaneous wastelanding over more than 50 % of their surfaces. The return to uncontrolled vegetal dynamism is only accepted if perturbations are periodically created in order to regularly produce the starting or reappearance conditions of the different series of vegetation. The last stage of our managing operations would consist, with a middle-term effect, in reducing the stability of the edging dune row and in favouring the development of wind passages with their devastation or saving effects on the dune we intend to preserve...|$|R
