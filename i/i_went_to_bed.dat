25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for two years to study art. Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting {{changed the course of}} her life, Fonda saying, [...] "I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It {{was the first time that}} anyone, except my father – who had to say so – told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!" ...|$|E

500|$|All That Glitters was series creator Norman Lear's {{attempt to}} {{duplicate}} his {{success with the}} syndicated soap opera spoof Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Lear described the premise simply: [...] "God created Eve first, took out her rib {{and gave her a}} companion so she wouldn't be lonely." [...] Lear {{came up with the idea}} on a trip to Washington, D.C.: [...] "I had visited the Institute of Policy Studies, and I just loved the whole thing. And I thought there was a series in it—a five-times-a-week series: <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> thinking about that, and I woke up the next morning thinking what would happen if the male-female equation were changed? What would happen if the women had all the power and all the advantage, and the men had what the women normally would have?” ...|$|E
500|$|MercyMe's {{lead singer}} Bart Millard wrote [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] while touring {{in support of}} their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine". The travel was exhausting, and Millard commented in an {{interview}} that, {{on one of the}} nights on tour, he [...] "went to bed just really frustrated... It started feeling like everything I was saying was the same. I just thought, I have nothing else to say. So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> with that on my mind". After falling asleep, Millard woke up {{early in the morning and}} wrote several lines to the song in his journal before going back to sleep. Several weeks later, he was searching through his journal and found the notes again; when he went to the band's studio, he showed the notes to his producer, Pete Kipley. The two finished the lyrics to the song in less than thirty minutes, and recorded the piano track the same night; they also brought in someone to compose a string track for the song. Millard wanted [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] to contain only piano, avoiding the big production that could assure the song success on the radio, as he felt the simple production would mirror the lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|Okereke is {{extremely}} shy. He has expressed disdain for interviews, asking one interviewer from Skyscraper magazine, [...] "Why {{is it important}} to know what I had for breakfast? Or who <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> with? Or what sneakers I am wearing? If it's relevant to understanding my music, then so be it. But if it's purely to satisfy the media's obsession with celebrity, then no thanks. I don't want to play that game." [...] The focus of one interview with NME in July 2005 was largely {{to do with his}} dislike of being interviewed. In it he implied that the media placed deliberate emphasis on conflicts between bands {{and did not want to}} be drawn into such publicity, saying that [...] "public feuding between bands is completely pointless." [...] Okereke has also said, [...] "people think that I hate being approached but that's not true" [...] in NME on 15 September 2005. In 2005 Okereke appeared on the front cover of Australian queer zine They Shoot Homos Don't They? ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, rapper M.I.A. posted several {{videos on}} her Instagram account during which a remix of [...] "Flawless" [...] was played. Two months later, on May 13, she {{released}} an officially commissioned remix {{of the song}} titled [...] "Baddygirl 2". M.I.A.'s version was produced by Party Squad, contained modified lyrics and samples of Beyoncé's [...] "Diva" [...] and [...] "Run the World (Girls)". It explored elements of trap and EDM music. Some of the reworked lines contained feminist messages and elements of the original song were completely altered. John Walker, writing for MTV News remarked that except the opening lines [...] "I woke up like this/ <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> like this/ We do everything just like this", the remix doesn't contain [...] "any easily recognizable bits" [...] of the original. Similarly, a writer of Fact magazine noted that Beyoncé {{did not want to}} release the remix as it only contained the same feminist elements of the original. Zach Frydenlund of Complex felt that the reworked version contained M.I.A.'s [...] "intense energy" [...] while Sharan Shetty found a [...] "manic", high-energy sound similar to the rapper's diverse influences. However the latter concluded that the remix [...] "doesn't quite measure up to the original, but... regardless, it's an interesting and head-bopping take". The Guardian editor Alexandra Khan-Anselmo felt that the remix is [...] "good enough to make you want to smash the window of a cop car, pull a Wynona or sneak on to the underground".|$|E
2500|$|Days after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of Time {{magazine}} published Plame's name, citing unnamed {{government officials}} as sources. In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the White House has [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night I hugged my son good-bye and told him it might {{be a long time before}} I see him again. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time. Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E

2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
