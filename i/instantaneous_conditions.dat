Childhood related diseases such as measles are characterised by short periodic outbreaks lasting about 2 weeks. This means therefore that the timescale at which such diseases operate is much shorter than the time scale of the human population dynamics. We analyse a compartmental model of the SIR type with periodic coefficients and different time scales for 1) disease dynamics and 2) human population dynamics.

In a model with time scales, Singular Perturbation theory is used to determine stability condi-tion for the disease free state. The stability condition is here referred to as <b>instantaneous</b> stability <b>condition,</b> and implies vaccination is done only when an <b>instantaneous</b> threshold <b>condition</b> is met.

40|$|Diode {{junction}} photovoltaic (PV) generators exhibit nonlinear V-I {{characteristics and}} the maximum power extractable {{varies with the}} intensity of solar radiation, temperature and load conditions. A {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) controller is therefore usually employed in PV-generator applications to automatically extract maximum power irrespective of the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>conditions</b> of the PV system.

The PV-generator system comprises a solar panel, DC-DC buck chopper, fuzzy MPP tracker and permanent DC-motor driving a centrifugal pump. The fuzzy controller generates a control signal for the pulse-width-modulation generator which in turn adjusts the duty ratio of the buck chopper to match the load impedance to the PV generator, and consequently maximizes the motor speed and the water discharge rate of a coupled centrifugal pump.
