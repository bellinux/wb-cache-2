5000|$|The Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis assay (SCGE, {{also known}} as comet assay) is an {{uncomplicated}} and sensitive technique {{for the detection of}} DNA damage {{at the level of the}} individual eukaryotic cell. It was first developed by Östling & Johansson in 1984 and later modified by Singh et al. in 1988. It has since increased in popularity as a standard technique for evaluation of DNA damage/repair, biomonitoring and genotoxicity testing. It involves the encapsulation of cells in a low-melting-point agarose suspension, lysis of the cells in neutral or alkaline (pH>13) conditions, and electrophoresis of the suspended lysed cells.

40|$|In view of {{understanding}} the mechanisms of retinal neovascularization, we had reported previously that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced pathological retinal angiogenesis requires the activation of Src-PLD 1 -PKCγ signaling. In the present work, we have identified cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2) as an effector molecule of Src-PLD 1 -PKCγ signaling in the mediation of VEGF-induced pathological retinal angiogenesis based on the following observations. VEGF induced cPLA 2 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs). VEGF also induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in a dose-, time-, and cPLA 2 -dependent manner. Depletion of cPLA 2 levels inhibited VEGF-induced HRMVEC <b>DNA</b> synthesis, <b>migration,</b> and tube formation. In addition, the exogenous addition of AA rescued VEGF-induced HRMVEC <b>DNA</b> synthesis, <b>migration,</b> and tube formation from inhibition by down-regulation of cPLA 2. Inhibition of Src, PLD 1, or PKCγ attenuated VEGF-induced cPLA 2 phosphorylation and AA release. Consistent with these findings, hypoxia induced cPLA 2 phosphorylation and activity in VEGF-Src-PLD 1 -PKCγ-dependent manner in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. In addition, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of cPLA 2 levels in the retina abrogated hypoxia-induced retinal endothelial cell proliferation and neovascularization.

In both control and irradiated nuclei, caffeine also increased the initial level of <b>DNA</b> <b>migration</b> in the comet assay. but to a lesser extent. These results indicate that caffeine increases the DNA damage that accumulates during the processing of alkylated bases and, to a lesser extent, of the DNA bases damaged by gamma-irradiation.

40|$|Malignant tumors of {{the three}} major pairs and the {{numerous}} minor salivary glands in humans are rare, and little is known about their various etiologies. Considering the fact that resin monomers from dental restorative materials are released into the saliva and diffuse into the tooth pulp or gingiva, mucosa, and salivary glands, this may potentially contribute to tumorigenesis. Resin monomers may also be reabsorbed and reach the circulating blood as well. Whereas the cytotoxic potential of some components has been clearly documented, data on genotoxicity in human target cells require further investigation. In the present study, genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of three common methacrylates are investigated in human samples of salivary glands and peripheral lymphocytes. The Comet assay was used to quantify DNA single strand breaks, alkali labile and incomplete excision repair sites in salivary gland probes and lymphocytes of 10 volunteers. The xenobiotics investigated were triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate (TEGDMA), urethanedimethacrylate (UDMA), and 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as controls. <b>DNA</b> <b>migration</b> was analyzed using the tail moment according to Olive (OTM). Cytotoxicity was monitored using trypan blue staining. With TEGDMA concentrations at 10 (- 5) m (10 (- 3) m), UDMA at 10 (- 7) m (10 (- 7) m), and HEMA at 10 (- 3) m (10 (- 5) m) significant enhancements of <b>DNA</b> <b>migration</b> were achieved in tissue cells (lymphocytes) as compared to the negative controls.

40|$|An {{important}} step in genetic recombination is <b>DNA</b> branch <b>migration,</b> {{the movement of the}} Holliday junction or exchange point between two homologous duplex DNAs. We have determined kinetic parameters of spontaneous branch migration as a function of temperature and ionic conditions. The branch migration substrates consist of two homologous duplex DNAs each having two single-strand tails at one end that are complementary to the corresponding single-strand tails of the other duplex. Upon rapid annealing of the two duplex DNAs, a four-stranded intermediate is formed that has a Holliday junction {{at one end of the}} duplexes. Branch migration to the opposite end of the duplexes results in complete strand exchange and formation of two duplex products. The rate of branch migration is exceedingly sensitive to the type of metal ions present. In magnesium, branch migration is quite slow with a step time, tau, equal to 300 msec at 37 degrees C. Surprisingly, branch migration in the absence of magnesium was 1000 times faster. Despite this difference in rates, apparent activation energies for the branch migration step in the presence and absence of magnesium are similar. Since metal ions have a profound effect on the structure of the Holliday junction, it appears that the structure of the branch point plays a key role in determining the rate of spontaneous <b>DNA</b> branch <b>migration.</b> We discuss the role of proteins in promoting the branch migration step during homologous recombination...|$|R
