40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{application}} of contemporary methods of <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> and the enlargement law in designing a GM counting tube. It {{has been shown}} that by applying <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> methods the counting tube can be optimally dimensioned. The application of the enlargement law was demonstrated in generalizing the results of test obtained by the GM tube to those obtained by the counting tube with m-times greater dimensions. The investigations were conducted both theoretically and by experiment. Using theoretical analysis, we derived the expressions that may be applied if a performance function of a random variable breakdown voltage is known. The experiments were conducted on a GM counter model under well controlled laboratory conditions...|$|E

40|$|In {{medium and}} high voltage power system networks, {{electromagnetic}} transients are inevitable when switching inductive loads such as free-running transformers, induction motors or power compensation coils. The potential occurrence of switching oscillatory overvoltages defines the <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> of cable-networks.

40|$|The impulse {{breakdown}} voltage-time to flashover (V-t) {{characteristics of}} a point-plane gap in SF 6 has been investigated using impulse wave fronts {{in the range of}} 1. 2 μs to 250 μs. Also, field nonuniformity was systematically varied to study the effect of corona preceding breakdown on time delays. The V-t characteristics are categorized into three types depending on the field nonuniformity and gas pressure. The properties of the characteristics in these types are generalised and will be useful in the <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> studies for abnormal voltage protection of $SF_ 6 $ gas insulated power equipment and systems (GIS). It has been deduced that the lightning impulse (LI) voltage appears to be the most effective on-site test voltage to detect any defects like fixed particles or protrusions in the GI...|$|E
40|$|Protection of {{transformers}} {{and other}} system equipment against transient overvoltages resulting from lightning or other causes {{is an important}} consideration in power system design. For <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> in transmission lines and substation equipment, {{it is necessary to}} accurately predict the lightning surge overvoltages that occur in power systems. The magnitude and waveshape of this overvoltage arriving at the terminating transformer is greatly affected by the use of a length of a cable connecting the transmission line to the terminating transformer. This paper is investigating the effect of this length of cable under lightning surge as it reaches the step-down transformer. The computer simulation-through EMTP-of a 345 kV line is presented and the results are analyzed aiming to obtain the reduced overvoltage at the terminating equipment and to find the optimum length and size of the cable used as a terminato...|$|E
40|$|Behaviour of {{energisation}} transients of {{high voltage}} (HV) underground cable {{system can be}} established through carefully crafted simulation studies. This information is useful for design engineers to ensure that protection and <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> are able to meet design criteria. This paper presents {{an assessment of the}} validity and applicability of existing cable models in PSCAD/EMTDC to study energisation transients of HV cable systems. The models considered are the distributed parameter travelling wave models (FD-Phase and FD-Mode models). Their performance is analysed through comparison of simulated results with measured current transient behaviour during the energisation of a 132 kV, 5. 6 km underground cable system. The results obtained from FD-Phase model demonstrate acceptable agreement with experimental data, whereas the simulation results of FD-Mode model predicted slightly lower transient peak magnitudes. Both models give reasonable settling time of the corresponding transient envelope...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> and {{the risk}} of failure for {{insulation}} can be predicted if critical flashover (CFO) and insulation withstand voltages are known. The paper aims at using the statistical method of evaluating the critical flashover and the withstand voltage for an airgap distance of 10 cm. The work was carried out with a point-plane electrode (needle point) arrangement using air as the dielectric medium for the given gap. Ten shots were allowed in each test and the breakdown probability was found. From the experimental values the critical flashover or the V 50 %, and the percentage breakdown probabilities were found. The withstand V N at 10 percent was estimated from the cumulative distribution function. From the knowledge of the withstand voltage and the statistical over voltage at 90 percent probability, it was possible to estimate the risk of failures if desired for the given insulation.

40|$|Disconnector switch {{operation}} in GIS generates VFT voltages in the system. It is important, for <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> purposes, to obtain accurate VFT V-t data for typical gap geometries found in GIS. This paper presents experimentally obtained VFT V-t data for a 180 / 1 lOmm co-axial gap. The VFT has {{a time to}} first peak of 35 ns and a oscillation frequency of 13, 6 MHz. Due {{to the location of}} the voltage divider in a compartment adjacent to the gap, a correction factor of 1. 1 is used to relate the measured breakdown voltage to that in the gap. Positive polarity VFT V-t data is presented for 1, 2, 3 and 4 bar absolute and negative polarity VFT data for 3 and 4 bar absolute. Two methods of generating the VFT's are used. The first is to power up the test transformer at power frequency. The second is to generate a switching impulse by discharging a capacitor into the primary of the test transformer...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of large}} air-insulated structures subjected to complex multiple-peak surge overvoltages {{is influenced by}} the presence of already established leader overvoltages in influenced by the presence of already established leader development in the space. The decay processes of a positive leader channel following current interruption appear not to have been studied in detail, and Part 2 provides electrical and optical measurements of leader decay and reactivation in a 6 m rod-plane gap. It is found that, for a positive leader created by a switching impulse (SI) of critical time to crest, the leader path could be rapidly reactivated over at least part of its length by a second voltage application at times of up to about 1 ms after its original formation. For longer times, new leader growth may still retrace the original basic leader path. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the reactivated leader are substantially {{different from those of the}} basic leader. The causes of the large statistical variation in behaviour are discussed. The results presented should provide the basis for improved physical knowledge of the leader and corona processes, and contribute to improved engineering models for <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination...</b>|$|E
40|$|South Africa has an {{electrical}} transmission grid of over 25 000 km of {{overhead power lines}} with voltages of 132 kV to 765 kV. The grid has been largely designed and built by the power utility, Eskom. This book embodies the planning philosophies, design principles and construction practices of Eskom. It {{is the culmination of}} decades of thought, study, research and the practical experience of many overhead power line engineers and researchers. The book covers the main aspects of overhead power line design and construction, from electrical first principles, system planning, <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> (including live line working), mechanical design through to environmental impact management and power line communications. The content emphasises the need for close interaction between all technical disciplines involved and the importance of optimising designs for economy and performance. Additional challenges in South Africa are the relatively high altitude of the interior plateau (1 000 m to 1 700 m above sea level), severe lightning in some areas and long transmission distances. The book explains how these factors are accommodated in modern designs. Other advanced work covered includes the use and understanding of polymeric insulators, the judicious reduction of phase-to-phase spacings and the adoption of guyed structures...|$|E
40|$|Zinc-oxide (ZnO) surge arresters are {{now well}} {{established}} as a very efficient and reliable form of overvoltage protection against both fast surges, such as those generated by lightning and gas-insulated switchgear, and high-energy surges generated by switching operations and temporary faults on the network. The addition of ZnO surge arresters to existing protection schemes reinforces the system's reliability and the security of supply. The protection characteristics of the parallel configuration formed by arresters and existing spark gaps at distribution voltages are studied. Tests on various spark-gap geometries, with and without surge arresters in parallel, {{have been carried out}} to determine breakdown characteristics, probability curves and voltage–time characteristics for different impulse shapes. It is found that the introduction of the arrester in the circuit modifies the prospective impulse which results in the shift of the breakdown characteristics towards higher voltages. A proposed circuit model, based on laboratory test data, is used to simulate such parallel configurations. Good agreement between test and simulated results is obtained. As a result of these tests, it is recommended that gap-sparkover characteristics based on short-tail (about 5 µs) impulses are used for <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> The role of parallel airgaps in preserving the arrester energy-rating limits is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{relates to}} a study of {{abnormal}} conditions on a threephase distribution feeder of industry like State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) with several loads and a capacitor bank. An induction generator, which {{plays the role of}} a dispersed storage and generation unit, driven by a hydraulic turbine, which is a common form of renewable energy scheme, is connected to the distribution feeder through a Δ/Y transformer. Transients caused switching of the induction generator, by single line-to-ground fault, double line-to-ground fault through contact resistances, broken conductor touching the ground through a small resistance, isolating the induction generator to form its own supply domain (islanding) etc are investigated and interesting conclusions of practical importance are derived. The IBM PC version 4 of the Electro-Magnetic-Transient Program - Alternative Transient Program (ATP), was used to solve this problem. The program also gives output results for automatic plotting in time domain. Accordingly, transient voltages at several nodes and transient currents at interesting points were plotted from the output results. Planning and operational aspects like voltage control, reliability, harmonics, earthing, and contractual matters between the private generator and the utility are also considered. Technical aspects interconnections between the private generation and the utility has been considered. Interesting conclusions, valuable for <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination,</b> interrupting duty on circuit breakers, effect on response of protective relays and automatic control systems are pointed out. It also considers security to personnel and protection of metering equipment. The thesis also offers guide for contractual matters between the utility and the private generation...|$|E
40|$|The {{economical}} <b>insulation</b> <b>co-ordination</b> in {{transmission lines}} and substations requires to accurately predict the lightning surge overvoltages that may occur. Therefore, to perform this insulation and protection design {{it is necessary}} to model the power system components adequately {{in order to determine the}} magnitude and shape of these overvoltages. There are three system elements which characterisation are extremelly important for an accurate computation of the lightning overvoltages: the transmission line, the tower and the tower footing. The transmission line is represented by a distributed, frequency dependent and non-linear parameters model. This model is based on a finite differences algorithm, developed as a general-purpose transmission line model, thus allowing to represent also the tower, as a non-uniform transmission line, and the distributed nature of long ground electrodes (counterpoises). The most common used tower footing configurations are the vertical rods and the counterpoises. Vertical rods are represented by lumped resistances, while the counterpoises are represented by the finite-differences transmission line model. The non-linear behaviour of towe footing, that occurs when high magnitude lightning currents flow through the earth electrodes to the earth, is also included in the proposed models. In this dissertation a practical application of the general-purpose transmission line model is presented. This application consists on the evaluation of impinging overvoltages at a station consequent to lightning striking an incoming transmission lineAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
