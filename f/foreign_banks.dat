5|$|After the bloodless coup d'état of 1969 {{that saw}} Mohamed Siad Barre's {{ascension}} to power, {{the government in}} 1971 nationalized the four <b>foreign</b> <b>banks.</b> The government combined Banco di Roma, Banco di Napoli, and National and Grindlays Bank to form the Somali Commercial Bank. The government also established the Somali Savings and Credit Bank {{to take over the}} commercial branches of Banca Nazionale Somala and Banque de Port Said, leaving the Banca Nazionale Somala with only central banking functions. The Somali Savings and Credit Bank had branches in Baidoa, Beledweyne, Berbera, Bosaso, Burco, Galkacyo, Qardho, Hargeisa and Kismayo, and for a while in Djibouti. The Somali Savings and Credit Bank had been established with the technical assistance and aid provided by the Associazione Bancaria Italiana {{in the context of an}} overall cooperation policy of the European savings banks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E

On 9 May 1964, was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied. He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 spectators. Lodge defended his actions, claiming the United States did all it could to prevent the execution. The ambassador claimed Cẩn would have been allowed to seek refuge at the U.S. embassy, despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept Cẩn at the airport. Rev. Cao Văn Luân, Catholic rector of Huế University who had been fired for falling afoul of the powerful Archbishop Thục, asked Lodge that Cẩn not be executed. According to Luân, Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place.

5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of liquidity, and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming").

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry on {{domestic}} firms' access to bank credit using a within-country staggered geographic variation in the policy of <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> lending in China.

40|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>bank</b> {{participation}} {{has increased}} steadily across developing countries since the mid- 1990 s. This paper documents this trend and surveys {{the existing literature}} to explore the drivers and consequences of this phenomenon, paying {{particular attention to the}} differences observed across regions both in the degree of <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> participation and in the impact of this process. Local profit opportunities, the absence of barriers to entry, and the presence of mechanisms to mitigate information problems have been the main factors driving <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry across developing countries. In general, <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> participation has been shown to exert a positive influence on banking sector efficiency and competition. The weight of the evidence suggests that <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> presence does not endanger, but rather enhances banking sector stability. And although some case studies suggest that <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry limits access to finance, many cross-country studies offer evidence to the contrary.

Using the modified dealership model of Maudos and Fernandez de Guevara (2004) as a baseline specification, we show that augmenting the model by proxies for direct and indirect impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> participation does not produce a significant outcome.

This suggests that <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry may have a different impact on domestic banking markets in developed and developing countries.
