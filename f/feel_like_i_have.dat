You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Maurice Kelly [...] (born 13 January 1955) is an Australian {{rock music}} singer-songwriter, guitarist, and {{harmonica}} player. He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He {{has worked with}} other artists and groups, including associated projects Professor Ratbaggy and Stardust Five. Kelly's music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture {{the vastness of the}} culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly [...] "one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise." [...] Kelly has said, [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got it nailed yet".|$|E

500|$|Fellow {{songwriter}} Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, [...] "There {{is something}} unique and powerful {{about the way}} Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle – not a trace of pretence or fakery in there". Ross Clelland, writing for Rolling Stone, described Kelly: [...] "hile he was (rightly) lauded {{for his ability to}} sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words". Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by [...] " [...] our suburbs with our own myths and social history". However, Kelly has been quoted as saying [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got it nailed yet". In 2007 Kelly donated his 'Lee Oskar' harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on Live, May 1992.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} the album was thematically {{different}} from Fallen, Lee said that [...] "all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences" [...] that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in [...] "the hard stuff", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness. In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{the ability to do}} a lot of things I couldn't do before, for a number of reasons......A lot of doors have kind of been opened in my life—not just since everything has happened for us. The singer also felt the band [...] "broke the doors" [...] and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Simon Cosyns of The Sun labelled the record's artwork—which sees Lee in front of an open door—as [...] " [...] the dark Evanescence image intact, with sinister fairytale scenes, elaborate Victorian gothic arches, illuminated typography and elaborate flowing dresses". Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters praised the album cover, calling it [...] " [...] gother-looking piece." ...|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{noted the}} album's {{extensive}} exploration of sexuality. Having been a singer {{since the age}} of nine, Beyoncé felt [...] "stifled" [...] by the perception she was a role model for young children, and now into her thirties, believed she had [...] "earned the right to [...] express any and every side of self". Addressing the album's sexual content specifically, the singer said [...] "I don't at all have any shame about being sexual and I'm not embarrassed about it and I don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to protect that side of me." [...] Several critics described Beyoncés sex songs as a celebration of monogamous love. [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] is a duet with her husband Jay-Z, and features lyrics heavily laden with double entendres that explore lust within their sexual relationship. It fuses intermittent trap beats with heavy bass, skittering synthesizers and drums, and Arabic-scale vocal arpeggios. Beyoncé's vocals are diverse, including a melodramatic chorus sung in her upper register and a half-rapped second verse. [...] "Blow" [...] veers from a thumping jazz beat created with sparse piano chords and guitars to a [...] "swinging electro-funk groove" [...] with elements of neo-disco. Its erotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics include a running cunnilingus metaphor of [...] "licking Skittles" [...] in its chorus. The slow-jam [...] "Rocket" [...] is a homage to D'Angelo's soul-infused [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). Described by Entertainment Weeklys Nick Catucci as a [...] "slippery, six-and-a-half-minute funk excursion", Beyoncé adopts a slow, harmonious vocal as she instructs her love interest to watch her perform a striptease.|$|E

2500|$|Kirito is voiced in Japanese by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka and in English by Bryce Papenbrook. In an {{interview}} with Matsuoka on the similarities {{between him and his}} character, the voice actor opinioned that [...] "I'm thinking about our workplaces – in both of our workplaces, there's only one chance , so there's {{a lot of people who}} are putting in their all. I always think that I have to do the best acting I can for the sake of those who came to see me or watch the show. I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to pull along people with my acting. I <b>feel</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to pave the way for the others." [...] Many fans have asked Reki Kawahara whether there would be an eventual crossover between Accel World and Sword Art Online, to which he answered that while he had already written a scenario where Kirito and Haruyuki Arita meet and fight, such a prospect would be difficult due to SAO taking place in 2022 and Accel World in 2046.|$|E
2500|$|After his nomination, Jackson {{received}} backlash {{for some}} of his past statements that have been perceived as derogatory to gays, blacks, and Democrats. Jackson and some observers have noted the challenge of differentiating between statements made in a ministry setting and those made in a political setting. Jackson said, [...] "I {{have been forced to}} clarify those views because they went back and picked out ministry settings where I talked about these things and brought them into my campaign. Then I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no choice but to clarify." [...] Coby Dillard, a Norfolk Republican, observed that some of the criticism {{stems from the fact that}} commentary acceptable in a church setting is received differently in a political campaign. Jackson said that by critiquing his comments made in a ministry context, his opponents were trying to impose a religious test to say that anyone who takes a traditional view of the Bible is unfit for public office.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album is}} partly {{inspired}} {{by the death of}} Hay's father in 2010. On the album's release, Hay noted, [...] "The loss of my father last year brought an unavoidable emotional contingent to writing and recording. <b>I</b> don’t <b>have</b> a definitive belief in an afterlife, but <b>I</b> do <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> his help when I was working on this album, especially alone late at night, in the studio. ... The night my father died, I was in Glasgow on the River Clyde, about twenty streets away from where he was born. There’s some kind of bleak poetry in that, very bleak." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the UK and Ireland, a {{new version}} of the album was {{released}} in November 2011, featuring several new songs including a new single, [...] "Try With Me". A further repackaged version of the album was in development for the US, featuring an alternate track listing; Scherzinger confirmed, during an interview with MTV, that the US album would contain contributions from RedOne, Ne-Yo, Jim Jonsin, The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. In addition to this, 50 Cent was featured on the album's US lead single, {{a new version}} of the Jonsin-produced, [...] "Right There". American hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg was to appear on one of the new songs recorded for the US album. At the time of recording in August 2011, Scherzinger had over forty songs to choose from for the new release, but said that it would [...] "not be finished until the very last minute. I don't know if I will ever <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> finished the album." [...] After being part of the inaugural judging panel on the first season of reality TV show, The X Factor USA, the following year in 2012, Scherzinger crossed the Atlantic to judge (and win) the [...] ninth series of the British edition of The X Factor. Whilst deciding whether or not to return to tenth series, Scherzinger unveiled that she had been working on her second studio album due for a global release in November 2013. This officially signaled the end of the Killer Love era, and resulting in the cancellation of the album's US release.|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E

In 2005 she left the label, noting that her perspective had changed considerably since she had started recording for Reunion at 17. [...] "My worldview shifted like tectonic plates from 17 to mid-twenties, and over time, I just started to feel less and less comfortable {{with the type of}} music I was making.

500|$|The album's {{guitar and}} bass {{ensemble}} was primarily dictated by Frusciante, {{rather than a}} collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, Stadium Arcadium, Flea reflected on the composition of By the Way, stating: [...] "John went to this whole level of artistry.
