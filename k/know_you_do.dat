60|$|BELLA.--Oh, {{something}} dreadful! You <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> I {{heard you}} say it to the cabman.|$|E
60|$|DOT. Yes, mother, and don't you {{pretend you}} don't understand, because you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
60|$|UNKNOWN. But {{you took}} it; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> said you'd score me off.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, yes; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> <b>you</b> young sneerer,' he said {{like a cross}} baby. 'You are {{laughing}} at me--that's who you {{are laughing}} at! I should like to <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> without such as me if the French were to drop in upon ye any night?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You struck her, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> Sir Barnes Newcome. She {{rushed over}} to me last year on the night <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> she did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I {{can tell}} {{what sort of}} dinners you like best--perfectly well. I know {{precisely}} the dishes you prefer----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you do know, Grandfather Frog, you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Please tell us!" [...] {{cried the}} Merry Little Breezes as they settled {{themselves}} among the rushes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hubby, {{you know}} better than that. You <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Doctors all say that the {{turpentine}} in pine wood is good for weak back and the kidneys." ...|$|E
60|$|JUDITH. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{it for his}} sake, {{believing he}} was a more worthy man than yourself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes you're rather keen," [...] Laura remarked. [...] "Still {{sometimes}} you are obstinate. I have <b>known</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> things I would sooner <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why? Surely {{you will}} make some little {{allowance}} for a naturally quick temper, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not--that <b>you</b> were--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you would}} do me a kindness,' {{proceeded}} Guy, 'you would just say you did not mean it. I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not, but if you would only say so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, now, Cousin Florence," [...] said Edward, [...] "you are {{a girl of}} {{moderately}} good sense, {{with all}} your nonsense. Now don't you (I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do)</b> think just so too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Mart. I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> sir, and {{therefore}} I hope you'll think never the worse of me for his prating: For, though I do not boast {{of my own}} good parts---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, you can't talk, William. You christened little Miss Demby the Button-quail last cold weather; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> India's {{the land}} of nicknames.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Barnes {{scratched}} their names," [...] cries Ethel, [...] "out of the list, mamma. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> Barnes; <b>you</b> {{said you}} had gallipots enough." ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE (smiling). To spoil it? You {{mean that}} you sought to flirt even with me. Ah, I <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But that is nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> but you overtask your strength. This wretched life, my love, {{of daily}} labour and fatigue, {{is more than}} you can bear, I am sure it is. Poor Madeline!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} wounded me. [...] "My dear uncle," [...] I exclaimed, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not intend}} it, but {{you make me}} feel unwelcome. Come down and let me in, I beg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall hope to {{make you}} do so before long," [...] he replied, with a meaning glance; [...] "but you are not very polite, you <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not offer me a seat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you can't talk, William. You christened little Miss Demby the Button-quail, last cold weather; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> India's {{the land}} of nicknames." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> It's {{the rotten}} {{sort of thing}} you would think. Rag, by Jove! Look at this. Now <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{understand}} that this is a genuine concern?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> did; I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> I {{see it in}} your face. Now {{that really}} wasn't nice of you. I thought you came as a friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right, Minnie," [...] was {{the answer}} in {{masculine}} tones. [...] "You like us to be here, you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> And, remember, we haven't seen you in a long time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not; {{but it is}} I {{whom you}} should blame. I should have learnt how her heart stood, and have {{prevented}} this--but I thought, I thought {{it would have been}} otherwise.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! you are cruel," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You want to {{take him}} from me; I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> He promised--to marry me--before you came. He must marry me! I dare not go home!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> love her," [...] {{continued}} Flora. [...] "I am {{sure you}} intended no harm, {{and it was my}} leaving her that made her fretful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean, you did--What I {{mean to say}} is--Oh, hang it, <b>you</b> <b>know!</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> cut {{off when}} we had that row in the town, didn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and you insulted his memory. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> yesterday. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> And I {{will never}} forgive you. Never!" [...] said Amelia. She shot out each little {{sentence}} in a tremor {{of anger and}} emotion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I {{know you}} don't want {{physical}} things by themselves. But, I {{want you to}} give me--to give your spirit to me--that golden light which is you--which you don't know--give it me--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> it pretty well," [...] he laughed. [...] "By the way, Honora, I've {{got to have}} a conference with Mr. Wing to-day, and I may not be home to lunch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Hereward, we <b>know</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> you {{not know}} us? We are the twins, {{the sons of}} your sister, Siward the White and Siward the Red, the orphans of Asbiorn Siwardsson, who fell at Dunsinane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> and I {{insist on}} your {{telling me what}} it was. I will pay you. I {{will give you a}} cheque for a hundred pounds.' ...|$|R
60|$|LIZA [wounded, {{getting away}} from him {{to the other side}} of the ottoman with her face to the hearth] I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> <b>you</b> brute. You wanted to get rid of me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not, Charlotte! <b>You</b> {{are only}} too patient and kind--' But his voice broke down, {{and he was}} forced silently to sign to her to leave him.|$|R
