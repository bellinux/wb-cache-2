5|$|How the <b>First</b> <b>Letter</b> Was Written — {{introduces}} the only characters who appear {{in more than}} one story: a family of cave-people, called Tegumai Bopsulai (the father), Teshumai Tewindrow (the mother), and Taffimai Metallumai, (the daughter). Explains how Taffimai delivered a picture message to her mother.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{concerns}} of the Irish discussed in the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> was over what is now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would {{no longer be able to}} pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E
5|$|The only decorations in the {{manuscript}} are decorative tail-pieces {{at the end of}} each book (see illustration) and it also shows a tendency to increase the size of the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> of each sentence. The capitals at the beginning of the sections stand out in the margin as in codices Ephraemi and Basilensis. Codex Alexandrinus is the oldest manuscript to use capital letters to indicate new sections.|$|E

The <b>first</b> <b>letters</b> of each paragraph in the Postface spell out [...] "On Wisconsin". In the first printing, in Fig. 9.L (p. 305) [...] "Bird" [...] is typeset safely outside the furnace wall.|$|R

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{religious}} overtones similar to Swift's sermons, {{such as the}} Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> to a Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul. However, the final judgment had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and {{the souls of the}} citizenry.|$|E
5|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to}} the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so {{it is more likely that}} the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E
5|$|That afternoon, Reagan {{consulted}} with White House counsel Fred Fielding by telephone, {{debating whether to}} invoke the amendment and, if so, whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned that Reagan was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. W. Bush was Acting President from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan transmitted a second letter to resume the powers and duties of the office.|$|E

5|$|The LAMP {{architecture}} {{has become}} {{popular in the}} web industry {{as a way of}} deploying web applications. PHP is commonly used as the P in this bundle alongside Linux, Apache and MySQL, although the P may also refer to Python, Perl, or some mix of the three. Similar packages, WAMP and MAMP, are also available for Windows and macOS, with the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> standing for the respective operating system. Although both PHP and Apache are provided as part of the macOS base install, users of these packages seek a simpler installation mechanism that can be more easily kept up to date.|$|E
5|$|The club {{eventually}} {{chose the}} colours {{of the local}} Parramatta council, which were royal blue and gold, which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or hoops. The crest used these colours and was {{like many of the}} other crests of the 1908 season, a badge with a letter 'C', to represent the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in hoops around the jersey. These hoops of blue and gold were mixed with a white collar and black or grey shorts.|$|E
5|$|The plural form of {{the common}} name {{narcissus}} has caused some confusion. British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two alternate forms, narcissi and narcissuses. In contrast, in American English the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides for a third form, narcissus, used for both singular and plural. The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English, although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three in the same order. However, Garner's Modern American Usage states that narcissi is the commonest form, narcissus being excessively sibilant. For similar reasons, Fowler prefers narcissi in British English usage. Neither support narcissus as a plural form. Common names such as narcissus do not capitalise the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> {{in contrast to the}} person of that name and the Latin genus name.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} code {{refers to}} the code assigned to the episode by the production team. The first two characters refer to the season the episode was made for. The first season is 7Gxx, the second is 7Fxx, the third is 8Fxx and the fourth is 9Fxx. After that, the fifth season started with 1F and continued in order until season nine (which was 5F). Starting with season ten, the production codes started with AABF, with the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> changing for each season (i.e. BABF, CABF, etc.). The number {{at the end of}} the code is the order in which that episode was produced during that production run.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the <b>first</b> <b>letter,</b> responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E
5|$|By August, Lucien, his {{children}} and Dermide had all suffered from bouts of fever. Doctors saw no cause for alarm and Lucien quickly recovered, as did {{his children}}. Despite the doctors' best efforts, Dermide died on 14 August, {{at the age of}} six. Pauline later came to believe her son's blood had been thinned by the recurrent spells of yellow fever they had suffered in Saint-Domingue. Borghese decided to conceal Dermide's death from his wife until her health improved. Thus, Francesco returned to Frascati and wrote three letters addressed to Pauline: one which announced the onset of Dermide's illness, the second announcing that the illness worsened and the third announcing Dermide's demise. Immediately after receiving the <b>first</b> <b>letter,</b> Pauline began making preparations for her departure from Pisa, in order to reach her son at Frascati. Before this was possible, she became aware of the truth and her suspicions were confirmed by de la Ronde.|$|E

5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E
5|$|The Years of Rice and Salt is an {{alternate}} history novel written by science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson {{and published in}} 2002. The novel explores how world history {{might have been different}} if the Black Death plague had killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Divided into ten parts, the story spans hundreds of years, from the army of the Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re-populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67-year-long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the ten parts take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified to the reader by the <b>first</b> <b>letter</b> of their name being consistent in each life.|$|E
