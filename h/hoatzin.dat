5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a <b>hoatzin,</b> a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of <b>hoatzin</b> behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E
5|$|He {{begins the}} section with an {{analysis}} of the temporal opening found in the skull of many extant birds. After a thorough comparison, he rejects the notion, which was common at the time, that this temporal opening was homologous with the supratemporal fenestra in reptiles. Instead, he concludes that it is a recent feature. Next he makes some observations on the wing structure of modern nestling birds. He finds that some species of extant birds have claws on their first and second fingers when very young, and some, like the <b>hoatzin,</b> will even use these temporary claws to climb about, including in the branches of trees. He also discovers that far more nestlings have a nonfunctional claw on the first digit, and some adult birds do as well.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the <b>hoatzin)</b> retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling <b>hoatzins</b> is much delayed compared to the {{development of}} these feathers in other young birds, presumably because young <b>hoatzins</b> are equipped with claws on their first two digits. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|R
50|$|In {{the species}} that incubate, the work is divided {{differently}} between the sexes. Possibly the most common pattern is that the female does all the incubation, as in the canary and the Indian robin, or most of it, as is typical of falcons. In some species, such as the whooping crane, the male and the female take turns incubating the egg. In others, such as the cassowaries, only the male incubates. The male mountain plover incubates the female's first clutch, but if she lays a second, she incubates it herself. In <b>hoatzins,</b> some birds (mostly males) help their parents incubate later broods.|$|R
50|$|Cantão Park was {{formally}} opened for visitation in June 2013. Visitor infrastructure includes a visitor center featuring videos and interpretative displays, and an 18 km system of trails through the forest, including hiking trails and canoe trails. The trails give access to five pristine lakes {{in the interior}} of the park, where top predators such as black caiman, giant otters, and pirarucú fish can be seen. It is possible to stay overnight on a platform overlooking one of the lakes, and to ride on a canoe powered by electric motor, which facilitates the watching of wildlife such as <b>hoatzins,</b> waterbirds, and giant otters. All visitors must be accompanied by a trained local guide, a list of which is available at the park visitor center.|$|R
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The <b>hoatzin</b> and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research {{the ecology of the}} surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions. Using Kalacoon as his base of operations, Beebe performed a novel type of study: methodically dissecting a small area of jungle, and all of the animals which inhabit it, {{from the top of the}} canopy to below the ground. In a second study, Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately a quarter mile (0.4km) square. During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a <b>hoatzin,</b> the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep it alive for the zoo during the trip back to New York.|$|E
25|$|Many {{familiar}} {{animals are}} quadrupedal, walking or running on four legs. A few birds use quadrupedal movement in some circumstances. For example, the shoebill sometimes uses its wings to right itself after lunging at prey. The newly hatched <b>hoatzin</b> bird has claws on its thumb and first finger enabling it to dexterously climb tree branches until its wings {{are strong enough}} for sustained flight. These claws are {{gone by the time}} the bird reaches adulthood.|$|E
30|$|Microbiota of {{mammalian}} {{gastrointestinal tract}} (GIT) {{is a complex}} ecosystem constitute of diverse bacterial populations (Falony et al. 2016). The intra- and interpersonal variation {{in the composition of}} the human microbiome significantly complicates the analysis of microbiome data (Consortium HMP 2012; Taglialatela et al. 2009). The recently proposed concept of enterotypes or stool community types has overcome this difficulty (Arumugam et al. 2011; Koren et al. 2013). Gut microbiota assists in intestinal homeostasis and other aspects of the host, including intestinal immune response, digestion, physiology, and disease treatment (Donia et al. 2014; Koboziev et al. 2014). The microflora in the GIT of ruminants plays a critical role in fiber degradation (Nyonyo et al. 2014; Thoetkiattikul et al. 2013). Ruminants can efficiently digest dietary fiber and absorb nutrients because of their unique stomachs, including the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, particularly the rumen (Morgavi et al. 2013). Due to the easiest sampling procedure feces and rumen of ruminants were most studied (Kittelmann et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2011). The microbiota in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine of koalas, <b>hoatzins,</b> Brazilian Nelore steer, and mice has been recently explored through high-throughput next-generation sequencing (Barker et al. 2013; de Oliveira et al. 2013; Godoy-Vitorino et al. 2012; Gu et al. 2013).|$|R
25|$|In {{describing}} Scansoriopteryx, Czerkas & Yuan cited {{evidence for}} an arboreal (tree-dwelling) lifestyle. They noted that, unlike all modern bird hatchlings, the forelimbs of Scansoriopteryx are {{longer than the}} hind limbs. The authors argued that this anomaly indicates the forelimbs {{played an important role}} in locomotion even at an extremely early developmental stage. Scansoriopteryx has a well-preserved foot, and the authors interpreted the hallux as reversed, the condition of a backward-pointing toe being widespread among modern tree-dwelling birds. Furthermore, the authors pointed to the short, stiffened tail of the Scansoriopteryx specimen as a tree-climbing adaptation. The tail may have been used as a prop, much like the tails of modern woodpeckers. Comparison with the hands of modern climbing species with elongated third digits, like iguanid lizards, also supports the tree-climbing hypothesis. Indeed, the hands of Scansoriopteryx are much better adapted to climbing than the modern tree-climbing hatchling of the <b>hoatzin.</b>|$|E
500|$|Wing types defined herewith: elliptical; high speed; high aspect ratio; soaring. The bird's forelimbs {{that are}} the key to flight. Each wing has a central axis, {{composed}} of three limb bones, the humerus, ulna and radius. The hand, or manus, which ancestrally was composed of five digits, is reduced to three digits (digit II, III and IV or I, II, III depending on the scheme followed), which serves as an anchor for the , one of two groups of flight feathers responsible for the wing's airfoil shape. The other set of flight feathers, behind the carpal joint on the ulna, are called the [...] The remaining feathers on the wing are known as , of which there are three sets. The wing sometimes has vestigial claws. In most species these are lost by the time the bird is adult (such as the highly visible ones used for active climbing by <b>hoatzin</b> chicks), but claws are retained into adulthood by the secretarybird, screamers, finfoots, ostriches, several swifts and numerous others, as a local trait, in a few specimens. Most kinds of bird wings can be grouped into four types, with some falling between two of these types: i) elliptical wings—short and rounded, having a low aspect ratio, allowing for tight maneuvering in confined spaces such as might be found in dense vegetation, which are common in forest raptors and many migratory species of passerines, and species that use a rapid take off to evade predators, such as pheasants and partridges; ii) high speed wings—short, pointed wings that when combined with a heavy wing loading and rapid wingbeats provide an energetically expensive high speed, used by the bird with the fastest wing speed, the peregrine falcon, as well as by most of the ducks and the auks who uses the shape for a different purpose, to [...] "fly" [...] underwater; iii) high aspect ratio wings—typified by low wing loading and which are far longer than they are wide, they are used for slower flight which may take the form of almost hovering (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift; and iv) soaring wings with deep slots—common in larger species of inland birds, such as eagles, vultures, pelicans, and storks, the slots {{at the end of the}} wings, between the primaries, reduce the induced drag and wingtip vortices, whilst the shorter size of the wings aids in takeoff (high aspect ratio wings require a long taxi to get airborne).|$|E

50|$|Inopinaves is a clade of neoavian birds {{recovered}} in a compressive genomic systematic study using nearly 200 species in 2015; it contains the clades Opisthocomiformes (<b>Hoatzin)</b> and Telluraves (core landbirds); the {{study shows that}} the <b>Hoatzin</b> diverged from other birds 64 million years ago. Previous studies have placed the <b>Hoatzin</b> {{in different parts of}} the bird family tree; however, despite its unusual and primitive morphology, genetic studies have shown the <b>hoatzin</b> is not as primitive or as ancient as once thought, and that it could be a very derived bird that reverted to or retains some plesiomorphic traits.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the Eocene genus Hoatzi from Argentina {{has been}} allied {{to both the}} <b>hoatzin</b> and Foro and even been {{considered}} congeneric with the latter. What is certain is that the Cuculiformes, especially the turacos, are among the likelier candidates for the hoatzin's closest living relatives. There is an ancestral <b>hoatzin,</b> Hoazinoides, from the Early or Middle Miocene of Colombia, which would at least not contradict the assumption that Foro panarium was an ancient member of the <b>hoatzin</b> lineage or its predecessor. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the <b>hoatzin</b> belongs to a highly distinct clade of (probably) Cretaceous origin, the Metaves. As nothing certain about the evolutionary history of the <b>hoatzin</b> lineage throughout the Paleogene is known at all, F. panarium cannot support or contradict this hypothesis either.|$|E
50|$|Gruae is a clade {{of birds}} that {{contains}} the order Opisthocomiformes (<b>hoatzin)</b> and Gruimorphae (shorebirds and rails) identified in 2014 by genome analysis. Previous studies have placed the <b>Hoatzin</b> {{in different parts of}} the bird family tree; however, despite its unusual and primitive morphology, genetic studies have shown the <b>hoatzin</b> is not as primitive or as ancient as once thought, and that it could be a very derived bird that reverted to or retains some plesiomorphic traits.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, Houde {{embarked}} on sequencing the entire genome of the <b>hoatzin.</b> [...] As of 2011, {{it was reported}} that more than 1.4 billion base pairs of <b>hoatzin</b> DNA had been sequenced, roughly equal to its entire haploid genome, but that only about 2.4% of its genome had yet been assembled. Completion of this project would be welcomed for more reasons than resolution of <b>hoatzin</b> relationships. Out of the diverse Class Aves, the genomes of no more than 4 species of birds including of the waterfowl/fowl and songbirds had been sequenced. Moreover, much might be learned by coordinating these efforts with that of the metagenomic analysis of the <b>hoatzin</b> foregut ruminant bacterial microflora.|$|E

50|$|Placement {{with the}} gamebirds is historical, based mainly on {{phenetic}} considerations of external morphology, which are considered unreliable and generally dismissed today; the gamebirds {{together with the}} waterfowl are classified as Galloanserae whereas the <b>hoatzin</b> are not. Cladistic analysis of skeletal characters, on the other hand, supports a relationship of the <b>hoatzin</b> to the seriema family Cariamidae, and more distantly to the turaco and cuckoo families. However, cuckoos have zygodactyl feet (two toes forward, two backward) and turacos are semi-zygodactylous, whereas the <b>hoatzin</b> has the more typical anisodactyl foot with three toes forward, one backwards. The evolution of avian dactyly, on the other hand, is not entirely resolved to satisfaction.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the buttonquails (Turnicidae), mesites (Mesitornithidae) and the <b>hoatzin</b> (Opisthocomus hoazin) {{were placed}} in the Galliformes, too. The former are now known to be {{shorebirds}} adapted to an inland lifestyle, whereas the mesites are probably closely related to pigeons and doves. The relationships of the <b>hoatzin</b> are entirely obscure, and it is usually treated as a monotypic order Opisthocomiformes to signify this.|$|E

5000|$|It seems {{probable}} that the taxa {{included in the}} Metaves by Fain and Houde contain some good clades, such as Caprimulgiformes, the Mirandornithes, or the Apodiformes. Considering that some [...] "odd Gruiformes" [...] which might be each other's closest living relatives make {{up most of the}} remaining Metaves, the doves, the <b>hoatzin,</b> and sandgrouse would remain as [...] "Metaves incerta sedis" [...] (Metaves with uncertain placement). This would seem to suggest that the <b>hoatzin</b> is at least more closely related to doves than to many of the other purported 'coronavian' families that previously have been suggested. Subsequent multigene studies of Ericson et al. 2006 and of Hackett et al. 2008 corroborated the Metaves clades, dependent on the inclusion of one and two genes respectively, but the latter did not recover the <b>hoatzin</b> with Metaves.|$|E
5000|$|Fain and Houde in 2004 {{proposed}} a dichotomy in the Neoaves (neognaths excluding fowl) based on β-fibrinogen intron 7 (FGB-int7) sequences.

50|$|An {{example of}} a bird that {{is thought to have}} reached its present {{location}} by rafting is the weak-flying South American <b>hoatzin,</b> whose ancestors apparently floated over from Africa.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a member}} of the family Opisthocomidae, which also {{includes}} the <b>hoatzin</b> and several other extinct genera. The only known species is Hoazinoides magdalenae. Its generic epithet refers to its refers to its resemblance to modern <b>hoatzin,</b> and its specific name refers to its discovery near the Magdalena River basin. Like many other fossil birds, it is known from fragmentary remains, including the back portion of the skull, the specimen UCMP 42823 and other bones of the extremities. From these remains it appears that this bird was similar to that of <b>hoatzin,</b> although smaller, and distinguished from it in the parietal wall of the skull is concave and the coracoid and sternum were not fused. This is why Tab Rasmussen (1997) erected a new family, Hoazinoididae, for it. Its feet were like those of modern owls, in which the fourth toe can rotate backwards. Additionally, the remains of its distal ulna and carpal-metacarpal suggest that its arms were similar to those of hoatzins.|$|E
50|$|Foregut {{fermentation}} {{is a form}} of digestion {{that occurs}} in the foregut of some animals. It has evolved independently in several groups of mammals, and also in the <b>hoatzin</b> bird.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hoatzin</b> was {{originally}} described by German zoologist Statius Müller in 1776. There {{has been much}} debate about the hoatzin's relationships with other birds. Because of its distinctness it has been given its own family, the Opisthocomidae, and its own suborder, the Opisthocomi. At various times, it has been allied with such taxa as the tinamous, the Galliformes (gamebirds), the rails, the bustards, seriemas, sandgrouse, doves, turacos and other Cuculiformes, and mousebirds. A whole genome sequencing study published in 2014 places the <b>hoatzin</b> as the sister taxon of a clade composed of Gruiformes (cranes) and Charadriiformes (plovers).|$|E
