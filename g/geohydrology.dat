50|$|Joints are {{important}} not only in understanding the local and regional geology and geomorphology, but also {{are important}} in development of natural resources, the safe design of structures, and environmental protection. Joints have a profound control on weathering and erosion of bedrock. As a result, they exert a strong control on how topography and morphology of landscapes develop. Understanding the local and regional distribution, physical character, and origin of joints is {{a significant part of}} understanding the geology and geomorphology of an area. Joints often impart a well-develop fracture-induced permeability to bedrock. As a result, joints strongly influence, even control, the natural circulation (<b>geohydrology)</b> of fluids, e.g. groundwater and pollutants within aquifers, petroleum in reservoirs, and hydrothermal circulation at depth, within bedrock. Thus, joints are important to the economic and safe development of petroleum, hydrothermal, and groundwater resources and the subject of intensive research relative to the development of these resources. Also, regional and local joint systems exert a very strong control on how ore-forming (hydrothermal) fluids, consisting largely of , , and NaCl, that formed most of Earth's ore deposits circulated within the Earth crust. As a result, understanding their genesis, structure, chronology, and distribution {{is an important part of}} finding and profitably developing ore deposits of various types. Finally, joints often form discontinuities that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of soil and rock masses in, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope construction. As a result, joints are an important part of geotechnical engineering in practice and research.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Geography and Environmental Studies) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. An {{assessment}} of the geohydrological character of the Vredefort Dome World Heritage Site (VDWHS) was done {{as a basis for}} the development of a groundwater resource management plan. This was done as part of the preparation for the compilation of an Integrated Management Plan and in order to reflect the principles of integration and sustainability with acknowledgment of the legal, institutional and environmental framework within the VDWHS. As the sole water supply in the VDWHS (except for the Vaal River) and being at a critical point in the water balance, groundwater resources require careful management and protection to ensure sustainability and equitable access. This was achieved through the delineation of different groundwater resource management units and the development of resource measures for each management unit. Due to the important role of groundwater as a natural resource, <b>geohydrology</b> is playing a major role in the alignment of the environmental, spatial and statutory frameworks in order to ensure good governance within the VDWHS. A geohydrological-based land use management guideline and spatial development framework were developed to optimise the integration between the water sector, the environmental sector and land use and spatial planning sector. It was concluded that a geohydrological assessment needs to form the basis of land use management and spatial planning in the VDWHS. Without effective integration of <b>geohydrology</b> and land use management contributing to a spatial development framework for the VDWHS, sustainable development will not be possible.

40|$|During the Spring semester, 2000, the University of Arizona Geophysics Field Camp (GEN/GEOS 416 / 516 class) {{conducted}} geophysical {{surveys in}} the vicinity of the United Musical Instruments facility near Nogales, Arizona. This site is a super-fund site, due to the presence of contaminants, including TCE, in the ground water. The contaminants are presumed to have come from cleaning and electroplating solutions, which had been dumped into a small pond on the UMI property. The U. S. Geological Survey provided the funding for our study. The objective was to determine subsurface structural information that would help interpret possible future movement of the contaminant plume. Transient electromagnetic (TEM) data were most useful for interpreting the subsurface <b>geohydrology.</b> Water table was found at a depth of approximately 30 meters, north of the UMI building. A particularly interesting feature in the TEM data was a high-resistivity anomaly and an associated low-resistivity anomaly 10 to 1 00 meters northeast of the UMI building. We interpret the high-resistivity anomaly as possibly being due to an impermeable levee that was associated with a buried stream channel and the low-resisitivity anomaly as possibly being due to the pooling of conductive contaminated fluids against the impermeable levee. DC resistivity surveys were dominated by cultural coupling, which was pervasive m the survey area. Magnetic readings were used to help locate potential cultural interference. Gravity surveys indicated a low-density anomaly, which may be due to a buried stream channel. This feature could be related to the features mapped with the TEM surveys. The seismic survey indicated progressively more compacted and cemented alluvium, overlying the Nogales formation.

Conventional finite element techniques calculate pressures in the nodes of the grid. However, such methods do not satisfy {{the requirement of}} flux continuity at the faces.

The method is algebraically equivalent with the popular block-centered finite difference method and with the mixed-hybrid finite element method, but is algorithmically different and has the same robustness as the more conventional node-based velocity-oriented method.

40|$|Recent {{decreases}} in rainfall {{and the accompanying}} {{decreases in}} groundwater levels since 1999 indicate heightened vulnerability to drought in Nebraska and the surrounding Great Plains.

Simultaneously, groundwater levels declined more than 9 m in the most heavily impacted areas, {{most of which were}} already experiencing declines due to extensive irrigation development and low recharge rates. Thus, recovery from the drought and long-term intensive land use will be particularly challenging in densely irrigated areas of Nebraska. In contrast, contemporaneous groundwater-level changes in areas with little groundwater irrigation were comparatively modest.

Our integrated studies of bedrock geology, bedrock and well-water chemistry, <b>geohydrology,</b> and downhole geophysics have delimited some of the features that can exert broad regional {{as well as local}} control on radon abundance in well water from crystalline rock aquifers. Local, small-scale features such as inhomogeneities in (he distribution and mineralogical residence of uranium in the bedrock and on fracture surfaces exert the strongest control on partitioning of radon between the bedrock aquifer and its entrained ground water. Detailed geologic mapping (meter-scale) has outlined zones in the granite bedrock that are enriched in uranium by an order of magnitude. Alpha-track mapping of thin sections (millimeter-scale) demonstrates that iron-oxide coatings on fracture surfaces are enriched in alpha-emitting elements that may be contributing radon to the well water.

Here we illustrate how, given appropriate <b>geohydrology,</b> a rift basin and its catchment can buffer vegetation response to climate signals on decadal time-scales, therefore exerting strong local environmental control. We use time-series data derived from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) residuals that record vegetation vigour, extracted from a decadal span of MODIS images, to demonstrate hydrogeological buffering. While this has been described previously {{it has never been}} demonstrated via remote sensing and results in relative stability in vegetation vigour inside the delta, compared to that outside. As such the Delta acts as a regional hydro-refugium. This provides insight, not only to the potential impact of future climate in the region, but also demonstrates why similar basins are attractive to fauna, including our ancestors, in regions like eastern Africa. Although vertebrate evolution operates on time scales longer than decades, the sensitivity of rift wetlands to climate change has been stressed by some authors, and this work demonstrates another example of the unique properties that such basins can afford, given the right hydrological conditions...|$|E
