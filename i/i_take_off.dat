25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my work clothes, {{covered in}} mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp St√∂lzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{letter to}} Zweig was intercepted by the Gestapo {{and sent to}} Hitler. Strauss was {{subsequently}} dismissed from his post as Reichsmusikkammer president in 1935. The 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics nevertheless used Strauss's Olympische Hymne, which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Arturo Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, [...] "To Strauss the composer <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat; to Strauss the man I {{put it back on}} again", when Strauss had accepted the presidency of the Reichsmusikkammer. Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to concentration camps.|$|E
60|$|They are not large, {{but they}} are very solid and they carry {{themselves}} well. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my hat to them as they passed. Then there came the guns. They were good guns, well horsed and well manned. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my hat to them. Then came the Engineers, and to them also <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my hat. There are no braver men than the Engineers. Then came the cavalry, Lancers, Cuirassiers, Chasseurs, and Spahis. To all of them in turn I was able to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat, save only to the Spahis.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my hat and bowed. It was {{the first}} time I had ever been {{addressed}} civilly by any English consular authority.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't run {{off with}} it. I found it {{drifting}} along the shore, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my shoes and socks and waded in after it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, miss," [...] said Jimmy, {{who could}} not resist the impulse of adding, with a {{whimsical}} twinkle in his eyes: [...] "Shall <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the trolling-spoon?" ...|$|E
60|$|MANGAN. I don't boast. But when I meet a {{man that}} makes a hundred {{thousand}} a year, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat to that man, and stretch out my hand to him and call him brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind that. What {{kind of a}} show can he put up? You've been {{conditioning}} and training fighters all your life. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat to your judgment. Can he give the public a run for its money?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for me to make any answer to this woman, but <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my hat and bowed. The sail filled, and we glided away.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my coat, and baring my arm, {{showed him}} the ring hanging by {{a few inches of}} strong chain from the bracelet. He {{examined}} the design curiously.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{handing the}} rifle to Hans, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my hat, pushed the gate a little wider open, slipped {{through it and}} called {{attention}} to my presence by coughing.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Peraps you'll {{understand}} me, when <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my own,' says I, unbuttoning the motherapurls of the MacWhirter tartn. 'Take my jackit, Joe,' says I to the boy,--and {{put myself}} in a hattitude about which there was NO MISTAYK.|$|E
6000|$|... (Now that is {{graceful and}} handsome. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat to my life-long friend and comrade, {{and with my}} feet {{together}} and my fingers spread over my heart, I say, {{in the language of}} Alabama, [...] "You do me proud.") ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, you defend him!" [...] cried Mr. Flint. [...] "I thought so--I thought so. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat to him, he is a cleverer man {{even than}} I. His own father, {{whom he has}} ruined, comes up here and defends him." ...|$|E
60|$|By and by {{my friend}} met a venerable personage, {{and not only}} made him a most {{elaborate}} bow, but also <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his hat. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> mine, too, with a mysterious awe. I was beginning to be infected.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> up my candle, and was {{not long}} in hunting up another packing-case. This was marked Furniture. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> some of the boards, and soon brought to light a {{quantity}} of pretty fair kindling wood! ...|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{good deal}} of a lecture, I thought, but it didn't disturb Sandy, didn't turn a feather; her steam soared {{steadily}} up again, the minute <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the lid: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whew!" [...] exclaimed {{the officer}} of the law--"who the devil told you that? But since you do know it, there is no harm to say ay. So make {{yourself}} ready to move immediately; and first, hold out your dew-beaters till <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the darbies." ...|$|E
6000|$|Amelius listened, wondering. Had he seen drowsily what {{he thought}} he had dreamed, or was there some mysterious sympathy between Sally and himself? The occult speculations were {{interrupted}} by Sally. [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my bonnet, and make myself tidy?" [...] she asked. Some men might have said No. Amelius was not one of them.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Wilmet! At {{that moment}} all her gladness {{had gone into}} a weight like lead on her heart, though it only made her more gentle. 'Dear Cherry,' she softly said, 'don't talk of {{anything}} to upset you. Will you be good and lie quite still while <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my things, and then I'll come and dress you? You must not be knocked up to-night.' ...|$|E
60|$|Going to {{the spring}} near which we were outspanned, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my shirt {{to have a good}} wash, still chuckling at the memory of all the hocus-pocus of my old friend, the Opener-of-Roads.|$|R
5000|$|For Artpop, I, in {{the most}} metaphorical explanation, {{stood in front of}} a mirror and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the wig and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the makeup and I unzipped the outfit and I put a black cap on my head and I covered my body in a black catsuit and I looked in the mirror and I said: 'OK, now you need to show them you can be {{brilliant}} without that.' And that's what Artpop is all about. Because I knew that if I wanted to grow, if I really wanted to innovate from the inside, I had to do something that was almost impossible for me.|$|R
60|$|CONJURER. <b>I</b> will <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my cloak {{when you}} <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your coat.|$|R
60|$|I am terribly dejected {{for about}} a week or two. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my ring, I wear my worst clothes, I use no bear's grease, and I {{frequently}} lament over the late Miss Larkins's faded flower. Being, by that time, rather tired of this kind of life, and having received new provocation from the butcher, I throw the flower away, go out with the butcher, and gloriously defeat him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{bill which}} {{was before the}} {{committee}} {{two years ago when}} I was down there was the most stupefying jumble of conflicting and apparently irreconcilable interests that was ever seen; and we all said [...] "the case is hopeless, absolutely hopeless--out of this chaos nothing can be built." [...] But we were in error; out of that chaotic mass this excellent bill has been instructed; the warring interests have been reconciled, and the result is as comely and substantial a legislative edifice as lifts its domes and towers and protective lightning rods out of the statute book, I think. When I think of that other bill, which even the Deity couldn't understand, and of this one which even I can understand, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat to the man or men who devised this one. Was it R. U. Johnson? Was it the Author's League? Was it both together? I don't know, but <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat, anyway. Johnson has written a valuable article about the new law--I enclose it.|$|E
6000|$|BURGE. Good God! Here is this professor: a man utterly {{removed from}} the turmoil of our {{political}} life: devoted to pure learning in its most abstract phases; and I solemnly declare he is the greatest politician, the most inspired party leader, in the kingdom. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat to him. I, Joyce Burge, give him best. And you sit there purring like an Angora cat, and can see nothing in it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{order to}} heat the iron <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> {{the top of the}} stove and opened the entire front. On leaving I paid no {{attention}} to closing it, and of course some of the coals must have fallen out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> my {{coat and}} laid it on a bench. I reckon they saw that I was in earnest, and they just sat as mum as mice. Then the little man said, in a quieter sort of voice,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--is it not? Twelve {{years ago}} <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> {{my shoes and}} {{stockings}} and had them dried in that cottage, and when I {{got back to the}} house I was put to bed for having been out all day in the wood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At the photographer's at Saratoga. I {{should never}} have come {{if she had not}} helped me, but she said she knew you would take me home, and she wrote and took my passage and all. She said if I did not find you, Mr. Wakefield would know where you were, but I did so want to get home to you! Please, may <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my things; I don't want to be such a fright when Allen comes in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Cyril Baptiste," [...] he answered, in a low, even, passionate voice, that {{he flung}} at her {{almost like a}} blow. [...] "The atheist, the gaol bird, the pariah, the blasphemer, the anti-Christ. I've hoofs instead of feet. Shall <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my boots and show them to you? I tuck my tail inside my coat. You can't see my horns. I've cut them off close to my head. That's why I wear my hair long: to hide the stumps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{leave her}} alone to choose. Don't go about looking as though you had a knife in your heart, if you find her turn {{for a moment to}} some one else. You don't want her to choose you, do you, just because you are a weakling, because her great kind heart can't bear the thought of making you miserable? Stand on your feet like a man and take your luck.... Can <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my hat? I can't eat in this." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{thinking}} {{that this was an}} occasion on which I might properly do so, for the first time <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the talisman which I had worn for so long, and Umslopogaas put it over his head and hid it beneath his blanket.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a pretty}} deep graze," [...] he said, after he had {{carefully}} removed the plaster. [...] "An eighth of an inch farther, {{and it would have}} made your teeth rattle. You had better keep quiet, today. Tomorrow morning, if {{there is no sign of}} inflammation, <b>I</b> will <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the dressing and bandage and put on a plaster--one a third of the size that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> will be sufficient; and as I will use a pink plaster, it will not be very noticeable, if you go outside the barracks.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Hirst," [...] said Hewet, after a pause, [...] "I have {{a terrible}} {{confession}} to make. Your book--the poems of Wordsworth, which if you remember <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> your table {{just as we were}} starting, and certainly put in my pocket here--" ...|$|R
