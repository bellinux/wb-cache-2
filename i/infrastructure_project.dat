5|$|The {{early and}} mid-1980s saw {{economic}} trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on Libya's {{largest and most}} expensive <b>infrastructure</b> <b>project,</b> the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished {{by the end of}} the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya's foreign debt rose, and austerity measures were introduced to promote self-reliance; in August 1985 there was a mass deportation of foreign workers, most of them Egyptian and Tunisian. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a militia—linked either to the NFSL or the Muslim Brotherhood—and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.|$|E
5|$|On 13 May 2015, {{the first}} test train, DRS Class 37 604 with DBSO 9702, worked the 1Q13 Tweedbank-Millerhill.

Official completion and handover of the line to the ScotRail Alliance, a group formed by Network Rail and Abellio ScotRail, took place on 14 June 2015. A 12-week period of driver training for 64 drivers and 64 guards began on 7 June 2015, with Abellio ScotRail Class 170 170414 in livery promoting the new line undertaking a proving run to measure stepping distances from platforms to trains. The train, which carried a large number of Network Rail staff, stopped at all stations from Newcraighall to Tweedbank in the presence of large crowds of spectators. The following day Class 158 158741 was used for the first driver-training runs. On 26 July 2015, a driver-training train carried Borders rail campaigner Madge Elliot. The Borders Railway was named the Scottish <b>infrastructure</b> <b>project</b> of 2016 by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.|$|E

5|$|Peter Law, {{the former}} Assembly Member (AM) for Blaenau Gwent, had {{been calling for}} {{passenger}} services between Ebbw Vale and Newport to resume on the line since the 1980s, {{while he was still}} a councillor. An initial feasibility study of the proposal was carried out for Blaenau Gwent council by <b>infrastructure</b> <b>project</b> management company Capita Symonds in 1998. Stations at Ebbw Vale, Cwm, Aberbeeg, Abercarn, Risca and Maesglas were suggested, and the plans included running some trains to Cardiff Central via a new station at Celtic Lakes on the South Wales Main Line. Law made fighting for the line's re-opening one of his major election promises during the National Assembly for Wales election campaign in 1999. A plaque at Ebbw Vale Parkway commemorates Law, who died in 2006, and his work to re-open the line. It was unveiled by Jocelyn Davies AM on 10 December 2007, four days before the Ebbw Valley Railway's planned official re-opening.|$|E

According to the World Bank, the decision process from design to execution involved users from the conception through a water user council.
