Following the death of his grandfather in 1928 the winery was run by his father alone.

The company then expanded the business and in addition to the winery offered wine imports, sparkling wines, and a distillery for wine and liqueur.

Developing a coherent distribution plan is a central component of strategic planning. At the strategic level, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective or exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the strategic approach. The overall <b>distribution</b> <b>channel</b> should add value to the consumer.|$|E
40|$|Purpose– This study aims {{to examine}} online room rates in Hong Kong hotels. It focuses on {{comparing}} and contrasting the lowest hotel room rates {{that are available to}} customers. Design/methodology/approach– Eight <b>distribution</b> <b>channels</b> and 45 hotels in Hong Kong were examined for online room rates in a 13 ‐month period from 2005 to 2006. The eight <b>distribution</b> <b>channels</b> represented different nature of operations including both indirect and direct <b>distribution</b> <b>channels.</b> Findings– Empirical findings showed the web sites of local travel agents and local reservation agents offered the lowest online room rates, and that indirect <b>distribution</b> <b>channels</b> offered lower room rates than direct <b>distribution</b> <b>channels.</b> Research limitations/implications– A major limitation of this study is the geographic limitation of hotel selection.

25|$|Yield {{management}} {{has become part}} of mainstream business theory and practice over the last fifteen to twenty years. Whether an emerging discipline or a new management science (it has been called both), yield management is a set of yield maximization strategies and tactics to improve the profitability of certain businesses. It is complex because it involves several aspects of management control, including rate management, revenue streams management, and <b>distribution</b> <b>channel</b> management. Yield management is multidisciplinary because it blends elements of marketing, operations, and financial management into a highly successful new approach. Yield management strategists must frequently work with one or more other departments when designing and implementing yield management strategies.|$|E
25|$|Channel-switching (not to be {{confused}} with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching to a different purchasing environment (or <b>distribution</b> <b>channel)</b> to purchase goods, such as switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues, or the internet. A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of Category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal/ statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{designing}} a distribution system, the planner needs {{to determine what}} the <b>distribution</b> <b>channel</b> is to achieve in broad terms.

2500|$|A {{new trend}} in {{newspaper}} publishing {{is the introduction}} of personalization through on-demand printing technologies or with online news aggregator websites like Google news. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This [...] "Best of" [...] approach allows to revive the print-based model and opens up a new <b>distribution</b> <b>channel</b> to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter.times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.|$|E
2500|$|In {{consumer}} markets, {{another key}} strategic level decision {{is whether to}} use a push or pull strategy. In a push strategy, the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, {{with the expectation that}} they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a pull strategy, the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the <b>distribution</b> <b>channel.</b> [...] The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use of consumer-oriented media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rising}} {{popularity}} of the Internet, Lynch decided to utilize it as a new <b>distribution</b> <b>channel,</b> releasing several new series that he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com. In 2002, he created a series of online shorts named DumbLand. Intentionally crude both in content and execution, the eight-episode series was later released on DVD. The same year, Lynch released a surreal sitcom on his website called Rabbits, about a family of humanoid rabbits. Later, he made his experiments with Digital Video available {{in the form of}} the Japanese-style horror short Darkened Room. In 2006, Lynch's feature film Inland Empire was released. At three hours long, it was the longest of Lynch's films. Like Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway before it, the film did not follow a traditional narrative structure. It starred Lynch regulars Laura Dern, Harry Dean Stanton and Justin Theroux, with cameos by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring (voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit), and a performance by Jeremy Irons. Lynch described the piece as [...] "a mystery about a woman in trouble". In an effort to promote the film, Lynch made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan [...] "Without cheese there would be no Inland Empire".|$|E

2500|$|Referencing {{the work}} of {{historian}} Lea Jacobs, Naremore describes how the line between A and B movies was [...] "ambiguous and never dependent on money alone." [...] Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as sleeper hits: One of 1943's biggest films was Hitler's Children, an 82-minute-long RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than $3 million in rentals, industry language for a distributor's share of gross box office receipts. The violent Dillinger (1945), made for a reported $35,000, earned Monogram more than $1 million for the first time. A pictures, particularly {{in the realm of}} film noir, sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Between November 1941 and November 1943, Dore Schary ran what was effectively a [...] "B-plus" [...] unit at MGM. Programmers, with their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition, leading in certain cases to historical confusion. As late as 1948, the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode—it was the standard screening policy at 25 percent of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36 percent. The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope: In 1947, Monogram established a subsidiary, Allied Artists, as a development and <b>distribution</b> <b>channel</b> for relatively expensive films, mostly from independent producers. Around the same time, Republic launched a similar effort under the [...] "Premiere" [...] rubric. In 1947 as well, PRC was subsumed by Eagle-Lion, a British company seeking entry to the American market. Warners' (and Fox's) former Keeper of the B's, Brian Foy, was installed as production chief.|$|E
