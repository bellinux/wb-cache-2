In normal circumstances this meant the club would have been relegated to the Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition {{in time for the}} 1991–92 season meant there was to be no <b>demotion.</b>|$|E

The scandal, which soon spread to Nanjing examination circles, uncovered the corruption and influence-peddling that was rife in the bureaucracy, and that many moralistic officials from the north attributed to the existence of southern literary clubs and to the decline of classical scholarship.|$|E

At the time of the notables' stated failure to conscript local peasants, Ibrahim Pasha had been in need of new troops to replenish his army in preparation for further advances against the Ottomans. He considered the notables' position to be treasonous and amounting to an insurrection.|$|E

5|$|The French {{responded by}} attacking and {{capturing}} Washington at Fort Necessity in July 1754. They {{allowed him to}} return with his troops to Virginia. Historian Joseph Ellis concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington's bravery, initiative, inexperience, and impetuosity.

Washington's expedition into the Ohio Country had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission. Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756.|$|E
