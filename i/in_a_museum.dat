5|$|Despite {{assistance}} from his friends, {{he was never}} able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum.</b> To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.|$|E
5|$|After its completion, Winslow Ames {{used the}} house as a rental {{property}} until 1949 {{when he went to}} work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> in Springfield, Missouri. The house was sold to Connecticut College. Connecticut College continued to rent it to staff and students until 2004, when plans were made to demolish the house. Changing the flat roof to a gable roof was a significant alteration from the original plan; the date of the alteration is unknown, but it preceded 1995.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|At {{an archaeological}} dig in the Ecuadorian highlands, two archaeologists, Dr. Bilac and Dr. Roosevelt, {{get into an}} {{argument}} over the removal of a burial urn that contains an Amaru, or a female shaman. Roosevelt argues that the urn must be taken from the site and preserved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum,</b> much {{to the chagrin of}} Bilac and the tribespeople present. Later, a native shaman distributes Yaje to the local villagers and Bilac. During this ritual, a jaguar spirit kills Roosevelt in his tent.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar {{of first-degree}} murder and sentenced her {{to life in prison}} with the {{possibility}} of parole after 30 years in 2025. Life with the possibility of parole was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas that could be imposed at the time. In 2002, under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay. Fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun should have been <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that September Morn was lewd {{and should not be}} {{displayed}} in public, but rather only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> exhibition. W.W.Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as the woman was committing the illegal act of bathing in public, September Morn had to be banned. Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young {{and the head of the}} Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of the Hallie Ford Museum, Willamette University previously collected various pieces of art donated to the university. By 1896 the collections were housed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> located on the fourth floor of Waller Hall. By 1940 the museum had moved to the second floor of the gymnasium (now the Theatre Playhouse). At that time the museum's collection included birds, various documents, minerals, wood specimens, shells, plant specimens, and Native American artifacts, among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum,</b> and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E

5|$|The corn crake breeds from Britain and Ireland east through Europe {{to central}} Siberia. Although it has {{vanished}} from {{much of its}} historic range, this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41°N and 62°N. There is also a sizable population in western China, but this species nests only rarely in northern Spain and in Turkey. Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect, and result from misidentification of eggs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> collection which are actually those of the African rail.|$|E
5|$|The film's set {{designers}} Eugène Lourié and Max Douy built one of {{the most}} expensive sets in French film history at the Joinville Studio. According to Douy they were based on the script and were not reproductions of the interior of Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin, where exterior scenes were shot. The music boxes used in the film were borrowed from several sources and some are now <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Renoir thought the musical organ scene and Dalio's performance in it was the best scene he had ever filmed. He shot the scene several times before he was satisfied with it. The costumes for the film were designed by Coco Chanel.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} some notable {{historical}} museums in the region. The Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, operated by the National Park Service, commemorates the lives and achievements of Dayton natives Orville and Wilbur Wright and Paul Laurence Dunbar.

Dayton {{is also home to}} America's Packard Museum, which contains many restored historical Packard vehicles. SunWatch Indian Village/Archaeological Park, a partially reconstructed 12th-century prehistoric American Indian village, is on the south end of Dayton; it is organized around a central plaza dominated by wood posts forming an astronomical calendar. The park includes a museum where visitors can learn about the Indian history of the Miami Valley.|$|E

5|$|Toy Story 2 is a 1999 American computer-animated comedy film {{produced}} by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.

In the film, Woody is stolen by a toy collector, prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow to rescue him, but Woody is then tempted {{by the idea of}} immortality <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum.</b> Many of the original characters and voices from Toy Story return for this sequel, and several new characters—including Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Barbie (voiced by Jodi Benson), Stinky Pete (voiced by Kelsey Grammer) and Mrs. Potato Head (voiced by Estelle Harris)—are introduced.|$|E
5|$|XF-104 53-7786 {{was lost}} in a crash on 11July1957 when it {{developed}} an uncontrollable fin flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests.

Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds {{of no more than}} Mach0.95 {{at the time of the}} accident. Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum,</b> arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.|$|E
5|$|DiCaprio {{was named}} Leonardo because his {{pregnant}} mother {{was looking at}} a Leonardo da Vinci painting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> in Italy when he first kicked. His parents separated when he was a year old, and he lived mostly with his mother. The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz (his Los Feliz residence was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several jobs. DiCaprio attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years. However, he {{dropped out of high school}} following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED). DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal grandparents, Wilhelm and Helene. He is conversant in German and Italian.|$|E

McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Buzz and {{the other}} toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned by a new Buzz Lightyear toy, who {{believes}} Buzz is a rogue space ranger. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andy's Buzz. After revealing Al's plan, they go to his apartment, while Andy's Buzz escapes and pursues them, accidentally freeing an Emperor Zurg toy, who in turn follows him {{with the intent of}} destroying him. After the toys find Woody, Buzz rejoins them, and proves that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to go home. Buzz reminds Woody that a toy's true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum.</b> After seeing a boy play with him on TV, Woody realizes Buzz was right, and asks the Roundup gang to come home with him and Andy's toys. However, Stinky Pete declines, and traps the gang, revealing that he wants to go to the museum to be appreciated forever, having never been sold or played with. He was also the one responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt and framing Jessie for it. Al then returns, takes the gang in a suitcase, and leaves for the airport.|$|E

No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E
