50|$|<b>Furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> {{also called}} 2-furylmethanol or 2-furancarbinol, is an organic {{compound}} containing a furan substituted with a hydroxymethyl group. It {{is a clear}} colorless liquid when pure, but becomes amber colored upon prolonged standing. It possesses a faint odor of burning and a bitter taste. It is miscible with but unstable in water.

5000|$|... 2-Furoic acid can be {{synthesized}} by the oxidation {{of either}} <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> or furfural. This {{can be achieved}} either chemically or biocatalytically. Currently the industrial route involves the Cannizaro reaction of furfural in an aqueous NaOH solution; this route produces both 2-furoic acid and <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The bio-catalytic route involves the microorganism Nocardia corallina. Experiments involving this microbial conversion resulted in high yields: 98% from 2-furfuryl alcohol and 88% from 2-furanaldehyde. Oxidation with N. corallina is unique because most other microorganisms produce two products from the oxidation, the acid and the alcohol. Furthermore, aromatic ring destruction does not occur.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the CRPU was {{extremely}} simple. The tubing was strong enough that the propellants were fed to the engine by pressure alone. This eliminated the need for turbopumps. The engine was ablatively cooled, {{eliminating the need for}} fine fuel passages and heat-resistant kerosene. The engine did not gimbal; instead, the vehicle was steered by throttling one side's CRPUs versus the opposite side. Thus, the engine was simply built into the tube walls, with the only mechanisms being the throttling valves. No separate pressurising system was included; the tanks were simply left with an ullage space, which was then filled with gas to a few hundred psi. Because of the narrow tubing, the bulkheads between sections could be simple plates, instead of domes like virtually all other rocket stages. There was no ignition system; instead, a slug of <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was injected before the kerosene. The <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> ignited spontaneously upon contact with the nitric acid.|$|E

50|$|Furan resin prepolymers {{made from}} <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> or by {{modification}} of furfural with phenol, formaldehyde, urea or other extenders, {{are similar to}} amino and phenolic thermosetting resins in that cure involves polycondensation and release of water as well as heat. While they are generally cured {{under the influence of}} heat, catalysts and pressure, furan resins can also be formulated as dual-component no-bake acid-hardened systems which are characterised by high resistance to heat, acids and alkalies. Furan resins are of increasing interest for the manufacture of sustainable composites - biocomposites made from a bio-derived matrix (in this case furan resin), or biofibre reinforcement, or both.|$|E

50|$|From 2008 to 2012, {{the group}} based {{the work on}} a hybrid rocket, using liquid oxygen (LOX) as oxidizer. Originally, the HEAT-1X rocket was to be fuelled by {{paraffin}} wax, but a ground test 28 February 2010 revealed {{that some of the}} paraffin wax had only partially melted, instead of evaporating. The result was that HEAT-1X had less power than expected. A ground test firing of HEAT-1X-P (P for polyurethane) was conducted 16 May 2010. It was positive, the polyurethane had the right power but showed heavy oscillation. Until 2011 the group had performed more than 30 tests of various engine types at their rocket engine test facility at RefshaleÃ¸en. In fall of 2012 a concept engine using white fuming nitric acid and <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was tried using a static test setup.

50|$|The rocket was {{to consist}} of {{individual}} pipes, each 27 cm in diameter and six meters long. Four of these pipes would be installed one above the other resulting in a 24 meter long fuel and oxidizer tank with a rocket engine at the lower end. The fuel {{was intended to be}} kerosene with a 50/50 mixture of nitric acid and dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidiser. Ignition was provided by a small quantity of <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> injected before the fuel, which ignites hypergolically (immediately and energetically) upon contact with the nitric acid. To simplify the design, pumps were not used to move the fuel to the engines, instead the fuel tanks were only 66% filled, with compressed air in the remaining space to press propellants into the ablatively cooled combustion chamber. Thrust control is by partially closing the electromechanical propellant valves. Pitch and yaw control can thus be achieved by differential throttling. In principle this is extremely reliable and cheap in mass production.|$|E

The products that were prepared with <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and AG under different pHs were analyzed by ESI-MS, 13 C NMR, and FT-IR. It was found that the medium environment had great effects on the competition of the co-condensation reaction between <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and AG and self-condensation reaction of <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> molecules in the mixing system with <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and AG. Under alkaline conditions, both co- and self-condensation were not obviously detected. Only when the value of pH was higher than 11, were a few co-condensation reaction products gotten. The reaction occurred mainly between <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and the primary amido groups of AG. Under acid conditions, both co- and self-condensation were observed. The more acid the preparation conditions were, the easier to be observed the self-condensation of <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> molecules would be than the co-condensation between <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and AG. When the value of pH was higher than 5, both co- and self-condensation were not outstanding. In this study, under pH 3, the co- and self-condensation found equilibrium.

40|$|The furfurylation {{process is}} an {{extensively}} investigated wood modification process. <b>Furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> molecules penetrate {{into the wood}} cell wall and polymerize in situ. This results in a permanent swelling of the wood cell walls. It is unclear whether or not chemical bonds exist between the <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> polymer and the wood. In the present study, five different wood species were used, both hardwoods and softwoods. They were treated with three different furfurylation procedures and leached according to three different leaching methods. The present study shows that, in general, the leachates from furfurylated wood have low toxicity. It also shows that the choice of leaching method is decisive for {{the outcome of the}} toxicity results. Earlier studies have shown that leachates from wood treated with <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> prepolymers have higher toxicity to Vibrio fischeri than leachates from wood treated with <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> monomers. This is probably attributable to differences in leaching of chemical compounds. The present study shows that this difference in the toxicity most likely cannot be attributed to maleic acid, furan, furfural, <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> or 2 -furoic acid. However, the difference might be caused by the two substances 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural and 2, 5 -furandimethanol. The present study found no difference in the amount of leached <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> between leachates from furfurylated softwood and furfurylated hardwood species. Earlier studies have indicated differences in grafting of <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to lignin. However, nothing was found in the present study that could support this. The leachates of furfurylated wood still need to be investigated further to identify the chemical differences between wood furfurylated with <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> monomers and <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> prepolymers...|$|E
40|$|In beer, the {{development}} of a solvent-like stale flavor is associated with the formation of furfuryl ethyl ether. The synthesis rate of this important flavor compound is proportional to the concentration of <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> in beer. This study shows that <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> in beer is mainly formed by Maillard reactions initiated during wort boiling and malt production. A mechanism for its formation from alpha-(1, 4) -oligoglucans and amino acids in wort and beer is proposed. During wort boiling, a quadratic relationship was found between the wort extract concentration, on the one hand, and the increase of <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and furfural, on the other. The reduction of furfural by yeast during fermentation further increases the <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> content. In pale beers, the <b>furfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration is essentially determined by the thermal load on wort during brewing operations.
