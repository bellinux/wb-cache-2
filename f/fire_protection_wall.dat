5000|$|The {{house at}} Bonngasse 20 (formerly: 515) {{featuring}} a baroque stone facade was erected around 1700 on an older cellar vault. It {{is one of}} the few remaining middle-class houses from the era of the prince elector. Back then it was in the neighbourhood preferred by the employees of the courts, in the heart of the town between the castle, the town hall with the market square and the banks of the Rhine River. Today, this is a pedestrian precinct with the Bonn Beethoven Hall and the opera close by. In the first half of the 19th century an additional, somewhat smaller, timbered house was built on the property behind the house. Five families temporarily lived in the multi-storey front and back buildings. Three tailors and one shoemaker also had their shops here. In 1836 the entrance door was widened and replaced with a gate entrance. After the back part of the house was identified as Beethoven's birthplace around 1840 by Beethoven's friend Franz Gerhard Wegeler, a physician, and Carl Moritz Kneisel, a teacher, the new owner opened a restaurant on the ground floor in 1873 with the name Beethoven’s Geburtshaus (Beethoven's birthplace). A beer and concert hall was added in the yard in 1887. In 1888 a grocery merchant bought the house but sold it just one year later. Thanks to the Beethoven Haus association, founded in 1889 to preserve the house, it was spared from demolition. The following years were characterised by renovation and remodelling works to turn the house into a memorial site. Back then, major parts of the building were still as they had been in the second half of the 18th century. In order to preserve spacious museum rooms, the floor plans of the main house were changed and an office for the association, plus a library and a flat for the janitor were installed. Construction changes in Beethoven's flat were limited to the stairs and the passageways to the front building. The inner yard was decorated with trellises and sandstone slabs, and a garden replaced the place where the beer hall had been. It has not been remodelled since. In order to preserve the character of Beethoven's birthplace in its contemporary environment and to protect the building, the association bought the neighbouring house number 22 in 1893. After installing a <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> <b>wall,</b> the building was sold again. In 1907 house number 18 [...] "Im Mohren" [...] was bought to extend the property. At first it was used as an apartment building. In 1927 the newly founded Beethoven archive moved in. In the mid-1930s both houses were extensively renovated. The Beethoven-Haus survived both World Wars almost unscathed. In the Second World War, Senior Building Officer Theodor Wildemann, later serving as the association's chairman, in his role as Deputy Provincial Curator, made sure that the collection was brought to an underground shelter near Siegen (Sauerland), thereby avoiding any war-related losses or damages. During the air raid of the Bonn city centre on 18 October 1944, a fire bomb fell on the roof of Beethoven's birthplace. Thanks to the help of janitor Heinrich Hasselbach and Wildemans, who were later awarded the German Federal Cross of Merit, as well as Dr. Franz Rademacher from the Rhenish National Museum, the bomb did not ignite a disaster. The damages were repaired in the early 1950s. In the late 1960s, the third renovation took place. For the fourth, basic renovation of the buildings from 1994 to 1996 the Beethoven-Haus was awarded the Europa Nostra award for cultural heritage (awarded since 1978) in 1998 as the first institution in Germany.|$|E

This work {{represents}} {{further development}} of earlier received results of simulation of water curtains used as <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> <b>walls.</b> Subject of the theoretical analysis is the flat fan sprays which flow from the slot-hole sprinkler. The central objective {{of the study is}} to develop calculation method of one of the main parameters of this mathematical model. It is such parameter as the equivalent diameter of droplets of the sprayed water stream. Earlier there was no such calculation procedure, and determination of this parameter was made by means of the difficult experimental measurements. Approach. In this study earlier published literary data are applied to calculation of this parameter. The formula received in the work allows carrying out calculation of called parameter on the basis of design characteristics of drencher installation. The graphic dependences constructed on the formula allowed defining dependence of the equivalent diameter of droplets of the sprayed stream on technical parameters. Findings. Application of this formula to earlier developed mathematical model of thermal shielding allowed expanding its opportunities for practical use. This model can be used for designing of water curtains of fire-prevention appointment, and also for definition of optimum modes of their operation. ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????????????? ????????????? ??????? ????? ???????????????? ??????????. ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ????? ??????????? ????, ??????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????????. ???????? ????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ????? ??????????? ????. ????? ??????????? ????? ????????? ???? ???????? ???? ? ??????? ??????? ????????????????? ?????????. ? ?????? ?????? ??? ??? ??????? ????????? ????? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????. ???????, ?????????? ? ??????, ????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????. ??????????? ???????????, ?????????? ? ??????? ???????, ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ??????????. ?????????? ??????? ? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ?? ??????????? ??? ????????????? ??????????. ?????? ????? ?????????????? ??? ?????????????? ??????? ????? ???????????????? ??????????, ? ????? ??? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ?? ??????????...|$|R

The central objective {{of the study is}} theoretical research of processes of droplets convective heating and their evaporation in heated air near the fire seat and their influence on the shielding properties of a fire-fighting water curtain. Approach. In this study the earlier published literary data are applied to fulfill the calculations. The calculated formula allowed to have received numerical results for graphic dependence of droplet equilibrium temperature on air temperature. Other calculated formulae allowed to have executed calculations of the droplet evaporation time and of the time of droplet flight along an axis of a water curtain. According to the executed calculations, for typical parameters of water curtain the droplets heating and their evaporation owing to heat convection with hot air have no significant effect on the shielding properties of fire-fighting water curtain. Findings. Application of this formula to earlier developed mathematical model of thermal shielding allowed expanding its opportunities for practical use.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{several major}} fires {{occurred}} in high-rise buildings involving rapid fire spread upon the exterior walls and facades, and caused severe damage and loss. The {{extensive use of}} combustible insulation materials without proper <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> and barriers were believed {{to contribute to the}} uncontrollable fire spread in the high-rise buildings. This paper reviews the current code and standard environment regulating the fire safety of exterior wall claddings in China. Three high-rise building fire cases involving rapid exterior wall fire spread are also discussed by analyzing the fire causes, propagation mechanisms and problems. The recent research progress and regulation development on the <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> of exterior <b>wall</b> claddings are also presented. It was suggested that limiting the combustibility of insulation materials used in the exterior wall cladding associated with building heights, as well as proper <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> and barriers would provide acceptable fire safety performance of exterior wall claddings in high-rise buildings. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Children’s need of {{assistance}} during {{the evacuation of}} a preschool is taken for granted when planning for fire safety. This calls for comprehensive technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> mesures. The aim of this report is to examine child behavior in a situation requiring evacuation and it’s implications for organizational and technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> To answer this question three areas of focus have been established; technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> at preschools and child behavior during evacuation. Technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> has been investigated according to the written rules and recommendations. The organization of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> has been investigated at four preschools according to Brandkompetensutvecklingsschema, BUS, which describes the level of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> awareness of an organization. Child behavior during an evacuation has been examined through studies of relevant literature. Two studies of evacuation, one from Denmark and one from Russia, that consider child behavior are referred to. In Sweden the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is planned according to laws and regulations, among other Plan och Bygglagen and Boverkets byggregler for which preschools place specific requirements. The most significant difference in planning of building <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> at a preschool {{is that it is}} assumed the children need help during evacuation. The organization of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is regulated by the Law Lagen om skydd mot olyckor, that requires preschools to work systematically with <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> and have sufficient documentation ensuring that reasonable <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> measures are taken and maintained in a functional state. Child behavior during evacuation differs from that of adults in movement patterns, speed of gait, preparation time and need for physical and verbal help. In three of the BUS-evaluated preschools we saw {{that when it comes to}} systematic work for <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> the technical aspects are in focus and some anxiety was registered about conducting evacuation exercises with the children. One preschool indicated a very developed level of organization regarding <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> This preschool regularly conducted evacuation exercises and responded positively. There are many things to take into account when planning for a preschool build. How child behavior differs from adult behavior needs to be considered in both the technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> The contractor needs to understand the importance organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> and the user of the building needs to understand how the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is intended to work. It is also important for the building user to prioritize correctly; the user should not only focus on the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> measures but also must understand the importance of systematic fire preventive actions.
