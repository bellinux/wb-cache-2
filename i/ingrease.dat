6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - I {{received}} {{your letter}} with delight; {{it was the}} first word that reached me from the old country. I am in good health now; I have been pretty seedy, for I was exhausted by the journey and anxiety below even my point of keeping up; I am still a little weak, but that is all; I begin to <b>ingrease,</b> it seems already. My book is about half drafted: the AMATEUR EMIGRANT, that is. Can you find a better name? I believe it will be more popular than any of my others; the canvas is so much more popular and larger too. Fancy, it is my fourth. That voluminous writer. [...] I was vexed to hear about the last chapter of 'The Lie,' and pleased to hear about the rest; it would have been odd if it had no birthmark, born where and how it was. It should by rights have been called the DEVONIA, for that is the habit with all children born in a steerage.|$|E

Sports Physiol., Vol. 10, No. 4 pp. 101 - 106, 2004. If the step {{frequency}} during runnning affects {{the functions of}} the thoracic pump dependent on the upper limb movements and the muscle pimp dependent on the upper limb movements and the muscle pump dependent on the lower limb movements, it can be hypothesized that changes in the step frequency have some relations with not only the efficiency of gas exchange but also the blood-borne gas transport. This study was carried out {{to examine the relationship between}} changes in the step frequency associated with <b>ingreases</b> in the running speed on a treadmill and ventilation threshold(VT), or the oxygen kinetics. The subjects were 6 male short-distance runners. The experiment was performed on a treadmill by the incremental loading method, and the step frequency, stride, expired gas concentrations, and fingertip arterial blood percent oxygen saturaiton recorded continuously. The experiment demonstrated the presence of a changing point in the step frequency, positive correlations of the stride with oxygen uotake (VO 2) and CO 2 excretion (VCO 2), and negative exponential relationships of the step grequency with VO 2 and VCO 2. According to the regression equation, the stride and the step frequency at the appearance of VT were 121. 1 cm and 171. 2 steps/min, respectively. The fingertip arterial blood percent oxygen saturation decreased immediately after the appearance of VT. The changing point of step frequency, the appearance fo VT, and the beginning of the decrease in the oxygen concentration were found to be nearly concurrent. These results suggest that a rapid increase in the step frequency is related to VT, that this relationship is based on the actions of the muscle pump and thoracic pump, which regulate the rates of Os supply and COs discharge, and that physiologic consistency of these functions results in the change in the step frequency...|$|R

To {{examine the}} activity-dependent {{plasticity}} of motoneuron function, male adult rats {{were divided into}} a control (CTL) froup(n= 17) and a denervation group(n= 17) that had been subjected to unilateral phrenicotomy 4 weeks previously. Electrophysiological mambrane properties (resting potential (mV), rheobase (nA) and input resistance (Mohm)) of the contralateral compensatory activated (CAC) phrenic motoneurons were measured. As compared to the CTL hemidiaphrabm, the CAC hemidiaphragm showed increases in electrical activity by 51 % one minute after the denervation, and <b>ingreases</b> in succinate dehydrogenase activity by 31 % {{at the end of}} experiment. There were significant inverse relationships between the rheobase and input resistance of motoneurons in the both groups (r=- 0, 48, - 0. 62). Mean value of the rheobase in non-recruited motoneurons was significantly higher than that in recruited motoneurons in the both groups. Most of the motoneurons wiht low rheobase (< 5 nA) were recruited in the CAC, but not in the CTL motoneurons. As the results, the incidence of recruited motoneuron in the CAC (69 %) was higher than that in the CTL motoneurons (48 %). Mean interval of action potentials of the recruited motoneuron was identical between the CAC (38 ms) and CTL (39 ms) motoneurons. We concluded that a main strategy of the phrenic motoneurons to the CAC induced by contralateral phrenicotomy was additional recruitment of motoneurons with low rheobase...|$|R

Sports Physiol., Vol. 11, No. 1 pp. 15 - 20, 2005. Skeletal {{muscle is}} highly adaptable, capable of {{undergoing}} {{changes in its}} structural and functional priperties with physiological stimuli. There is growing evidence that endurance exercise training can promote numerous adaptations in skeletal muscle, including changes {{in the composition of}} myosin heavy chain (MHC) and in fiber oxidative capacity those are better suited for prolonged muscke activation. However, fes studies have been undertaken on skeletal muscle adaptations with endurance exercise training using mice. In this study, we investigated the effects of differntial endurance exercise training on skeletal muscle fiber type in mice. Litters of male ddy mice were randomly divided into either an exercised group or a non-exercised control group. The endurance exercise training consiseted of treadmill running sessions of differential intensities (15, 20 and 25 m 2 ̆ 7 min - 1) and durations (30, 60 and 90 min･day- 1) for four weeks, everyday. The MHC composition and citrate synthase (CS) activity of the soleus (Sol), plantaris (Pla) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles ere analyzed. After for weeks of training, an increase in MHCHa+d/x and decrease in MHCHb were observed in the TA muscle. CS activity also <b>ingreased</b> in the Pla and TA muscles. In the Sol muscle, we could not observe meaningful change in MHC composistion and CS activity. These results suggest that, in mice, endurance exercise can induce the transformation of skeletal muscle phenotype in the Pla and TA muscles from fast to intermediate profile...|$|R

To {{determine}} the influence of rowing exercise on serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles, forty-one collegiate male rowers were compared with thitry-one sedentary men. Compared with sedentary men, make rowers were taller (P< 0. 01), heabier (P< 0. 001), had higher body mass index(BMI) (P< 0. 05), and a larger proportion of lean body mass (LBM 9 (P< 0. 001). However, the rowers had a similar percentage of body fat as that of sedentary men (11 ± 4 vs. 13 ± 5 %, mean±SD). Male rowers higher maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max 61 ± 4 ml-kg- 1 ･min- 1) and leg extension power (33. 7 ± 5 W-kg- 1) than sedentary men (48 ± 6 mi-kg- 1 ･min- 1, 25 ± 6 W･kg- 1, P< 0. 001, respectively). The blood cariables were within the normal range, except for an elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPS) in make rowers. Male rowers had lower total cholesterol (TC 3. 95 ± 0. 62 vs. 4. 77 ± 0. 64 mmol･L- 1, P< 0. 001), low-density lopoprotein cholesterlo (LDLC 2. 01 ± 0. 51 vs. 2. 85 ± 0. 59 mmol･L- 1, P< 0. 001) and the ratio of LDLC to high-density lopoprotein choklesterol (HDLC) (1. 41 ± 0. 48 vs. 2. 00 ± 0. 56 unit, P< 0. 001) than sedentary men. There was similar HDLC levels between the rowers and sedentary men (1. 49 ± 0. 31 vs. 1. 47 ± 0. 22 mmol･L- 1). Thus, the findings of the current cross-sectional study suggest the possibility that regularly performed rowing exercise, which <b>ingreases</b> both VO 2 max and LBM, may induce a favorable reducion of serum LDLC in men...|$|R

Sports Physiol, Vol. 6, No. 1 pp. 1 - 6, 2000. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} 1) whether footstrike impacts induce hemolysis, and 2) whether runner 2 ̆ 7 s erythricytes are more fragile than those of sedentary subjects. Eight female distance runners and 8 sedentary subjects performed treadmill-running and ergometer-cycring of simillar exercise intensity for 20 minutes. Mcan heart rate, as an index of exercise intensity, was adjusted for both groups in each exercise. Blood samples were drawn just before, immediately after (within 1 minute) and 1 hour after excrcise, and hematological parameters (while blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (Hb). hematocrit (Ht), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platclct count (PLT)) and serum haptoglobin concentration (Hp) were measured. WBC, RBC, Hb, Ht and PLT increased immediately after exercise, but they returned to the initial values 1 hour later. The resting level of Hp in runners was significantly lower than that in seduntary subjects (p< 0. 05). Hp <b>ingreased</b> significantly immediately after ergometer-cycling in both groups (p< 0. 05), and it decreased significantly below the initial level 1 hour after treadmill-running (p< 0. 05) in both groups, whereas it returned to the initial level 1 hour after ergometer-cycling in both groups. Since WBC, RBC, Hb, Ht and PLT increased immediately after exercise decreased signigicantly in both groups (p< 0. 05). When Hp was corrected by plasma volume change, the apparent increase in Hp immediately after exercise was not observed any more. Although Hp of runners was lower than that of sedentary subjects, changes in Hp by eiercise were quite similar in the two groups. From these results, it may be concluded that 1) footstrike impacts seem to cause intravascular hemolysis, and 2) the fragility of runner 2 ̆ 7 s erythrocytes does nto seem to be increased...|$|R
