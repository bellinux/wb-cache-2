50|$|A study {{incorporating}} comparative target prediction {{and subsequent}} experimental verification of selected predictions, suggests that FnrS {{might be a}} more global regulator in Escherichia coli. It is predicted to control several transcription factors. These include the verified targets marA and IscR.

40|$|Short Abstract — The {{composition}} of bacteria varies greatly for different bacterial growth rates. Therefore {{significant changes in}} gene expression are expected to arise “passively” from changes in growth rate alone. We performed a joint theoretical/experimental study for E. coli to obtain a quantitative understanding of these effects.

We have assayed {{each of the}} individual DNaseI hypersensitive regions present in the full 15 kb DCR for position independence and copy number dependence of a linked beta-globin gene in transgenic mice. The results show that {{at least three of}} the individual DNaseI hypersensitive site regions (sites 1, 2 and 3), though expressing at lower levels than the full DCR, are capable of position independent, copy number <b>dependent</b> <b>expression.</b> Site 2 alone directs the highest level of expression of the single site constructs, producing nearly 70 % of the level of the full DCR. Sites 1 and 3 each provide 30 % of the full activity. Deletion of either site 2 or 3 from the complete set significantly reduces the level of expression, but does not effect position independence or copy number dependence. This demonstrates that sites 2 and 3 are required for full expression and suggests that all the sites are required for the full expression of even a single gene from this multigene locus...|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of fish as model systems is still limited by the mosaic distribution of cells transiently expressing transgenes leading to a low frequency of transgenic fish. Here we present a strategy that overcomes this problem. Transgenes of interest were flanked by two I-SceI meganuclease recognition sites, and co-injected together with the I-SceI meganuclease enzyme into medaka embryos (Oryzias latipes) at the one-cell stage. First, the promoter <b>dependent</b> <b>expression</b> was strongly enhanced. Already in F 0, 76 % of the embryos exhibited uniform promoter <b>dependent</b> <b>expression</b> compared to 26 % when injections were performed without meganuclease. Second, the transgenesis frequency was raised to 30. 5 %. Even more striking was {{the increase in the}} germline transmission rate. Whereas in standard protocols it does not exceed a few percent, the number of transgenic F 1 offspring of an identified founder fish reached the optimum of 50 % in most lines resulting from meganuclease co-injection. Southern blot analysis showed that the individual integration loci contain only one or few copies of the transgene in tandem. At a lower rate this method also leads to enhancer trapping effects, novel patterns that are likely due to the integration of the transgene in the vicinity of enhancer elements. Meganuclease co-injection thus provides a simple and highly efficient tool to improve transgenesis by microinjection...|$|E

Using the standard procedure, we derive the time evolution equations for the additional variables. These equations are used to obtain general wave vector and frequency <b>dependent</b> <b>expressions</b> for measurable properties of the system.

40|$|After {{presenting}} Kripke’s criticism to Frege’s {{ideas on}} context dependence of thoughts, I present two recent attempts of considering cognitive aspects of context <b>dependent</b> <b>expressions</b> inside a truth conditional pragmatics or semantics: Recanati’s non-descriptive modes of presentation (MOPs) and Kaplan’s ways of {{having in mind}} (WHIMs). After analysing the two attempts and verifying which answers they should give to the problem discussed by Kripke, I suggest a possible interpretation of these attempts: to insert a procedural or algorithmic level in semantic representations of indexicals. That a function may be computed by different procedures might suggest new possibilities of integrating contextual cognitive aspects in model theoretic semantics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Proteins {{of human}} and animal viruses are {{frequently}} expressed from RNA polymerase II <b>dependent</b> <b>expression</b> cassettes to study protein function and to develop gene-based vaccines. Initial attempts to express the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by eukaryotic promoters revealed restrictions at several steps of gene expression. Results Insertion of an intron flanked by exonic sequences 5 '-terminal to the open reading frames (ORF) of VSV-G and RSV-F led to detectable cytoplasmic mRNA levels of both genes. While the exonic sequences were sufficient to stabilise the VSV-G mRNA, cytoplasmic mRNA levels of RSV-F were dependent {{on the presence of}} a functional intron. Cytoplasmic VSV-G mRNA levels led to readily detectable levels of VSV-G protein, whereas RSV-F protein expression remained undetectable. However, RSV-F expression was observed after mutating two of four consensus sites for polyadenylation present in the RSV-F ORF. Expression levels could be further enhanced by codon optimisation. Conclusion Insufficient cytoplasmic mRNA levels and premature polyadenylation prevent expression of RSV-F by RNA polymerase II <b>dependent</b> <b>expression</b> plasmids. Since RSV replicates in the cytoplasm, the presence of premature polyadenylation sites and elements leading to nuclear instability should not interfere with RSV-F expression during virus replication. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the destabilisation of the RSV-F and VSV-G mRNAs and the different requirements for their rescue by insertion of an intron remain to be defined. </p...|$|E

Symbolic computations with simple, non-nested, radicals is relatively straightforward; however, when the radicals are nested the problem becomes more difficult, This paper presents an algorithm for determining a linearly independent basis for a set of radicals (nested or not). This allows elementary techniques to be used for arithmetic operations on expressions involving elements of this set. In addition we provide a structure theorem that provides a sufficient condition for a nested radical to be expressed in terms of radicals of lower nesting level. These two techniques are powerful tools for computations involving radicals...|$|R
