25|$|Kidney {{transplantation}} is a life-extending procedure. The typical {{patient will}} live 10 to 15 years longer with a kidney transplant than if kept on dialysis. The increase in longevity is greater for younger patients, but even 75-year-old recipients (the oldest group {{for which there}} is data) gain an average four more years of life. People generally have more energy, a less restricted diet, and fewer complications with a kidney transplant than <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stay</b> on conventional dialysis.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} battle, Henry {{acts as the}} flag-bearer after the color {{sergeant}} falls. A line of Confederates hidden behind a fence beyond a clearing shoots with impunity at Henry's regiment, which is ill-covered in the tree-line. Facing withering fire <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stay</b> and disgrace if they retreat, the officers order a charge. Unarmed, Henry leads the men while entirely escaping injury. Most of the Confederates run before the regiment arrives, and four of the remaining men are taken prisoner. The novel closes with the following passage: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, {{also known as}} The Place of No Stars. The spirits of cats who cause great pain and suffering to others during their lives reside there {{in order to pay}} for their sins. As the name suggests, it {{takes the form of a}} never-ending forest, forcing its residents to forever walk alone. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they later learn how to walk in the dreams of living cats. [...] Like StarClan cats, Dark Forest residents will fade away if they are forgotten, or killed in battle. A unique aspect is that if a living cat dies whilst visiting the Dark Forest in their dreams, they will automatically become a spirit of the Dark Forest themselves. In addition, it is possible for StarClan cats to become lost within the forest <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stay</b> there for too long, hence why the majority avoid it.|$|E

60|$|Half an hour later, Cyril {{was told}} what the doctor's advice had been, and, seeing {{that he was}} bent on it, and that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>they</b> would do him more harm than good, they {{resolved}} to start the next day for Gloucestershire.|$|R
500|$|Seven {{years after}} the {{outbreak}} began, a conference is held {{off the coast of}} Honolulu, aboard the , where most of the world's leaders argue that they can outlast the zombie plague <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stay</b> in their safe zones. The U.S. President, however, argues for going on the offensive. Determined to lead by example, the U.S. military reinvents itself to meet the specific strategic requirements of fighting the undead: using semi-automatic, high-power rifles and volley firing, focusing on head shots and slow, steady rates of fire (a tactic [...] "re-invented" [...] by the Indian Army during the Great Panic); and devising a multipurpose hand tool, the [...] "Lobotomizer" [...] or [...] "Lobo" [...] (described as a combination of a shovel and a battle axe), for close-quarters combat. The military, backed by a resurgent U.S. wartime economy, begins the three-year-long process of retaking the contiguous United States from both the undead as well as groups of hostile human survivors. Prewar military tactics and equipment are mentioned as being employed to deal with sometimes well-armed and organized human opposition.|$|E
500|$|Blaine and Kurt's {{relationship}} has been generally well received.

Guess I may have to like him now." [...] Their first kiss, in the episode [...] "Original Song", was met with critical acclaim. Mark Perigard of The Boston Herald wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It's long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story." [...] Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly was so impressed with the scene that she was initially concerned it may be a dream sequence, [...] "because we don't get romantic, unapologetic first kisses like that between young gay characters on network TV." [...] She wrote, [...] "Relationships aren't easy. They’ll make mistakes. But <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stay</b> true to themselves, and continue to be as open and honest with each other, we're in for something special." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Blaine and Kurt.

5000|$|While General Musharraf {{was finding}} this couple's {{determination}} to get justice increasingly irritating, according to Dr. Shazia and her husband, the authorities ordered {{to leave the}} country, and warned that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stayed,</b> <b>they</b> would be killed - by government [...] "agencies" [...] - {{and that no one}} would even find their bodies.|$|R
2500|$|The McLaren team told Berger to let Senna {{through and}} thus protect {{him with the}} promise that Senna will let him back ahead on the last lap <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stay</b> 1–2. [...] There were no changes after the stops and the order stayed as: Senna, Berger, Patrese, Prost, Martini and Schumacher. At the front, Senna and Berger traded fastest laps. On lap 29, well behind Schumacher passed Martini for fifth. However, his engine failed on lap 35, giving the place back to Martini. Martini only held it for five more laps before his clutch failed, forcing him to retire.|$|E

50|$|The {{fire brigade}} very soon {{realized}} {{the threat to}} these 23,000 trapped people - the fire was growing ever hotter, and the oxygen in the bunkers and shelters thereby ever thinner. The danger was clearly that the victims would either suffocate for lack of oxygen <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> in the bunkers, or be burnt alive <b>if</b> <b>they</b> tried to leave and escape through the firestorm outside.|$|R
50|$|In summer 2008, Zayatte had trials with Everton and Newcastle United, {{before joining}} Hull City on a season-long loan on 31 August.

60|$|The men replied audaciously, {{they should}} be starved <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> here, for <b>they</b> could not work, and would not work; and they could but be starved abroad; and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were murdered, there was an end of them, they had no wives or {{children}} to cry after them; and, in short, insisted importunately upon their demand, declaring that they would go, whether they would give them any arms or no.|$|R
5000|$|Tug of war: All {{six members}} of the first team competed against American Gladiator Hawk, with a tank full of green [...] "gunk" [...] set up at the center point.

"I expect {{they really}} gave up all idea of {{carrying}} our position long ago," [...] Chris said, [...] "and {{have only been}} keeping up their fire to prevent our turning the tables upon them.
