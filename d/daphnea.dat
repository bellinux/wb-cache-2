50|$|Antioch at Daphne, a small place, 40 stadia from Antioch, {{where there}} was a large sacred grove watered by many fountains. The festival was {{originally}} called <b>Daphnea,</b> and was sacred to Apollo and Artemis, but was called Olympia, after the inhabitants of Antioch had purchased from the Eleans, in 44 AD, the privilege of celebrating Olympic games. It was not, however, regularly celebrated as an Olympic festival until the time of the emperor Commodus. It commenced {{on the first day of}} the month Hyperberetaeus, with which the year of Antioch began. It was under the presidency of an Alytarches. The celebration of it was abolished by Justin I, 521 AD. The writings of Libanius, and of Chrysostom, the Christian Father, who lived many years at Antioch, gave various particulars respecting this festival.|$|E
50|$|Relicanthus <b>daphneae</b> (formerly Boloceroides <b>daphneae)</b> is a {{cnidarian}} {{resembling a}} sea anemone, which {{occurs in the}} depths of the East Pacific Rise and was described in 2006. The genus Relicanthus is monotypic.|$|R
50|$|The anemone-like Relicanthus <b>daphneae</b> was {{classified}} as incerti ordinis within this class in May 2014.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most recent}} authors, who {{recognize}} 4 subfamilies, B.E. Herber has divided Thymelaeaceae into 2 subfamilies. He has retained the subfamily Gonostyloideae, but renamed it Octolepidoideae. The other 3 traditional subfamilies (Synandrodaphnoideae, Aquilarioideae, and Thymelaeoideae) were combined into a Thymelaeoideae s.l.(sensu lato), and reduced to tribal rank, as Synandrodaphneae, Aquilarieae, and <b>Daphneae,</b> respectively. No tribes were designated in subfamily Octolepidoideae, {{but it was}} provisionally divided into 2 informal groups, the Octolepis group and the Gonystylus group. Likewise, no subtribes were designated in the tribe <b>Daphneae,</b> but it was informally divided into 4 groups: the Linostoma group, the Daphne group, the Phaleria group, and the Gnidia group. The 45 genera recognized by Herber are grouped as follows. Three genera in <b>Daphneae</b> were placed incertae sedis (not assigned to any particular group or in a separate group by themselves).|$|R
5000|$|R. <b>daphneae</b> was {{described}} in 2006 and initially assigned to the genus Boloceroides (family Boloceroididae). The other species of the genus Boloceroides, however, are rather small and occur on warm seashores. A phylogenetic study from 2014 however, in which two genes of mitochondrial DNA and three genes from the nucleus of over a hundred different sea anemones were compared, showed that the species is not a sea anemone, but belongs in a new order. For the type therefore a new genus was named: Relicanthus (from Latin relictum; [...] "covered", [...] "stored", [...] "left") in the new family Relicanthidae, the sister group of the Zoanthidea, which allows for the possible discovery of additional species. The specific name <b>daphneae</b> is after Daphne Gail Fautin, [...] "in honor of her contributions to actinarian systematics." ...|$|R
50|$|Daphne Gail Fautin is an American {{professor}} of invertebrate zoology at the University of Kansas, specializing in sea anemones and symbiosis. She is world-renowned for her extensive work studying and classifying sea anemones and related species. A large sea anemone-like cnidarian species {{has been named}} in her honor, originally called Boloceroides <b>daphneae,</b> but recently renamed to Relicanthus <b>daphneae,</b> after it was discovered (using DNA-based identification techniques) {{to belong to a}} previously unknown cnidarian order. Fautin has published numerous scientific articles and texts—including co-authoring Encyclopædia Britannica's entry on cnidarians—and her publications have been widely cited by other researchers in the field. Among her current positions, she is the curator of the University of Kansas Natural History Museum and serves as vice president and commissioner of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, overseeing the naming of new species.|$|R
50|$|R. <b>daphneae</b> has a pink-colored {{cylindrical}} body capable of reaching a metre across, with long, thin, whitish tentacles {{up to two}} meters in length. The body is divided into 24 septa. The muscles of the mesenteries are less developed. The spirocysts, which are stinging cells in which the stinging tube is spirally rolled up and which are covered with adhesive threads instead of spines, are significantly larger than those of any other deep-sea species and among the largest of all cnidarians.|$|R
40|$|Sea anemones (order Actiniaria) {{are among}} the most diverse and {{successful}} members of the anthozoan subclass Hexacorallia, occupying benthic marine habitats across all depths and latitudes. Actiniaria comprises approximately 1, 200 species of solitary and skeleton-less polyps and lacks any anatomical synapomorphy. Although monophyly is anticipated based on higher-level molecular phylogenies of Cnidaria, to date, monophyly has not been explicitly tested and at least some hypotheses on the diversification of Hexacorallia have suggested that actiniarians are para- or poly-phyletic. Published phylogenies have demonstrated the inadequacy of existing morphological-based classifications within Actiniaria. Superfamilial groups and most families and genera that have been rigorously studied are not monophyletic, indicating conflict with the current hierarchical classification. We test the monophyly of Actiniaria using two nuclear and three mitochondrial genes with multiple analytical methods. These analyses are the first to include representatives of all three currently-recognized suborders within Actiniaria. We do not recover Actiniaria as a monophyletic clade: the deep-sea anemone Boloceroides <b>daphneae,</b> previously included within the infraorder Boloceroidaria, is resolved outside of Actiniaria in several of the analyses. We erect a new genus and family for B. <b>daphneae,</b> and rank this taxon incerti ordinis. Based on our comprehensive phylogeny, we propose a new formal higher-level classification for Actiniaria composed of only two suborders, Anenthemonae and Enthemonae. Suborder Anenthemonae includes actiniarians with a unique arrangement of mesenteries (members of Edwardsiidae and former suborder Endocoelantheae). Suborder Enthemonae includes actiniarians with the typical arrangement of mesenteries for actiniarians (members of former suborders Protantheae, Ptychodacteae, and Nynantheae and subgroups therein). We also erect subgroups within these two newly-erected suborders. Although some relationships among these newly-defined groups are still ambiguous, morphological and molecular results are consistent enough to proceed with a new higher-level classification and to discuss the putative functional and evolutionary significance of several morphological attributes within Actiniaria...|$|R
60|$|The Dingpun {{paid his}} respects {{to us in}} the morning, wearing, besides his green cloak, a white cap with a green glass button, {{denoting}} his rank; he informed us that he had written to his superior officer at Kambajong, explaining his motives for conducting us across the frontier, and he drew from his breast a long letter, written on Daphne* [Most of the paper used in Tibet is, as I have elsewhere noticed, made from the bark of various species of <b>Daphneae,</b> and especially of Edgeworthia Gardneri, and is imported from Nepal and Bhotan; but the Tibetans, as MM. Huc and Gabet correctly state, manufacture a paper from the root of a small shrub: this I have seen, and it is of a much thicker texture and more durable than Daphne paper. Dr. Thomson informs me that a species of Astragalus is used in western Tibet for this purpose, the whole shrub, which is dwarf, being reduced to pulp.] paper, whose ends were tied with floss silk, with a large red seal; this he pompously delivered, with whispered orders, to an attendant, and sent him off. He admired our clothes extremely,* [All Tibetans admire sad value English broad-cloth beyond any of our products. Woollen articles are very familiar to them, and warm clothing {{is one of the first}} requisites of life.] and then my percussion gun, the first he had seen; but above all he admired rum and water, which he drank with intense relish, leaving a mere sip for his comrades at the bottom of his little wooden cup, which they emptied, and afterwards licked clean, and replaced in his breast for him. We made a large basin full of very weak grog for his party, who were all friendly and polite; and having made us the unexpected offer of allowing us to rest ourselves for the day at Yeumtso, he left us, and practised his men at firing at a mark, but they were very indifferent shots.|$|R
