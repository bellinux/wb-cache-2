5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, all twelve T2000 {{units were}} taken out of service, before {{the last of the}} much older T1300. Kollektivtransportproduksjon, the {{successor}} of Oslo Sporveier, stated that procuring spare parts was becoming nearly impossible and that the small size of the series forced <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs. The initial orders for MX3000 trains did not call for sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so they can run for 15 more years at NOK50 million. Alternatively, the city council has been recommended by Kollektivtransportproduksjon to purchase 15 new MX3000 three-car trains for NOK250 million.|$|E

They report that low floor trams have 15% <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{costs for the}} rolling stock, and 20% <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs for the infrastructure on average. Among the problems observed is that the missing bogies result in {{a higher level of}} wear and tear.|$|R

40|$|The {{maintenance}} costs of 137 residential rental properties in northwestern South Carolina are analyzed. The {{results show that}} maintenance cost per square foot increases with property age, tenant turnover, certain amenities, and for higher-rent properties. Compared to other property types, apartments exhibit <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs per square foot with larger complexes showing lower per square foot {{maintenance costs}} than smaller complexes. This cost economy suggests added value to rental housing for larger complexes. Owners of multiple properties are found to pay <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs. Finally, there is no observed relationship between absentee ownership {{and the level of}} property maintenance. ...|$|R
5|$|One of the {{helicopters}} {{was bought by}} Widerøe in December 1976 and the operations were subcontracted to Offshore Helicopters. The second Sikorsky was bought from Helilift in March 1978 and also operated by Offshore Helicopters. Helikopter Service merged with Offshore Helicopters in 1980, and the new Helikopter Service took over the route. They introduced an eleven-seat Bell 212 helicopters from 1 January 1982 because of the <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs of the S-58Ts. In 1982 the service to both islands handled 7,145 passengers and three tonnes of post and cargo, and made 744 landings. It received subsidies for NOK4 million.|$|E
5|$|The two {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} to UP in April 1939, and they completed test runs {{and participated in}} a variety of publicity events for the railroad, including the grand opening of the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, the world premier of Cecil B. DeMille's film Union Pacific, and even an inspection by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the locomotives displayed excellent acceleration and an ability to maintain schedules better than conventional steam locomotives, they also demonstrated serious reliability problems and relatively <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs; they never entered regular revenue service.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the city}} council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains {{to be the main}} mode of {{transport}} to Holmenkollen Ski Jump during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. This will allow 9,000people per hour to be transported to the sports venue. The first T1000 was scrapped on 14 March 2007, and the last T1000 train was run on 19 July 2009. Oslo Tramway Museum has preserved six T1000 cars, no. 1002 (T1-2), 1018 (T1-2), 1076 (T1-1), 1092 (T2), 1129 (T3) and 1141 (T4). In 2008, the T2000 were taken out of service while the Holmenkollen Line was being renovated. In 2010, Ruten decided that they would not put back into service, largely because of <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs and low availability of spare parts because of the technically complex design and small series. The last T1300 was retired on 22 May 2010, after which only MX3000 units are used on the metro.|$|E

5|$|A second colony was {{established}} at the Arguin archipelago off the West African coast (now part of Mauritania). In contrast to the Guinean colony, Arguin had been a colony before: In 1520, Portugal had built a fort on the main island, which with all of Portugal came under Spanish control in 1580. In 1638 it was conquered by the Dutch Republic, and in 1678 by France, who due to <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs abandoned it and demolished the fort soon after. On 27 July 1685, an expedition was mounted by Frederick William and Raule, who took possession of the vacated colony on 1 October. Subsequently, the fort was rebuilt and contacts to the indigenous population established. France was alarmed and sent a vessel to re-conquer the fort in late 1687, but the attack of a French frigate and a smaller vessel was beaten back by the Brandenburg-Prussian garrison. The victory improved the relations to the indigenous people, {{many of whom were}} carried off as slaves by the French before. While Arguin did not reach the economic importance of Großfriedrichsburg, it temporarily advanced to the world's primary staple port for slaves.|$|E
25|$|The 2016 Australian Defence White Paper {{stated that}} the Tiger {{helicopters}} will be replaced with other armed reconnaissance aircraft in the mid 2020s.

25|$|On 29 June 1944, {{the first}} {{successful}} take-off from a ship underway was performed from the flight deck of USCGC Cobb.

40|$|Forest {{roads are}} built for forest {{management}} purposes, to which planning of their use and maintenance is adapted. The increasing importance of non-forestry use of forest roads leads to <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> standard, which by formed maintenance system causes permanent shortage of funds. <b>Higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs occur {{due to the}} past forest roads construction characteristics, which gave priority to quick opening of villages and farms, on the account of building quality.

25|$|Storms, fire, and <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs caused major {{problems}} in the centuries after 1600. The monastery underwent many changes until 1930.

30|$|The {{full-time}} mechanical maintenance workers’ average {{reliability was}} the lowest when {{compared with those of}} other maintenance categories during overtime maintenance activity.

The average maintenance worker’s reliability for overtime maintenance activity was 83.13 %.|$|R
25|$|On May 1, 2014, Aeroports de Montréal {{confirmed}} that Mirabel Airport's terminal building would be demolished, citing its <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> cost as a reason, {{as well as}} its facilities being unfit for commercial aviation needs and lacking any economic viability. Several reports suggested that it would simply be less expensive to rebuild a new terminal if passenger service ever returned to Mirabel.|$|E
25|$|The RoCAF's Mirages have {{suffered}} from low operational readiness and <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs; the harsh environment and high operational tempo had caused higher-than-expected wear and tear. After the presence of cracks in the blades of the aircraft's engines were detected in 2009, Dassault worked with Taiwanese authorities to successfully rectify the issue and provided compensation for the engine damage. By the following year, normal training hours of 15 per month had resumed and the fleet's operational readiness had been restored, after having reportedly dropped to 6 hours per month due to the engine troubles. In addition to this issue, there were considerations of mothballing the entire Mirage fleet due to its <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs. Although the aircraft's maintenance supplies cost more {{than those of the}} Republic's AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo and the Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon, the fleet was reportedly still being maintained adequately because of its popularity. Yet plans to upgrade the fleet had not been carried out as costs for doing so in France would be very high.|$|E
