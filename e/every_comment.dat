Matson returned to New York City in 1987 and enrolled in the writing program at Columbia University. He worked with Robert Montgomery, Sharon Olds, Robert Hass, and Quincy Troupe. He earned his MFA in poetry from Columbia University School of the Arts in 1989 and his thesis became the basis for the poetry volume Squish Boots. He joined Alan Soldofsky and Susan Lurie in organizing readings at Cody's Books in Berkeley 1979 to 1981; joined workshops with Soldofsky, Josephine Miles, Robert Hass, Diana O'Hehir, and Marc Linenthal; attended Squaw Valley Writers’ Conference in 1973; and met with peers from Squaw Valley for several years. With Paul Geffner, Glenn Ingersoll, and Katherine Harer he ran the [...] "Poetry and Pizza" [...] reading series in San Francisco from 1998 to 2010. He began the reading series [...] "Poetry Unbound" [...] in 2013 with Richard Loranger and Harold Adler at Art House Gallery and Cultural Center in Berkeley, which continues today. In 1993 Matson established a small, eight-page quarterly journal, The Scribbler, edited by workshop participants, a role since taken over by Kayla Sussell. It continues today as one of the longest-enduring literary publications in the Bay Area and in the country. Blogs on Matson's website, matsonpoet.com, from 1998 to the present, prepare for Writing Your Way In, a sequel to Let the Crazy Child Write! Following the tragic attacks of 9/11, Matson wrote Towers Down, published as a chapbook along with Diane Di Prima's Notes Toward a Poem of Revolution (Eidolon Editions, San Francisco, 2002). Matson then edited, along with Allen Cohen, An Eye for an Eye Makes the Whole World Blind: Poets on 9/11, a selection of poems by over 100 American poets. [...] In 2009, Matson reissued his first volume of poetry as Mainline to the Heart and Other Poems, adding later poems to the collection, to further praise. [...] In 2013 he began a monthly column for Berkeley Times [...] "On Words" [...] about local venues from Hip-Hop and Spoken Word to postmodern poetry at UC Berkeley. Matson has affirmed throughout his career that how a poem comes across when read aloud provides clues on how it might best be revised and also is a measure of its success. Matson continues a 40-year tradition of frequent open readings in the Bay Area to experiment orally with poems in progress. Poetry readings in Northern California, often with cellist Gael Alcock accompanying, include Bay Area events such as LitCrawl, Bay Area Generations, and Literary Death Match.|$|E
