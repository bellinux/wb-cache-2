500|$|The {{appendages}} {{that arise}} from pereonites are known as pereopods. The first two pairs of pereopods are highly modified raptorial grasping appendages known as gnathopods. They somewhat resemble the arms of praying mantises. The segments of the gnathopods {{can be divided into}} two parts which fold into each other: the propodus (plural: propodi, [...] "forelimb") and the tipmost segment known as the dactylus (plural: dactyli, [...] "finger"). The first pair of gnathopods are considerably smaller than the second pair and arise close to the maxillipeds. The inside margins of the propodi possess two spines. Both the propodi and dactyli have serrated inner edges. The second pair of gnathopods are very large with two large spines on the middle and upper edges of the <b>inside</b> <b>margin</b> of the palm of the propodi. The upper spine is known as the [...] "poison spine" [...] or [...] "poison tooth" [...] and may be of the same size or much larger than the lower spine (the [...] "closing spine"). Despite the name, it remains unclear if the poison spine is indeed venomous, though they are perfectly capable of inflicting potentially lethal injuries on small organisms. Recent studies have associated the spines with pores that lead to possible toxin-producing glands.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} new high level command for an unmanned aerial vehicle. The command is assumed to make the UAV follow a reference position that is placed on a certain distance to an object. At the same time the UAV is assumed to move more smoothly than the reference position and the UAV is allowed to follow the reference position with margin. The problem was solved with an automatic control system that takes the reference position as input signal and has a fictitious position as output signal. The fictitious position moves smoothly <b>inside</b> the <b>margin</b> and irregular behavior of the reference position is smoothed out by the automatic control system. The fictitious position is affected by strong feedback outside the margin and weak feedback <b>inside</b> the <b>margin.</b> This makes the fictitious position to stay <b>inside</b> the <b>margin</b> and moves smoothly <b>inside</b> the <b>margin.</b> The UAV follows the fictitious position instead of the reference position. In this way the UAV holds a certain distance to an object {{and at the same time}} moves smoother than the object...|$|R

50|$|The {{geometrical}} {{solution of}} the construction of Van de Graaf's canon, which works for any page width:height ratio, enables the book designer to position the text body in a specific area of the page. Using the canon, the proportions are maintained while creating pleasing and functional margins of size 1/9 and 2/9 of the page size. The resulting <b>inside</b> <b>margin</b> is one-half of the outside margin, and of proportions 2:3:4:6 (inner:top:outer:bottom) when the page proportion is 2:3 (more generally 1:R:2:2R for page proportion 1:R).

5000|$|In 1967, Matt Roberts, {{chief of}} the {{circulation}} department of the Washington University library, first documented the drawbacks of oversewn bindings. [...] It is especially threatening to books with acidic paper; the tight sewing in the gutter margin may cause shards of this paper, in its weakened, embrittled state, to tear and flake off. Oversewn bindings are also often very tightly bound, so {{it is difficult for}} books' spines to open fully and lie flat. From a conservation standpoint, a primary concern about oversewing is that it is essentially irreversible. In order for an oversewn text block to be re-bound again, more of the <b>inside</b> <b>margin</b> has to be cut or ground off. Some librarians believe that it is a hasty practice which favors cost over artifactual value, as original bindings may potentially be restorable.|$|E
5000|$|The winged {{seeds of}} Pinus peregrinus are between 20 and 23 mm long {{and have a}} nutlet located {{in the base of}} the wing {{to one side of the}} wing axis.

50|$|Banks Peninsula tree weta is a red-brown colour (Biodiversity Recovery Unit, 1998) {{its body}} length {{can range from}} 40-55 mm in mature adults and it weighs 4-6 g. Like other insects Banks Peninsula tree weta has three body segments, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head of the mature male Banks Peninsula tree weta is much larger and darker than that of females or {{juvenile}} males with large mandibles that they use to fight other males. The two eyes are situated {{on the front of}} its head with two antennae protruding from the <b>inside</b> <b>margin</b> of these. The antennae can be much longer than the body length, and these are covered with hairs which are able to sense activity. Banks Peninsula tree weta also has three ocelli, or simple eyes, between its eyes which respond to changes in light. The thorax contains the front, middle and hind legs of the weta, each leg is made up of six segments; the coxa, the trochanter, the femur, the tibia, the tarsus and the pretarsus. The ear of the weta {{can be found at the}} top of the tibia near the knee joint of the front legs. The tibia of the hind legs are covered in spines, that can be rubbed against the stridulatory ridges on the side of the body to produce a sound, these can also be used as a defence mechanism against predators. Banks Peninsula tree weta can be distinguished from other types of weta as they have 20 or more stridulatory ridges. The hind legs are also very muscular for the purpose of jumping, however Banks Peninsula tree weta is too heavy to jump. The abdomen is broken up into segments, called spiracles, and it is here we find the stridulatory ridges. Protruding from the abdomen is the cerci, which is used to pick up vibrations in the air. Females also have an ovipositor, a long tube like cylinder used to deposit eggs in the soil.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{features}} {{observed in}} human teeth can link them to different populations. Teeth exhibit variables {{with a strong}} hereditary component that are useful in assessing population relationships and evolutionary dynamics. One example is shovel-shaped incisors, in which individuals have ridges on the <b>inside</b> <b>margins</b> of their front teeth. This trait is most common in East Asian and Native American populations and occurs less frequently elsewhere. Teeth {{have an important role}} in chewing food, and different dental pathologies and patterns of tooth wear can indicate kinds of food eaten and other dietary behaviors of certain populations. The measurement and examination of teeth can also exhibit incidental and intentional modifications which reflect the patterns of different cultural behaviors. The process of tooth formation is highly reflective of environment. Developmental defects observed on teeth can provide a general measure of environmental stress on a population.|$|R

30|$|As far as {{we could}} observe, the random {{selection}} trend was constant, with no improvement in acquisition capabilities over the 10  days. While the SVM-Margin method showed {{a decrease in the}} number of malwares acquired through the fifth day, it showed a very negligible improvement from the sixth day. It can be seen that the performance of our methods was much closer to the ALL line which represents the maximum number of malicious PDF files that can be acquired each day. This phenomenon can be explained by looking at the ways in which the methods work. The SVM-Margin acquires examples about which the detection model is less confident. Consequently, they are considered to be more informative but not necessarily malicious. As was explained previously, SVM-Margin selects new informative PDF files <b>inside</b> the <b>margin</b> of the SVM. Over time and with improvement of the detection model towards more malicious files, it seems that the malicious files are less informative (due to the fact that malware writers frequently try to use upgraded variants of previous malwares). Since these new malwares might not lie <b>inside</b> the <b>margin,</b> SVM-Margin may actually be acquiring informative benign, rather than malicious, files. However, our methods, combination and exploitation, are more oriented toward acquiring the most informative files and most likely malware by obtaining informative PDF files from the malicious side of the SVM margin. As a result, an increasing number of new malwares are acquired; in addition, if an acquired benign file lies deep within the malicious side, it is still informative and can be used for learning purposes and to improve the next day’s detection capabilities.|$|R
