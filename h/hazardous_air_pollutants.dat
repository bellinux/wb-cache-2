2500|$|In 1990, Congress {{amended the}} Clean Air Act {{to create new}} {{regulations}} for over 180 different kinds of [...] "hazardous air pollutants" [...] emitted from stationary sources. One of the programs created by the 1990 amendments was the National Emissions Standards for <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutants</b> Program, which regulated pollution from [...] "major sources" [...] of air pollution. At the same time, Congress developed a procedure to determine {{the applicability of the}} <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutants</b> Program to power plants that generated electricity from fossil fuels. These procedures directed the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") to study the effects of emissions of hazardous pollutants from these power plants on public health, and to regulate power plants if [...] "regulation is appropriate and necessary after considering the results of the study." [...] When regulating sources, the Clean Air Act states that the EPA must enforce minimum emissions regulations (known as [...] "floor standards") and to consider costs, among other factors, when implementing more stringent emissions standards (known as [...] "beyond-the-floor standards"). The EPA later interpreted the Clean Air Act to mean that [...] "power plants become subject to regulation on the same terms as ordinary major and area sources" ...|$|E

2500|$|The EPA {{completed}} the required study in 1998 {{and concluded that}} regulation of coal and oil-fired power plants was [...] "appropriate and necessary."

[...] Although the EPA estimated that regulations would cost power plants $9.6 billion per year, the EPA concluded that [...] "“costs should not be considered” when determining whether power plants should be regulated. A group of non-profit organizations, corporations, and 23 states filed suit to challenge the EPA's refusal to consider costs when regulating power plants, but the United States Circuit Court for District of Columbia upheld the Agency's decision to not consider costs. In 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to resolve {{the question of whether the}} EPA must consider costs when regulating power plants under the Clean Air Act.|$|E
