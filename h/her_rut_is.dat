5000|$|The <b>ruts</b> <b>were</b> {{created from}} 1847 to 1860 by the wagon {{wheels of the}} wagons pioneers used to move westward. The segment of {{preserved}} <b>ruts</b> <b>is</b> approximately [...]25 mi in length running through unploughed prairie. This segment of <b>ruts</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the few}} remaining remnants of the Woodbuy Cutoff due to extensive agriculture in eastern Nebraska where the trail once ran. The <b>ruts</b> <b>are</b> approximately 20 ft wide at their eastern edge and run southwest along a ridge for about [...]125 mi at which point the trail curves to the west. As the trail turns west, it descends 110 ft to Oak Creek. As of 1992, the total length of the remaining wagon wheel <b>ruts</b> <b>was</b> 2,315 ft.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{interior}} prototype <b>rutting</b> test <b>is</b> {{designed to}} research the effect of geogrid on reducing <b>rutting.</b> Three models <b>are</b> studied, which include unreinfored, Telegrid JBS 20 and Tensar SS 30. The change trend of rutting {{and the influence of}} differential structure geogrid on <b>rutting</b> <b>are</b> analyzed to evaluate the effect of geogrid on reducing rutting. The results of the tests prove that the geogrid reduce pavement rutting on soft foundation effectively, SS 30 with higher node intensity and rigidity obviously exceeds JBS 20 with higher tensile strength on the effect of reducing rutting, and the effect on reducing <b>rut</b> <b>is</b> not very good by improving tensile strength of geogrid...|$|R

The measured shape of the <b>rut</b> <b>was</b> copied for calculating its cross-sectional surface with a drawing program. Finally, the mean {{depth of the}} <b>rut</b> <b>was</b> determined. However, the range of the profile gauge was not always sufficient, and the gauge’s accuracy (± 5  mm) was not good enough to produce results with the desired reliability.|$|R

40|$|<b>Rutting</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} encountered in flexible pavements supported by weak subgrades. Reinforcing the weak subgrades {{is one of}} the promising alternatives to alleviate the pavement surface rutting. This paper presents the results of laboratory model tests on a circular plate supported by geocell reinforced sand subgrades. A series of tests were carried out by varying the height of the geocell mattress with an additional layer of basal geogrid placed underneath the geocell mattress. The surface settlements (<b>rutting)</b> <b>were</b> measured through displacement gauges. Strain gauges were placed along the width of the basal geogrid to verify their performance as a base layer. A substantial reduction in surface <b>rutting</b> <b>is</b> observed in the case of geocell reinforced beds with basal geogrids. A seven fold improvement in bearing capacity was obtained with the provision of an additional geogrid layer over unreinforced subgrades. Overall, a basal geogrid layer provides higher structural support mobilized through membrane effect to the geocell reinforced pavement layer...|$|R
