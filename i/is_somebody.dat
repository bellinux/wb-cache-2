500|$|Ralph P. Locke, in {{his study}} of Carmen's origins, draws {{attention}} to Bizet's successful evocation of Andalusian Spain. Grout, in his History of Western Music, praises the music's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion. Among the opera's early champions were Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and particularly Wagner, who commented: [...] "Here, thank God, at last for a change <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> with ideas in his head." [...] Another champion of the work was Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed to know it by heart; [...] "It is music that makes no pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere". By broad consent, Carmen represents the fulfilment of Bizet's development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of opéra comique.|$|E

[...] Bale employed a martial arts discipline called the Keysi Fighting Method, now modified for Bruce's current state and Bane's style. Bale has stated that The Dark Knight Rises will be his final Batman film. Bale acknowledged that Batman is [...] "not a healthy individual, this <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> that is doing good, but he's right {{on the verge of}} doing bad". Bale clarifies that [...] "He doesn't want to forget [...] He wants to maintain that anger he felt at that injustice". Bale felt bittersweet about leaving the franchise, saying that it was like [...] "saying goodbye to an old friend." ...|$|E

500|$|House of Pain spent 10 days {{working on}} [...] "Gangstas iz Genocide". Alba {{digitally}} photographed images of buildings near the Marcy Houses in Brooklyn, New York. Portions {{of the sequence}} were pre-visualized in 3D Studio Max, while stills were imported as texture maps and added to animated cut scenes created in 3D modeling package Maya. The artists also improvised {{the use of a}} hand grenade. When Lee saw how violent the sequence was, he improvised the line [...] "Kill Dat Nigga!" [...] as a subtitle. The entire sequence was rendered out to play onscreen in full frame. The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds. Lee cut it to 30 seconds, feeling that a shorter length would make more of an impact. Upon Inside Mans theatrical release, he regretted the video game sequence in the film, saying, [...] "The sad thing <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> is probably gonna make a game out of it and take that as inspiration." ...|$|E
500|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the {{follow-up}} to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E

I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making. Basically, I never thought I would because it didn't seem like his stories or subject matter were ever going to include me. So, I'm just as excited as I can be." [...] She described her character as a woman with [...] "a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having to yell at anybody — she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. It all went way too fast for me." ...|$|E

500|$|Ana Lucia was {{described}} by Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer as [...] "demanding", [...] "hostile" [...] and a [...] "bully". She called Ana Lucia a [...] "brooding, broken ex-cop" [...] with a [...] "perpetual scowl". McFarland described the character as someone with a [...] "take-charge nature", and an [...] "inability to be reasoned away from her dictatorial decisions". Anna Johns from AOL's TV Squad felt Ana Lucia is [...] "abrasive and lacking common sense or civility". C. K. Sample, also from TV Squad, thought Ana Lucia was [...] "angry", [...] "power mad" [...] and a [...] "total nut job". According to supervising producer Leonard Dick, [...] "Ana Lucia <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who {{does not want to}} be a victim. She was a victim once and she swore to herself she would never be a victim again". Rodriguez described the character as [...] "very intuitive", adding [...] "I like that the character is pretty much always aware and suspicious". She is [...] "street smart" [...] and has a [...] "speak-her-mind quality".|$|E
500|$|Cogman noted, {{about the}} Arya storyline {{in the same}} interview, that {{he comes from a}} theater background, and that [...] "being able to comment on the show and the {{reactions}} to the show through the players were so much fun. The show is often accused of being gratuitous in all kinds of way – the violence and the bigness of the characters. It's a huge operatic story. We're able to lovingly spoof ourselves but also play with ideas about how audiences view the show, good and bad, and how a perspective of a story changes. Plus there’s the dramatic deliciousness of Arya watching her own life play out on stage." [...] Weiss also spoke about Arya, saying [...] "We were excited to do the play within the play, and it's a distorted fun house mirror representation of things we've already seen." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Part of Arya's amusement is just that she knows that they're getting so many details wrong, but she always regretted that she didn't have a chance to watch Joffrey die, and now she gets to. It's obviously a comic version of it, but that gives her great pleasure." [...] Weiss also noted, [...] "Arya is slowly getting seduced by these performances, and Lady Crane, the actress that she's charged with killing, this <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who like her has taken as her life's work the job of becoming other people." ...|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E
