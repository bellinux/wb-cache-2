The courteous Frenchman even promised that Morocco would be the Algeria of the Canaries. His observations for temperature, pressure, variation, <b>hygrometry,</b> and psychrometry of the Orotavan climate, which he chose for health, are valuable. He starts with a theory of the three conditions of salubrity--heat-and-cold, humidity, and atmospheric change. The average annual mean of Orotava is 66.34 degrees (F.), that of Southern France in September; it never falls below 54.5 degrees nor rises above 73.88 degrees, nor exceeds 13.88 degrees in variation.] ...|$|E

Then, the operator removes the whey that makes up for 80% of the initial volume of milk. The milk serum or milk permeate is later given to the cows, spread in the fields. It can also be collected by some dairy industries that extract cream from it, turn it into powder to feed the calves, or use it in the elaboration of other food products, such as chocolate and pre-packaged-meals. Once drained, the bits of renneted milk are pressed {{for the first time}} into their mould thanks to a machine. The compressed cheese is called “tome”. The “tome” is then wrapped into linen, a little casein slab (oval or square) is put on top of it, and the cheese is salted (with some brine). Next, it is put into a press, for 12 to 24 hours. The next step is called “ressuyage” (lit. “re-wiping”), when the cheese is unwrapped, and stored in a cold room, at 10 C, with between 40% to 60% of <b>hygrometry.</b> Farmers and dairy producers can let the “tome” to mature, or sell then to people specialized in cheese maturing.|$|E

We tested the hypothesis that inlet chamber temperature, influenced by ambient air and ventilator output temperatures, may affect humidifier performance, as assessed by <b>hygrometry.</b> <b>Hygrometry</b> was measured with three different humidifiers under several conditions, varying ambient air temperatures (high, 28 - 30 degrees C; and normal, 22 - 24 degrees C), ventilators with different gas temperatures, and two VE levels.

Humidifier performance was strongly correlated with inlet chamber temperature in both the bench (p < 0. 0001, r 2 = 0. 93) and the clinical study. With unfavorable conditions, absolute humidity of inspired gas was much lower than recommended (approximately 20 mg H 2 O/L).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: No clear {{recommendation}} exists concerning humidification during non-invasive ventilation (NIV) {{and high}} flow CPAP, and few hygrometric data are available. METHODS: We measured <b>hygrometry</b> during NIV delivered to healthy subjects with different humidification strategies: heated humidifier (HH), heat and moisture exchanger, (HME) or no humidification (NoH). For each strategy, a turbine and an ICU ventilator were used with different FiO(2) settings, {{with and without}} leaks. During CPAP, two different HH and NoH were tested. Inspired gases <b>hygrometry</b> was measured, and comfort was assessed. On a bench, we also assessed the impact of ambient air temperature, ventilator temperature and minute ventilation on HH performances (with NIV settings). RESULTS: During NIV, with NoH, gas humidity was very low when an ICU ventilator was used (5 mgH(2) O/l), but equivalent to ambient air <b>hygrometry</b> with a turbine ventilator at minimal FiO(2) (13 mgH(2) O/l). HME and HH had comparable performances (25 - 30 mgH(2) O/l), but HME's effectiveness was reduced with leaks (15 mgH(2) O/l). HH performances were reduced by elevated ambient air and ventilator output temperatures. During CPAP, dry gases (5 mgH(2) O/l) were less tolerated than humidified gases. Gases humidified at 15 or 30 mgH(2) O/l were equally tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study provides data {{on the level of}} humidity delivered with different humidification strategies during NIV and CPAP. HH and HME provide gas with the highest water content.

The {{aim of this}} bench and clinical study {{was to assess the}} humidification performance of passive and active heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) and the impact of ambient temperature and ventilator settings. METHODS: We first tested on the bench a device with passive and active humidification properties (Humid-Heat, Teleflex), and 2 passive hydrophobic/hygroscopic HMEs (Hygrobac and Hygrobac S, Tyco Healthcare). The devices were tested at 3 different ambient temperatures (from 22 to 30 °C), and at 2 minute ventilation settings (10 and 20 L/min).

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European research project MeteoMet, the LNE-CNAM and the LNE-CETIAT are developing novel copper cells for the determination of the water vapour pressure equation and the measurement of the triple point of water temperature at the highest degree of accuracy. The Water Vapour Pressure Equation (WVPE) is the basic formula for the calculation of the vapour pressure and other humidity related quantities. Improvement in the uncertainty of the water vapour formulation in the temperature range between - 80 ^·C (and possibly down to - 90 ^·C) and + 100 ^·C is needed for the improvement of primary standards in the field of <b>hygrometry.</b> The Triple Point of Water (TPW, temperature 273, 16 K) {{plays a key role in}} thermometry, because of its threefold function. On one side, it defines the temperature unit, the kelvin. On the other side, it is the reference point in Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer (SPRT) calibrations, according to the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS- 90). Finally, it is the connection point between the current definition of the kelvin and the future one, based on the Boltzmann constant. Copper cells for WVPE and TPW allow highly accurate temperature control, fast thermal response time and excellent thermal uniformity, because of the elevated copper thermal conductivity. Thus, they can be an outstanding tool for reducing measurement uncertainty.
