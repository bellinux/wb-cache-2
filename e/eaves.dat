Hugo, who {{is hiding}} at Martha's farm, overhears him and {{recognises}} him as the cop that he and the others paid off when he was involved in the people smuggling racket. Martha makes this aware to Angelo who agrees to go to Martha's farm with <b>Eaves.</b> On the way, <b>Eaves</b> threatens Angelo to go along with his plans. <b>Eaves</b> shoots Hugo and then flees the scene. Hugo is rushed indoors and Martha phones local doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews). <b>Eaves</b> is caught by Angelo, Tony and Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). Angelo then arrests both Hugo and Martha. As Angelo is driving them to the police station, he suddenly stops and lets them out. He tells Hugo to punch him {{to make it look like}} he and Martha had overpowered him and escaped. Martha thanks Angelo for letting them leave together. Hugo and Martha use Angelo's police car to escape and they flee the Bay, leaving behind their family and friends.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} {{study has}} been carried out on partially heated triangular enclosures with <b>eave.</b> The <b>eave</b> and inclined wall has a cold temperature. The laminar, two-dimensional, steady governing equations of natural convection are solved in the streamfunction-vorticity form using a finite difference technique. Streamline, isotherm and Nusselt number are presented for different parameters such as aspect ratio AR=H/L from 0. 25 to 1, ratio of <b>eave</b> length E=L/n where n changes from 3 to 7 and Rayleigh number from 103 to 106. It is observed that the heat transfer decreases with increasing aspect ratio for small Rayleigh number but increases for higher Rayleigh number.

40|$|Background: Novel {{interventions}} for malaria control are {{necessary in the}} face of problems such as increasing insecticide resistance and residual malaria transmission. One way to assess performance prior to deployment in the field is through mathematical modelling. Modelled here are a range of potential outcomes for <b>eave</b> tubes, a novel mosquito control tool combining house screening and targeted use of insecticides to provide both physical protection and turn the house into a lethal mosquito killing device. Methods: The effect of <b>eave</b> tubes was modelled by estimating the reduction of infectious mosquito bites relative to no intervention (a transmission metric defined as relative transmission potential, RTP). The model was used to assess how RTP varied with coverage when <b>eave</b> tubes were used as a stand-alone intervention, or in combination with either bed nets (LLINs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS). Results: The model indicated the impact of <b>eave</b> tubes on transmission increases non-linearly as coverage increases, suggesting a community level benefit. For example, based on realistic assumptions, just 30 % coverage resulted in around 70 % reduction in overall RTP (i. e. there was a benefit for those houses without <b>eave</b> tubes). Increasing coverage to around 70 % reduced overall RTP by > 90 %. <b>Eave</b> tubes exhibited some redundancy with existing interventions, such that combining interventions within properties did not give reductions in RTP equal to the sum of those provided by deploying each intervention singly. However, combining <b>eave</b> tubes and either LLINs or IRS could be extremely effective if the technologies were deployed in a non-overlapping way. Conclusion: Using predictive models to assess the benefit of new technologies has great value, and is especially pertinent prior to conducting expensive, large scale, randomized controlled trials. The current modelling study indicates <b>eave</b> tubes have considerable potential to impact malaria transmission if deployed at scale and can be used effectively with existing tools, especially if they are combined strategically with, for example, IRS and <b>eave</b> tubes targeting different houses...|$|R

5|$|Ivall's Cottage, a Grade II listed {{building}} since 1985, is located opposite the post box {{near the village}} green. The cottage was originally built during the 16th century, with late 18th century and early 19th century additions with contemporary extensions at the sides.

There is a large roof dormer on the side (east) facade which provides exterior access to the hayloft. Other fenestration includes small square windows with fixed sashes near the <b>eaves</b> on all facades and four double-hung windows, two per level, in the main facade's pavilion. Each end facade has a set of large double wood carriage doors. The complex now serves as a storage and maintenance facility for the club's golf carts.|$|E
5|$|Thatched or tiled roofs were {{supported}} by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof. Stone and plaster were also used for domestic architecture.

5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France.

Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features.
