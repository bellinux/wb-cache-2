5|$|In 1903, Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs in {{the season}} for the first time, in the process {{completing}} his first double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. However, after bowling {{a large number of}} overs against Worcestershire early in the season, he had little success as a bowler for a spell of three weeks. Pelham Warner, a leading amateur cricketer and later captain of England, noted that Rhodes was comparatively unsuccessful {{at the start of the}} year but came back well to take 193 wickets. Warner wrote that Rhodes at this time was accused of being easy to face on a wicket which suited the batsmen, although Warner himself <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue {{was not available}} in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected {{to use it to}} study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.|$|E
5|$|In December 1940 Bacher {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory at MIT, {{but did not}} {{immediately}} cease his research.

Calderwood expressed hope that improved results would bring better form out of Miller, who he described as a top-level player.

Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> {{with all of the}} party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican Party because of their stance against slavery.

5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> {{with some of the}} restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on a rationale for the holding.|$|E
