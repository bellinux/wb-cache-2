The petition alleged that the NRC knowingly allowed NU to operate the Millstone Unit 1 Nuclear Power Station for 20 years in violation of its operating license and beyond its design basis. The petitioners maintained that during normal refueling outages at Millstone Unit 1, NU offloaded the entire fuel core.The OIG investigation developed evidence that NU operated Millstone Unit 1 outside of its design basis.

40|$|Monitoring the {{breathing}} air in tritium facility rooms for airborne tritium is a radiological safety requirement and a best practice for personnel safety. Besides audible alarms for room evacuation, these monitors often send signals for process shutdown, ventilation isolation, and cleanup system actuation to mitigate releases and prevent tritium {{spread to the}} environment. Therefore, these monitors are important not only to personnel safety but also to public safety and environmental protection. This paper presents an operating experience review of tritium monitor performance on demand during small (1 mCi to 1 Ci) operational releases, and intentional airborne inroom tritium release tests.

However, the unavailability or <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> {{of any of the}} passive safety systems will change the accident sequence and may affect reactor safety. The analysis in this study is based on some hypothetical scenarios, in which the passive safety system failure is considered during the loss of coolant accidents. Four different cases are assumed, that is, with all passive systems, without actuation of one of the accumulators, without actuation of ADS stages 1 – 3, and without actuation of ADS stage 4. The actuation of all safety systems at their actuation set-points provides adequate core cooling by injecting sufficient water inventory into reactor core. The LOCA with actuation of one of the accumulators cause early actuation of ADS and IRWST. In case of LOCA without ADS stages 1 – 3, the primary system depressurization is relatively slow and mixture level above core active region drops much earlier than IRWST actuation. The accident without ADS stage 4 actuation results in slow depressurization and mixture level above core active region drops earlier than IRWST injection.

40|$|Due to {{advances}} {{in the field of}} digital protection, more and more utilities are using microprocessor based relays for protection of power system equipment However, the protection philosophy remains the same. The present practice of protection is to analyze all the abnormal operating conditions in advance and to set the relays considering all the Contingencies. But {{it is not possible to}} identify all operating conditions in advance and to determine a set of relay settings that are optimum for all those conditions. Compromises are, therefore, made which result in the relays exhibiting poor selectivity, slow response and even <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate.</b> Many researchers are now investigating the capability of microprocessor based relays to adapt to the changing state of the power system. This approach, known as adaptive protection, will allow the relay settings to be changed dynamically to suit the prevailing operating condition of the power system. The work reported in this thesis includes the investigations for setting ground overcurrent relays in a distribution system and changing the settings to adapt to the operating conditions of the system. Four software modules were developed for this purpose and were tested using a personal computer. The results reported in the thesis demonstrate that improvements in coordination of ground overcurrent relays can be achieved when the adaptive approach of protection is implemented...|$|E

Research on the {{application}} of nanoparticles, specifically magnetic nanoparticles in enhanced oil recovery has been increasing in recent years due to their potential to increase the oil production despite having to interact with reservoirs of high salinity, {{high pressure and temperature}} and un-natural pH. Unlike other conventional EOR agents e. g. surfactants and polymers, a harsh environment will cause degradation and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate.</b> Magnetic nanoparticles which are activated by a magnetic field are anticipated {{to have the ability to}} travel far into the oil reservoir and assist in the displacement of the trapped oil. In this work, ferromagnetic Co 2 +xFe 2 + 1 -xFe 3 + 2 O 4 nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized for their morphological, structural and magnetic properties. At a composition x = 0. 75, this nanomaterial shows its best magnetisation parameters i. e. highest value of saturation magnetization, remanence and coercivity of 65. 23 emu/g, 12. 18 emu/g and 239. 10 Oe, respectively.

Rather than focusing primarily on constitutional text, this Article explores the dynamic ways in which constitutional processes have influenced and been influenced by the structure of constitutional politics. Constitutional dysfunction is best conceptualized as the failure of a constitutional order rather than as a consequence of a flawed constitutional text, and dysfunction typically occurs when a regime is unable to transition from a dysfunctional constitutional order to better constitutional politics. The New Deal constitutional order experienced a fairly painless transition and was able <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> successfully under the formal rules established in 1789 largely because institutions conformed to a system of two non-ideological parties.
