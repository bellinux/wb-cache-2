5000|$|Coigneau is a Belgian {{variety of}} hop which was massively {{cultivated}} in the Flemish Aalst-Asse area near Brussels {{in the nineteenth}} and {{first half of the}} twentieth century. Because of the light bitterness the Coigneau was during a considerable period of time the favorite hop used for Lambic beer brewed in the Pajottenland region of Belgium (southwest of Brussels).Traditional lambic brewing required aged hops but utilized <b>fresh</b> <b>hops</b> as well, preferably in a 50%/50% proportion. The addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>hops</b> was possible because the local hop variety Coigneau contained low alpha-acids and thus added little to the bitterness of the resulting brew.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the results}} of the IAA methods are {{practically}} identical to those obtained by the IBU method for beer brewed with <b>fresh</b> <b>hops,</b> the IAAs of beer brewed with old or poorly stored hops, and with certain special hop extracts, can be significantly lower than the IBU figure.|$|E
50|$|The main {{components}} of hops essential oils are terpene hydrocarbons consisting of myrcene, humulene and caryophyllene. Myrcene {{is responsible for}} the pungent smell of <b>fresh</b> <b>hops.</b> Humulene and its oxidative reaction products may give beer its prominent hop aroma.

40|$|The {{results of}} this study show that the most usual damages of hop glandular trichomes are {{obtained}} on tunica of peltate glandular trichomes as well as cracking of bulbous glandular trichomes. In <b>fresh</b> <b>hop</b> cones any sorts of damage of glandular trichomes are obtained, on the other hand frequency of damaged hop glandular trichomes increase after drying (fi= 0. 08) and after pelletization of hop cones the structure of glandular trichomes is completely destroyed. Volume of hop glandular trichomes of dried hop cones is significantly smaller in the comparison with volume of glandular trichomes of <b>fresh</b> <b>hop</b> cones (D= 0. 544 × 10 − 2 mm 3; P< 0. 01) and a phenomenon of shrinkage on tunica surface of peltate glandular trichomes of dried hop cones is also visible in comparison with the fresh one. The decrease in volume of hop glandular trichomes in dried hop cones is the result of dehydration of hop cones and consequently hops glandular trichomes during the drying process which cause shrinkage of peltate glandular trichomes. However, after pelletization the structure of hop glandular trichomes is completely destroyed. ...|$|R

40|$|Surplus hops (Humulus lupulus L.) {{that are}} not needed by the brewing {{industry}} {{could be used as}} a feed supplement for cattle and other ruminants. Previous research indicates that antimicrobial hops plant secondary metabolites (i. e., α- and β-acids) inhibit methane and ammonia production and promote the growth of ruminant animals. The goal was to determine that hop pellets produced for brewing still possessed the requisite antimicrobial activity after 5 -year storage. HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) analysis indicated that the α- and β-acid concentrations in two varieties of hops were relatively stable after 5 years of storage under N 2. Either hop variety inhibited the growth of the ruminal hyper ammonia-producing bacterium, Clostridium sticklandii SR, in broth culture and Petri plate bioassays. Either hop variety inhibited ammonia production from amino acids or peptides by mixed rumen microorganisms from Holstein steers. These results are similar to those previously obtained with <b>fresh</b> <b>hops,</b> hops extracts, other antimicrobial phytochemicals and typical feed ionophores, such as monensin. The rumen-active antimicrobial phytochemicals in hops can still be present and active after years under certain storage conditions. Further investigation is warranted to determine how surplus and older hops can be used to benefit ruminant nutrition and ruminant industries...|$|E

40|$|Parallel brewing {{trials were}} {{performed}} in laboratory brewery. For beer wort hopping, hop pellets of diff erent age (“slightly aged ” and “strongly aged” one) and storage indexes (0. 35 and 0. 59, respectively) were used.

40|$|Trans-Piceid and trans-resveratrol {{contents}} of hop cones, hop pellets, CO 2 extracts, and spent hop from American varieties (harvest 2004) {{were determined by}} reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry [RP-HPLC-APCI(+) -MS/MS]. Pelletization induced strong stilbene degradation in some cultivars. Similarly, 1 year of storage at 4 degrees C led to a huge loss of trans-piceid, {{especially in the case}} of hop cones (much faster than in model media, although well protected from light and oxygen). Therefore, after 8 months of storage, the overall stilbene content was in the same range whatever the conditioned form. Absent in <b>fresh</b> <b>hop</b> cones or pellets, cis-resveratrol was released from cis-piceid in all stored samples. On the other hand, no delta-viniferin was detected despite it is present in light-protected model media spiked with trans-piceid. Because supercritical carbon dioxide proved inefficient for recovering resveratrol and piceid from pellets, spent hop emerged as the most interesting material for subsequent specific stilbene extraction...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{stability}} during storage of several compounds previously described for distinguishing hop varieties. Volatile compounds of five aromatic cultivars (Styrie, Saaz, Lublin, Mount Hood, and Hallertau) and six bitter cultivars (Northern Brewer, Nugget, Pride of Ringwood, Northdown, Target, and Challenger), stored at different temperatures, were extracted with a Likens-Nickerson simultaneous solvent extractor. Only compounds remaining stable through aging were kept to build an identification flowchart. Although very typical of <b>fresh</b> aromatic <b>hops,</b> farnesene proved much too unstable to be selected for distinguishing aged samples. 3 -Methylbutylisobutyrate, which authenticates all <b>fresh</b> European bitter <b>hops,</b> is also partially destroyed upon storage. On the other hand, bergamotene, alpha- and beta -selinene, methyl geranate, humulene epoxide II, alpha -amorphene, 2 -undecanone, and an unknown compound can be used to distinguish all cultivars whatever the storage temperature. Both the ratios of humulene to humulene + humulene epoxides (I, II, and III) and of bergamotene to farnesene proved good indicators of the freshness status of hop samples...|$|R

60|$|Within {{appropriate}} {{distance of}} this magic ground, though not so near it as that the song trolled from tap or bench at door, can invade its woodland silence, {{is a little}} hostelry which no man possessed of a penny was ever known to pass in warm weather. Before its entrance, are certain pleasant, trimmed limes; likewise, a cool well, with so musical a bucket-handle that its fall upon the bucket rim will make a horse prick up his ears and neigh, upon the droughty road half a mile off. This is a house of great resort for haymaking tramps and harvest tramps, insomuch that as they sit within, drinking their mugs of beer, their relinquished scythes and reaping-hooks glare out of the open windows, {{as if the whole}} establishment were a family war-coach of Ancient Britons. Later in the season, the whole country-side, for miles and miles, will swarm with hopping tramps. They come in families, men, women, and children, every family provided with a bundle of bedding, an iron pot, a number of babies, and too often with some poor sick creature quite unfit for the rough life, for whom they suppose the smell of the <b>fresh</b> <b>hop</b> to be a sovereign remedy. Many of these hoppers are Irish, but many come from London. They crowd all the roads, and camp under all the hedges and on all the scraps of common-land, and live among and upon the hops until they are all picked, and the hop-gardens, so beautiful through the summer, look {{as if they had been}} laid waste by an invading army. Then, there is a vast exodus of tramps out of the country; and if you ride or drive round any turn of any road, at more than a foot pace, you will be bewildered to find that you have charged into the bosom of fifty families, and that there are splashing up all around you, in the utmost prodigality of confusion, bundles of bedding, babies, iron pots, and a good-humoured multitude of both sexes and all ages, equally divided between perspiration and intoxication.|$|R

40|$|The {{isolation}} of high-quality RNA {{is a prerequisite}} for gene expression studies. RNA quality is of special relevance if PCR-based strategies such as cDNA-AFLP or RT-PCR are followed. Our molecular investigations of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) focus on genes that determine the biosynthesis of prenylflavonoids with interesting biological activities which accumulate in the lupulin glands. However, optimized protocols for RNA extraction from hop cones are not available. In this study, the RNeasy midi kit protocol was modified to isolate high amounts of total RNA from <b>fresh</b> and freeze-dried <b>hop</b> tissues, specifically leaves, female inflorescences, and lupulin-enriched hop cone fractions. The main difficulties in obtaining high RNA yields were related to specific features of hop, including the abundance of secondary metabolites and their accumulation in the sticky lupulin glands. The introduction of a number of modifications into the RNeasy midi kit protocol resulted in RNA of high quality, as assessed by spectrophotometry and electrophoresis in agarose gels. The protocol developed is currently being used to produce cDNA-AFLP fingerprints of hop cones and leaves for genetic screening. Furthermore, the method could provide RNA for further molecular studies, including Northern blot hybridizations and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions. status: publishe...|$|R

He swings his legs out of bed, puts on a <b>fresh</b> uniform and <b>hops</b> on the #5 bus at 6:00am {{to go to the}} zoo. While at the City Zoo, Amos always makes time to visit his good friends and always gives them exactly what they need. He follows a reliable agenda of activities with each of his favorite animals: the elephant, the tortoise, the penguin, the rhinoceros and the owl. Amos sits quietly with the shy penguin and at sunset, reads stories to the owl who is afraid of the dark. One day; however, Amos woke up with a terrible cold. He swung his legs out of bed, curled them back again and decided that he would not make it to work. Because Amos is a reliable friend, his dear friends started to wonder where he was. They were getting worried, so the animals left the zoo and hopped onto the #5 bus. To comfort Amos, each animal stretches beyond his or her fears to help a friend recover. After his friends help him recover, they all go to bed as they have a morning bus to catch that brings them back to the zoo.|$|R
