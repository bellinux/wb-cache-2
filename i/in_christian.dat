50|$|A medical {{study from}} 2008 in Tirana on the {{relationship}} between religious observance and acute coronary syndrome found out that 67% of Muslims and 55% of Christians were completely religiously non-observant. The regular attendance of religious institutions (at least once every 2 weeks) was low in both denominations (6% in Muslims and 9% <b>in</b> <b>Christians),</b> and weekly attendance was very low (2% and 1%, respectively). Frequent praying (at least 2 to 3 times per week) was higher <b>in</b> <b>Christians</b> (29%) than <b>in</b> Muslims (17%) Praying several times daily (as required of devout Muslims) was rare (2% in Muslims and 3% <b>in</b> <b>Christians).</b> Regular fasting during Ramadan or Lent was similarly low <b>in</b> Muslims and <b>Christians</b> (5% and 6%, respectively). Generally <b>Christians</b> <b>in</b> the study were more observant then Muslims (26% vs 17%).|$|R

5|$|Christian metal soon {{developed}} {{into its own}} independent record labels and networks. The first Christian metal label was Pure Metal Records, a sublabel of Refuge Records. Soon there appeared other labels such as R.E.X. Records and Intense Records. Fanzines were published in several countries, with Heaven's Metal as {{the first one in}} the US in 1985. During that time almost every Christian record label became interested <b>in</b> <b>Christian</b> metal, and they advertised the newly signed metal bands on their roster on Heaven's Metal since it was the only publication exclusively covering the movement. Soon Heaven's Metal achieved more popularity and became an official, professional publication. Heaven's Metal achieved a dedicated flock of 15,000 readers. Bands' sales usually rose when the ensembles were covered on the magazine. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the more underground Christian metal releases were typically distributed <b>in</b> <b>Christian</b> bookstores, and those as well as the fanzines also traded Christian metal cassette copies with the music fans.|$|E

The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus <b>in</b> <b>Christian</b> eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity.
