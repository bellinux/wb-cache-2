40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method for}} analysis of nonlinear vibrations of mistuned bladed disk assemblies has been developed. This development has facilitated the use of large-scale finite element models for realistic bladed disks, used hitherto in analysis of linear vibration, to be extended {{for the analysis of}} nonlinear multiharmonic vibration. The new method is based on a technique for the exact condensation of nonlinear finite element models of mistuned bladed disks. The model condensation allows the size of the nonlinear equations to be reduced to the number of degrees of freedom where nonlinear interaction forces are applied. The analysis of nonlinear forced response for simplified and realistic models of mistuned bladed disks has been performed. For a practical high-pressure bladed turbine disk, several types of nonlinear forced response have been considered, including mistuning by (i) scatter of underplatform dampers. (ii) shroud <b>gap</b> <b>scatter,</b> and (iii) blade frequency scatter in the presence of nonlinear shroud interaction...|$|E

For compatibility with other systems, {{it is necessary}} {{in some cases to}} be able to reproduce the data in serial form at a synchronous rate. To take maximum advantage of the storage capability of magnetic tape, however, it is desirable in many instances to record the data in a parallel format; i. e., the technique used in magnetic tape recorders used with ground based computers. Reconstructing a serial pulse train with a synchronous bit rate from parallel data recorded on magnetic tape involves some problems which are peculiar to magnetic tape recording equipment. Variations in tape speed (flutter), dynamic skew (wobble) of tape as it passes over the record and playback heads and static skew of the data on the tape resulting from head <b>gap</b> <b>scatter</b> and mean gap azmuth alignment results in nonsynchronous data being generated during playback. To provide synchronous data output, it is therefore necessary to provide a buffer between the output of the magnetic tape recorder and the system accepting the data. Recorder characteristics are examined with respect to their effect on the degree of non-synchronism. Furthermore, the size and complexity of buffers necessary to provide synchronous output data is considered...|$|E

40|$|The {{excitation}} {{spectrum of the}} t-J model is studied on a square lattice in the large N limit in a doping range where a d-density-wave (DDW) forms below a transition temperature T^. Characteristic features of the DDW ground state are circulating currents which fluctuate above and condense into a staggered flux state below T^ and density fluctuations where the electron and the hole are localized at different sites. General expressions for the density response are given both above and below T^ and applied to Raman, X-ray, and neutron scattering. Numerical {{results show that the}} density response is mainly collective in nature consisting of broad, dispersive structures which transform into well-defined peaks mainly at small momentum transfers. One way to detect these excitations is by inelastic neutron scattering at small momentum transfers where the cross section (typically a few per cents of that for spin scattering) is substantially enhanced, exhibits a strong dependence on the direction of the transferred momentum and a well-pronounced peak somewhat below twice the DDW <b>gap.</b> <b>Scattering</b> from the DDW-induced Bragg peak is found to be weaker by two orders of magnitude compared with the momentum-integrated inelastic part.

40|$|Polarimetric {{observations}} of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars are a powerful way to image protoplanetary disks. However, interpretation {{of these images}} is difficult because the degree of polarization is highly sensitive to the angle of scattering of stellar light off the disk surface. We examine how disks with and without gaps created by planets appear in scattered polarized light {{as a function of}} inclination angle. Isophotes of inclined disks without gaps are distorted in polarized light, giving the appearance that the disks are more eccentric or more highly inclined than they truly are. Apparent gap locations are unaffected by polarization, but the gap contrast changes. In face-on disks with gaps, we find that the brightened far edge of the <b>gap</b> <b>scatters</b> less polarized light {{than the rest of the}} disk, resulting in slightly decreased contrast between the gap trough and the brightened far edge. In inclined disks, gaps can take on the appearance of being localized "holes" in brightness rather than full axisymmetric structures. Photocenter offsets along the minor axis of the disk in both total intensity and polarized intensity images can be readily explained by the finite thickness of the disk. Alone, polarized scattered light images of disks do not necessarily reveal intrinsic disk structure. However, when combined with total intensity images, the orientation of the disk can be deduced and much can be learned about disk structure and dust properties. Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures.

AUSTRALIA AND THE NORTHERN MARGIN In the Triassic the northern margin of Gondwanan Pangea opened onto the Meso-Tethys Ocean (Nicoll, 2002). The then continental mar-gin was formed by the Lhasa and West Burma Blocks, parts of the Banda Arc and the New Guinea portion of the Australian Plate. Along {{what would become the}} margin of the Australian Plate were a series of cratonic basins, from the Perth Basin in the south, through the Bonaparte Basin to poorly defined Triassic basin structures on islands of the Banda Arc. In terms of the present day Australian Plate, only along the northern margin of present-day New Guinea and some of the islands of the North-ern Banda Arc did continental margin shelf areas open directly onto the Meso-Tethys Ocean. Within this setting Triassic sediments were depos-ited in tectonically controlled basins. Conodonts and other fossils are beginning to allow high resolution correlation of sedimentary sequences and events within and between these basins.

40|$|In several parent iron-pnictide {{compounds}} the resistivity has {{an extended}} range of linear magnetic field dependence. We {{argue that there}} is a simple and natural explanation of this behavior. Spin density wave transition leads to Fermi-surface reconstruction corresponding to strong modification of the electronic spectrum near the nesting points. It is difficult for quasiparticles to pass through these points during their orbital motion in magnetic field, because they must turn sharply. As the area of the Fermi surface affected by the nesting points increases proportionally to magnetic field, this mechanism leads to the linear magnetoresistance.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of an annular gap induced by an {{embedded}} proto-planet on the hydrostatic structure of the protoplanetary disk.

This effect occurs because stellar radiation that would have been scattered (and absorbed) by material within in the gap is instead reprocessed by the disk wall at {{the outer edge of the}} gap, producing a bright ring surrounding the dark gap in the images. The light absorbed by the outer wall raises its temperature, which in turn increases the disk scale height at that location. As a result, the outer wall of the gap will shadow the outer region of the disk.

40|$|We {{propose a}} non-BCS {{mechanism}} for superconductivity (SC) in hole-underdoped cuprates {{based on a}} gauge approach to the t-J model. The gluing force is a long-range attraction between spin vortices centered on the empty sites of two opposite Neel sublattices, leading to pairing of charge carriers (spinless holons). In {{the presence of these}} pairs, a gauge force coming from the single occupancy constraint induces, in turn, a RVB pairing of the spin carriers (spinons), <b>gapped</b> by <b>scattering</b> against spin-vortices. This gives rise to a finite density of incoherent hole pairs, precursor to superconductivity, supporting a Nernst signal whose anticipated contour plot is qualitatively consistent with experiments. The true superconducting transition occurs at an even lower temperature via a planar XY-type transition and it involves a kinetic energy gain due to lowering of the spinon gap. Since the short-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order and the holon pairing originate from the same term of the t-J model, this approach incorporates a strong interplay between AF and SC, giving rise to a universal relation between the energy of the resonance mode (bound state of spinons) and T-c, as observed in neutron scattering experiments...|$|R
