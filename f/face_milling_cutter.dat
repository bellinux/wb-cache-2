[...] The experiment consisted of three phases, the first being of a preliminary nature to evaluate the feasibility of depositing copper by this process. Measurements of cutting power for various depths of cut, using a mild steel work piece, were compared to those obtained using a soluble oil, with favourable results for the copper sulphate electrolyte. [...] Evaluation of the electrolyte cutting fluid to determine its optimum composition by measuring cutter wear, cutting forces, cutting power, and the surface finish of the work piece, follows. Observations of surface finish and cutting power produced no positive result.
