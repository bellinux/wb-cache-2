40|$|BACKGROUND Hirayama disease, also termed non-progressive <b>juvenile</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> of {{the distal}} upper limbs, {{is a type}} of {{cervical}} myelopathy related to flexion movements of the neck. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the role of Dynamic MR imaging findings in young patients with clinical suspicion of Hirayama disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirteen patients (age range from 16 to 26 years) with clinical suspicion of Hirayama disease underwent thorough clinical evaluation and dynamic cervical MRI in the Department of Radiology at IPGME&R within a time duration of June 2014 to September 2016. RESULTS All the thirteen patients showed anterior shifting of posterior dural sac, cord flattening, abnormal curvature, enhancing epidural component. Nine of them showed localised cord atrophy and intramedullary T 2 hyperintensities. Ten patients showed prominent flow voids. CONCLUSION Hirayama disease, a rare disease affecting young adults almost always in the second to third decades of life, is characterised by insidious onset and slowly progressive course followed by static phase of unilateral or asymmetric atrophy of the hand(s) and forearm(s) with sparing of the brachioradialis, characterised as oblique amyotrophy. Dynamic contrast MRI has accurate and characteristic findings which help in early diagnosis and early institution of therapy...|$|E

Foram utilizados anticorpos monoclonais contra linfócitos T totais e subpopulações (CD 4 + e CD 8 +), linfócitos B, macrófagos, células exterminadoras naturais (NK), imunoglobulinas e porção C 3 do complemento. A análise foi quantitativa e de acordo com o local de acúmulo (interstício, intra-fibra e perivascular). Linfócitos CD 8 + foram encontrados no interstício na maioria dos casos, sendo menos comuns dentro das fibras musculares e raros no espaço perivascular. Os casos de MCIC apresentaram maior número de linfócitos CD 8 + se comparados às outras doenças. A proporção de células CD 8 +/CD 4 + foi maior na MCIC do que nas outras doenças. Existiam macrófagos em grande proporção na MCIC, miopatias distais e em um dos casos de distrofia das cinturas pélvica e escapular. Células NK foram frequentes no interstício nos casos de MCIC e mais raras nas outras doenças. Houve maior depósito de imunoglobulinas e complemento nos casos de MCIC do que nas demais doenças. O grande número de células CD 8 + e a relação CD 8 +/CD 4 + podem auxiliar no diagnóstico diferencial da MCIC de outras doenças neuromusculares com vacúolos marginados. Among 1400 muscle biopsies, {{we found}} 16 cases with rimmed vacuoles whose {{diagnosis}} were sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) (4 cases), <b>juvenile</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (6 cases), distal myopathies (3 cases), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (2 cases), and peripheral neuropathy (1 case). Monoclonal antibodies reactive for T lymphocytes and subsets, B lymphocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, immunoglobulins, and complement {{were used to}} analyze the inflammatory infiltrate. The analysis was quantitative and according to the site of accumulation (interstitial, endomysial, and perivascular). The immunocytochemical analysis showed CD 8 + lymphocytes in the interstitial in most cases, occasionally inside of muscle fibers, and rarely in the perivascular region. The IBM cases had an increased number of CD 8 + lymphocytes comparing with the other diseases. CD 8 +/CD 4 + ratio was increased in IBM compared with the other diseases. Macrophages were frequent in IBM, distal myopathy, and one case of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Natural killer cells were frequent at interstitial site in IBM but rare in the other diseases. Immunoglobulins and complement deposition were slightly more intense in IBM than in the other diseases. The case of peripheral neuropathy had no cells or immunoglobulins deposition. The increased number of CD 8 + lymphocytes and the CD 8 +/CD 4 + ratio help to distinguish IBM from other neuromuscular disorders with rimmed vacuoles...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{clinically}} characterize and map {{the gene}} locus in a three-generation family with an X-linked adult-onset distal hereditary motor neuropathy. METHODS:: Microsatellite markers spanning the <b>juvenile</b> distal <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (DSMAX) locus were genotyped and analyzed using genetic linkage analysis. The promoter, untranslated and coding {{region of the}} gap junction ? 1 (GJB 1) gene was sequenced. Nine positional candidate genes were screened for disease mutations using high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis. RESULTS:: The family showed significant linkage to markers on chromosome Xq 13. 1 -q 21. Haplotype construction revealed a disease-associated haplotype between the markers DXS 991 and DX 5990. Sequence analysis excluded pathogenic changes in the coding and promoter regions of the GJB 1 gene. Additional fine mapping in the family refined the DSMAX locus to a 1. 44 -cM interval between DXS 8046 and DXS 8114. HRM analysis did not identify disease-associated mutations in the coding region of nine candidate genes. CONCLUSION:: We have identified a family with adult-onset distal hereditary motor neuropathy that refines the locus reported for <b>juvenile</b> distal <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (DSMAX) on chromosome Xq 13. 1 -q 21. Exclusion of mutations in the coding and regulatory region of the GJB 1 gene eliminated the CMTX 1 locus {{as a cause of}} disease in this family.

Timing of diagnosis is crucial for <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> because early diagnosis may lead to early supportive care and reduction in patient and caregiver stress. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the published literature for diagnostic delay in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed and Web of Science databases for studies published between 2000 and 2014 that listed any type of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> and without molecular, mouse, or pathology in the keywords. Mean and/or median age of onset and diagnosis and delay in diagnosis was extracted or calculated. All estimates were weighted by the number of patients and descriptive statistics are reported. ResultsA total of 21 studies were included in the final analysis. The weighted mean (standard deviation) ages of onset were 2. 5 (0. 6), 8. 3 (1. 6), and 39. 0 (32. 6) months for <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> types I, II, and III, respectively, and the weighted mean (standard deviation) ages of confirmed <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> genetic diagnosis were 6. 3 (2. 2), 20. 7 (2. 6), and 50. 3 (12. 9) months, respectively, for types I, II, and III. For studies reporting both age of onset and diagnosis, the weighted diagnostic delay was 3. 6, 14. 3, and 43. 6  months for types I, II, and III, respectively. ConclusionsDiagnostic delay is common in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> The length of delay varied by severity (type) of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Further studies evaluating this delay and tools such as newborn screening are warranted to end the diagnostic delay in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> is {{distinct}} among neurodegenerative {{conditions of the}} motor neuron, with onset in developing and maturing patients. Furthermore, the rate of degeneration appears to slow over time, {{at least in the}} milder forms. To investigate disease pathophysiology and potential adaptations, the present study utilized axonal excitability studies to provide insights into axonal biophysical properties and explored correlation with clinical severity. Multiple excitability indices (stimulus–response curve, strength–duration time constant, threshold electrotonus, current–threshold relationship and recovery cycle) were investigated in 25 genetically characterized adolescent and adult patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> stimulating the median motor nerve at the wrist. Results were compared with 50 age-matched controls. The Medical Research Council sum score and <b>Spinal</b> <b>Muscular</b> <b>Atrophy</b> Functional Rating Scale were used to define the strength and motor functional status of patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> In patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> there were reductions in compound muscle action potential amplitude (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) associated with reduction in stimulus response slope (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005), confirming significant axonal loss. In the patients with mild or ambulatory <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> there was reduction of peak amplitude without alteration in axonal excitability; in contrast, in the non-ambulatory or severe <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> cohort prominent changes in axonal function were apparent. Specifically, there were steep changes in the early phase of hyperpolarization in threshold electrotonus (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) that correlated with clinical severity. Additionally, there were greater changes in depolarizing threshold electrotonus (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) and prolongation of the strength-duration time constant (P[*]=[*] 0. 001). Mathematical modelling of the excitability changes obtained in patients with severe <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> supported a mixed pathology comprising features of axonal degeneration and regeneration. The present study has provided novel insight into the pathophysiology of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> with identification of functional abnormalities involving axonal K+ and Na+ conductances and alterations in passive membrane properties, the latter linked to the process of neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of anterior horn {{cells in the}} spinal cord leading to progressive <b>muscular</b> weakness and <b>atrophy.</b> The <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> candidate interval genes including survival motor neuron, the responsible gene in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> phenotype expression, neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein, and P 44, potential modifying genes, are located on chromosome 5 q 13 in two highly homologous copies (telomeric and centromeric) within the <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> region. Methods: In this study, the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion was analyzed in 34 <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> families, with the consanguinity rate of 65 % (22 / 34), in whom exon 7 of the survival motor neuron- 1 gene was already confirmed and was deleted in 79 % of the affected individuals. Deletion analysis of exons 5, 6, and 13 of the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-t gene {{was carried out in}} our samples. Results: We found 80 % neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion in 5 q-spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> patients (91 % <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-I, 50 % <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-II and-III), and in 5 % (two of fourty) of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> parents. All the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-deleted samples also lacked the survival motor neuron- 1 gene. Conclusion: The neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-I was higher than the other <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> types. The high frequency of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein deletion most likely reflects a higher frequency of survival motor neuron- 1 deletions compared with survival motor neuron- 1 to survival motor neuron- 2 gene conversion in this population...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} reported {{that patients with}} <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> do not lose muscle strength over time as measured quantitatively. However, we noted that many patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> suffer from what they called fatigue. We wondered if we could measure fatigue during a single maximal voluntary contraction, whether fatigue might increase with time, independent of muscle strength, and whether increasing fatigue might correlate with loss of function in some patients. We measured fatigue during a single maximal voluntary contraction in a cohort of patients having spinal mus-cular atrophy using quantitative strength testing. We included only patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> aged 5 years or older, so they could follow instructions regarding muscle contraction, and who were followed for at least 2 years.
