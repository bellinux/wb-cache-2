An Act of 1866 gave permission to raise a further £20,000, with loans of £6,600. After raising this capital, the line was opened to Llanerchymedd in 1866, with the temporary station at Llangefni replaced by a permanent structure half a mile further on. Captain Rich, when surveying the line, noted that the curves and gradients were severe, and recommended that the line be worked at moderate speed.

They were asked about their perceptions of the risk of riding bicycles unprotected, the severity of possible head injuries, and about other bicycle-safety related behaviors. Factors that best predicted the student's <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> bicycle helmets involved both behavioral beliefs and normative beliefs. Analysis of factors influencing those with low <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> helmets, compared <b>to</b> those with high intentions, suggests the most effective messages that health planners can provide preadolescents to influence them <b>to</b> <b>use</b> helmets. They are that helmet use is fun and attractive, helmets provide a new look and a sporting image, and friends approve of and value this behavior. Parents, and particularly mothers, can reinforce their children's <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> helmets and their involvement should be encouraged...|$|R

The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities.

Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads.

40|$|Background: Childcare {{services}} {{represent a}} key setting to implement nutritional interventions {{to support the}} development of healthy eating behaviours in young children. Childcare-specific nutritional guidelines outlining recommendations for provision of food in care have been developed. Despite this, research suggests that few childcare services currently implement these guidelines. This study aimed to {{examine the impact of}} providing printed educational materials on childcare service cooks’ <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> nutritional guidelines and provide fruit and vegetables on their menu. Findings: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 77 childcare services (38 control and 39 intervention). Intervention service cooks were mailed a two-page educational material together with a menu planning checklist. Intervention development and evaluation was guided by the theory of planned behaviour. Outcome data assessing <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> nutritional guidelines and serves of fruit and vegetables provided on menus (primary outcomes) as well as secondary outcomes (attitudes, behavioural regulation and social norms) were collected via a telephone interview with cooks. Relative to the comparison group, cooks in the intervention arm had significantly higher <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the guidelines (p value 0. 0005), accompanied by significant changes in perceived behavioural control (p value 0. 0008) and attitudes (p value 0. 0071). No significant difference in serves of fruit (p value 0. 7278) and vegetables (p value 0. 0573) was observed. Conclusions: The use of educational materials can improve childcare service cooks’ <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> nutritional guidelines; however, as a standalone strategy, it may not improve provision of food on menus...|$|R

The study is carried out from the theory of planned behaviour and distinguishes attitudes (psychological openness), subjective norms (indifference to stigma), and perceived behavioural control (help-seeking propensity) in explaining behavioural <b>intentions</b> with regard <b>to</b> seeking preventive and therapeutic psychological help. Method: 167 Dutch adults between 65 and 75 years of age filled out a questionnaire measuring these concepts. Results: Older adults have low <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> seek professional help for psychological problems. Their <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> preventive help are somewhat higher.
