5|$|The FEPP {{conducted}} a survey in 2001 which revealed that online monitoring software, including Net Nanny, SurfWatch, and Cybersitter, cast too broad a net and often blocked legitimate educational websites {{in their attempts to}} censor material from youths. In 2003, the organization assisted 33 academics in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted the sale of violent video games to minors. In coordination with the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP released a public policy report in 2006 on the inefficiency of Internet filtering; the report concluded that freedom of <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> harmed by such online censorship activity. In 2007, the FEPP became an independent organization.|$|E

50|$|These three {{standard}} depth-first traversals are {{representations of}} the three different expression formats: infix, postfix, and prefix. An infix <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> produced by the inorder traversal, a postfix <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> produced by the post-order traversal, and a prefix <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> produced by the pre-order traversal.|$|R
5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{noted in}} 1922 {{that the work}} of intense <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> {{singular}} in the sacred music of its period, with a convincing musical interpretation of the biblical text and its manifold shades of emotion. Paul Hindemith wrote a trimmed adaption which probably helped to keep the work in the repertory, and François Callebout wrote an organ version, making the work accessible for smaller choirs. It was first performed in Wiesbaden, where the composer studied, in 2003. The celebration of the Reger Year 2016 led to several performances.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA2 synthesis, but SFTPA2 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, pancreas, thymus, colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. While {{the majority of these}} tissues express both SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 transcripts, only SFTPA2 <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> found in the trachea and prostate. Using specific monoclonal antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung alveolar type II pneumocytes, Clara cells, and alveolar macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{also support}} the {{hypothesis}} that an increase in the expression of cereblon is an essential element of the anti-myeloma effect of both lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Cereblon <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> three times higher in responding patients compared to non-responders and higher cereblon <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> also associated with partial or full response while lower <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> associated with stable or progressive disease.|$|E
40|$|In this article, a {{formalisation}} of index <b>expressions</b> <b>is</b> presented. Index <b>expressions</b> <b>are</b> more expressive than keywords {{while maintaining}} a comprehensible complexity. Index <b>expressions</b> <b>are</b> well-known in Information Retrieval (IR), where they are used for characterising document contents, formulation of user interests, and matching mechanisms. In addition, index expressions have found both practical and theoretical applicability in 2 -level hypermedia systems for IR. In these applications, properties of (the structure of) index <b>expressions</b> <b>are</b> heavily relied upon. However, the presupposed mathematical formalisation of index expressions and their properties still lacks. Our formalism {{is based on the}} structural notation of index <b>expressions.</b> It <b>is</b> complete in the sense that several notions of subexpressions and defoliation of index <b>expressions</b> <b>are</b> also formalised. Defoliation, which {{plays an important role in}} defining properties of index <b>expressions,</b> <b>is</b> provided as a recursively defined oper [...] ...|$|R

In mouse, the gene <b>expression</b> of C6orf165 <b>is</b> even lower, the gene is only expressed in two body parts, ovary and testis. In chicken, the weak <b>expressions</b> <b>are</b> in two body part, brain and testis. In zebra fish, gene <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> still low, the very weak <b>expressions</b> <b>are</b> in eye, kidney and reproductive system.

25|$|Similarly, out of 119 {{cases of}} {{mismatch}} repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable {{in the absence}} of MLH1). In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, {{eager evaluation}} or greedy evaluation is the evaluation strategy used by most traditional programming languages. In eager evaluation, an <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> evaluated {{as soon as}} it is bound to a variable. An alternative to eager evaluation is lazy evaluation, where <b>expressions</b> <b>are</b> evaluated only when a dependent <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> evaluated.|$|R
50|$|An <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> called {{partially}} redundant if {{the value}} computed by the <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> already available on some {{but not all}} paths through a program to that <b>expression.</b> An <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> fully redundant if the value computed by the <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> available on all paths through the program to that expression. PRE can eliminate partially redundant expressions by inserting the partially redundant expression on the paths that do not already compute it, thereby making the partially redundant expression fully redundant.|$|R
