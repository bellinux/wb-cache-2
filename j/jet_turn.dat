The {{aim of the}} experiment was to analyze {{the impact of the}} AWJ traverse speed (1. 5 – 9 mm/min) on the surface quality in terms of micro-structure formed on the created surface. The water pressure was set to 400 MPa and the spindle revolution to 34 rpm. Australian garnet (MESH 80) was used as an abrasive component. The surfaces were visualized and qualitatively described using a laser confocal microscope. Basic roughness parameters of the surfaces (Ra, Rq, Rz) were measured using an optical profilometer. The presented experimental results demonstrate that the technology of abrasive water <b>jet</b> <b>turning</b> is an appropriate tool for rough machining of difficult-to-machine materials.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relation between}} compact jet emission and X-ray variability properties of all black hole transients with multiwavelength coverage during their outburst decays. We studied the evolution of all power spectral components (including low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations), and related this evolution to changes in jet properties tracked by radio and infrared observations. We grouped sources according to their tracks in radio/X-ray luminosity relation, and show that the standards show stronger broadband X-ray variability than outliers at a given X-ray luminosity when the compact <b>jet</b> <b>turned</b> on. This trend {{is consistent with the}} internal shock model and can be important for the understanding of the presence of tracks in the radio/X-ray luminosity relation. We also observed that the total and the QPO rms amplitudes increase together during the earlier part of the outburst decay, but after the compact <b>jet</b> <b>turns</b> either the QPO disappears or its rms amplitude decreases significantly while the total rms amplitudes remain high. We discuss these results with a scenario including a variable corona and a non-variable disk with a mechanism for the QPO separate from the mechanism that create broad components. Finally, we evaluated the timing predictions of the magnetically dominated accretion flow model which can explain the presence of tracks in the radio/X-ray luminosity relation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to evaluate the transient effects of a reaction control jet on the aerodynamic performance of a generic interceptor missile. Three-dimensional computations of the highly turbulent flow field produced by a pulsed, lat-eral-jet control thruster and the interaction of this jet with the supersonic free stream and missile bound-ary layer were completed for different altitudes and thruster conditions. A generic supersonic missile-interceptor configuration consisting of a long, slen-der body (L/D = 14. 1) containing fixed dorsal and tail fins {{was used in this}} study. Parametric compu-tational fluid dynamic (CFD) solutions were obtained at two altitudes of 64. 5 kft (19. 7 km) and 115 kft (35. 1 km). Computation of the flow-field behaviors at each altitude were completed for the following assumptions: (1) steady-state conditions, lateral control <b>jet</b> <b>turned</b> off, (2) steady-state condi-tions, lateral control <b>jet</b> <b>turned</b> on, (3) transient tran-sient jet startup simulation, and (4) transient jet shutdown simulation. A thermally perfect gas (y = 1. 4) was assumed for the Mach number 5 free stream and the Mach number 3 lateral jet. Vehicle forces and moments were obtained for each solu-tion by integrating the surface pressures and vis-cous shear stresses computed on the missile sur-faces. These results are applied to assess the influ-ence of the jet interaction (Jl) effects on the tran-sient aerodynamic performance of the missile. The analysis indicates that strong transient influence is predicted in the integrated normal force and pitch-ing moment. These effects may be influenced by the dorsal fin interaction with the jet interaction (Jl) region...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) {{analytical approach}} {{to calculate the}} mixing and combustion efficiency along engine combustors that use sidewall fuel injectors is described. The analysis consists of three parts: (1) an empirical correlation for fuel penetration, (2) application of integral conservation laws following <b>jet</b> <b>turning</b> and pressure equilibration, and (3) an analytical solution for the simplified three-dimensional partial differential equations to describe the downstream mixing and combustion process. Numerical results are compared to some empirical and experimental work, and favorable agreements are shown. The importance of including anisotropic turbulence and three-dimensional effects are illustrated by comparison with data and other less comprehensive analyses.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that subtle {{changes in the}} {{velocity}} profile across the seaward extension of midlatitude jets, such as the Gulf Stream, can lead to {{dramatic changes in the}} zonal-penetration scale. In particular, if α-dq/dψ > 0, where q is the absolute vorticity and ψ is a streamfunction for the geostrophic flow, then the jet tends to penetrate across to the eastern boundary; conversely if α < 0, the <b>jet</b> <b>turns</b> back on itself creating a tight recirculation on the scale of order [α] - 1 / 2. This behavior is demonstrated in a quasigeostrophic ocean model. The implications of this study for numerical simulations of ocean gyres are discussed.

40|$|Bipolar {{expansion}} {{at various}} stages of evolution has been recently observed {{in a number of}} AGB stars. The expansion is driven by bipolar jets that emerge late in the evolution of AGB winds. The wind traps the jets, resulting in an expanding, elongated cocoon. Eventually the jets break-out from the confining spherical wind, as recently observed in W 43 A. This source displays the most advanced evolutionary stage of jets in AGB winds. The earliest example is IRC+ 10011, where the asymmetry is revealed in high-resolution near-IR imaging.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the work}} {{presented}} in this paper, combined machining of hypereutectic G-AlSi 17 Cu 4 Mg with abrasive water <b>jet</b> <b>turning</b> (AWJT) as a roughing process and conventional turning as a finishing process was studied. The duration of the single processing steps was estimated and compared {{to the length of}} a conventional machining process. The tool life of AWJT of at least 10 hours combined with a material removal rate of up to 13 cm 3 /min and low process temperatures give this cutting technology a very high potential. Furthermore the material close to the cutting surface is impacted less by the cutting process, in comparison to conventional rough turning. The results obtained showed that AWJT roughing combined with conventional finishing generates parts with high surface qualities and with further optimization may be a possible process substitution with high productivity...|$|R
