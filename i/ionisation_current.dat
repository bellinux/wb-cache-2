50|$|The {{accompanying}} plot {{shows the}} variation of <b>ionisation</b> <b>current</b> for a co-axial cylinder system. In the ion chamber region, {{there are no}} avalanches and the applied voltage only serves to move the ions towards the electrodes to prevent re-combination.In the proportional region, localised avalanches occur in the gas space immediately round the anode which are numerically proportional {{to the number of}} original ionising events. Increasing the voltage further increases the number of avalanches until the Geiger region is reached where the full volume of the fill gas around the anodes ionised, and all proportional energy information is lost. Beyond the Geiger region the gas is in continuous discharge owing to the high electric field strength.|$|E

50|$|The Trionic system lacks a {{camshaft}} position sensor. This sensor {{is normally}} {{a prerequisite for}} a sequential pre ignition/pinging regulation and fuel injection. Saab Trionic must decide whether cylinder one or cylinder four ignites when the crank shaft position sensor indicates that cylinder one and four is at TDC. This is done by help of ionization current. One of the poles of the secondary coil of the spark coils {{is connected to the}} spark plugs in an ordinary manner. The other pole isn’t grounded directly but connected to an 80 V voltage. This means that an 80 V voltage is applied across the spark gap of the spark plugs, except when the spark is fired. When combustion has occurred the temperature in the combustion chamber is very high. The gases are formed as ions and start to conduct electric current. This results in a current flowing in the spark plug gap (without resulting in a spark). The <b>ionisation</b> <b>current</b> is measured in pairs, cylinder one and two is one pair and cylinder three and four in the other pair. If combustion occurs in cylinder one or two the ignition cassette sends battery voltage (B+) pulse to the ECU, pin 17. If the combustion takes place in cylinder three or four the B+ pulse is fed to pin 18 in ECU. If the crankshaft position sensor indicates that cylinders one and four are at TDC and a B+ pulse enters the ECU via pin 17 simultaneously, then the ECU know that it is cylinder one that has ignited. Upon starting, the ECU doesn’t know which cylinder is in compression phase, hence ignition is initiated in both cylinders one and four and 180 crank shaft degrees later sparks in cylinder two and three are fired. As soon as the combustion signals enters the ECU via pin 17 and pin 18 the ignition and fuel injection is synchronised to the engines firing order. The combustion signals are also used to detect misfires.|$|E

40|$|Pre-breakdown <b>ionisation</b> <b>current</b> {{measured}} by Steady State Townsend experiment in hydrogen for values of E/p 0 up to 1000 Vcm^- 1 Torr^- 1 is analysed {{by applying the}} Townsend equation, the Lucas equation and the current growth equation considering ionisation collision between positive ions and hydrogen gas molecules {{as well as that}} between electrons and the molecules. It is seen that the degree of fit of the measured current by applying the Lucas equation is the best of the analysis by the three equations at large E/p 0 values, then it is found that the <b>ionisation</b> <b>current</b> at large E/p 0 values in hydrogen is affected by the gap length dependency of geometry factor, namely, loss of photons out of the gap, for the secondary process by photons.

40|$|Data on {{the impact}} of {{ionising}} radiation on life are examined in the light of evolutionary biology. This comparison confirms that fear of nuclear radiation is not justified by science itself; rather it originates in a failure of public trust in nuclear science, a relic of the international politics of the Cold War era. <b>Current</b> <b>ionisation</b> safety regulations appease this fear but without scientific support and they need fundamental reformulation. This should change the reaction to accidents like Fukushima, the cost of nuclear energy and the application of nuclear technology to the supply of food and fresh water.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the air mass in the cylinder of a spark ignition (SI) engine is crucial in order to regulate the exact air fuel (A/F) ratio for the catalyst and thus minimize the emissions. Conventional algorithms for estimating the air mass are based on sensor information measured {{in front of the}} throttle or in the manifold. Thus, the determination of cylinder individual sizes, particularly the air mass, is impossible. In this work, new sensors, which provide cylinder individual information are investigated and the air mass in each individual cylinder is calculated with adaptive, model based algorithms. Sensors within the combustion chamber of an SI engine enable a cylinder specific evaluation of the thermodynamic work process. In particular, the combustion pressure sensor or <b>ionisation</b> <b>current</b> sensing are two independent methods of measuring direct combustion information. In a few cases such sensors are used in mass production cars. The combustion pressure sensor exhibits two significant advantages when compared to <b>ionisation</b> <b>current.</b> First, it provides information of the pressure in the cylinder during the complete working cycle of the engine and this pressure information {{is a measure of the}} entire combustion chamber. In contrast, the ionisation sensing represents a local measurement during the combustion and part of the expansion phase and this measurement can only be seen as a part of the information contained in the combustion pressure sensor signal. Second, the determination of the air mass in the cylinder, the most significant process information, can only be determined by cylinder pressure measurements and not by <b>ionisation</b> <b>current.</b> Reducing costs by eliminating the mass air flow meter is a requirement for the implementation of combustion pressure sensors in a mass production throttled SI engine. Thus, the cylinder pressure sensor must be able to determine the air mass in the cylinder. However, the cylinder pressure sensors will not be implemented in a mass production application based only on replacing the mass air flow meter, but must in addition provide much more cylinder specific information. This might change in future with new engine concepts. Available from: [URL] / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEDEGerman...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, AlGaAs/InGaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs {{have been}} {{submitted}} to DC life-tests in impact ionisation regime with and without thermal stress. Control devices present an identical and steep shape of the on-state breakdown locus while aged devices present a large dispersion of this characteristic. It seems that some slight modification of the surface properties and/or micro-defects located in the gate-drain region affect the on-state breakdown voltage loci measured with a gate current of 0. 13 mA/mm. After the two life-tests, the temperature evolution of the surface leakage contribution to the reverse gate current has increased while impact <b>ionisation</b> <b>current</b> remains unchanged. This result is confirmed by a weak temperature dependence of the on-state breakdown voltage measured with a gate current of 1 mA/mm. These slight modifications of the surface properties do not affect the reliability of this technology...|$|E
40|$|Space Missions, {{by virtue}} of the energy {{required}} for geocentric or heliocentric orbits, generally explore and hence encounter objects at velocities in excess of terrestrial values for macroscopic objects. Their demand, to quantify impact relationships, extends from penetration to momentum exchange; from ionisation to plasma diagnostics. Response to the "need to know" in space and defence has {{led to the development of}} laboratory facilities and of hydrocodes; but because the parameter space of velocity and dimension in space cannot be replicated in full, the scaling of velocity and dimension is a vital element in establishing quantitative formula to decode space impact features.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the energy of}} a charged particle {{by means of the}} total amount of ionisation it produces in a gas, through which it passes, is well established. Gas filled devices may be subdivided into (a) <b>current</b> <b>ionisation</b> chambers and (b) pulse ionisation chambers, proportional counters and Geiger counters. Proportional counters in a very crude form were used by Rutherford and Geiger in 1908. Soon afterwards the Geiger counter was developed, which after considerable improvement by Geiger and Müller in 1928, became the well known Geiger-Müller counter. In fact the three gas filled devices mentioned in (b) can be achieved with the same counter by using it with different applied voltages. If the applied voltage on a typical cylindrical counter is varied and the output pulse height is measured for a fixed number of ion pairs liberated in the gas, a characteristic curve of the form shown in Fig. (1) will be obtained. With voltages between say v₁ and v₂, the field strength is just sufficient to collect all the ion-pairs and no new ion-pairs are liberated, so the pulse height will remain constant. This is the region of pulse ionization chambers where the gas gain is unity. As the voltage is further increased to between v₂ and v₃ both elastic and inelastic collisions take place and the pulse height increases exponentially [...] ...|$|R
