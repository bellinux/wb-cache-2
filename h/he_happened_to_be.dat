5|$|Pound {{graduated}} from Hamilton College with a BPhil in 1905, then studied Romance languages under Hugo A. Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained an MA in early 1906 and registered {{to write a}} PhD thesis on the jesters in Lope de Vega's plays. A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees {{and gave him a}} travel grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe. He spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace; <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> standing outside the palace on 31 May 1906 during the attempted assassination by anarchists of King Alfonso, and left the country for fear he would be identified with them. After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris, attending lectures at the Sorbonne, followed by a week in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} of H.M.S. Pinafore {{relied on}} stock character types, {{many of which}} were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone—the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of H.M.S. Pinafore, the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before The Sorcerer, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> writing for, as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury. Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} First Crusade, land was {{distributed}} to loyal vassals of Godfrey, forming numerous feudal lordships within the kingdom. This was continued by Godfrey's successors. The number {{and importance of}} the lordships varied throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and many cities {{were part of the}} royal domain. The king was assisted by a number of officers of state. The king and the royal court were normally located in Jerusalem, but due to the prohibition on Muslim inhabitants, the capital was small and underpopulated. The king just as often held court at Acre, Nablus, Tyre, or wherever else <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> In Jerusalem, the royal family lived firstly on the Temple Mount, before the foundation of the Knights Templar, and later in the palace complex surrounding the Tower of David; there was another palace complex in Acre.|$|E
500|$|Cotton {{had written}} a letter to Roger Williams {{immediately}} following his banishment in 1635 which appeared in print in London in 1643. [...] Williams denied any connection with its publication, although <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in England at the time getting a patent for the Colony of Rhode Island. [...] The letter was published in 1644 as Mr. Cottons Letters Lately Printed, Examined and Answered. [...] The same year, Williams also published The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution. [...] In these works, he discussed the purity of New England churches, the justice of his banishment, and [...] "the propriety of the Massachusetts policy of religious intolerance." [...] Williams felt that {{the root cause of}} conflict was the colony's relationship of church and state.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{does not}} feature Scully, as Gillian Anderson was busy still filming her final parts of Fight the Future. Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales. He was {{requested}} {{for the part}} especially by Chris Carter. Casting director Rick Millikan noted, [...] "McGavin was Chris's inspiration for writing this series. He always had Darren in mind to use somewhere, {{and that was really}} his doing. He said 'I want Darren McGavin for this,' and <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available, and we got him." [...] McGavin had originally been casting directors' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson for the second season opener [...] "Little Green Men". McGavin was later sought out to be Mulder's dad, but he again eluded the staff. In the end, McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Dales, the agent who founded the X-Files.|$|E

2500|$|Ramsey was of Scottish and German ancestry. [...] In 1855, {{he became}} the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota. Ramsey was elected the second Governor of Minnesota after {{statehood}} and served from January 2, 1860 to July 10, 1863. Ramsey is credited with being the first Union governor to commit troops during the American Civil War. [...] <b>He</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Washington, D.C. when fighting broke out.

2500|$|A dialectical {{approach}} is multicausal, multidirectional, integrates facts and value, rejects {{the idea that}} there are hard and fast dividing lines between social phenomena, focuses on social relations, [...] looks not only at the present but also at the past and future, and is deeply concerned with both conflicts and contradictions. [...] Simmel’s sociology was concerned with relationships—especially interaction—and was known as a “methodological relationist”. His principle was that everything interacts in some way with everything else. Overall, he was mostly interested in dualisms, conflicts, and contradictions in whatever realm of the social world <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working on.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{administrative}} {{divisions of}} mediaeval Wales were the cantrefs, {{each of which}} was divided into several commotes. These were of particular importance {{in the administration of}} the law. Each cantref had its own court, which was an assembly of the [...] "uchelwyr", the main landowners of the cantref. This would be presided over by the king if <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present in the cantref, or if he was not present by his representative. Apart from the judges there would be a clerk, an usher and sometimes two professional pleaders. The cantref court dealt with crimes, the determination of boundaries and matters concerning inheritance. The commote court later took over most of the functions of the cantref court. The judges (Welsh ynad) in Gwynedd were professionals, while in south Wales the professional judges worked together with the free landowners of the district, all of whom were entitled to act as judges.|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich Schiller {{was born}} on 10 November 1759, in Marbach, Württemberg as the only son of {{military}} doctor Johann Kaspar Schiller (1733–1796) and Elisabeth Dorothea Kodweiß (1732–1802). They also had five daughters, including Christophine, the eldest. Schiller {{grew up in a}} very religious family and spent much of his youth studying the Bible, which would later influence his writing for the theatre. [...] His father was away in the Seven Years' War when Friedrich was born. He was named after king Frederick the Great, but he was called Fritz by nearly everyone. Kaspar Schiller was rarely home during the war, but he did manage to visit the family once in a while. His wife and children also visited him occasionally wherever <b>he</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stationed. When the war ended in 1763, Schiller's father became a recruiting officer and was stationed in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The family moved with him. Due to the high cost of living—especially the rent—the family moved to nearby Lorch.|$|E

He heard nothing of what may have caused the commotion until he reached KRLD, running all the way through Dealey Plaza, [...] "The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget.
