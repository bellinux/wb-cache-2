40|$|Godin {{introduced}} {{the categories of}} open closed fat graphs $Fat^{oc}$ and admissible fat graphs $Fat^{ad}$ as models of the mapping class group of open closed cobordism. We use the contractibility of the arc complex to give a new proof of Godin's result that $Fat^{ad}$ {{is a model of}} the mapping class group of open-closed cobordisms. Similarly, Costello introduced a chain complex of black and white graphs $BW$-Graphs, as a rational homological model of mapping class groups. We use the result on admissible fat graphs to give a new <b>integral</b> <b>proof</b> of Costellos's result that $BW$-Graphs is a homological model of mapping class groups. The nature of this proof also provides a direct connection between both models which were previously only known to be abstractly equivalent. Furthermore, we endow Godin's model with a composition structure which models composition of cobordisms along their boundary and we use the connection between both models to give $BW$-Graphs a composition structure and show that $BW$-Graphs are actually a model for the open-closed cobordism category.

40|$|Makeenko and Migdal (1979) gave {{heuristic}} identities {{involving the}} expectation of the product of two Wilson loop functionals associated to splitting a single loop at a self-intersection point. Kazakov and I. K. Kostov (1980) reformulated the Makeenko [...] Migdal equations in the plane case into a form which made rigorous sense. Nevertheless, the first rigorous proof of these equations (and their generalizations) was not given until the fundamental paper of T. Lévy (2011). Subsequently Driver, Kemp, and Hall (2017) gave a simplified proof of Lévy's result and then with G. Frank (2017) we showed that these simplified proofs extend to the Yang-Mills measure over arbitrary compact surfaces. All of the proofs to date are elementary but tricky exercises in finite dimensional integration by parts. The goal {{of this article is}} to give a rigorous functional <b>integral</b> <b>proof</b> of the Makeenko [...] Migdal equations guided by the original heuristic machinery invented by Makeenko and Migdal. Although this stochastic proof is technically more difficult, it is conceptually clearer and explains "why" the Makeenko [...] Migdal equations are true. It is hoped that this paper will also serve as an introduction to some of the problems involved in making sense of quantizing Yang-Mill's fields. Comment: 63 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
