40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} threshold current, <b>differential</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and internal loss have been measured in the temperature range 10 - 293 °K.

The threshold behavior at low temperatures (≤ 80 °K) depends strongly on the type and concentration of the impurity. The relatively fast decrease in threshold below 100 °K shows saturation for an active layer with n-type impurities or with high-concentration p-type impurities. The saturation is attributed to the carrier diffusion length becoming smaller than the active-layer thickness.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} how to achieve high power, low threshold, and high {{efficiency}} single mode VCSELs. Various mechanisms that affect the <b>differential</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> and threshold current of the proton-implanted and oxide-confined photonic crystal vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are studied. Three degrees of freedom in designing the photonic crystal VCSELs to maximize the laser performance in terms of efficiency and threshold current are considered: the epitaxial structure, the relative size of the current aperture and the transverse optical mode, and the photonic crystal design. The theoretical background regarding the <b>differential</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> and threshold current of the photonic crystal VCSELs is presented. Proton-implanted 850 nm VCSELs intended for high efficiency single mode lasing are fabricated and characterized, and then the experimental results are compared with the theories. It is found that spectral and spatial mode-gain overlap, optical loss, and thermal effects affect the laser efficiency and threshold current. The thermal effects also affect the dynamical change of <b>differential</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> with the injected current. The epitaxial structure determines the spectral mode-gain overlap and the modal properties of the VCSELs, while the relative size of the current aperture and the optical mode sets the spatial mode-gain overlap factor. The photonic crystal air hole fill-factor {{has an impact on}} all the mechanisms mentioned above. By etching the photonic crystal into proton-implanted VCSELs, stronger index guiding is introduced and consequently the wide distribution of efficiency and threshold current between devices and the discontinuity in measured output power versus current are eliminated, and the threshold current is reduced.

The lasers were fabricated using GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum well wafers, and processed {{in order to}} produce 4 ^m wide, l/im- 4 /im high mesas for optical confinement. This mesa isolation was done by means of wet and dry etching techniques. Fabrication of Fabry-Perot lasers was completed after Si 02 insulation, p-contact and n-contact metalizations, thinning, and dicing. Similar fabrication techniques were applied to produce ring lasers coupled to Fabry-Perot cavities, with various diameters ranging from 50 to 1400 //m. Device characterization was done by means of photoluminescence, currentvoltage, current-power measurements, and electroluminescence. Photoluminescence was used for checking the lasing wavelength.

40|$|Abstract—Al-enhanced SiN-induced {{hydrogenation}} is imple-mented {{to improve}} the minority carrier lifetime in String Ribbon Si. Rapid cooling after the hydrogenation anneal is found to increase the spatially averaged relative lifetime enhancement by over 160 % for String Ribbon Si samples with a spatially averaged as-grown lifetime of 2. 9 s. Partial coverage of back surface by Al eliminates wafer bowing in 100 m thick substrates, but reduces the spatially averaged lifetime enhancement to below 100 % because vacancy generation at the back surface is decreased. Rapid thermal firing (RTF) of screen-printed contacts, with high heating and cooling rates, is found to improve String Ribbon solar cell efficiency {{by an average of}} 1. 2 % absolute over lamp heated belt furnace contact firing. Light beam-induced current (LBIC) mapping and light biased or <b>differential</b> internal <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> (IQE) analysis show that the enhancement in cell performance is primarily due to an improved effective diffusion length and diffusion length uniformity, which are both a result of the improved retention of hydrogen at defects achieved during rapid cooling after contact firing.
