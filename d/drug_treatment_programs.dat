40|$|Objective: Premature {{termination}} from {{treatment is}} a major factor associated with poorer <b>drug</b> and alcohol <b>treatment</b> outcomes. The present study investigated client-related baseline predictors of dropout at 3 months from a faith-based 12 -step residential <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>program.</b> Method: Data were collected over a period of 14 months from eight residential <b>drug</b> and alcohol <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> run by The Australian Salvation Army. The final sample consisted of 618 participants, including 524 men (84. 8 %) and 94 women (15. 2 %). Predictor variables of interest were age, gender, primary drug of concern, criminal involvement, psychological distress, drug cravings, self-efficacy to abstain, spirituality, forgiveness of self and others, and life purpose. At 3 months, 264 participants (42. 7 %) remained in the <b>treatment</b> <b>program,</b> and 354 participants (57. 3 %) had dropped out. Results: Binary logistic regression revealed that individuals were more likely to drop out by the 3 -month time frame if at intake their primary drug of concern was a drug other than alcohol or they reported greater forgiveness of self. Conclusions: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine forgiveness as a predictor of dropout from a <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>program.</b> Assessing patient’s primary drug of concern and levels of forgiveness may be useful for residential <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> providers in constructing programs that provide differential treatment {{based on the results of}} these assessments...|$|R
