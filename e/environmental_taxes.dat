40|$|About the Czech <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> reform, {{it can be}} {{said that}} its concept is not very well known even to its {{principal}} stakeholders. The reason is the little promotion: the absence of explanatory campaigns. The support to dealing only with existing local environmental problems and the opposition to introducing an <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> reform aimed at combating climate change connected with consistent revenue recycling points at a certain short-sightedness, cause probably largely by the lack of awareness of the risks as well as advantages of the <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> reform approach where the revenues are fully recycled. It is here that foreign experience in terms of evaluating the <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> reform impacts on economies and environment may play a key role in the promotion and implementation of the Czech <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> reform. And also, further increases of the CO 2 tax rates in the Czech Republic should be preceded by a quantification of its impacts on the Czech economy using e. g.

40|$|In a two-period {{overlapping}} generations model, {{this paper}} {{demonstrates that the}} relationship between environmental taxation and economic activity (output level and output growth) becomes inverted-U shaped when the detrimental impact of pollution on health and the private decision of each working-age agent to improve her health are taken into account. In particular, a tighter <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> is more likely to promote (rather than to harm) output-level and -growth when health is very sensitive to pollution, the weight of health in preferences is high, the polluting capacity of the production technology is high and the rate of natural purification of pollutants is low. The inverted-U shaped relationship between <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> and economic activity is due to a positive effect arising from the competition for resources between the final output sector and the health-enhancing activities. This offsets the conventional detrimental “drag-down effect” for low values of the <b>environmental</b> <b>tax.</b> We also demonstrate that the link between <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> and lifetime welfare is inverted-U shaped as well.

50|$|Criticism {{of the use}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>taxes</b> {{is based}} on the premise that these taxes are regressive, because {{individuals}} from lower-income households spend a larger proportion of their income on products such as fuel, and therefore are more heavily burdened by the imposition of such taxes. The questionable social implications of the introduction of <b>environmental</b> <b>taxes</b> acts as a major hindrance to the introduction of environmental tax reform. In support of this notion, research figures suggest that in the EU, a 10 percent increase in gas and electricity prices would reduce the real household income of the 1st quintile by 0.69 percent, compared to only 0.43 percent for the 5th quintile.|$|E
50|$|Economic {{variables}} {{that are already}} included in the national accounts but are of obvious environmental interest, such as investments and expenditure {{in the area of}} environmental protection, environment-related taxes and subsidies, and environmental classification of activities and the employment associated with them, etc. In principle, <b>environmental</b> <b>taxes</b> and environmental protection expenditures can be regarded as {{two sides of the same}} coin. Both entail costs involved in production processes that are related to the exploitation of the environment in different ways. On the one hand, environmental protection expenditures record spending on measures aimed at improving the environment, while on the other hand, taxes record the costs set by a government for the exploitation of the environment. Thus, in the total cost of production, the <b>environmental</b> <b>taxes</b> paid can be added to expenditure on environmental protection.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on environmental taxation {{in the presence}} of pre-existing distortionary taxes has shown that the interactions with pre-existing taxes tend to raise the cost of an <b>environmental</b> <b>tax,</b> and thus that the optimal <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> in that context is less than marginal environmental damages. A recent paper by Schwartz and Repetto (2000) challenges this finding, arguing that the health benefits from reduced pollution will also interact with pre-existing taxes, possibly causing the optimal <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> to exceed marginal environmental damages. Schwartz and Repetto's analysis aimed to account for health effects by representing environmental quality and leisure as substitutes in utility. The present paper employs an analytically tractable general equilibrium model that, in contrast with Schwartz and Repetto's analysis, explicitly considers health effects. It shows that interactions with health effects from pollution actually will tend to reduce the optimal <b>environmental</b> <b>tax.</b> This result contradicts Schwartz and Repetto's conclusion. This demonstrates the usefulness of explicitly modeling health effects, and it reinforces the general notion that tax-interactions tend to raise the costs of an <b>environmental</b> <b>tax.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{accumulated}} environmental problems resulting from excessive usage {{of fossil fuels}} have gradually loomed. Thus, an <b>environmental</b> <b>tax,</b> as an important policy tool, {{has been put on}} the agenda in China. In this paper, a dynamic recursive multi-sector Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is applied to explore the impacts of the <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> on China’s economy. To comprehensively analyze the impacts, we introduce four kinds of typical contaminants and set two kinds of scenarios: different tax rates and different tax refunds. The results show that the <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> is conducive to environmental improvement, but the economic variables are adversely affected, for example, the loss of GDP at the low level tax rate is 0. 46 %. In order to offset the negative impacts, we presume the government refunds the tax. The results show that this can indeed relieve the negative effects. When the government refunds the production tax and corporate income tax, 0. 49 % and 0. 34 % of GDP is relieved by respectively.
