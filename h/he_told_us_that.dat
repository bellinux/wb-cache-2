25|$|From {{that point}} on {{he took over the}} story. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{in the early part of}} his career he had taken special {{training}} on spotting and tracing torpedo wakes and that was one of the reasons he felt a little safer when he was on the bridge in treacherous waters. As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. We were not able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.|$|E
500|$|Maeser had a {{profound}} effect on his students. One of them, Alice Louise Reynolds, wrote that [...] "he had the ability to inspire. He made his students feel the worth of life; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the Lord had sent each of us to do a special work, and that the proper preparation was necessary for that mission." [...] Among the students who studied under Maeser were George Sutherland, William H. King, Bryant S. Hinckley, James E. Talmage, George Albert Smith and J. Golden Kimball. He also inspired his family members; one of his sons, Karl Emil, studied under Maeser and went on to be a respected educator and school president. Maeser retired from Brigham Young Academy in 1892 to devote his time to his position as the Superintendent of Church Schools. He was succeeded by Benjamin Cluff.|$|E
500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> before <b>that</b> {{the gate}} was strait; he also exhorted us to strive to enter in thereat, {{or to get}} those things now that will further our {{entrance}} then, and to set ourselves against those things that will hinder our entering in.|$|R
6000|$|... “We had {{a letter}} from dearest Frank,” his mother said, “three days since, whilst you were on your visit to your friend Captain Steele, at Hampton. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>that</b> you had done, and how nobly you had put {{yourself}} between him and that—that wretch.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Edmonds: When we went home, of course, they {{understood}} {{and they said}} {{not to worry about}} it. And our uncle helped us get a lawyer, Mr. Horace Meldahl in Charleston, who was a very understanding person, a nice person. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we {{had to go back to}} school every morning for a while.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, {{he acted}} in [...] Haathi Mere Saathi, which became that year's highest-grossing film {{and the biggest}} grosser ever till then. Khanna is {{credited}} with giving Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in Haathi Mere Saathi. Javed Akhthar accepted and said in an interview: [...] "One day, he went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar {{had given him a}} huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow Aashirwad. But the film's script was far from being satisfactory. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit." [...] Rajesh bought Rajendra Kumar's bungalow named Dimple in Carter Road for 31lakhs in 1970 and renamed it Ashirwaad.|$|E
2500|$|Michael's mother, Valerie Glassborow (1924–2006) {{worked at}} the Second World War Government Code and Cypher School (GC) in Bletchley Park, along with her twin sister, Mary. Codebreaking {{penetrated}} the secret communications of the Axis Powersmost importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers and is {{the birthplace of the}} world's first programmable, digital, electronic computer: Colossus. Her Bletchley Park colleague and friend, Lady Body (née Marion Graham), recalled in 2014 that she had shared a [...] "rather special moment" [...] with Valerie: [...] "Our superior officer, Commander Williams, came into the room smiling and he said, ‘Well done, girls. A signal has been intercepted from Tokyo to Geneva and it's the signal that the Japanese are surrendering'. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> a message has gone to the King and the Prime Minister but that it could not be announced until Geneva has sent on the message to London." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> now <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{orders to}} take us before the consul. Nothing loth, we formed in procession; and, {{with the old man}} at our head, sighing and labouring like an engine, and flanked by a guard of some twenty natives, we started for the village.|$|R
5000|$|The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, Henry Fielding (1749):“I {{remember}} my old schoolmaster, {{who was a}} prodigious great scholar, used often to say, Polly Matete cry Town is my daskalon.

60|$|<b>He</b> then <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> went to Batavia, {{where two}} of the seamen {{belonging}} to the ship had arrived, having deserted the rest in their travels; and gave an account, that the fellow who had run away with the ship, sold her at Bengal {{to a set of}} pirates, which were gone a-cruising in her; and that they had already taken an English ship, and two Dutch ships, very richly laden.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the campaign in Poland the armoured forces were transferred to the west to prepare for the next set of operations. The four light divisions had proved to have inadequate firepower, and they were brought up to strength to full panzer divisions, one of which was given to Erwin Rommel. With this change the total number of panzer divisions in the Heer stood at ten. Guderian continued to work in development of the panzer arm. Said Hans von Luck of the 7th Panzer Division in his memoir: [...] "In the middle of February we were transferred to Dernau on the Ahr, hence practically in to the western front. Rommel visited every unit. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he was proud to be permitted to lead a panzer division. Guderian too came to inspect and talk to us. 'You are the cavalry' he told us. 'Your job is to break through and keep going.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He is in {{attendance}} on the duke, my lord," [...] Beorn said. [...] "We presented ourselves also at his tent, but <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he required no duty from us." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> also <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> my Lord Cornwallis {{had made}} his {{headquarters}} at Governor Nelson's house, for it can well be understood that our governor of Virginia, noted {{for more than a}} leaning toward the cause of liberty, would not remain within the limits of York Town, or anywhere that it was likely the Britishers could get hold of him, while General Cornwallis was occupying this portion of our state of Virginia.|$|R
60|$|The idea of his taking himself well to task, {{with that}} {{laughing}} face and heedless manner {{and with a}} fancy that everything could catch and nothing could hold, was ludicrously anomalous. However, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> between-whiles <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was doing it {{to such an extent}} that he wondered his hair didn't turn grey. His regular wind-up of the business was (as I have said) that he went to Mr. Kenge's about midsummer to try how he liked it.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Henry tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> at this he smote {{the table}} with his open palm, {{displaying}} an anger {{he could no longer}} curb. [...] "This is too much!" [...] he cried. [...] "Hitherto I have believed you sincere but misguided and mistaken. But so deliberate a falsehood transcends all bounds. What has come to you, girl? Why, Lionel himself <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the circumstances of his escape from the galeasse. Himself <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> how <b>that</b> villain had him flogged and then flung him into the sea for dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{the water}} and {{lighting}} were to be supplied by the private company you spoke of, {{but he seemed to}} have no idea as to what price they would be likely to charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a clearvoyant and a witch. The Missis consults him. He knows everything. But he hasn't {{done the}} Missis any good yet, though she's paid him {{hundreds}} of dollars. But <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the stars {{told him we}} could find you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He will be {{out there}} himself, father. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he had for some little time been {{thinking}} of returning to Flanders, and that now he should do so at once. How was it, father, that the men-at-arms did not defend the Tower?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Loyalties of Robinson Jeffers,the [...] first {{in-depth}} study of Jeffers not written {{by one of}} his circle, poet and critic J. Radcliffe Squires addresses the question of a reconciliation of the beauty of the world and potential beauty in mankind: “Jeffers has asked us to look squarely at the universe. [...] <b>He</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> materialism has its message, its relevance, and its solace. [...] These are different from the message, relevance, and solace of humanism. [...] Humanism teaches us best why we suffer, but materialism teaches us how to suffer.” ...|$|R
50|$|I {{might say}} that my {{question}} to their Lordships was: Is this contrary to Catholic moral teaching? The reply, as you all know, was that it is contrary to Catholic social teaching. I was not aware — the Taoiseach can verify this — until I had asked {{each member of the}} Cabinet separately what he proposed to do, what he had been given to understand by Dr. McQuaid when that decision was taken. <b>He</b> then <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> morning <b>he</b> had been informed by Dr. McQuaid that Catholic social teaching and Catholic moral teaching were one and the same thing.|$|R
2500|$|Police {{said that}} he had been in {{psychiatric}} care, where he was treated for depression. Prosecutors {{said that he}} had been treated for two months in a mental care facility in 2015. De Maizière said that he may have been bullied by his peers, and police {{said that he had}} suffered [...] "bodily injury" [...] in an incident involving other young people in 2012. During the attack, Sonboly shouted that he had been bullied for seven years. A former classmate recalled, [...] "We always mobbed [...] him in school, and <b>he</b> always <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would kill us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The hyperborean Orcades,' as the Abbe called them, made {{us think}} of nothing but frost and ice and savages, and we could not believe Sir Andrew when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the Hebrides and all {{the west coast of}} Scotland were warmer than Paris in the winter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{suggesting}} that we may meet Mr. Lessingham?" [...] Helen enquired, lazily. [...] "I am perfectly certain that he knows nothing of the equipment of the melodramatic spy. As to Zeppelins, don't you remember <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he hated them and was terrified of bombs." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{we should}} meet, indeed, with {{provisions}} enough, {{and with an}} innocent, harmless people, who, according to their ability, would entertain us very willingly; but that I, who was a stranger, would be sorely put to it for lodging, especially for so many of us.|$|E
6000|$|Now as Mr. Leaf has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we must {{depend on}} [...] "fundamental discrepancies," [...] "on these alone," [...] {{when we want}} to dissect the ILIAD; as <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{linguistic}} tests alone are [...] "not sufficient to bear the superstructure," [...] &c., how can we lop off two Books [...] "only on account of linguistic evidence"? It would appear that on this point, as on others, Mr. Leaf has entirely changed his mind. But, even in the Companion (p. 388), he had amputated Book XXIV. for no [...] "fundamental discrepancy," [...] but because of [...] "its close kinship to the ODYSSEY, as in the whole language of the Book." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little service!" [...] Madame Duchesne {{repeated}} indignantly. [...] "However, we know Monsieur Glover of old. First of all {{he saved}} Myra's life from that dog, and certainly he saved both our lives from the negroes. And did he save yours? <b>He</b> has just <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> you came on board with him, and that he took you to Jamaica. Still, that is not like {{what he did for}} us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Queen of {{the country}} {{appointed}} two men to attend <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> had enough of our language to make themselves understood in some few particulars. But we soon perceived these two were great enemies to one another, and did not always agree in the same story. We could make a shift to gather {{out of one of}} them, that this island was very much infested with a monstrous kind of animals, in the shape of men, called Whigs; and <b>he</b> often <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hoped we should meet with none of them in our way, for that if we did, they would be apt to knock us down for being kings.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> it {{had been}} a fine day to-day, and we told him that {{it had been}} a fine day yesterday, and then we all told each other that {{we thought it would be}} a fine day to-morrow; and George said the crops seemed to be coming up nicely.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{paddling}} up, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> a canoe {{had arrived}} overnight, from Papeetee, with {{an order from}} a ship lying there for a supply of his potatoes; and as they must be on board the vessel by noon, {{he wanted us to}} assist in bringing them down to his sail-boat.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> in {{this great}} wood there were immense numbers of elephants; and upon the desert, great multitudes of lions, lynxes, tigers, leopards, &c.; {{and that it was}} to that wood and that desert that the negroes went to get elephants' teeth, where they never failed to find a great number.|$|E

It is true that in the beginning he read my plans in a dream, or otherwise; it is true that he hurled the lightning back upon my head; but I hold that these things were accidents.
