We report here that a specific pair of nearby <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> in budding yeast fuse to form a dicentric chromosome intermediate, which then rearranges to form a translocation and other GCRs. We next show that fusion of nearby <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> is general; we found that many nearby <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> that {{are present in the}} yeast genome also fuse, as does a pair of synthetically constructed <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats.</b> Fusion occurs between <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> that are separated by several kilobases of DNA and share > 20 base pairs of homology. Finally, we show that fusion of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats,</b> surprisingly, does not require genes involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair or genes involved in other repeat recombination events. We therefore propose that fusion may occur by a DSB-independent, DNA replication-based mechanism (which we term “faulty template switching”).

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> of DNA are {{widespread}} in the genomes of eukaryotes and prokaryotes and can mediate genome rearrangement. We studied rearrangement mediated by plasmid-borne <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> in Escherichia coli. We show that <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> can mediate an efficient and recA-independent recombination event. Surprisingly, the product of this recombination is not that of simple inversion between the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats,</b> but almost exclusively an unusual head-to-head dimer with complex DNA rearrangement. Moreover, this recombination is dramatically reduced by increasing the distance separating the repeats. These results can be readily explained by a model involving reciprocal switching of the leading and lagging strands of DNA replication within the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats,</b> {{which leads to the}} formation of a Holliday junction. Reciprocal strand switching during DNA replication might be a common mechanism for genome rearrangement associated with inverted duplication...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> are {{important}} genetic elements for genome instability. In {{the current study}} we have investigated the role of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> in a DNA rearrangement reaction using a linear DNA substrate. We show that linear DNA substrates with terminal <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> can efficiently transform Escherichia coli. The transformation products contain circular inverted dimers in which the DNA sequences between terminal <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> are duplicated. In contrast to the recombination/rearrangement product of circular DNA substrates, which is exclusively one particular form of the inverted dimer, the rearrangement products of the linear DNA substrate consist of two isomeric forms of the inverted dimer. Escherichia coli mutants defective in RecBCD exhibit much reduced transformation efficiency, suggesting a role for RecBCD in the protection rather than destruction of these linear DNA substrates. These results suggest a model in which <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> near the ends of a double-strand break can be processed by a helicase/exonuclease to form hairpin caps. Processing of hairpin capped DNA intermediates can then yield inverted duplications. Linear DNA substrates containing terminal <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> can also be converted into inverted dimers in COS cells, suggesting conservation {{of this type of}} genome instability from bacteria to mammalian cells...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> DNA <b>repeats</b> are an at-risk motif {{for genetic}} {{instability}} that can induce both deletions and recombination in yeast.

A perfect palindrome, formed by two 1. 0 -kb URA 3 -inverted repeats, increased intra- and interchromosomal recombination in the adjacent region 2, 400 -fold and 17, 000 -fold, respectively. The presence of a strong origin of replication in the spacer reduced both rates of deletion and recombination.

40|$|The {{stability}} {{of the structure of}} bacterial genomes is challenged by recombination events. Since major rearrangements (i. e., inversions) are thought to frequently operate by homologous recombination between <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats,</b> we analyzed the presence and distribution of such repeats in bacterial genomes and their relation to the conservation of chromosomal structure. First, we show that there is a strong under-representation of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats,</b> relative to direct repeats, in most chromosomes, especially among the ones regarded as most stable. Second, we show that the avoidance of repeats is frequently associated with the {{stability of}} the genomes. Closely related genomes reported to differ in terms of stability are also found to differ in the number of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats.</b> Third, when using replication strand bias as a proxy for genome stability, we find a significant negative correlation between this strand bias and the abundance of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats.</b> Fourth, when measuring the recombining potential of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> and their eventual impact on different features of the chromosomal structure, we observe a tendency of repeats to be located in the chromosome {{in such a way that}} rearrangements produce a smaller strand switch and smaller asymmetries than expected by chance. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our analysis and the influence of factors such as the nature of repeats, e. g., transposases, or the differences in the recombination machinery among bacteria. These results shed light on the challenges imposed on the genome structure by the presence of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats...</b>|$|R
50|$|Amplicons {{in general}} are direct repeat (head-to-tail) or <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> (head-to-head or tail-to-tail) genetic sequences, and can be either linear or {{circular}} in structure. Circular amplicons consist of imperfect inverted duplications annealed into a circle and are thought to arise from precursor linear amplicons.|$|E
5000|$|Inverted repeats {{are often}} {{described}} as [...] "hotspots" [...] of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic instability. Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence {{the stability of the}} genome of various organisms. This is exemplified in E. coli, where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity. Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion. Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats. Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats. The instability results from the tendency of inverted repeats to fold into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities. Thus, inverted repeats lead to special configurations in both RNA and DNA that can ultimately cause mutations and disease.The illustration shows an <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> undergoing cruciform extrusion. DNA in the region of the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> unwinds and then recombines, forming a four-way junction with two stem-loop structures. The cruciform structure occurs because the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> sequences self-pair to each other on their own strand.|$|E

40|$|Repetitive DNA {{sequences}} {{with the}} potential to form alternative DNA conformations, such as slipped structures and cruciforms, can induce genetic instability by promoting replication errors and by serving as a substrate for DNA repair proteins, which may lead to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the contribution of each of the DSB repair pathways, homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and single-strand annealing (SSA), to this sort of genetic instability is not fully understood. Herein, we assessed the genome-wide distribution of repetitive DNA sequences in the Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli genomes, and determined the types and frequencies of genetic instability induced by direct and <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats,</b> both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} HR, NHEJ, and SSA. All three genomes are strongly enriched in direct repeats and modestly enriched in <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats.</b> When using chromosomally integrated constructs in M. smegmatis, direct repeats induced the perfect deletion of their intervening sequences ~ 1, 000 -fold above background. Absence of HR further enhanced these perfect deletions, whereas absence of NHEJ or SSA had no influence, suggesting compromised replication fidelity. In contrast, <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> induced perfect deletions only in the absence of SSA. Both direct and <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> stimulated excision of the constructs from the attB integration sites independently of HR, NHEJ, or SSA. With episomal constructs, direct and <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> triggered DNA instability by activating nucleolytic activity, and absence of the DSB repair pathways (in the order NHEJ>HR>SSA) exacerbated this instability. Thus, direct and <b>inverted</b> <b>repeats</b> may elicit genetic instability in mycobacteria by 1) directly interfering with replication fidelity, 2) stimulating the three main DSB repair pathways, and 3) enticing L 5 site-specific recombination...|$|R
