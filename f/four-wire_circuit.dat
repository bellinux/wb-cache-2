50|$|The <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> {{gets its}} name from the fact that, historically, a {{balanced}} pair of conductors were used in each of two directions for full-duplex operation. The name may still be applied to, for example, optical fibers, even though only one fiber is required for transmission in each direction. A system can separate the frequency directions by frequency duplex and realize the benefits of a <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> even while the same wire pair is used in both directions.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-90s {{four-wire}} technology started gaining more prominence due to {{the technology}} getting cheaper and smaller. <b>Four-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> technology had been around {{for quite some time}} but was very expensive to implement. It usually required a large footprint in the physical television studio, thus was only used at very large television stations or television networks.|$|E

If simultaneous transmit and receive is required, a four-wire or full duplex audio path to the base station is required.

Simulation results of different load, power supply and line conditions will be discussed in order to elucidate the author’s conclusions and to provoke the readers for additional discussions.

50|$|R2 line {{signalling}} variants that support R2 {{line signalling}} in its electrical-pulse form by dedicated two-wire or <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuits</b> usually represent each signal as two different pulse lengths (e.g., 150 milliseconds versus 600 milliseconds), {{where the two}} different meanings of those two different pulse lengths varies by context.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, a <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{a two-way}} circuit using two paths so {{arranged}} that the respective signals are transmitted {{in one direction}} only by one path {{and in the other}} direction by the other path. Late in the 20th century, almost all connections between telephone exchanges were four-wire circuits, while conventional phone lines into residences and businesses were two-wire circuits.|$|E
50|$|Three-phase {{electric}} power requires less conductor mass {{for the same}} voltage and overall amount of power, compared with a two-phase <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> of the same carrying capacity. It has replaced two-phase power for commercial distribution of electrical energy, but two-phase circuits are still found in certain control systems. These power pulsations tend to cause increased mechanical noise in transformer and motor laminations due to magnetostriction and torsional vibration in generator and motor drive shafts.|$|E
50|$|The CCITT 6 {{signalling}} channel was typically a 2.4 kbit/s data link. Technology {{at the time}} was an M1040 or M1020 analogue <b>Four-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> presented private circuit link. Modems were slowly beginning to exceed these data rates over 4w circuits; these data links had the advantage that there was no national tail from the ISC out to a normal end point in the country. It was often the National Section that detracted the most from the quality and reliability of such links.|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages {{of single}} wire {{operation}} such as crosstalk and hum from nearby AC power wires had already {{led to the}} use of twisted pairs and, for long distance telephones, <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuits.</b> Users {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century did not place long distance calls from their own telephones but made an appointment to use a special soundproofed long distance telephone booth furnished with the latest technology.|$|R
50|$|The No. 4 Crossbar {{switching}} system {{had been introduced}} in the 1940s to switch <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuits</b> and replace the incoming operator. With semiautomatic operation analogous to {{the early days of}} the panel switch, the operator in the originating city used a multifrequency keypad to dial an access code to connect to the correct city and to send the seven digit number to incoming equipment at the terminating city. This design was further refined to serve DDD.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} hybrids {{comes from the}} nature of analog plain old {{telephone}} service home or small business telephone lines, where the two audio directions are combined on a single two-wire pair. Within the telephone network, switching and transmission are almost always <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuits</b> with the two signals being separated. Hybrids perform the necessary conversion. In older analog networks, conversion to four-wire was required so that repeater amplifiers could be inserted in long-distance links. In today's digital systems, each speech direction must be processed and transported independently.|$|R
50|$|R2 line {{signalling}} {{is a family}} of protocols that govern the resource acquisition and resource release related to a two-party telephone call attempt and, if successful, {{the establishment of a}} two-party telephone call. Although in the 1960s R2 {{line signalling}} was represented as electrical pulses on a two-wire or <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuit,</b> by the latter 1970s these analog electrical pulses also could be represented in digital form by a signalling DS0 channel in the trunk, which is normally channel 16 in an E1 trunk.|$|E
50|$|In older audio systems (reliant on {{transformers}} {{and passive}} filter networks, {{and based on}} the telephone system), the source and load resistances were matched at 600 ohms. One reason for this was to maximize power transfer, as there were no amplifiers available that could restore lost signal. Another reason was to ensure correct operation of the hybrid transformers used at central exchange equipment to separate outgoing from incoming speech, so these could be amplified or fed to a <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuit.</b> Most modern audio circuits, on the other hand, use active amplification and filtering and can use voltage-bridging connections for greatest accuracy. Strictly speaking, impedance matching only applies when both source and load devices are linear; however, matching may be obtained between nonlinear devices within certain operating ranges.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunication, a {{two-wire}} circuit {{is characterized by}} supporting transmission in two directions simultaneously, as opposed to <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuits,</b> which have separate pairs for transmit and receive. In either case they are twisted pairs. Telephone lines are almost all two wire, while trunks and switching are almost entirely four wire. To communicate in both directions in the same wire pair, conversion between four-wire and two-wire is necessary, both at the telephone and at the central office. A hybrid coil accomplishes the conversion for both. At the central office, {{it is part of}} a four-wire terminating set, more often as part of a line card.|$|R

40|$|For {{three-phase}} <b>four-wire</b> <b>circuits,</b> two compensation criteria {{have been}} established: {{one based on}} the instantaneous value concept {{and the other on}} the average value concept. Thus, according to the instantaneous value concept the non instantaneous power current is reduced, without altering the instantaneous active power. According to the average value concept, the nonactive average-current is reduced, without altering the average power. When the zero-sequence voltage component exists, both compensation types would not enable the zero-sequence (neutral) source current elimination. Then, two approaches are marked in this paper. The first one is for eliminating the non instantaneous power current or the nonactive average-current but the neutral current can still flow. The second one for eliminating the modified non instantaneous power current or the modified nonactive average-current, thus the neutral current component is compensated. According to recent recommendations in this work three-phase systems are considered as four-conductor systems. Experimental results are obtained to confirm the theoretical properties and to show the compensator performance.

The PAD service could {{be connected to}} via a dedicated <b>four-wire</b> telephone <b>circuit</b> using a PSS analog modem and later on via a Kilostream digital access circuit.
