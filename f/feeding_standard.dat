Consequently, ADLIB sows lost less BF than STANDARD sows (P= 0. 041). Additionally, BF change was affected by body condition. LEAN sows (BF 22 mm) (P< 0. 001). Except for a decreased percentage of stillborn piglets for MODERATE sows (P= 0. 044), reproduction results were not affected. Piglet weaning weight of ADLIB-FAT and STANDARD-MODERATE sows was reduced in comparison with that of ADLIB-LEAN sows (P= 0. 005). Regardless of body condition, all metabolites and thyroid hormones measured showed a time dependent profile (P< 0. 001).

40|$|A {{simplified}} ration optimization {{method was}} applied to a beef cattle fattening system to evaluate the utilization of food by-products under various situations. The method was extended to reduce feed costs (i. e., economic factors) and nitrogen and phosphorus excretions (i. e., environmental factors) by introducing penalty coefficients of nitrogen and phosphorus contents in each ingredient of the diet in the objective function in traditional linear programming. Six regional food by-products, five commercial concentrates and two roughages were used as ingredients of the fermented total mixed ration. Constraints for the feed formulation were based mainly on nutrient requirements in the Japanese <b>Feeding</b> <b>Standard</b> for Beef Cattle. The replacement price (or acquisition cost) of food by-products {{was defined as the}} maximum price of food by-products when the feed cost with the use of food by-products was below the cost with the use of conventional concentrates. The results showed that although the replacement prices were not greatly affected by the penalty levels, they were associated with the changes in the substitution rate of food by-products for concentrates and the price of concentrates. The replacement prices were about 16 (yen/kg, as-fed basis) against the present price level of concentrates, when food by-products were substituted for a half of concentrates. Feed compositions were altered and nitrogen and phosphorus excretions were decreased by the changes of penalties, in spite of the small change in the replacement price of food by-products. Both nitrogen and phosphorus penalties greatly reduced the nitrogen and phosphorus excretions, indicating that nitrogen and phosphorus penalty coefficients should be introduced together in the objective function in order to reduce both excretions efficiently...|$|E

Physically robust, tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations, varied water quality conditions, relatively high stocking densities {{and with no}} planktonic larval stage production techniques are relatively straightforward (Jones 2002; Saoud et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 2003). Redclaw can grow to 200  g in 6 – 9  months under optimal conditions (Jones et al. 2002; Thompson et al. 2004) which is superior to many overseas commercially important species such as the Red Swamp Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) which reaches up to 50  g in 7 – 10  months (Ackefors 2000; McClain et al. 2007). Further, approximately 30  % of the total body weight of redclaw is edible tail meat {{which is one of}} the highest yields compared to other farmed crustaceans (Thompson et al. 2005). These characteristics have seen redclaw exported to countries such as Argentina, Mexico, Spain, The United States, South-East Asia, and Central/South America (Food and Agriculture Organisation 2012; Rodríguez-Canto et al. 2002; Saoud et al. 2013). However, the industry is relatively small with total global production totalling 61.5 tonne worth USD$ 1.3 million in 2011 (FAO 2012 [...]). In Australia, commercial aquaculture of redclaw is limited to a small number of farms in Queensland where production has continued to decline over the past decade. Only 41 tonnes worth AUD$ 862, 000 was produced in 2010 – 2011 down from a peak of 100 tonnes in 2004 – 2007 (Heidenreich 2013).

A number of standards have been developed {{such as those of}} the ‘‘Moving Picture Experts Group’’ (MPEG). Those are defined for the source coding of video signals. Various channel coding standards for audio and video transmission based on spread spectrum technology have been established by the ‘‘European Television Standards Institute’’ (ETSI). While the video receivers will come to the market in the form of set top boxes <b>feeding</b> <b>standard</b> PAL-, SECAM- or NTSC-receivers with the appropriate analog signals, a {{new generation}} of mobile TV- and radio receivers on the basis of mobile phones and PDA’s is also conceived. One of the central questions regarding the implementation of those products is the balance between flexibility and speed performance of the various hardware-platforms. The competition is between standard processors like the new generations of the Pentium (as ‘‘superscalar’’ representatives), possibly enhanced with add-ons like MMX, or, alternatively, the TRIMEDIA, (a VLIW representative). Somewhere on the scale resided the ‘‘Digital Signal Processors’’ like the TSM 320. But also special purpose architectures like the PROPHID architecture have been developed for applications like multi-channel real time video or real time three dimensional graphics for ‘‘virtual reality’’. Late in the nineties the PROPHID architecture has been cast into an experimental prototype called ‘‘CPA’’ (Coprocessor Array). All those architectures need special software techniques to actually exploit their potential in terms of operation speed. The paper reviews some of the relevant features of the signal streams and the sort of processes that have to be executed on them. Then it discusses some hardware architectures that compete as media-processors. Eventually the question of software design for such architectures is addressed culminating in the description of some recently discovered scheduling techniques to be used in compilers/code generators for those processor...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} gut microbiota influences various metabolic {{and physiological}} processes. Substantial metabolic changes occur during a healthy pregnancy {{that may be}} related to microbiota composition dynamics. However, the effect of diet on intestinal microbiota composition and diversity during pregnancy remains unclear. We examined the ileal contents of Huanjiang mini-pigs at two pregnancy stages {{to determine the effects of}} dietary nutrient levels on such microbial communities. Animals received either a higher-nutrient (HN) diet formulated to meet US National Research Council requirements or a lower-nutrient (LN) diet that met the Chinese National <b>Feeding</b> <b>Standard</b> recommendations. On day 45 or 75 of pregnancy, sows were euthanized and their ileal contents sampled. Experimental diet and pregnancy stage did not affect ileal bacterial richness or diversity, as determined by Chao 1 and ACE species richness measures and Shannon and Simpson indices, respectively. The phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, accounting for 69. 99 - 85. 44 % and 5. 82 - 15. 17 % of the total reads, respectively, predominated regardless of diet. At the genus level, diet significantly affected the abundance of Lactobacillus species, which was greater in pigs given HN feed (P < 0. 05), but had little impact on that of Megasphaera species (P = 0. 096). Pregnancy stage had a minimal effect on Proteobacteria numbers (P = 0. 053). The number of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes and genus Lactobacillus decreased, while that of the phylum Proteobacteria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and genus Bacteroides increased between days 45 and 75 of pregnancy. Of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) measured, only propionate levels changed significantly, with higher concentrations observed on day 45 than on day 75. Our findings indicate that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominate pregnant sow ileal bacterial profiles. Excepting a tendency for the number of Proteobacteria to increase as pregnancy progressed, pregnancy stage and diet had little effect on ileal microbiotic composition and diversity and luminal SCFA concentrations...|$|E
