5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers {{about what to do}} if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|During {{the month}} of {{separation}} from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the instructions on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E

5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the Soviet threat had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E

During the Ten-Day War in June and July 1991, Špegelj once again urged Tuđman to act while the JNA fought Slovenia's TO. Špegelj's calls were echoed by Šime Đodan, who succeeded him as Defence Minister in July. Špegelj remained {{in command of the}} ZNG.|$|E

5|$|Washington, {{alarmed by}} what {{appeared}} to be an armed insurrection in Western Pennsylvania, asked his cabinet for written opinions about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State Randolph who urged reconciliation. Washington did bothhe sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. When the final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws, the president invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to summon the militias of Pennsylvania, Virginia and several other states. The governors sent the troops and Washington took command as Commander-in-Chief, marching into the rebellious districts.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great deal of money. Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the Woods Hole Institute to advise them on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> shark.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying {{in the last quarter of}} the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{took place}} in the Tower of London about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> revolt. The King had only a few troops at hand, {{in the form of the}} castle's garrison, his {{immediate}} bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E
5|$|Montcalm and Vaudreuil, {{who did not}} {{get along}} with each other, {{differed}} on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British threat. They had fewer than 5,000 regular troops, an estimated six thousand militia men, and {{a limited number of}} Indian allies, to bring against British forces reported to number 50,000. Vaudreuil, who had limited combat experience, wanted to divide the French forces, with about 5,000 each at Carillon and Louisbourg, and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the British in the Mohawk River on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York. Montcalm believed this to be folly, as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack. Vaudreuil prevailed, and in June 1758 Montcalm left Quebec for Carillon.|$|E

Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves {{the world to}} darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, {{you were in the}} right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E

5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} between the city authorities and the peasants were not continued. While the authorities debated at the Tagsatzung <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> insurrection, the peasants worked to gain support for their cause amongst the rural population of other regions and lobbied for a formal alliance. A peasant delegation sent to Zürich was turned back promptly: the city authorities, who had put down local unrests in their territory already in 1645 and again in 1646, had already recognized {{the danger of the}} agitation. On April 23, 1653, representatives {{of the people of the}} countryside of Lucerne, Bern, Basel, and Solothurn met at Sumiswald and concluded an alliance to help each other to achieve their goals. A week later, they met again at Huttwil, where they renewed that alliance and elected Niklaus Leuenberger from Rüderswil in the Emmental as their leader.|$|E
5|$|After Orlović's {{battalion}} {{entered the}} undefended village of Zamlača, the Serb rebels {{moved from one}} house to the next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found {{to move to the}} main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundać. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge of what had happened in Zamlača. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered them to run and then killed them. Unsure <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> situation, the Croatian forces withdrew from {{the southern part of the}} village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{delays in}} {{finalising}} arrangements for Operation Trio {{were caused by}} disagreements regarding where it would commence, who would be in command, the involvement of Chetniks and NDH forces, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> demarcation line between the German and Italian zones of occupation, and what local authorities would {{be put in place}} as localities were cleared of insurgents. The NDH contributed to the mutual suspicion between the Germans and Italians. The Italian demands prevailed, because they were committing larger forces to the operation. The decision was ultimately made to target all insurgents in eastern Bosnia between Sarajevo and the Drina. Throughout the preparation for Operation Trio, the Italians looked for opportunities to cross over the demarcation line and expand their sphere of influence into eastern Bosnia to take advantage of German weakness in the NDH. Bader's final orders for the operation granted several key Italian demands, including military control over civil affairs in the area of operations, fair treatment of the local population, and treating non-resisting Chetniks as prisoners of war.|$|E
