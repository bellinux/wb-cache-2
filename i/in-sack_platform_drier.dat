Turning, they hobbled with eager but painful {{steps in the}} direction of a larger camp-fire, situated to the right of the great rock that sheltered their lean-to. No hut or house showed there and none was needed. Hiding-places and homes for a hundred hunters were there in the sections of caverned cliffs, split off in bygone ages from the mountain wall above. A few stately pines stood out from the rocks, and a clump of silver spruce ran down to a brown brook. This camp was only a step from the lean-to, round the corner of a huge rock, yet it had been out of sight. Here indeed was evidence of a hunter's home--pelts and skins and antlers, a neat pile of split fire-wood, a long ledge of rock, well sheltered, and loaded with bags like a huge pantry-shelf, packs and ropes and saddles, tools and weapons, and a <b>platform</b> of <b>dry</b> brush as shelter for a fire around which hung on poles a various assortment of utensils for camp.|$|R
50|$|Breeding occurs {{once a year}} {{in spring}} or autumn in {{southern}} Australia, and {{before or after the}} monsoon in tropical regions. The nest is a small <b>platform</b> built of <b>dried</b> branches and sticks in the forks of trees that are standing in water. Nests are often located near other waterbirds such as other cormorants, herons, ibis, or spoonbills. Three to five (rarely six or seven) pale blue oval eggs measuring 48 x 32 mm are laid. The eggs are covered with a thin layer of lime, giving them a matte white coated appearance. They become increasingly stained with faeces, as does the nest, over the duration of the breeding season.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} ibises, the plumbeous ibis is a non-colonial breeder. Breeding occurs in sparsely wooded areas from March until mid-October. Nest {{building}} by both partners begins in March and takes {{about a month}} to complete. Nests are commonly constructed above or near to water on horizontal limbs of massive fig trees of Ficus species. or in the species Luehea paniculata. Some nests in Mato Grosso in Brazil have been found situated in trees above or near to farmsteads, which may further reflect this species’ association with humans. The nest typically measures 25 cm in height and 50 cm in width and consists of a loose, disorderly constructed <b>platform</b> of <b>dry</b> branches or sticks, with a hollow about 20 cm deep lined with dry grass and leaves; therefore resembling that of the wood stork. Both partners contribute to building the nest, which takes about a month to complete and is situated 10-12m above the ground; although some nests built in large fig trees in forested areas in the Pantanal may lie up to 20m above the ground. The same nest may also be used by a pair over consecutive years.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of petroleum field generates substantial values for Norway. In every development project {{there is always}} “local” and “global” contentment and Norwegian value creation depends on {{the combination of the}} two. Principally, Norwegian value creation is equal to contract value minus the value of imported goods and services for fabrication in Norway and value of Norwegian goods and services used in the fabrication for fabrication outside Norway. In this thesis, Norwegian value creation is defined as a fraction of field development cost that is delivered by Norwegian companies, measured in percentage. Cost estimation is performed using Acona Cost Estimation Software (ACES) software which breakdown field development cost into facilities-based costs and activity-based costs. This thesis estimates and analyzes Norwegian value creation in four different development projects namely Edvard Grieg, Ivar Aasen, Aasta Hansteen, and Gjøa. The four projects are chosen to represent the combination of fixed and floating production <b>platform,</b> <b>dry</b> tree and wet tree (subsea) wells, and local and foreign fabrication of platform. The analysis encompasses analysis of Norwegian value creation in facilities development and well development. Analysis of facilities development comprises 5 main facilities: (1) topside, (2) substructure, (3) subsea system, (4) export pipelines, and (5) power/fiber optic cables, and for every facility 5 main activities are examined: (i) fabrication, (ii) engineering, (iii) procurement, (iv) marine operation, and (v) project management. Analysis of well development covers 2 main activities: drilling service and well completion. The estimation result shows for facilities development Edvard Grieg generates the largest Norwegian value creation among the four projects estimated at 64 % of facilities development cost. Subsequent analysis then shows fabrication and procurement activities of topside account for the biggest development cost in a project. It indicates that location of topside fabrication and origin of goods and services used in topside development have significant effect in increasing Norwegian value creation of a project. For Edvard Grieg case, as both topside and substructure were fabricated in Norway and utilized more Norwegian suppliers in comparison to other projects it generates the highest Norwegian deliveries. This thesis also aims to analyze the competitiveness of local fabrication (i. e. fabrication in Norway) with respect to Norwegian krone exchange rates to US Dollar (NOK/USD). The analysis reveals that competitiveness of local fabrication increases when Norwegian krone depreciates against US Dollar in a long run. As for well development the four projects have comparable Norwegian value creation in a range 55 % - 61 % of respective well development cost. The comparable result is achieved because supply arrangements in drilling activities are practically the same between different projects and eventually similar suppliers are utilized...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{detailed study of}} high amplitude wave loadings on the hull of a paired column semisubmersible platform, for material selection during scantling. The recent development of deep draft paired column semisubmersible <b>platform</b> for <b>dry</b> trees application in the Gulf of Mexico has opened a new phase in the functionalities of semisubmersible platforms in the oil & gas industry. Its innovation nevertheless is not without {{the high cost of}} steel for hull columns and reinforcement during construction. A technique for hull weight reduction has been postulated with the possible application of composite girders and stiffeners on regions with less stress profile during high amplitude ocean loading for hull reinforcement. The column deformations and stress profile from fluid structural interactions have been studied, and a precise understanding of the material and structural deformation of the hull component has been recorded using FEA. Results have suggested that the drag effect of flow circulation within the hull formation is more dominant on the inner columns, and minimum steel reinforcement might be required on the sensitive areas around the inner columns. As expected, the un-submerged surface area received no significant stress variation irrespective of the wave amplitude profile and the bulking tendencies of the inner part of the outer column is also reduced...|$|R

While the normal crew fished from boats, the shore party felled trees to construct a small wharf or fishing stage and platforms of brush and small boughs upon which the fish would be dried about three feet above the ground. The boats returned to the fishing stage where they threw their catch to be gutted and split by the shore party, who then lightly salted the split fish and arranged them to <b>dry</b> on the <b>platforms.</b> The <b>drying</b> fish were covered with sailcloth every night and during fog or rainy weather, and rearranged periodically for several weeks until they hardened and could be stacked like boards.

40|$|Introduction: The most {{commonly}} used test for monitoring heparin therapy is the {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT). The response of available aPTT reagents to heparin varies significantly. The aim {{of this study was to}} highlight the differences between aPTT reagents stored in a dried format in order to select the most suitable formulations to be used for the development of point of care diagnostic devices used for monitoring of unfractionated heparin dose response. Methods: Ten reagents were analysed in terms of their performance in liquid and in dried form after storage for 24 h and 14 days. Performance was assessed by measurement of the clotting time (CT) as evidenced by the onset of thrombin formation using a chromogenic thrombin substrate in plasma samples activated with these formulations. Results: Reagents in all of the three forms tested (liquid, 24 h and 14 days) resulted in significant shortening of CTs in comparison to the non-activated plasma CT. Liquids returned more rapid CTs in comparison to dried reagents. Most reagents were more sensitive to heparin in dried, rather than in liquid form. Dried reagents based on kaolin as a surface activator were notably more effective in achieving short CT than others, while dried reagents composed of silica and synthetic phospholipids were the most sensitive to heparin. Conclusion: Two reagents, namely aPTT-SP and SynthASIL which are both based on synthetic phospholipids and silica, were identified as promising candidates for incorporation into point of care diagnostic device <b>platforms</b> as <b>dried</b> reagents...|$|R
40|$|Summary Lakeside {{settlements}} can {{be regarded}} as a special type of archaeological site, where, thanks to their location near the shoreline or in the lake, various kinds of organic remains have been preserved under waterlogged conditions. In this work, site formation processes from six Neolithic pile dwelling sites shall be presented from a micromorphological point of view. A series of natural and anthropogenic site formation processes were identified and have been compared with natural processes in peatlands. The main processes can be summarized as follows: in the littoral zone a carbonate lake marl stratum accumulated prior to construction of the settlement. During lake regressions, the shore <b>platform</b> became <b>dry</b> and the settlements were established. Throughout the period of occupation, anthropogenic processes led to the accumulation of manly organic and loamy layers. House building activities, food processing and livestock husbandry led to the accumulation of a complex puzzle of deposits. Further, signs of trampling on minerogenic and organic sediments are discussed. The depositional regime can be characterized as paludal, dominated by constant humidity, high accumulation rates, and rapid covering of the remains. Erosion and reworking processes as a result of lake flooding, and/or runoff from the hinterland have affected some parts of the anthropogenic accumulations. Finally, the degradation of organic matter occurred mainly during dry phases when the groundwater level dropped. Seasonality was of great importance in this kind of milieu throughout the various processes described above...|$|R

Microbial counts were found in all samples during fermentation and drying of the coffee beans. Counts of fungi in the coffee cherries collected from the tree (time 0) were around 1. 5 x 10 ³ CFU/g. This number increased slowly during the fermentation and drying reaching values of 2 x 10 (5) CFU/g within 22 days of processing. Two hundred and sixty three isolates of filamentous fungi were identified. The distribution of species during fermentation and drying was very varied while there was a predominance of Aspergillus species during storage period.

40|$|A small model {{oil field}} Tesla {{has been created}} based on {{assumptions}} and data from an existing field. With a lifetime of 8 years and expected total production of 8 million Sm 3 oil, it is a marginal development, where the development concept influence the net present value (NPV), which decides whether this field {{is going to be}} developed or not. The made assumptions are thoroughly described, and used for inputs in Acona Cost Estimation Software (ACES). The assumptions mainly apply to the subsea system, process concept and platform. Production profiles are also calculated, and these are important for dimensioning the process facilities. These assumptions were applied to 8 platform concepts and by using ACES the results in form of technical-, cost- and NPV reports were calculated. These results provided insight in e. g. which components on a production platform required great amount of structural material, the different amount of vessel days required for different marine operations, the basis for NPV calculations and how different platform concepts affected the NPV. The major differences between concepts and their NPV was that wet trees with subsea system is more expensive than dry trees, and drilling facilities are costly investments for a small field {{with a small amount of}} wells. The option of leasing production facilities gave a larger positive NPV than purchasing the facilities, and tie-back of close-by discoveries can extend lifetime and provide a higher NPV. The discussion summarizes what other factors can have an effect on the decided concept, and it is concluded that a jacket <b>platform</b> with <b>dry</b> trees is the most suitable development concept for the model field, due to its high NPV of 2955 million NOK, at an oil price of 75, 76 USD/bbl...|$|R

Skin formation and subsequent locking {{of the skin}} and morphology development were the main aspects studied. Droplets of initial solids content of 30 % (w/w), containing maltodextrin DE 12 and whey protein in varying ratios were dried at temperatures ranging between 40 °C and 90 °C at a sessile droplet <b>drying</b> <b>platform.</b> The droplet composition did not influence the initial drying rate or locking point, but had major influence on the morphology of the final particle. Particles with high amount of whey protein and/or dried at low temperatures were smooth and spherical with one large vacuole, whereas high maltodextrin concentrations and/or high temperature particles gave a wrinkled surface and multiple vacuoles. Results suggest that composition and drying temperature have a strong influence on particle morphology, and can be altered to steer morphology. Skin formation being a determining factor in morphology development in whey protein-rich systems is explained by sol-gel transition and in maltodextrin-rich systems by reaching a viscosity value that leads to critical skin rigidity. </p...|$|R
