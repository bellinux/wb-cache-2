Thus, diversity of marine benthos, interrupted by some collapses and plateaus, has risen from the Cambrian to the Recent, {{and there is no}} evidence that saturation has been reached. Rates of diversification per time unit for birds and butterflies increase towards the tropics. Allen et al. found a general correlation between environmental temperature and species richness for North and Central American trees, for amphibians, fish, Prosobranchia and fish parasites. They showed that species richness can be predicted from the biochemical <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism,</b> and concluded that evolutionary rates are determined by generation times and mutation rates both correlated with metabolic rates which have the same Boltzmann relation with temperature. They further concluded that these findings support the mechanisms for latitudinal gradients proposed by Rohde. Gillooly et al. (2002) described a general model also based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics which makes predictions about generation times as a function of body size and temperature. Empirical findings support the predictions: in all cases that were investigated (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic insects, zooplankton) generation times are negatively correlated with temperature. Brown et al.(2004) further developed these findings to a general metabolic theory of ecology. Indirect evidence points to increased mutation rates at higher temperatures, and the energy-speciation hypothesis is the best predictor for species richness of ants. Finally, computer simulations using the Chowdhury eosystem model have shown that results correspond most closely to empirical data when the number of vacant niches is kept large. Rohde gives detailed discussions of these and other examples. Of particular importance is the study by Wright et al. (2006) which was specifically designed to test the hypothesis. It showed that molecular substitution rates of tropical woody plants are more than twice as large as those of temperate species, and that more effective genetic drift in smaller tropical populations cannot be responsible for the differences, leaving only direct temperature effects on mutation rates as an explanation. Gillman et al. (2009) examined 260 mammal species of 10 orders and 29 families and found that substitution rates in the cytochrome B gene were substantially faster in species at warm latitudes and elevations, compared with those from cold latitudes and elevations. A critical examination of the data showed that this cannot be attributed to gene drift or body mass differentials. The only possibilities left are a Red Queen effect or direct effects of thermal gradients (including possibly an effect of torpor/hibernation differentials). Rohde (1992, 1978) had already pointed out that “it may well be that mammalian diversity is entirely determined by the diversity of plants and poikilothermic animals further down in the hierarchy”, i.e., by a Red Queen effect. He also pointed out that exposure to irradiation including light is known to cause mutations in mammals, and that some homoiothermic animals have shorter generation times in the tropics, which - either separately or jointly - may explain the effect found by Gillman et al. Gillman et al. (2010) extended their earlier study on plants [...] by determining whether the effect is also found within highly conserved DNA. They examined the 18S ribosomal gene in the same 45 pairs of plants. And indeed, the rate of evolution was 51% faster in the tropical than their temperate sister species. Furthermore, the substitution rate in 18S correlated positively with that in the more variable ITS. These result lend further very strong support to the hypothesis. Wright et al. (2010) tested the hypothesis on 188 species of amphibians belonging to 18 families, using mitochondrial RNA genes 12S and 16S, and found substantially faster substitution rates for species living in warmer habitats at both lower latitudes and lower elevations. Thus, the hypothesis has now been confirmed for several genes and for plants and animals.|$|E

40|$|For two centuries, {{biologists}} have documented a gradient of {{animal and plant}} biodiversity from the tropics to the poles but {{have been unable to}} agree whether it is controlled primarily by productivity, temperature, or historical factors. Recent reports that find latitudinal diversity gradients to be reduced or absent in some unicellular organisms and attribute this to their high abundance and dispersal capabilities would suggest that bacteria, the smallest and most abundant organisms, should exhibit no latitudinal pattern of diversity. We used amplified ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) whole-assemblage genetic fingerprinting to quantify species richness in 103 near-surface samples of marine bacterial plankton, taken from tropical to polar in both hemispheres. We found a significant latitudinal gradient in richness. The data can help to evaluate hypotheses about the cause of the gradient. The correlations of richness with latitude and temperature were similarly strong, whereas correlations with parameters relating to productivity (chlorophyll, annual primary productivity, bacterial abundance) and other variables (salinity and distance to shore) were much weaker. Despite the high abundance and potentially high dispersal of bacteria, they exhibit geographic patterns of species diversity that are similar to those seen in other organisms. The latitudinal gradient in marine bacteria supports the hypothesis that the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism,</b> setting the pace for life, has strong influence on diversity...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{rates of}} ectotherms (y) are often linearly related to {{temperature}} (Tc in C) within some biologically relevant {{range of temperatures}} as y = (1 /S) (Tc - Tb), where Tb is the estimated temperature at zero development, and the thermal constant S is the development time multiplied by the temperature above Tb (i. e. degree days above Tb). Among similar species, it has been widely shown that S and Tb are negatively related across environments, that S is positively related to body size, and that Tb is independent of body size but increases with mean environmental temperature. Here we present a model that predicts quantitatively each of these relationships by showing that the developmental rate equation (y) is a linear approximation to a universal exponential function (in Kelvin) reflecting the underlying biochemical <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The model combines the effects of body size and temperature on individual growth to explain the majority of variation in development rates among a broad assortment of aquatic ectotherms (fish, amphibians, zooplankton) at different life stages.

40|$|A rapid, sensitive, and {{selective}} method for {{the determination of}} betaines is described and discussed. The method entails derivatizing the quaternary ammonium compounds to increase their sensitivity to detection by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Sensitivity of detection increases markedly as {{the length of the}} carbon chain of the alcohol used to esterify the betaine carboxylic acid group is increased (C 4 > C 3 > C 2 > C 1 > C 0). The lower limit of detection of glycine betaine as the n-propyl ester is 0. 05 nanomole per microliter of glycerol. Betaine aldehyde can be readily derivatized to the di-n-butyl or di-n-propyl acetal derivatives which exhibit lower limits of detection of about 5 picomoles and 10 picomoles per microliter of glycerol, respectively. Accurate quantification of these compounds is accomplished by the use of deuterium labeled internal standards or quaternary ammonium compound homologs of distinct mass. Methods for the synthesis of these internal standards are reported.

40|$|Ecosystem {{respiration}} is the biotic {{conversion of}} organic carbon to carbon dioxide {{by all of}} the organisms in an ecosystem, including both consumers and primary producers. Respiration exhibits an exponential temperature dependence at the subcellular and individual levels, but at the ecosystem level respiration can be modified by many variables including community abundance and biomass, which vary substantially among ecosystems. Despite its importance for predicting the responses of the biosphere to climate change, it is as yet unknown whether the temperature dependence of ecosystem respiration varies systematically between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here we use the largest database of respiratory measurements yet compiled to show that the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in temperature is remarkably similar for diverse environments encompassing lakes, rivers, estuaries, the open ocean and forested and non-forested terrestrial ecosystems, with an average activation energy {{similar to that of the}} respiratory complex (approximately 0. 65 electronvolts (eV)). By contrast, annual ecosystem respiration shows a substantially greater temperature dependence across aquatic (approximately 0. 65 eV) versus terrestrial ecosystems (approximately 0. 32 eV) that span broad geographic gradients in temperature.

We quantitated the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> of apoE 4 in 19 normolipidemic apoE 3 homozygotes and 1 normolipidemic apoE 4 homozygote, and compared this with the metabolism of apoE 3 in 12 normolipidemic apoE 3 homozygotes. In the apoE 3 homozygous subjects, apoE 4 was catabolized {{twice as fast as}} apoE 3, with a mean plasma residence time of 0. 37 +/- 0. 01 d (+/- SEM) and 0. 73 +/- 0. 05 (P less than 0. 001), respectively. When plasma was fractionated into the lipoprotein subclasses, the greatest amount of labeled apoE 4 was present on very low density lipoproteins, while the largest fraction of labeled apoE 3 was associated with high density lipoproteins. The plasma apoE concentration was decreased in an apoE 4 homozygote compared with the apoE 3 homozygotes (3. 11 mg/dl vs. 4. 83 +/- 0. 35 mg/dl). The reduced apoE 4 concentration was entirely due to a decreased apoE 4 residence time in the apoE 4 homozygote (0. 36 d vs. 0. 73 +/- 0. 05 d for apoE 3 in apoE 3 homozygotes).

Here, we used a novel experimental protocol that allows profiling of newly transcribed RNAs in conjunction with an advanced computational modeling pipeline to explore the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> RNA <b>metabolism</b> and the underlying genetic determinants. In the first study, we investigated cell cycle regulated gene {{expression and}} the contributions of synthesis and degradation to mRNA levels in S. cerevisiae. During the cell cycle, the levels of hundreds of mRNAs change in a periodic manner, but how this is carried out by alterations in the rates of mRNA synthesis and degradation has not been studied systematically. We were able to derive mRNA synthesis and degradation rates every 5 minutes during the cell cycle, and thus provide {{for the first time a}} high-resolution time series <b>of</b> RNA <b>metabolism</b> during the cell cycle. A novel statistical model identified 479 genes that show periodic changes in mRNA synthesis and generally also periodic changes in their mRNA degradation rates. Peaks of mRNA degradation follow peaks of mRNA synthesis, resulting in sharp and high peaks of mRNA levels at defined times during the cell cycle. Whereas the timing of mRNA synthesis is set by upstream DNA motifs and their associated transcription factors (TFs), the synthesis rate of a periodically expressed gene is apparently set by its core promoter. In the second study, we developed metabolic labeling with RNA-Seq (4 tU-Seq) and novel computational methods to gain further insights into the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> RNA <b>metabolism</b> and its regulation.

Here we report on a mechanistic and quantitative correlation between the kinetics of aminopeptidase-based cleavage of L-Ala- 4 -methoxy- 2 -naphthylamide (Ala-MNA) in HaCaT sheets versus stripped human skin. Fresh human skin (breast or abdominal) was obtained from cosmetic surgery, tape-stripped, and dermatomed. HaCaT sheets were cultured on porous membranes. Diffusion and concurrent metabolism were studied under reflection and permeation conditions. Numerical simulations of simultaneous diffusion and saturable Michaelis-Menten metabolism {{were based on a}} physical model and a fixed set of independently obtained parameters (diffusion coefficient D, distance x, partition coefficient P, Michaelis constant Km, maximum metabolic rate Vmax). Under reflection conditions, cleavage of Ala-MNA in HaCaT sheets was very close to stripped skin. In contrast, in permeation studies substrate only permeated through HaCaT whereas passage through stripped skin led to full cleavage of Ala-MNA to MNA. All experimental data were in reasonable to excellent agreement with numerically generated data. Differences between HaCaT and stripped skin could be quantitatively and mechanistically explained by the thickness of the metabolically active layer, i. e., ≈ 10 µm in HaCaT and ≈ 40 µm in stripped skin. Full cleavage of permeating Ala-MNA in stripped skin was predicted to occur within the upper ≈ 20 µm of viable epidermis. Thus epidermal aminopeptidase activity may act as an efficient metabolic barrier to fully block the permeation of aminopeptidase labile xenobiotics.

The rapid advances {{in the use of}} molecular biology approaches has had an impact on all 4 components, but the greatest overall current and future impact will be on the dose-response assessment because this requires an understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, both background and induced by environmenta l agents. In this regard, hazard identi cation is a qualitative assessment and dose-response is a quantitative estimate. Thus, the latter will ultimately require a quantitative assessment of molecular endpoints that are used to describe the dose-response for cancer. It has been possible for many years to quantitate alterations {{at the level of the}} single gene. For example, analysis of mutation frequency by phenotypic selection, analysis of transcription (mRNA) by Northern blot, analysis of translation (proteins) by Western blot, and analysis of <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> from metabolite levels. However, it is becoming clear that it is necessary when considering risk for adverse health outcomes to develop quantitative approaches for whole cell phenotypes or organ effects.

Thus, there is the need to quantitate the circuitry of a cell: the metabolic/biochemical pathways, genetic regulation pathways, and signaling pathways in normal and stressed conditions. The hypothesis presented by Hanahan andWeinberg of the requirement for 6 acquired characteristics for tumor development, independen t of tissue type and species or inducer, seems to provide a viable approach.

Fatty acid synthesis was increased in subcutaneous and perirenal adipose tissue of pigs fed tallow. Tallow-fed pigs also had greater number of very small and very large adipocytes than did pigs fed soybean oil;In vivo kinetic parameters of plasma and lipoprotein cholesterol and measurements of dietary cholesterol absorption were examined in the second trial. As in the first trial, pigs fed diets containing tallow had greater plasma and lipoprotein cholesterol concentration than did pigs fed soy diets. Tissue cholesterol concentrations (liver, skeletal muscle, aorta, and viscera) were greater in pigs fed soy diets than in beef-fed pigs. Kinetic analyses indicated greater turnover of lipoprotein cholesterol in VLDL and HDL fractions of soy-fed pigs. Diet did not affect percent of dietary cholesterol absorbed as measured by two methods. Turnover of plasma cholesterol was unchanged by dietary treatment;Results from the two trials suggest that dietary fats and not dietary protein have significant effects on cholesterol metabolism in pigs; that is, unsaturated fats cause a redistribution of cholesterol within body pools such that changes in concentrations occur in metabolic subcompartments, but not in overall <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> of cholesterol...|$|E
40|$|A simple model {{simulating}} the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> drug <b>metabolism</b> inhibition {{interaction is}} investigated. The relative sensitivity of drug and metabolite concentration-time profiles as indices of inhibition is assessed. Under steady-state conditions where inhibitor concentrations are maintained constant, {{the determination of}} metabolite in addition to drug kinetics provides little additional information when inhibition is nonselective in nature. However metabolite profiles do offer increased sensitivity when parallel routes <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> exist and there is selectivity of inhibitory action. Non-steadystate conditions are also investigated as they often apply in inhibition studies; the inhibitor is often administered as a single dose or as a multiple dosing regimen rather than by a constant rate intravenous infusion. Under the former conditions, when inhibitor concentrations in the body fluctuate during the study, metabolite kinetics can be more useful than drug kinetics. The changes evident in the metabolite concentration-time profiles are substantial due to both the inhibition per se and the nonlinearity in the system arising from inhibitor elimination. It is concluded that metabolite kinetics provide a useful aid in the detection <b>of</b> drug <b>metabolism</b> inhibition interactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{diversification of}} animal groups {{known as the}} Cambrian Explosion (evolution's 'Big Bang') remains an unsolved puzzle in Earth Science. The Vendian–Cambrian interval is characterized by anomalously high rates of apparent plate motion, interpreted as True Polar Wander (TPW), and {{by more than a}} dozen large, high-frequency perturbations in carbon isotopes that dwarf all others observed through the past 65 million years. We suggest that these biological, tectonic, and geochemical events are intimately related in the following fashion. First, tropical continental margins and shelf-slopes which formed during fragmentation of the supercontinent Rodinia accumulated massive quantities of isotopically-light organic carbon during Late Neoproterozoic time, as indicated by strikingly heavy isotope ratios in inorganic carbon during interglacial intervals. Second, an initial phase of Vendian TPW moved these organic-rich deposits to high latitude, where conditions favored trapping biogenic methane in layers of gas hydrate and perhaps permafrost. Continued sedimentation during Late Vendian time added additional hydrate/gas storage volume and stabilized underlying units until the geothermal gradient moved them out of the clathrate stability field, building up deep reservoirs of highly pressurized methane. Finally, a burst of TPW brought these deposits back to the Tropics, where they gradually warmed and were subjected to regional-scale thermohaline eddy variation and related sedimentation regime changes. Responding to the stochastic character of such changes, each reservoir reached a critical failure point independently at times throughout the Cambrian. By analogy with the Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum event, these methane deposits yield transient, greenhouse-induced pulses of global warming when they erupt. Temperature correlates powerfully with biodiversity; the biochemical <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> at higher temperature decrease generation time and maintain relatively rich and dense invertebrate populations. Repeated thermal pulses along with progressive disruption and alteration of global ocean circulation patterns by TPW could cause the increase in diversity that accompanied the radiation of metazoans. We suggest that a methane 'fuse' ignited the Cambrian Evolutionary Explosion...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Chemistry, Washington State UniversityCytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes metabolize {{more than}} 80 % of {{clinically}} used drugs. Given {{a large role}} of CYP enzymes in drug metabolism, {{one of the goals}} in pharmaceutical industry is to understand metabolic rate and regioselectivity of a drug candidate in the early phase of drug discovery. A common practice in pharmaceutical industry to increase metabolic stability of a drug is to replace a carbon in an aromatic ring by a nitrogen so that the inserted nitrogen can coordinate with heme iron to form type II binding. This minor change in structure of a drug is believed to increase metabolic stability without altering the geometry and size of the compound. It has also been reported that type II binding compounds get metabolized significantly. But <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> of type II binding compounds is unknown. This work is focused to understand the metabolism, metabolic stability and regioselectivity of type II binding compounds. To explore the metabolism of type II binding compounds, we used saturation kinetics, surface plasmon resonance and electrochemical studies. Three possible mechanisms were described and analyzed to identify the kinetic of metabolism. Furthermore, to determine the effect of the type II binding on the metabolic stability of the drugs we developed a small library of the quinoline carboxamide compounds to systematically compare the metabolic stability and regioselectivity between structurally similar type I and type II binding compounds. The library contained same core structure but number and position of the nitrogen ware varied. On the basis of kinetic parameters variation in metabolic stability and regioselectivity was explained for the two binding modes. To measure the metabolic rate one should quantify the metabolites from a drug. A common practice for quantification is to use liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Given the difficulty in obtaining pure metabolites, usually signals from the metabolite and the substrate is considered equivalent. Herein we describe the error associated with this assumption by comparing the signals from twenty substrate/metabolite pairs using both conventional electrospray ionization and captive flow ionization in LCMS.

The experimental {{results suggest that the}} sugar consumption and ethanol production behaviors of the plant cell suspensions can be non-destructively and simultaneously monitored using the developed method.

40|$|Mechanistic {{understanding}} of bioaccumulation in different organisms and environments should {{take into account}} the influence of organism and chemical depending factors on the uptake and elimination <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> chemicals. Lipophilicity, <b>metabolism,</b> sorption (bioavailability) and biodegradation of chemicals are among the important factors that may significantly affect the bioaccumulation process in soil organisms. This study attempts to model elimination <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> organic chemicals in earthworms by accounting for the effects of both chemical and biological properties, including metabolism. The modeling approach that has been developed is based on the concept for simulating metabolism used in the BCF base-line model developed for predicting bioaccumulation in fish.
