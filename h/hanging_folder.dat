50|$|Another {{commonly}} used folder type is the <b>hanging</b> <b>folder,</b> which has hooks {{on all four}} corners that slide over a rail. Normally, hanging folders are used to file one or more manila folders, {{and it is not}} a common practice to put loose sheets directly into hanging folders. When some documents need to be retrieved, the corresponding manila folder(s) are removed from the <b>hanging</b> <b>folder.</b> The <b>hanging</b> <b>folder</b> itself is left in its place on the rails.|$|E
50|$|In February 2004, Pendaflex {{released}} {{another new}} product line, an update {{to the original}} <b>hanging</b> file <b>folder,</b> called Pendaflex Ready-Tab Hanging Folders. This product added pre-installed tabs {{across the top of}} the <b>hanging</b> <b>folders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many European {{companies}} engineer {{filing systems}} that accommodate <b>hanging</b> <b>folders</b> only; {{there are no}} drawer bottoms. In the US, most file drawers still have bottoms in the drawers so materials of any sort can be stored.|$|R
5000|$|The drawers of most {{vertical}} filing cabinets are engineered to accept <b>hanging</b> file <b>folders,</b> as these {{have come to}} dominate the way most users store information. Some files still have a [...] "follower block" [...] in each drawer. This is a device that adjusts the apparent depth of the drawer interior so that files are kept upright in the drawer. These are the legacy {{of a time when}} most filing was done with manila <b>folders</b> rather than <b>hanging</b> files.|$|R
50|$|In 1918, the Record Card Company first {{registered}} Oxford as a brand name. The {{success of}} the Oxford brand led the company to change its name in 1921 to the Oxford Filing Supply Company. The firm continued to specialize in filing supplies, introducing many new items which contributed {{to the growth of}} the filing industry. In 1939, the company began making expanding envelopes and introduced the convenience of file folder labels in rolls, as well as corrugated board transfer files in a drawer style. The company's most significant advance, however, was the Oxford Pendaflex <b>hanging</b> file <b>folder.</b> This was the now familiar filing pouch that hooked over the sides of a file drawer. Smaller files placed inside the hanging file allowed the drawer to be easily subdivided. The company called its Pendaflex hanging file the greatest development in filing since the evolution of the filing folder.|$|R
