60|$|<b>Dulse</b> is roasted by {{twisting}} it {{round the}} tongs fired to a red-heat, {{and the house}} was soon heavy with the smell of burning sea-weed. Leeby was at the dresser munching it from a broth-plate, while Hendry, on his knees at the fireplace, gingerly tore off the blades of <b>dulse</b> that were sticking to the tongs, and licked his singed fingers.|$|E

5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of Grand Manan residents live {{on the eastern side}} of the island. Due to limited access, 91 m cliffs, and high winds, the western side of the island is not residentially developed, although it does feature wind-power ventures and camps at Dark Harbour, a small <b>dulsing</b> community and get-away destination for islanders. Grand Manan has a network of trails for all-terrain vehicles, hiking, mountain biking, nature walks, and presents a challenging landscape for jogging. There are a number of fresh-water ponds, lakes and beaches that are prime locations for sun-bathing, beach combing, and picnics. Other interesting finds on Grand Manan are magnetic sand, and [...] "The Hole-In-The Wall" [...] located in Whale Cove in the village of North Head. Anchorage Provincial Park can be found on the island's southeastern coast between the communities of Grand Harbour and Seal Cove.|$|R
40|$|A polyphasic {{approach}} {{was used to}} evaluate the diversity and persistence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains during the production and ripening of two Flemish artisanal raw milk Gouda-type cheeses, Bellie and <b>Dulses.</b> During two consecutive productions with a one-month interval, samples of milk, starter, curd and cheese at various ripening times were sampled for conventional culturing using four different selective media. The resulting set of 734 isolates was identified using (GTG) (5) -PCR fingerprinting and sequence analysis of the 16 S rRNA and pheS genes. Isolated LAB mainly consisted of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus curvatus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus durans and Lactobacillus perolens. A combined typing approach including (GTG) (5) -PCR and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis revealed the presence of a Lc. lactis subsp. lactis isolate of the starter in ripened cheese at eight weeks and the persistence of several other LAB strains throughout the two successive production batches. Possibly, a number of these strains are autochthonous members of the microbial cheese production environment that {{play an important role in}} the development of the sensory properties of the cheese...|$|R

6000|$|One fine morning, {{just after}} the men had landed, and before they had {{commenced}} work, [...] "Long Forsyth", as his comrades styled him, went to a pool to gather a little <b>dulse,</b> of which {{there was a great}} deal on the rock, and which was found to be exceedingly grateful to the palates of those who were afflicted with sea-sickness.|$|E
60|$|The rolling of the Pharos lightship, too, {{became so}} great that sea-sickness prevailed {{to a large extent}} among the landsmen. One good arose out of this evil, however. Landing on the Bell Rock {{invariably}} cured the sickness for a time, and the sea-sick men had such an intense longing to eat of the <b>dulse</b> that grew there, that they were always ready and anxious to get into the boats when there was the slightest possibility of landing.|$|E

But I guess there's no danger, for Mrs. Lynde says I'm a very handsome child. Do you s'pose it'll last, Anne? I want to know?" ...|$|E
60|$|This morning, at five a.m., {{the bell}} rung {{as a signal}} for landing upon the rock, a sound which, after a lapse of ten days, it is {{believed}} was welcomed by every one on board. There being a heavy breach of sea at the eastern creek, we landed, though not without difficulty, on the western side, every one seeming more eager than another to get upon the rock; and never did hungry men sit down to a hearty meal with more appetite than the artificers began to pick the <b>dulse</b> from the rocks. This marine plant {{had the effect of}} reviving the sickly, and seemed to be no less relished by those who were more hardy.|$|E
6000|$|Go down at low spring-tide to {{the nearest}} ledge of rocks, and with a hammer and chisel chip off {{a few pieces of}} stone covered with growing sea-weed. Avoid the common and coarser kinds (fuci) which cover the surface of the rocks; for they give out under water a slime which will foul your tank: but choose the more {{delicate}} species which fringe the edges of every pool at low-water mark; the pink coralline, the dark purple ragged <b>dulse</b> (Rhodymenia), the Carrageen moss (Chondrus), and above all, the commonest of all, the delicate green Ulva, which you will see growing everywhere in wrinkled fan-shaped sheets, as thin as the finest silver-paper. [...] The smallest bits of stone are sufficient, provided the sea-weeds have hold of them; for they have no real roots, but adhere by a small disc, deriving no nourishment from the rock, but only from the water. Take care, meanwhile, that there be as little as possible on the stone, beside the weed itself. Especially scrape off any small sponges, and see that no worms have made their twining tubes of sand among the weed-stems; if they have, drag them out; for they will surely die, and as surely spoil all by sulphuretted hydrogen, blackness, and evil smells.|$|E

If she deign to lift you there, Murmur what I may not dare; In that archway, pearly-pink As the Dawn's untrodden brink, Murmur, 'Excellent and good, Beauty's best in every mood, Never common, never tame, Changeful fair as windwaved flame'-- Nay, I maunder; this she hears Every day with mocking ears, With a brow not sudden-stained With the flush of bliss restrained, With no tremor of the pulse More than feels the dreaming <b>dulse</b> In the midmost ocean's caves, When a tempest heaps the waves.

60|$|The wind still {{continued}} {{from the}} eastward {{with a heavy}} swell; and to-day it was accompanied with foggy weather and occasional showers of rain. Notwithstanding this, such was the confidence which the erection of the beacon had inspired that the boats landed the artificers on the rock under very unpromising circumstances, at half-past eight, and they continued at work till half-past eleven, being {{a period of three}} hours, which was considered a great tide's work in the present low state of the foundation. Three of the masons on board were so afflicted with sea-sickness that they {{had not been able to}} take any food for almost three days, and they were literally assisted into the boats this morning by their companions. It was, however, not a little surprising to see how speedily these men revived upon landing on the rock and eating a little <b>dulse.</b> Two of them afterwards assisted the sailors in collecting the chips of stone and carrying them out of the way of the pickmen; but the third complained of a pain in his head, and was still unable to do anything. Instead of returning to the tender with the boats, these three men remained on the beacon all day, and had their victuals sent to them along with the smiths'. From Mr. Dove, the foreman smith, they had much sympathy, for he preferred remaining on the beacon at all hazards, to be himself relieved from the malady of sea-sickness. The wind continuing high, with a heavy sea, and the tide falling late, it was not judged proper to land the artificers this evening, but in the twilight the boats were sent to fetch the people on board who had been left on the rock.|$|E
60|$|As {{the weather}} was {{extremely}} fine, with light airs of wind from the east, we landed without difficulty upon {{the central part of}} the rock at half-past five, but the water had not yet sufficiently left it for commencing the work. This interval, however, did not pass unoccupied. The first and last of all the principal operations at the Bell Rock were accompanied by three hearty cheers from all hands, and, on occasions like the present, the steward of the ship attended, when each man was regaled with a glass of rum. As the water left the rock about six, some began to bore the holes for the great bats or holdfasts, for fixing the beams of the Beacon-house, while the smith was fully attended in laying out the site of his forge, upon a somewhat sheltered spot of the rock, which also recommended itself from the vicinity of a pool of water for tempering his irons. These preliminary steps occupied about an hour, and as nothing further could be done during this tide towards fixing the forge, the workmen gratified their curiosity by roaming about the rock, which they investigated with great eagerness till the tide overflowed it. Those who had been sick picked <b>dulse</b> (Fucus palmatus), which they ate with much seeming appetite; others were more intent upon collecting limpets for bait, to enjoy the amusement of fishing when they returned on board of the vessel. Indeed, none came away empty-handed, as everything found upon the Bell Rock was considered valuable, being connected with some interesting association. Several coins and numerous bits of shipwrecked iron, were picked up, of almost every description; and, in particular, a marking-iron lettered JAMES--a circumstance of which it was thought proper to give notice to the public, as it might lead to the knowledge of some unfortunate shipwreck, perhaps unheard of till this simple occurrence led to the discovery. When the rock began to be overflowed, the landing-master arranged the crews of the respective boats, appointing twelve persons to each. According to a rule which the writer had laid down to himself, he was always the last person who left the rock.|$|E
6000|$|What I have remarked as {{peculiar}} to Editors {{of the class}} in which I venture to enrol you, is the happy combination of fortuitous circumstances which usually put you in possession of the works which you have the goodness to bring into public notice. One walks on the sea-shore, and a wave casts on land a small cylindrical trunk or casket, containing a manuscript much damaged with sea-water, which is with difficulty deciphered, and so forth. [Footnote: See the History of Automathes.] Another steps into a chandler's shop, to purchase a pound of butter, and, behold! the waste-paper on which it is laid is the manuscript of a cabalist. [Footnote: Adventures of a Guinea.] A third is so fortunate as to obtain {{from a woman who}} lets lodgings, the curious contents of an antique bureau, the property of a deceased lodger. [Footnote: Adventures of an Atom.] All these are certainly possible occurrences; but, I know not how, they seldom occur to any Editors save those of your country. At least I can answer for myself, that in my solitary walks by the sea, I never saw it cast ashore any thing but <b>dulse</b> and tangle, and now and then a deceased star-fish; my landlady never presented me with any manuscript save her cursed bill; and the most interesting of my discoveries in the way of waste-paper, was finding a favourite passage of one of my own novels wrapt round an ounce of snuff. No, Captain, the funds from which I have drawn my power of amusing the public, have been bought otherwise than by fortuitous adventure. I have buried myself in libraries to extract from the nonsense of ancient days new nonsense of my own. I have turned over volumes, which, from the pot-hooks I was obliged to decipher, might have been the cabalistic manuscripts of Cornelius Agrippa, although I never saw [...] "the door open and the devil come in."

In the SE region (Skaftafellssýslur), locals knew how to use the lyme grass (Leymus arenarius) (melkorn; sometimes called the Icelandic grain) for centuries, where it was used in compotes, bread, pancakes, etc. These grain substitutes gave the bread a distinctive character. <b>Dulse</b> breads and biscuits can be made by mixing <b>Dulse,</b> rye, and Icelandic Moss in equal proportions.|$|E
