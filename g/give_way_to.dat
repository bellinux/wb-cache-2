5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland {{has been}} seen as {{reaching}} its peak {{in the first half of}} the sixteenth century, between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots. The loss of the church as a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603, changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas. In the same period civic humanism began to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> private devotion and retreat from the world influenced by Stoicism. In art and architecture, Renaissance proportion began to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620.|$|E

5|$|In {{suitable}} environments, {{such as the}} Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, or {{the mixed}} podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand, forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community {{at the end of}} a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by taller plants, which in turn <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> trees that eventually form a forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{representative}} {{measures for}} embracing the German-Japanese partnership were sought {{and the construction}} of a new Japanese embassy building in Berlin was started. After the preceding embassy had to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Hitler's and Albert Speer's plans of re-modeling Berlin to the world capital city of Germania, a new and more pompous building was erected in a newly established diplomatic district next to the Tiergarten. It was conceived by Ludwig Moshamer under the supervision of Speer and was placed opposite the Italian embassy, thereby bestowing an architectural emphasis on the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis.|$|E

5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most importantly, {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E
5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is {{not associated with}} loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E
5|$|NY120 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US1 (Boston Post Road) {{in the city}} of Rye. The route proceeds northward along Purchase Street as a two-lane street through the Locust Avenue Business District, intersecting a handful of local streets and serving Rye's station on the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line. Past the station, the highway passes under the New Haven Line, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line, and I-95 in quick succession ahead of the Purchase Street Business District. The commercial surroundings <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> residential neighborhoods after three blocks as NY120 winds northward through the northern part of Rye to the adjacent village/town of Harrison.|$|E

5|$|NY38 {{continues}} {{north as}} an unnamed highway to the hamlet of Conquest, {{a small community}} built up around the intersection of NY38 and Fuller and Slayton Roads. It continues on into the town of Victory, where the undeveloped fields <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> cultivated fields used as farmland. The route heads through mostly desolate surroundings to the hamlet of Victory, a slightly larger community centered on NY38. The route proceeds through the hamlet, passing by several homes {{on its way to}} a junction with NY370 just north of the community. Past this point, the homes cease again as NY38 presses on through more fields and forests to the town of Sterling.|$|E
5|$|NY9N and NY22 head {{generally}} northward {{through an}} area of lowlands, which eventually <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Lake Champlain as the conjoined routes pass into the town of Crown Point. Once again, NY9N serves as the lakeside highway as it follows {{the western edge of}} the lake through the hamlet of Crown Point to the peninsula that gives the town its name. While NY9N and NY22 pass by Crown Point to the west, NY185 directly serves the peninsula and the Crown Point State Historic Site, located at its tip.|$|E
5|$|North of the Long Island Expressway, CR101 {{passes by}} the Christopher Morley Park and Golf Course {{to the east}} and {{residential}} neighborhoods to the west. Past the park, CR101 enters an area with more residential development as it begins to run along the western boundary of Roslyn Estates and the eastern edge of Manhasset. The homes <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> commercial developments as the highway approaches Flower Hill and NY25A (Northern Boulevard). Searingtown Road becomes Port Washington Boulevard and CR101 becomes NY101 upon intersecting NY25A.|$|E

5|$|Past Sunrise Highway, {{the route}} serves many blocks of residences prior to {{entering}} a cloverleaf interchange with the Heckscher State Parkway (exit43). After this junction, NY111 continues north as a two-lane residential {{street to the}} hamlet of Central Islip. Here, the residences <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> various businesses as NY111 and Islip Avenue briefly bend to the northwest for several blocks. Another north-northwesterly stretch follows, bringing the highway over another Long Island Rail Road line, this time the Ronkonkoma Branch. Past the railroad overpass, NY111 intersects with CR100 (Suffolk Avenue), at which point NY111 leaves Islip Avenue and changes names to Joshua's Path.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may {{compete with}} striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's {{stronger}} jaws can easily tear open flesh {{that is too}} tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even {{when there is no}} food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps.|$|E
5|$|Shaw and Crompton's built {{environment}} {{is similar to}} the urban structure of most towns in England, consisting of residential dwellings centred on a High Street in the town centre, which is the local centre of commerce. There is a mixture of low-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Shaw and Crompton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is residential; industrial areas and terraced houses <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> suburbs and rural greenery as the land rises out of the town. Generally, property in the centre, west, and south of the town is older and smaller in comparison to that found in the east and north.|$|E

5|$|The Aire and Calder {{was built}} for {{commercial}} freight, and although the volume carried has dropped significantly, particularly since coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section {{and much of the}} Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, and pleasure boats must <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> commercial vessels. 600 tonne vessels, designed to make maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as manoeuvrable as a narrow boat.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continues}} north, {{serving as}} the boundary between Searingtown and Albertson as it proceeds past side streets lined by homes. At I.U. Willets Road, CR101 serves Henry Wiscardi School and enters Searingtown. Just inside of the community, CR101 intersects Hilldale Drive and Dogwood Road, two local streets connecting to Herricks Middle School. The route continues on through Searingtown into the village of North Hills, where the homes <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> trees as it turns to the northeast and passes under the Northern State Parkway. A short distance after the Northern Parkway overpass, CR101 meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) by way of Nassau Boulevard—the southern service road—and North Service Road.|$|E
5|$|The route heads {{northwest}} from Winthrop, {{passing through}} heavily forested areas of St. Lawrence County. As NY420 passes out of Stockholm and into Norfolk, the forests surrounding the highway begin to taper off and <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> small pockets of residences and cultivated fields. The amount of homes {{along the route}} begin to increase upon intersecting Plum Brook Road, at which point NY420 becomes lined with residences for much of its run through north Norfolk. However, the string of homes ends near the northern town line, and the highway becomes flanked by forests once more as it curves northward and enters the town of Massena.|$|E
