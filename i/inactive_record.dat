50|$|An <b>inactive</b> <b>record</b> is {{a record}} {{that is no longer}} needed to conduct current {{business}} but is being preserved until it meets the end of its retention period, such as when a project ends, a product line is retired, or the end of a fiscal reporting period is reached. These records may hold business, legal, fiscal, or historical value for the entity in the future and, therefore, are required to be maintained for a short or permanent duration. Records are managed according to the retention schedule. Once the life of a record has been satisfied according to its predetermined period and there are no legal holds pending, it is authorized for final disposition, which may include destruction, transfer, or permanent preservation.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. When the U. S. {{acquired}} the Philippines {{at the end}} of the Spanish-American War in 1898, it also {{acquired the}} Spanish Crown's archives on the archipelago. The vagaries of war had resulted in the destruction of many of the colonial government's records, and those that had survived the upheaval were, in many instances, unsatisfactory to the officials of the newly-installed American government. Shortly thereafter, the Bureau of Archives was established to care for the existing Spanish records and house the <b>inactive</b> <b>records</b> of the American government. The archives played a crucial role in the entrenchment of the American colonial state in the Philippines. Over the next twenty years, the Bureau of Archives became more than just the repository for <b>inactive</b> <b>records</b> of the two colonial regimes. It collaborated with the Bureau of Lands in attempts to register public lands, to settle natives on theretofore uncultivated arable land, and to settle disputes about privately-owned land. During this period, the bureau also managed the government's new system to register cattle brands, trademarks and copyrights, a crucial function in the islands' economic development. The establishment and growth of the state's archives in the early years of colonial occupation were important to the suppression of the ongoing Philippine revolution, the disposition of seized lands, and the development of a colonial economy. Though a much less spectacular and less memorable colonial project than the establishment of public education or the construction of roads, it was precisely the Bureau of Archives' insidiousness that made it so effective. The Bureau of Archives was not a passive receptacle for the government's unneeded documents; and it did not simply document the work of the colonial state. It was part of the undeniably political and ambitious project of American empire...|$|R

5000|$|Disposition is the {{practice}} of handling information that is less frequently accessed or has met its assigned retention periods. Less frequently accessed records may be considered for relocation to an <b>inactive</b> <b>records</b> facility until they have met their assigned retention period. [...] "Although {{a small percentage of}} organizational information never loses its value, the value of most information tends to decline over time until it has no further value to anyone for any purpose. The value of nearly all business information is greatest soon after it is created and generally remains active for only a short time --one to three years or so-- after which its importance and usage declines. The record then makes its life cycle transition to a semi-active and finally to an inactive state." [...] Retention periods are based on the creation of an organization-specific retention schedule, based on research of the regulatory, statutory and legal requirements for management of information for the industry in which the organization operates. Additional items to consider when establishing a retention period are any business needs that may exceed those requirements and consideration of the potential historic, intrinsic or enduring value of the information. If the information has met all of these needs and is no longer considered to be valuable, it should be disposed of by means appropriate for the content. This may include ensuring that others cannot obtain access to outdated or obsolete information as well as measures for protection privacy and confidentiality.|$|R

The value of this correlation in patients with Chagas heart disease is currently unknown. Objective: Determine the correlation of the QRS-T angle and the risk of induction of ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation (VT / VF) during electrophysiological study (EPS) in patients with Chagas disease. Methods: Case-control study at a tertiary center. Patients without induction of VT / VF on EPS were used as controls. The QRS-T angle was categorized as normal (0 - 105 º), borderline (105 - 135 º) or abnormal (135 - 180 º). Differences between groups for continuous variables were analyzed with the t test or Mann-Whitney test, and for categorical variables with Fisher's exact test. P values < 0. 05 were considered significant. Results: Of 116 patients undergoing EPS, 37. 9 % were excluded due to incomplete information / <b>inactive</b> <b>records</b> or due to the impossibility to correctly calculate the QRS-T angle (presence of left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation). Of 72 patients included in the study, 31 induced VT / VF on EPS. Of these, the QRS-T angle was normal in 41. 9 %, borderline in 12. 9 % and abnormal in 45. 2 %. Among patients without induction of VT / VF on EPS, the QRS-T angle was normal in 63. 4 %, borderline in 14. 6 % and abnormal in 17. 1 % (p = 0. 04). When compared with patients with normal QRS-T angle, those with abnormal angle had a fourfold higher risk of inducing ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation on EPS [odds ratio (OR) 4; confidence interval (CI) 1. 298 - 12. 325; p = 0. 028]. After adjustment for other variables such as age, ejection fraction (EF) and QRS size, there was a trend for the abnormal QRS-T angle to identify patients with increased risk of inducing VT / VF during EPS (OR 3. 95; CI 0. 99 - 15. 82; p = 0. 052). The EF also emerged as a predictor of induction of VT / VF: for each point increase in EF, there was a 4 % reduction in the rate of sustained ventricular arrhythmia on EPS.
