25|$|Extreme {{temperatures}} present <b>geographical</b> <b>constraints</b> in {{the distribution}} of aquatic species, indicating temperature tolerance plays a role in the lionfish’s survival, reproduction, and range of distribution. The abrupt differences in water temperatures north and south of Cape Hatteras directly correlate with the abundance and distribution of Pterois. Pterois expanded along the southeastern coast of the United States and occupied thermal-appropriate zones within 10 years, and the shoreward expansion of this thermally appropriate habitat is expected in coming decades as winter water temperatures warm in response to anthropogenic climate change. Although the timeline of observations points to the east coast of Florida as the initial source of the western Atlantic invasion, the relationship of the United States East Coast and Bahamian lionfish invasion is uncertain. Lionfish can tolerate a minimum salinity of 5 parts per thousand and even withstand pulses of freshwater, which means they can also be found in estuaries of freshwater rivers.|$|E

Check-ins {{of an individual}} tend to localize in a specific geographical range. We propose a novel model to capture personalized <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint</b> of each individual. On the other hand, PoIs reflect requirements of people from different aspects. Usually, places of different functions show different temporal visiting distributions and places of similar function share similar visiting pattern in temporal aspect. Temporal distribution similarity {{can be used to}} characterize functional similarity. Based on the findings above, this paper introduces improved collaborative filtering models by jointly taking advantages of <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint</b> and temporal similarity.

40|$|Two {{empirical}} papers study US housing {{markets and}} treat {{the impacts of}} both natural geographic constraints, such as water bodies and steep slopes, and regulatory restrictions. Albert Saiz (2010) concentrates on identifying the impact of natural geographic constraints. Saiz creates measures of developable land using an invariant 50 -kilometer radius about an urban focal point. I criticize SaizÃ¢â¬â¢s <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint</b> {{on the basis that}} its invariant radius renders comparisons between urban areas of differing sizes of questionable value. Moreover, the inter-relation between the two kinds of constraints—the natural and the regulatory—is highly particular to the locale; for example, the effect of a natural <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint</b> would be neutralized by an interior regulatory constraint such as an urban growth boundary. Haifang Huang and Yao Tang (2010) concentrate on the impact of regulatory constraints on booms and busts in local housing markets, but they also make use of the natural-constraint data furnished by Saiz. Both studies also use the Wharton Land Use Regulatory Index, about which I raise a number of questions. I believe that the procedures employed by the two papers have the tendency to understate, at the aggregate level, the pernicious impact of regulatory restrictions.

40|$|Using a {{geographical}} scale-free network to describe relations between {{people in a}} city, we explain both superlinear and sublinear allometric scaling of urban indicators that quantify activities or performances of the city. The urban indicator Y(N) of a city with the population size N is analytically calculated by summing up all individual activities produced by person-to-person relationships. Our {{results show that the}} urban indicator scales superlinearly with the population, namely, Y(N) ∝ N^β with β> 1 if Y(N) represents a creative productivity and the indicator scales sublinearly (β< 1) if Y(N) is related to the degree of infrastructure development. These coincide with allometric scaling observed in real-world urban indicators.

30|$|Unlike Philip A. Kuhn, Tan Chee-Beng {{emphasized}} the “ethnic cultural sphere” {{in the study}} of overseas Chinese, which breaks the <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint</b> of region-level and nation-level anthropological studies. He believed that Chinese people around the world share similar characteristics of Chinese “culture,” though such characteristics are divideddue to cultural localization and cultural changes. The concept of “Chinese cultural sphere” applies to studying the diverse expressions of acculturation and cultural identity of Chinese and overseas Chinese in different regions(Tan Chee-Beng, 2012). The Chinese communities of the South China Sea Rim and the multiple social networks based on kinship, geo-relation and religion are key components of this “Chinese cultural sphere.” Their cultural characteristics are mainly embodied in the religion, food culture, identity psychology, multinational societial organizations, localization process and the like. Chen utilized a cross-regional perspective to view the spatial-temporal diffusion, flow and change of ethnic culture and, on that basis, constructed a larger community. Community, in this context, weaves a huge identity-based social network that crosses community, state or even region.|$|R

40|$|Local search {{services}} allow a user {{to search}} for businesses that satisfy a given <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint.</b> In contrast to traditional web search engines, current local search services rely heavily on static, structured data. Although this yields very accurate systems, it also implies a limited coverage, and limited support for using landmarks and neighborhood names in queries. To overcome these limitations, we propose to augment the structured information available to a local search service, based on the vast amount of unstructured and semi-structured data available on the web. This requires a computational framework to represent vague natural language information about the nearness of places, {{as well as the}} spatial extent of vague neighborhoods. In this paper, we propose such a framework based on fuzzy set theory, and show how natural language information can be translated into this framework. We provide experimental results that show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and demonstrate that local search based on natural language hints about the location of places with an unknown address, is feasible...|$|R
40|$|As a {{means to}} keep pace with today's {{globally}} networked society, the home is reconceived as a portable, transformable device that adapts and reconfigures itself to coexist within a range of changing terrains. Ownership will no longer act as a <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint</b> limiting world-wide, long-term travel. Mobile housing affords one the means to explore the landscape without sacrificing the sense of place and permanence provided by "home". Analogous to the work of Archigram, "homes" of the future will have the ability to migrate according to the needs and desires of their populations. This thesis explores the possibilities of transformational, mobile architecture that delivers a diverse range of settlement options. As a means of demonstrating the flexibility of this concept, this micro-home will be incorporated into the social and technological framework of the modem metropolis and examined at both the urban scale of the city and at the micro-scale of the individual.

For example: Cyberfeminism can be a critique at equality in cyberspace, challenge the gender stereotype in the cyberspace, examine the gender relationship in cyberspace, examine the collaboration between human and technology, examine the relationship between women and technology and more. For examples: the innovation of internet has a huge impact on women’s lives (Like how the innovation of telephone bought women security from crime and no longer being isolated from <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint),</b> the idea of digital life has been introduced to all users of the internet; but is this new technology liberating or oppressing women?

As many studies show, Inovcluster (which has 158 associates, from which 120 are enterprises) is also a geographic region cluster, which improves innovation performance of businesses seeking to gain competitiveness and ability to improve their exportations in the agro-industrial Portuguese sector. The role of the cluster is fundamental to creating a model for knowledge transfer of innovation capacity, interconnecting its institutional, scientific and business associates. This model has to be adapted to the sector and enterprise characteristics, relying in an interconnecting structure which is more or less decentralized according to the mentioned features. Here we present an experience and case study of the Inovcluster ecosystem and its trends and innovation transfer to business value creation, contextualized within the regional strategy for smart specialization. We have shown how, through the establishment of an Inovcluster network, it is possible to integrate the contribution of different research and academic centres, channelled to assist micro-enterprises by innovating within a <b>geographical</b> <b>constraint...</b>|$|R
