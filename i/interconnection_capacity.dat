40|$|Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms (CRMs) are {{implemented}} in European countries {{to help to}} achieve national generation adequacy targets. In contradiction to the European harmonization process towards the Internal Energy Market (IEM) national CRMs may introduce distortion and implicit competition of market designs. By remunerating capacity, CRMs introduce additional revenue streams based on availability (in €/MW). The objective to reach a European-wide economically efficient generation mix might not be reached due to differing investment signals originating from different market designs. The harmonization process of short-term energy markets based on energy output, remunerated in €/MWh, makes use of <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacity</b> to exchange energy between market areas. This causes prices to converge prices if <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacity</b> is sufficient. Consequently, there is an interaction between implemented market designs, with or without CRMs, {{and the need for}} <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacity.</b> While for harmonized short-term energy-based markets the use of interconnection lines is common, cross-border participation and the usage of interconnection lines for CRMs is mostly unexploited.

The German data of 2012 are scaled to a 100 % supply of the electricity consumption by renewable sources. Wind and PV power are mixed in a ratio which minimises back-up energy. The 100 %, optimal mix data are used to identify the powers to be installed, the accumulating backup and surplus energies, the size of storage to replace thermal back-up power, the possibilities of demand-side-management, and the specific CO 2 production.

40|$|AbstractEU {{goals and}} {{policies}} have significant consequences for Norway affiliated through the EEA-agreement. Through the EU Climate Package, EU aims to reduce total GHG emissions in all EU member states 20 % {{and increase the}} share of renewable energy to 20 % by 2020. Norway already has a share of renewable energy of more than 60 %, and {{to live up to}} EUs requirements Norway may have to increase its share to 75 %. New power production is expected to cover most of the increase. Because of energy efficiency and a shift to renewable heat in buildings, general consumption in Norway is expected to decrease. This implies that Norway may see a huge power surplus in 2025 in this report estimated power surplus equals 15 - 19 TWh. This surplus can be exported out of the country to Continental Europe through interconnectors. To analyze possible effects on Norwegian power prices, and thus the effects on the investment potential for renewable heat, a set of scenarios have been prepared looking at the price effects of different interconnection capacities to the Continent. The modeling tool Samlast is used for the simulations. The report assumes that fuel and CO 2 prices are high as a result of increased economic growth and climatic focus. The Continent, with its large share of thermal power generation in its system, is to a large degree affected by this and because of its connection to the Continental markets, Norway is also likely to be affected too. Results indicate that Norwegian power prices will rise from current price level in all scenarios and prices increase with increased <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacity.</b> Price differences between Norway and the Continent are significant in all scenarios, and decrease with increased <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacity.</b> With low <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacity,</b> water is spilled in Norway and power prices can drop to zero during years of high inflow. With high <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacity</b> is it unlikely that prices will come as low as current price level. Some of the results obtained in the simulations seem a bit unreasonable and it was therefore attempted to examine whether {{there was something wrong with}} the simulations. The examination led to nothing, and the results may even be correct. If so, Norwegian power prices are to a large extent affected by fuel prices and the price on CO 2, also in case of relatively low <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacity</b> to the Continent. Price on renewable heat is fixed by law to be lower than the power price and the profitability of investments in renewable heat is determined by income versus total costs. The profitability of such investments is not discussed in this report...|$|E

40|$|Thanks {{to growing}} {{environmental}} concerns, renewable energies take a higher andhigher share of electricity generating portfolios. In Germany particularly, the installedcapacity {{of wind and}} solar plants has increased continuously {{for the past ten}} years. Given theprinciple of the merit-order dispatch, a greater use of wind and solar power allows theelectricity spot prices to drop significantly. However, wind and sun are both intermittentresources, and this leaves great room for uncertainties on prices. As a consequence, pricesbecome much more dependent on the weather conditions and show greater volatilities,making hedging much more difficult. At the same time, the mechanism of market coupling inthe Central West Europe (France, Germany, Benelux) goes toward a harmonization of prices. As such, the cross-border interconnections play a decisive role in the electricity pricing. This paper deals with the actual influence of the interconnections between France andGermany on electricity spot prices when renewable energies are added to the energy mix. Amodel of a French-German market is made in order to see the impact of an increasingpenetration of renewable energies on spot prices. The wind and solar generations aremodelled using artificial neural networks, ANN. Multiple linear regression is employed tomodel the French and German loads. The cross-border interconnections are modelled basedon the capacity allocations published by RTE (the national French grid operator) and finallythe French and German prices are modelled with a GARCH process to study the volatilities. The study is made for three different scenarios: the reference scenario, with a penetration ofrenewable energies as seen in 2012, a 2020 scenario, with a penetration of renewable energiesas predicted in 2012, and a 2020 scenario with increased <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacities</b> betweenFrance and Germany. Running the models shows that a higher penetration of renewable energies lowers spotprices in average, but introduces price spikes that did not exist beforehand. On short periodsof observation, the volatility seems to decrease, but on longer periods, the spikes increase thevolatility. Also, increasing the <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacities</b> does make the prices converge, butto a certain extent only. Finding fitting hedging strategies becomes more delicate when prices vary with suchuncertainty. The study could be more developed (by extending it to the whole Europeancontinent) {{in order to get a}} more accurate vision of how energy markets will look like in a fewyears. However, it must be understood that the future scenarios depend on many variablefactors, and no mathematical model is able to capture all those factors accurately...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} HECTOR, {{a new and}} advanced long-term electricity market model that simulates market behavior bottom-up through opportunistic, variable cost-based bidding of individual power plants into auction-based national markets with international <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacities.</b> Unlike most other approaches, we implement the objective function on an hourly level. This allows for a reduction of the solution space, and enables a higher modeling resolution, including opportunistic bidding behavior of power plants based on expected supply scarcity, and ex-post investment decisions based on NPV considerations. The model simulates the electricity markets of 19 European countries, with over 400 groups of power plants, {{and is able to}} closely approximate historic electricity prices. The average base load price computed by the model for 2006 - 2008 and across the largest regions in Europe is 54. 5 €/MWh, compared to 54. 8 €/MWh in reality, using 2005 as training period.

It was demonstrated that some of these characteristics might complicate the deregulation process. This paper analyses the ongoing deregulation process in the European electricity sector and attempts to establish whether these difficulties can more readily be solved at European level. It would appear that some problems, e. g. economies of scale in electricity generation, have less of an impact at European level than within smaller national markets. However, a number of difficulties have to be overcome before a unified European electricity market can become a reality. These include the limited <b>interconnection</b> <b>capacities</b> between Member States. The European Commission has taken steps to improve the situation, for example by offering financial support for investments and promoting the development of regional markets as an interim measure ultimately leading to a fully integrated market. Apart from the difficulties related to electricity generation and transmission there are also exogenous factors that influence the ongoing deregulation process, e. g. the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and the dramatic increases in primary fuel prices. This paper argues that a consistent, stable and uniform European regulatory framework must be put in place if the impact of these difficulties is to be minimised. Electricity deregulation...|$|R
