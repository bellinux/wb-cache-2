40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>dissemination</b> <b>and</b> uptake of health research into policy and program delivery in four developing countries. In-depth {{interviews were conducted}} with health researchers, policymakers and practitioners at both local and national level. The study highlights the similarities across the study countries in the barriers to effective <b>dissemination</b> <b>and</b> uptake of research results. A fundamental barrier to the uptake of research by decision-makers is the lack of appreciation of the important contribution that research can make to policy and program development. A further barrier is researcher’s lack of appropriate ‘packaging’ of research findings which consider the needs of different policy audiences. Dissemination within academic circles also restricts access by decision-makers and practitioners. Overcoming the barriers requires effort on behalf of researchers, decision-makers and donor agencies. The strong presence of donor agencies in developing countries places them in a position to both enable <b>and</b> to encourage <b>dissemination</b> activities <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> between researchers <b>and</b> policymakers or practitioners. Increased collaboration between all three parties {{is one of the key}} strategies towards increasing the uptake of research into health policy and program development...|$|R
