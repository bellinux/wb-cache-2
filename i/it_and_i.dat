5|$|I hemmed and hawed {{about it}} for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what {{everybody}} else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, my husband makes me breakfast and he's excited about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> kind of don't have time to eat. As a police officer, I have a male partner and the video goes through our days. My husband's at work and has attractive girls flirting with him but he declines their advances. I have a guy flirting with me, and I flirt back.|$|E
5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E

5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think you can tell.|$|E

5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That's more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this thing.

25|$|I don't. I {{support the}} Hyde Amendment. I hate abortion. I wish people didn't have abortions. I {{believe that the}} Hyde Amendment should remain the law. States should make their decision.

25|$|It {{became a}} burden. Some {{people say it}} helped me invent {{the kind of music}} I play, but I don’t know whether it did. It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn to live with.

Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time I liked school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E

It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn.
