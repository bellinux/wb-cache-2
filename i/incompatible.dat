5|$|Acts <b>incompatible</b> with Singapore citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Some older 48K and 128K {{games were}} <b>incompatible</b> with the machine. The ZX Interface 1 was <b>incompatible</b> due to {{differences}} in ROM and expansion connector, making it impossible to connect and use the Microdrive units.|$|E
5|$|A valve ejected during filling due to <b>incompatible</b> thread {{killed the}} {{operator}} by impact to the chest.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} connectors were deliberately {{intended to}} enforce the directed topology of a USB network: type-A receptacles on host devices that supply power and type-B receptacles on target devices that draw power. This prevents users from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other, {{which could lead to}} short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire. USB does not support cyclic networks and the standard connectors from <b>incompatible</b> USB devices are themselves <b>incompatible.</b>|$|E
5|$|A valve failed on a diver’s {{emergency}} cylinder on {{a diving}} support vessel during {{preparation for a}} dive injuring five divers. The cylinder valve was ejected at 180 bar due to <b>incompatible</b> thread. Pillar valve was M25x2 parallel thread and cylinder was a 3/4″x14 BSP parallel thread.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{presented}} Xem as his Aeonic Word to the Setians, presenting it as {{a natural}} and necessary further development of Aquino's Xeper. Aquino later acknowledged Xem as a worthwhile magical concept for Setians to explore, but found Barrett's insistence on its exclusivity as <b>incompatible</b> with the Temple's individualistic philosophy.|$|E
5|$|DIN valves are {{produced}} in 200 bar and 300 bar pressure ratings. The {{number of threads}} and the detail configuration of the connections is designed to prevent <b>incompatible</b> combinations of filler attachment or regulator attachment with the cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{reserved}} {{the right}} not to apply Article 8 (the right to form and join trade unions) insofar as existing measures (which at the time included compulsory unionism and encouraged arbitration of disputes) were <b>incompatible</b> with it.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 2012, Perl 5.16 was released. Notable new {{features}} include {{the ability to}} specify a given version of Perl that one wishes to emulate, allowing users to upgrade their version of Perl, but still run old scripts that would normally be <b>incompatible.</b> Perl 5.16 also updates the core to support Unicode 6.1.|$|E
5|$|Sold {{exclusively}} in North America, the Nomad was never officially released worldwide, and employs a regional lockout. Sega's {{focus on the}} Sega Saturn left the Nomad undersupported, and the handheld itself was <b>incompatible</b> with several Genesis peripherals, including the Power Base Converter, the Sega CD, and the 32X.|$|E
5|$|The {{freedom to}} display {{femininity}} and gender equality seem <b>incompatible</b> in Chinese society. Gender equality appeared prevailing only when women were restricted to desexualization in the Mao era. Opening up policy guarantees women's freedom for resexualization, but it simultaneously brings back gender inequality.|$|E
5|$|The pre-battle {{sacrifice}} is <b>incompatible</b> {{with the first}} and second boons, but the cults have their own explanations. The self-sacrifice prior to the war is <b>incompatible</b> with dying a heroic death during the war and both are <b>incompatible</b> with living to see the full duration of the war. The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma, holding that Aravan's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to die a heroic death on the eighth day of the war. The Kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about the second boon of Aravan's continued observation of the war. On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation of the war, holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day, observing the remainder of the war through the eyes of his severed head.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two <b>incompatible</b> components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
5|$|A {{person is}} disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include {{engaging}} in acts <b>incompatible</b> {{with being a}} Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence. The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners {{the right to vote}} has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|A valve ejected due to <b>incompatible</b> thread (metric valve in {{imperial}} cylinder) injured commercial diver by {{impact on}} the back of the helmet during preparations for a dive. Cylinder had been under pressure for several days following hydrostatic testing, and no particular triggering event was identified. Diver was knocked down and bruised but protected from serious injury by the helmet.|$|E
5|$|Agârbiceanu {{spent his}} last {{decade and a}} half under a {{communist}} regime that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved <b>incompatible</b> with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, {{with the possible exception of}} his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the Clal Center {{was the target}} of criticism. Some critics decried the {{decision}} to demolish the historic Alliance Vocational School in order to build the project in the first place. Others pointed out that the style and height of the building were <b>incompatible</b> with typical low-rise Jerusalem architecture in the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International organises {{campaigns to}} protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a {{prisoner}} of conscience because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association. Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was {{the winner of the}} 2009 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award. In legislation, a conscience clause is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is <b>incompatible</b> with religious or conscientious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|As {{a widely}} used {{international}} standard, ISO 3166-1 is implemented in other standards {{and used by}} international organizations to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information. However, {{it is not the}} only standard for country codes. Other country codes used by many international organizations are partly or totally <b>incompatible</b> with ISO 3166-1, although some of them closely correspond to ISO 3166-1 codes.|$|E
5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically <b>incompatible),</b> while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.|$|E
5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} {{would have created}} a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of <b>incompatible</b> and heat-producing elements.|$|E
5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are <b>incompatible.</b> This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E
5|$|During the {{development}} of these algorithms and tables, it was recognized that a successful algorithm could be used to replace the existing collection of <b>incompatible</b> tables for various air and Nitrox diving modes currently in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual with a set of mutually compatible decompression tables based on a single model, which was proposed by Gerth and Doolette in 2007. This has been done in Revision 6 of the US Navy Diving Manual published in 2008, though some changes were made.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was <b>incompatible</b> with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
5|$|Governor Lane {{kept the}} legal {{code of the}} {{dissolved}} provisional government, only immediately repealing the law authorizing the minting of the Beaver Coins, as this was <b>incompatible</b> with the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8). The creation of the Washington Territory in 1854 removed the northern half of the Oregon Territory. Established on 14 February 1859, the state of Oregon was composed roughly the western half the territory, the remaining eastern section being added to the Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|Grown on agar plates, the mycelia of A.serialiformis and A.serialis have {{identical}} chemical reactivity, and {{are rather}} similar in appearance, although the authors {{note that the}} former's was more cottony than the latter's. The authors mated several combinations of North American collections using vegetative compatibility tests, and confirmed the presence of different mating alleles—indicating {{that all of the}} North American collections represented a single species. Similar pairings performed between North American and European collections showed the species to be <b>incompatible,</b> and therefore distinct.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans would lead to the system opening in 1966, after the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway to metro standard, and supplemented with the new Furuset and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third rail power supply. This would make the metro <b>incompatible</b> with the existing tramways.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is <b>incompatible</b> with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of a {{northern}} location counter that this site is {{not supported by}} the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role <b>incompatible</b> with a proposed northern location.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese Rites {{controversy}} was {{a dispute}} among Roman Catholic missionaries over the religiosity of Confucianism and Chinese rituals during the 17th and 18th centuries. The debate centered over whether Chinese ritual practices of honoring family ancestors and other formal Confucian and Chinese imperial rites qualified as religious rites and were thus <b>incompatible</b> with Catholic belief. The Jesuits argued that these Chinese rites were secular rituals that were compatible with Christianity, within certain limits, and should thus be tolerated. The Dominicans and Franciscans, however, disagreed and reported {{the issue to}} Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic Andalusi philosopher Averroes or Ibn Rushd (11261198) {{criticized the}} {{argument}} on its methodology. Averroes, an avid Aristotelian, argued that God's existence {{has to be}} shown {{on the basis of}} the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on physics, and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful. Other Muslim philosophers such as Al-Ghazali (10581111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed <b>incompatible</b> with God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary. Al-Ghazali disputed this as <b>incompatible</b> with the concept of God's untrammelled free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's Asharite theology. He further argued that God's free choice can be shown by the arbitrary nature of the exact size of the universe or the time of its creation.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Interface 1 add-on module {{included}} 8KB of ROM, an RS-232 serial port, {{a proprietary}} LAN interface (called ZX Net), and an interface for {{the connection of}} up to eight ZX Microdrives– somewhat unreliable but speedy tape-loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983. These were used in a revised version on the Sinclair QL, whose storage format was electrically compatible but logically <b>incompatible</b> with the Spectrum's. Sinclair also released the ZX Interface 2 which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port.|$|E
5|$|The alkali metals, due {{to their}} high reactivity, do not occur {{naturally}} in pure form in nature. They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also <b>incompatible</b> elements {{due to their}} large ionic radii.|$|E
5|$|The blast {{caused by}} a sudden release of the gas {{pressure}} inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to <b>incompatible</b> valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is <b>incompatible</b> to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E
5|$|The long-pink and short-white races {{frequently}} {{occur in}} close proximity to each other; in these mixed populations the former tends to flower in winter and the latter in spring. The question has been raised whether these different forms are becoming <b>incompatible.</b> However, controlled cross-pollination between plants with short and long corollas showed that there was no incompatibility between them.|$|E
