The program consists of an identical pre- and post-test. Participants sign consents to act as research subjects. Each participant is treated as if he/she is a patient and is exposed to a simulated patient environment for thirty minutes. The experiential portion of this program is the most significant, as it provides the participant with an opportunity to personally experience what the patient actually hears and feels. The program was two hours in length and was offered at four different times to accommodate three nursing shifts. Two educators set up all the equipment and monitored the participants.

A practical assessment was conducted to evaluate a variety of quieter actuation methods for animatronic toys for Hasbro®, the client. Also, an evaluation of acoustical enclosures was carried out to determine if they were an effective way to reduce the sound from gear-boxes and actuators that currently actuate the line of animatronic toys made by the client. Several actuation methods and enclosure materials were considered and evaluated based upon their performance, relative quietness, and their viability in the application into animatronic toys. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons were made of each of the actuation methods and were eliminated based upon their ability to satisfy the design constraints based upon their safety, acoustical performance, and ability to reproduce the life-like characteristics of the toys. Quantitative comparisons were made of each of the enclosure materials using a sound control box and a <b>decibel</b> <b>meter</b> to measure the output sound pressure level of each enclosure configuration. Among all the evaluated alternatives, from advanced actuation methods to acoustically attenuating enclosures, the acoustical enclosures performed the best. The acoustical performance rating of the polyurethane-neoprene based composite layering was far superior to the other materials tested, but was not the most economical of the acoustical enclosure materials. Acoustical enclosures can be implemented in the current line of animatronic toys and do not require any mold changes, modifications to the product architecture.

Measurements were made approximately 15 cm from the infant (the distance from an infant's mouth to a parent's ear when the infant is held) during episodes of spontaneous screaming, using a <b>Decibels</b> Sound Level <b>Meter</b> (Type 1565 A. General Radio, Concord, Mass.). The As scale, which approximates the intensity appreciated by the human ear, was used for readings. Much to our. © 1983, Massachusetts Medical Society.
