40|$|Abstract. The <b>default</b> nonmonotonic <b>reasoning</b> was formalised by a {{class of}} logical systems: default logics (classical, justified, constrained, rational), {{based on the same}} syntax which utilises nonmonotonic {{inference}} rules: defaults, but with different semantics for the defaults. In this paper we introduce a uniform semantic characterisation for the constrained and rational extensions of a default theory. This characterisation is an operational approach of the nonmonotonic reasoning that is viewed as a successive application of the applicable <b>defaults.</b> During the <b>reasoning</b> process can be observed the interaction between the <b>defaults</b> and the <b>reasoning</b> context. The graphical interpretation associated to the semantic characterisation of extensions illustrates the type of applicability: cautious (for constrained extensions) and hazardous (for rational extensions) of the defaults and some formal properties: semi-monotonicity, regularity, existence of extensions, commitment to assumptions of these variants of default logic. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Bach {{argues that}} the {{reasoning}} method employed by humans is <b>default</b> <b>reasoning,</b> {{which is to say}} that when humans reason, many steps in their reasoning are taken by default- i.e. they are “based on some generalization or stereotype which is overridden only if there occurs the thought of an alternative or of a reason to the contrary.” [...] An example of this would be seeing an apple on the table. Bach would argue that, under normal circumstances, the belief “there is an apple on the table” will be formed without reflection on the process by which that belief was formed since the reasoning process of the agent that sees the apple is working under the assumption that seeing something means it is there. Given this, Bach holds that the internalist is expecting too much for a belief to be justified, since expecting reasoning to be evaluated in every step would mean denying justification to the large majority of beliefs since they are formed via <b>default</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Bach therefore holds that if internalism cannot provide a solid argument against the <b>default</b> <b>reasoning</b> model of human cognition, then they must be satisfied in defining what a justified believer is, leaving the question of justified belief to the externalist.|$|E
40|$|Consistency-based {{approaches}} in nonmonotonic reasoning {{may be expected}} to yield multiple sets of default conclusions for a given <b>default</b> theory. <b>Reasoning</b> about such extensions is carried out at the meta-level. In this paper, we show how such reasoning may be carried out at the object level for a large class of default theories. Essentially we show how one can translate a (semi-monotonic) default theory #, obtaining a second # #, such that # # has a single extension that encodes every extension of #. Moreover, our translated theory is only a constant factor larger than the original (with the exception of unique names axioms). We prove that our translation behaves correctly. In the approach we can now encode the notion of extension from within the framework of standard default logic. Hence one can encode notions such as skeptical and credulous conclusions, and can reason about such conclusions within a single extension. This result has some theoretical interest, in that it shows how multiple extensions of semi-monotonic default theories are encodable with manageable overhead in a single extension. <b>default</b> logic, skeptical <b>reasoning,</b> credulous reasoning, tagging...|$|R

40|$|Analogical {{reasoning}} is often employed in problem-solving and metaphor interpretation. This paper submits that, as a <b>default,</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> addressing these different tasks employs different mapping strategies: In problem-solving, it employs analogy-maximising strategies (like structure mapping, Gentner & Markman 1997); in metaphor interpretation, analogy-minimising strategies (like ATT-Meta, Barnden 2015). The two strategies interact in analogical reasoning with conceptual metaphors. This interaction leads to predictable fallacies. The paper supports these hypotheses through case-studies on ‘mind’-metaphors from ordinary discourse, and abstract problem-solving {{in the philosophy}} of mind, respectively: It shows that (1) default metaphorical interpretations for vision- and space-cognition metaphors can be derived with a variant of the analogy-minimising ATT-Meta approach, (2) philosophically influential introspective conceptions of the mind can be derived with conceptual metaphors only through an analogy-maximising strategy, and (3) the interaction of these strategies leads to hitherto unrecognised fallacies in analogical reasoning with metaphors.

40|$|Existing {{computational}} design {{technologies are}} insufficiently developed {{to integrate the}} design activities during the product lifecycle. The main reason is three fold: inhomogeneous requirement, function and form definition in the general design context, ill nature of function-to-form mapping and difficulties of design synthesis with qualitative information. Although computational design technology has progressed {{in the past two}} decades, there have been little radical changes from a designer's point of view.
