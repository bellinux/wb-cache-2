50|$|The {{base of the}} {{spinning}} tunnel holds the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> that the tunnel rings rest and roll on. The drive motor for the tunnel that has the drive motor driving the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> will also be installed on this framework. The tunnels that have a drive motor above the tunnel will have a vertical framework that {{is attached to the}} base. The <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> can be bicycle rims or pulleys which also hold the tunnel in place as it spins. Tunnels that use the hard rubber wheels will have an extra set of horizontal wheels at both ends, attached to the bridge, to keep the tunnel from wandering off the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels.</b> The bridge is also mounted to the base.|$|E
5000|$|On kerb-guided buses (KGB) small <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> {{attached}} to the bus engage vertical kerbs {{on either side of}} the guideway. These <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> push the steering mechanism of the bus, keeping it centralised on the track. Away from the guideway, the bus is steered in the normal way. The start of the guideway is funnelled from a wide track to guideway width. This system permits high-speed operation on a narrow guideway and precise positioning at boarding platforms, facilitating access for the elderly and disabled. As <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> can be inexpensively {{attached to}}, and removed from, almost any standard model of bus, kerb guided busway systems are not tied to particular specialised vehicles or equipment suppliers. Characteristically, operators contracted to run services on kerb-guided busways will purchase or lease the vehicles themselves; as second-hand vehicles (with <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> removed) have a ready resale market.|$|E

50|$|Where {{snowfall}} is an issue, {{this system}} {{may not be}} practical: since the guide rail forms the return leg of the electrical circuit, accumulation of ice and snow on the rail could cause intermittent power interruptions to the vehicle. Also, as the vehicle does not place {{a significant portion of}} its weight on the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> (most of it being supported by the rubber tyres), snow packed into the flangeways or atop the rail by road traffic could lift the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> off the rail, leading the vehicle to go off course.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{activate}} the retarder in the mechanical gears 2 to 4, the reverse gear brake, is closed. As a result, the turbine wheel is accelerated by a correspondingly high ratio and driven in 1st gear against the rotary direction. The turbine wheel now acts as an axial pump which delivers oil against the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> and the braked or stationary impeller.During this process, kinetic energy is converted into heat which is dissipated by the heat exchanger.The vehicle is braked.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept is}} {{described}} in detail at controlled traffic farming Europe's wide span page and achieves the low tracked area by virtue of {{using one of the}} same wheel tracks on adjacent passes. The system also reduces reliance on satellite technology because a <b>guiding</b> <b>wheel</b> track for the next pass is automatically laid down. With implements mostly contained within its wheel track, part width operations, for example ploughing or root crop harvesting, are perfectly feasible, whereas with existing tractor systems they are not.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a reference guide for decision makers seeking to determine an appropriate precision docking technology to be used along a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line utilizing low-floor buses. It uses statistics and observations collected from industry experts, reports prepared on current systems and emerging technologies, and {{an investigation into the}} current literature. Five technologies were researched and separated into two categories, mechanical or electronic. The two electronic technologies are (1) magnetic guidance and (2) optical guidance. The three mechanical technologies are (1) the <b>guide</b> <b>wheel,</b> (2) the Kassel Kerb, and (3) the guide strip. A general overview and expected cost, performance, and general advantages and disadvantages of each technology is then given. After reviewing each technology, several supplemental technologies, primarily for use in conjunction with the mechanical technologies, are assessed for their use to help assist operators during precision docking. Finally, Appendix 2 addresses issues surrounding lug nut and fender flare protrusions and Appendix 3 presents system interoperability concerns, as both can cause of potential issues regardless of the technology utilized.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Guide</b> <b>wheel</b> {{crankshaft}} used in caterpillar tractor is analyzed under working condition. The crankshaft {{is made of}} 45 Cr steel. Since {{the work}} conditions of the crankshaft are complicated, three dimensional finite element model of the crankshaft is built for strength checking of the crankshaft. Appropriate boundary condition is applied. The {{results show that the}} maximal stress of the crankshaft is 728 MPa, which is less than the yield limit of 45 Cr steel (835 MPa). Therefore, the crankshaft can not be broken during the work of caterpillar tractor...|$|R
5000|$|Record Breakers were Mini 4WD {{but not in}} the {{conventional}} sense as they didn't have the pins or blades characteristic of most. They were battery operated and could run on a track with horizontal side-mounted <b>guide</b> <b>wheels,</b> but could just as well run independently of tracks, though if their <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> were removed, in-track performance would be greatly diminished if not impossible. The cars were known for their high performance, and on smooth surfaces were capable of 20 mph, translating into 500 to 640 scale miles per hour. [...] A car outside of a track would inevitably crash into an obstacle if not otherwise stopped. Twin electric motors cars ran off two AA batteries. Another version of the cars used a single motor that ran on two AA batteries, though often a third battery could be added for additional power. The single motor cars could be manually switched between 2WD and 4WD. The scale is difficult to specify as they were frequently not based on any real-life vehicles, but it appears to be approximately 1:32. Customization and upgrade kits with accessories such as different kinds of wheels and <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> were sold, as well as different kinds of tracks.|$|E
50|$|This {{system was}} not {{suitable}} for steam locomotives so Arnoux invented a separate system for them. The locomotives had a 2-4-2 wheel arrangement and the driving wheels were flangeless. The carrying wheels were arranged to pivot and were controlled by near-horizontal <b>guide</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two {{incompatible}} systems using physical {{guide rails}} exist, the Guided Light Transit (GLT) designed by Bombardier Transportation, and the Translohr from Lohr Industrie (currently made by Alstom and FSI). There are no guide bars {{at the sides}} {{but there is a}} central guidance rail that differs in design between the systems. In the case of Translohr, this rail is grasped by a pair of metal <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> set at 45° to the road and at 90° to each other. In the GLT system, a single double-flanged wheel between the rubber tires follows the guidance rail. In both cases, the weight of the vehicle is borne by rubber tires to which the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> are attached. Power is usually supplied by overhead lines, rechargeable batteries, or internal combustion engines where there are no overhead wires.|$|E
40|$|Local blowing on {{the profile}} suction {{side of the}} turbine <b>guide</b> <b>wheel</b> blades can be {{effective}} in preventing the propagation of secondary flows that is, the transport of casing and hub boundary layers by pressure gradients. Some preliminary results on how the blowing should be accomplished in order to influence the secondary flows in the desired manner are given. The effectiveness of blowing is demonstrated. Blowing is also seen {{to be more effective}} than using boundary layer slots as far as diminishing losses in the rim zones is concerned...|$|R

The tubes are bent by pressing the tube using the bending lever over the <b>guiding</b> <b>wheel.</b> The split bush and split cone clamping arrangement ensures that there is no movement of the tubes during the bending operation. This procedure has yielded kink-free bends with good circularity...|$|R
