30|$|Nitrogen {{is a major}} {{wastewater}} nutrient and {{exists in}} various forms, including free ammonia, organic nitrogen, nitrate and nitrite each {{of which may be}} assessed for in a variety of ways. Fresh wastewater nitrogen is generally present in the ammonia and organic nitrogen forms, with the minute corpus of nitrite and nitrate forms (Sharma and Chopra 2015). The effluent may consist of either ammonia or nitrate nitrogen depending on the extent of nitrification, which exists within the treatment plant. Under routine conditions, the nitrite form of nitrogen does not exist in fat quantities due to its <b>instantaneous</b> <b>oxidation</b> or transformation to nitrate (Zhang and Gao 2000). Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is a chemical analysis to ascertain both the organic and the ammonia nitrogen. The TKN value corresponds to a total nitrogen concentration, which is the summation of organic nitrogen compounds and ammonia nitrogen [TKN = org-N + NH 4 –N (mg/L)]. Nitrogen mainly occurs in wastewater in the TKN form. After biological wastewater treatment, TKN mostly appears as oxidized nitrite (Liu et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn situ 119 Sn Mössbauer {{measurements}} {{show that}} annealing in hydrogen atmosphere of co-precipitated chromium and lutetium hydroxides, doped with 0. 2 at. % Sn 4 +, {{results in the}} formation of Sn 2 + cations on the surface sites of LuCrO 3 microcrystals. Such a distribution of dopant cations is consistent with the anomalously high concentration of tin revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The 19 Sn spectrum recorded above the Néel point of LuCrO 3 attests to the distribution of Sn 2 + ions over two kinds of site. For both of them, the isomer shift and quadrupole splitting values agree with those previously reported for 119 Sn 2 + on surface sites of several oxides other than the perovskite-type one. The <b>instantaneous</b> <b>oxidation</b> of tin upon contact with ambient air did not allow us to characterize the cationic surrounding of Sn 2 + by measurements involving sample transfer into a liquid-helium cryostat. Relevant information is obtained for the Sn 2 +→ 4 + oxidized species located on the sites with unchanged cationic surroundings. The spectrum recorded at 4. 2 K shows that nearly two-thirds of the Sn 2 +→ 4 + species are spin-polarized to different extents. Comparison with Mössbauer parameters reported for 119 Sn ions sitting in the regular Cr-substitution site in the bulk of LuCrO 3 allows us to ascribe the diffuse magnetic contribution to a distribution of Sn 2 +→ 4 + species over Cr-substitution sites with lower (than in the bulk) number of neighboring Cr 3 + ions. The presence of an additional non-magnetic component in the spectrum of Sn 2 +→ 4 + ions points to the location of the remaining Sn 4 + ions and, very likely, the predecessor Sn 2 + ones, on Lu-substitution sites with magnetically compensated (2 Cr↑+ 2 Cr↓) surroundings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlass melting process {{involves}} {{two-phase flow}} for which bubbles are dispersed {{in a high}} viscous fluid. Due to the quality requirement, the bubble removal is needed. This stage is achieved by the bubble rising due to the buoyancy forces. The efficiency of the last effect is improved by increasing temperature and by bubble growth. In order to increase the bubble size, few chemical species are added which release gaseous species such as O 2, SO 2, by chemical reactions. The modeling of mass transfer of bubble in a molten glass has been studying since many years. Nevertheless, the modifications in mass transfer due to chemical reactions between bubbles and the molten glass are seldom. Since iron is an major element present in industrial glass coming from the raw materials and also add to change the glass color {{as a function of}} its reduction state, we investigate the particular role of the iron by taking into account the oxidation-reduction reaction of iron to describe the mass transfer around of oxygen bubble. The dimensionless mass transfer coefficient, Sherwood number, is determined {{as a function of the}} Péclet number based on the terminal rising velocity of the bubble. Two different techniques are used: the first based on the boundary layer theory and the second using a finite element method. The Sherwood number, taking into account the oxidation-reduction reaction, increases with iron content as well as with reduction state of iron [1]. The behavior of an isolated rising bubble in a molten glass is investigated both experimentally and numerically. The theoretical model to describe bubble shrinkage is based on the preceding results. We show that the bubble shrinkage increases with the reduced iron content. The behavior is very well established with the new developments on Sherwood number described above [2]. [1] F. Pigeonneau.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} advance present {{modelling}} capabilities {{in respect of}} soot and thermal radiation emission from fires. Such developments are crucial to the improved estimate of the hazard potential of accidental fires. Radiation calculation requires the prediction of temperature and the concentrations of all radiatively important species. In hydrocarbon combustion, the key species are carbon dioxide, water vapour, carbon monoxide and particulate soot. In large hydrocarbon fires the latter is usually the dominant radiator. The detailed prediction of the gaseous species in turbulent combustion has previously {{been shown to be}} successfully achieved using laminar flamelet modelling in the fast chemistry limit. Soot, however, is governed by relatively slow formation processes which as yet remain poorly understood. The present study proposes a model for soot formation in turbulent non-premixed combustion which aims to address both the slow chemistry and turbulence interaction. In order to circumvent uncertainties in soot formation processes the model relies on empiricism, through the experimental investigation of a sooting laminar diffusion flame. The soot formation model is used to predict soot levels in a jet diffusion flame. Subsequent comparison with experimental data suggests the satisfactory performance of the model, but highlights soot oxidation to be a more significant problem. This stems from uncertainties associated both with <b>instantaneous</b> soot <b>oxidation</b> rate and the highly intermittent nature of this process in turbulent non-premixed flames. The soot formation model is also applied to the prediction of soot levels in a simulated buoyant methane fire, which supplement temperature and gaseous species predictions using a flamelet approach. Detailed predictions of spectrally resolved radiative intensity are then performed and compared with similarly detailed experimental data. The encouraging agreement with experiment allows the assessment of the effect of turbulence-radiation interaction. This is shown to be particularly important in buoyancy-driven fires and is most evident for the luminous radiation. This arises from the soot which is largely confined to narrow sheets that typically lie close to peak temperature zones. A strategy in which more representative soot-temperature correlations may be realised is also described...|$|R
40|$|The high {{atmospheric}} {{concentrations of}} toxic gases, particulate matter, and acids {{in the areas}} immediately surrounding volcanoes can have negative impacts on human and ecological health. To better understand the atmospheric fate of volcanogenic emissions in the near field (in the first few hours after emission), we have carried out real-time measurements of key chemical components of the volcanic plume from Kılauea on the Island of Hawai‘i. Measurements were made at two locations, one ∼ 3 km north-northeast of the vent and the other 31 km to the southwest, with sampling at each site spanning a range of meteorological conditions and volcanic influence. Instrumentation included a sulfur dioxide monitor and an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor, allowing for a measurement of the partitioning between the two major sulfur species (gas-phase SO[subscript 2] and particulate sulfate) every 5 min. During trade wind conditions, which sent the plume toward the southwest site, sulfur partitioning exhibited a clear diurnal pattern, indicating photochemical oxidation of SO[subscript 2] to sulfate; this enabled the quantitative determination of plume age (5 h) and <b>instantaneous</b> SO[subscript 2] <b>oxidation</b> rate (2. 4 × 10 [superscript – 6] s[superscript – 1] at solar noon). Under stagnant conditions near the crater, the extent of SO[subscript 2] oxidation was substantially higher, suggesting faster oxidation. The particles within the plume were extremely acidic, with pH values (controlled largely by ambient relative humidity) as low as − 0. 8 and strong acidity (controlled largely by absolute sulfate levels) up to 2200 nmol/m[superscript 3]. The high variability of sulfur partitioning and particle composition underscores the chemically dynamic nature of volcanic plumes, which may {{have important implications for}} human and ecological health.
