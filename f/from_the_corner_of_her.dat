60|$|After some search Mrs. Holl {{produced}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> capacious pocket the seal, carefully {{wrapped up}} in paper.|$|E
60|$|But Miss Pinnegar, {{a regular}} old, grey, {{dangerous}} she-puss, eyed him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pale eye, {{as he turned}} tail.|$|E

60|$|She {{watched him}} as {{he walked down the}} garden, and then sighed deeply, wiping away a tear <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Effie {{shut her}} book over her hand. [...] "It keeps me wakeful longer," [...] she whispered, {{with a glance}} at her mother <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye.|$|E
60|$|Miss Truefitt {{appeared}} to tremble, and made {{as though to}} rise. Then she sat still and took a gentle peep at Mr. Catesby <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, sir!" [...] she simpered. And then, {{bursting}} into naturalness, and glancing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye, [...] "'Tis {{the funniest thing}} under the sun! And it costs money." ...|$|E
6000|$|As he {{said this}} he looked across to Mary Lowther, who no doubt was {{watching}} every turn of his face <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye. [...] "I've just been and knocked under, {{and told him that}} the old place shall be put to rights." ...|$|E
6000|$|The curtain {{fell upon}} {{the first act}} of [...] "Louise." [...] The lights were turned up, the tenseness relaxed, men made dives for their hats, and the unmusical murmured the usual platitudes. Naida leaned forward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> box {{to the man who}} was her sole companion.|$|E

6000|$|... "I know Tulliver's hasty, {{and says}} odd things," [...] said Mrs. Tulliver, wiping away one small tear <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye; [...] "but I'm sure he's {{never been the}} man, since he married me, to object to my making the friends o' my side o' the family welcome to the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Tyrell, looking {{straight}} {{in front of}} her, stole a glance at this easily satisfied young man <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye. [...] "I should never expect to hear of you doing anything wicked," [...] she said. Fraser thanked her again, warmly. [...] "Or venturesome," [...] added Miss Tyrell, thoughtfully. [...] "Youâ€™re not the kind." ...|$|E
60|$|Our young gentleman {{and young}} lady of Orr's Island went {{through with this}} {{customary}} little lie of civilized society with as much gravity {{as if they were}} practicing in the court of Versailles,--she looking out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye to watch the effect of her words, and he laying his hand on his heart in the most edifying gravity. They perfectly understood one another.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must do it}} like this." [...] The witch {{laid down}} her knife and potato, and then poured into Fancy's ear a long and {{detailed}} list of directions, glancing up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye into Fancy's face {{with an expression of}} sinister humour. Fancy's face brightened, clouded, rose and sank, as the narrative proceeded. [...] "There," [...] said Elizabeth at length, stooping for the knife and another potato, [...] "do that, and you'll have him by-long and by-late, my dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have all}} been very kind to my son," [...] said Mrs. Corey in acknowledgment, and stiffly bowing a little, [...] "and we feel greatly indebted to you. Very much so." [...] At these {{grateful}} expressions Mrs. Lapham reddened once more, and murmured {{that it had been}} very pleasant to them, she was sure. She glanced at her daughter for support, but Penelope was looking at Mrs. Corey, who doubtless saw her <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes, though she went on speaking to her mother.|$|E
60|$|A sudden wave of colour {{swept over}} the girl's {{face at the}} {{ingenuity}} of this mode of attack. She was used to attention and took compliments as her due, but the significant audacity of this one baffled her. She sat with downcast eyes looking at the fender occasionally glancing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye to see whether he was preparing to renew the assault. He had certainly changed from the Jem Hardy of olden days. She had a faint idea that his taste had improved.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Mrs. Kybird, {{glancing at}} her <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye, [...] "Jack has 'ad to rough it, pore feller, and that's left its mark on 'im. I'm sure, {{when we took}} 'im in, he was quite done up, so to speak. He'd only got what 'e stood up in, and the only pair of socks he'd {{got to his feet}} was in such a state of 'oles that they had to be throwed away. I throwed 'em away myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|He bent {{a little}} over toward her, so as {{to look into the}} face she instinctively averted, while she could not help glancing at him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye. [...] "You have the color and the light of the South," [...] he said. [...] "When you get to Italy, you will live in a {{perpetual}} mystification. You will go about in a dream of some self of yours that was native there in other days. You will find yourself retrospectively related to the olive faces and the dark eyes you meet; you will recognize sisters and cousins in the patrician ladies when you see their portraits in the palaces where you used to live in such state." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, to {{run away}} from it would be {{to run away}} from you," [...] the Prince replied; [...] "and I've already told you often enough how I depend on you to see me through." [...] He so liked the way she took this, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sofa, that he gave his sincerity-- for it WAS sincerity--fuller expression. [...] "I'm {{starting}} on the great voyage--across the unknown sea; my ship's all rigged and appointed, the cargo's stowed away and the company complete. But what seems the matter with me is that I can't sail alone; my ship must be one of a pair, must have, in the waste of waters, a--what do you call it?--a consort. I don't ask you to stay on board with me, but I must keep your sail in sight for orientation. I don't in the least myself know, I assure you, the points of the compass. But with a lead I can perfectly follow. You MUST be my lead." ...|$|E
