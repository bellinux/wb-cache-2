50|$|The Tsar Tank, {{also known}} as the Lebedenko tank after its {{designer}} - was a tricycle <b>design</b> <b>vehicle</b> on 9 m high front wheels. It was expected that such large wheels would be able to cross any obstacle but because of a flawed design most of the weight was forced through the smaller rear wheel, which became stuck when tested in 1915. The designers were prepared to fit larger engines but the project - and the vehicle - was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|The newest <b>design</b> <b>vehicle</b> of the Ecorunner VI was {{considered}} to be the most fuel efficient hydrogen-powered vehicle in the world. The Ecorunner participated in the Shell Eco-Marathon of 2016 held in London. The major innovations were carried over in the aerodynamic properties to make it best among the world, as the shape was designed {{in such a way that}} the extensive aerodynamic CFD analysis could be fully optimised for racing conditions. The application of zigzag strips was used for the delay of the separation point of flow which ultimately led to a better performance in the race. The amalgamation of supercapacitors which are used to serve as a buffer between the fuel cell and the motor and also for inclination as required for London tracks which made it easier to quickly distribute a lot of power to the motor and so the fuel cell could constantly run to its optimal efficiency.|$|E

A sample of 148 bridges is chosen from a total population of 3700 Indiana highway bridges using a proportionate stratified random sampling process. A sample of 25 trucks, with the truck parameters uniformly distributed over their ranges is compiled from the 1990 and 1991 truck population (permit vehicles obtained from INDOT and AASHTO HS <b>Design</b> <b>Vehicle).</b> The selected trucks are used to rate bridges in the selected sample using the Bridge Analysis and Rating System (BARS) program at the operating stress level.
