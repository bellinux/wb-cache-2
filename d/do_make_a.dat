5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that <b>do</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
25|$|The Judges {{themselves}} are not exempt from the law; in fact {{they are expected to}} obey it more strictly than any other. A violation that would earn a citizen a few months in an Iso-Cube would get a Judge a twenty-year sentence, served as hard labor on Saturn's moon, Titan, after surgical modification to enable the convict to survive outside there without needing an expensive space suit. (Titan is a moon of Saturn in reality, but was located over Jupiter in an early Dredd strip.) When Judges <b>do</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> minor mistake (anything were the citizen is alive or not in an intensive care ward) such as wrongful arrest or search they do have to pay the citizen a compensation fee if there is no crimes to be charged with. On that basis, if they can't find any evidence for the main charge, then they will look for any minor crime or misdemeanours to charge to citizen with to get themselves off the hook.|$|E
500|$|In a subplot, Bart begins taking karate {{lessons at}} Akira's karate school. On his first lesson, {{he finds that}} karate is quite boring, so he decides to skip each lesson in order to play video games at the mall arcade. Whenever he is {{questioned}} by {{his family and friends}} about the techniques he has learned, he refers to the [...] "Touch of Death", an ability he saw in one of the arcade games he played. He proceeds to terrorize his sister Lisa into doing his will by threatening her with the technique. His actions catch up to him when Lisa prods him to defend her from the school bullies and reclaim her saxophone. He ends up being pantsed and hung by his underwear from the basketball hoop rim by the bullies, as Lisa (having reclaimed her saxophone) wistfully notes that sometimes two wrongs <b>do</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> right.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{released}} Forever Malcolm Young in October 2006 – {{the title}} is a conflated reference to the 2005 song [...] "Forever Young" [...] by Youth Group {{and the name of}} AC/DC's guitarist, Malcolm Young – which peaked in the top40. It provided a minor radio hit with the title track. Some controversy was expressed over the profanity in the title and lyrics of [...] "Johnny Ramone was in a Fucking Good Band, but He Was a Cunt" [...] (see Johnny Ramone, Ramones).

Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll described them [...] " [...] history is littered with legendary stories, perhaps true, perhaps exaggerations, but stories which fuel and match their song and album titles. Their songs are often profane, likely to poke fun at someone including themselves, hint at a social conscience, and inside all the tough talk and body jokes be hopelessly romantic." ...|$|E
