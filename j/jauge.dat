In this study, the flood records of more than 23 gauged river basins in Sarawak, Malaysia, are examined using an index-flood estimation procedure based on L-moments. Two homogeneous regions were identified and the Generalized Extreme Value and the Generalized Logistic distributions are found to describe the distribution of extreme flood events appropriately within the respective regions. A regional growth curve is subsequently developed {{for each of the}} regions. These curves can be used for the estimation of design floods in ungauged basins in Sarawak within the limitations identified for the method.

Huge practical difficulties arise from the Panel's scale and interdisciplinary context, {{the complexity of the}} climate change issue and its political context. The key question of this paper is if the observed differences in the handling of uncertainties by the three IPCC Working Groups can be clarified. To address this question, the paper reviews a few key issues on the foundations of uncertainty analysis, and summarizes the history of the treatment of uncertainty by the IPCC. One of the key findings is that there is reason to agree to disagree: the fundamental differences between the issues covered by the IPCC's three interdisciplinary Working Groups, between the type of information available, and between the dominant paradigms of the practitioners, legitimately lead to different approaches. We argue that properly using the IPCC's Guidance Notes for Lead Authors for addressing uncertainty, adding a pedigree analysis for key findings, and particularly communicating the diverse nature of uncertainty to the users of the assessment would increase the quality of the assessment. This approach would provide information {{about the nature of the}} uncertainties in addition to their magnitude and the confidence assessors have in their findings.

40|$|La prévention du risque d'inondation nécessite une connaissance détaillée du régime hydrologique en crue du bassin étudié. Dans ce but, l'approche débit-durée-fréquence (QdF), développée depuis déjà {{plusieurs}} années, a permis de définir un modèle statistique décrivant les crues observées {{en fonction}} de leur débit, de leur durée et de leur fréquence. Un récent travail a revisité cette approche. Grâce à son nombre réduit de paramètres, le modèle proposé, appelé modèle local convergent, peut être facilement ajusté pour chaque bassin. Dans l'ancienne approche, que nous appelons approche " bassin de référence ", l'ajustement local avait été effectué sur seulement trois bassins, dits de référence, et réputés être chacun représentatif d'une typologie d'écoulement différente. Ces trois paramétrisations types ont ensuite donné lieu à trois modèles adimensionnels, capables de caractériser la majorité des régimes observés. Le modèle adimensionnel correspondant au régime du bassin étudié devait être dénormé par deux caractéristiques locales du bassin : le débit instantané maximal de crue décennale et une durée caractéristique de crue. Une comparaison du nouveau modèle, appelé modèle local convergent, et de l'approche type " bassin de référence " a été effectuée sur une cinquantaine de bassins <b>jaugés.</b> Elle met en évidence la robustesse du modèle convergent et permet de discuter du choix du modèle relatif à l'approche " bassin de référence ". Le modèle local convergent autorise d'envisager le développement d'un modèle QdF régional, s'inspirant de différentes méthodes de régionalisation. Ceci permettra alors une application à des bassins peu ou non observés. Flood risk mitigation requires a good knowledge of hydrological flood regime, {{which can be}} described by a flow-duration-frequency (QdF) approach. New developments of this approach are presented and compared to the former method. Usually, flood frequency analysis deals only with the maximum flood peak distribution or the maximum daily discharge distribution. The QdF approach analyses maximum average flows over different durations d (d = 1, 3, …, N days). Similar to intensity-duration-frequency curves, each of the QdF curves represents the flood frequency distribution, for the duration d. QdF modelling aims to express QdF curves by a Q(d,T) function (d : the duration; T : the return period). Before this present work, QdF modelling {{was associated with the}} "reference basin" approach. In this approach, QdF curves (plotted as a function of d, for fixed T) of many studied basins are converted into a dimensionless form. The two characteristics used are the 10 -year peak flood, Q(d= 0, T= 10 years), and a characteristic flood duration (D) of the studied catchment, calculated from different flood hydrographs. Then, three different families are determined, grouping basins with similar dimensionless QdF curves. For each of these families, one reference basin is chosen. Their dimensionless curves are parameterised, in order to obtain a continuous formulation, as a function on T and d. By denormalising one of these dimensionless QdF models with the local parameters Q(0, 10) and D, it is possible to obtain the continuous Q(d,T) formulation for the studied basin. The choice of the correct dimensionless model is made via a choice criterion. It involves Q(0, 10), D and shape parameters of local maximal rainfall distributions (a Gumbel law is assumed), for different durations, d. These distributions are obtained according to the intensity-duration-frequency approach. If the studied basin is ungauged, local parameters Q(0, 10) and D are estimated by regional formulas, involving significant variables such as catchment area and rainfall. Recent work has improved this "reference basin" approach. A new QdF model, called convergent local, has been developed. For fixed T, the model assumes that the Q(d,T) is described by a hyperbolic form, as a function of d. This choice of the hyperbolic form is based on the observation of many catchments (about one hundred). It has also been observed that QdF curves, plotted for fixed d as a function of T, converge toward the same point, when T decreases. Using these observations as assumptions, the model is then able to calculate Q(d,T) for any return period T and any duration d. If a two-parameter statistical law (such as the exponential law) is adopted, the model contains only 4 parameters. The first parameter is the limit of Q(d,T), when d tends to infinity. It is estimated by calculating the average value over the entire observed period of the Q(t) discharge time series. The second one gives the hyperbolas curvatures and is ∆. The ∆ parameter has a time dimension and is consequently a characteristic duration of the studied basin. The final two parameters are the location and shape parameters, x 0 (0) and aq (0), of the exponential maximal flood distribution for d= 0. x 0 (0), aq (0) and ∆ parameters are directly adjusted on observed QdF curves of the studied basin. The comparison between the convergent local model and the "reference basin" approach has been carried out on about 50 basins, drawn from different regions of France. For each basin, the two approaches have been tested. First, the two characteristic durations D and∆, defined respectively by the "reference basins" approach and the convergent local model, are compared. As mentioned earlier, ∆ characteristic duration is an adjusted parameter and its calculation does not depend on D. In spite of their different definitions, a strong correlation between these two parameters is observed. This shows a good coherence between the two tested approaches. Second, in order to compare results, a relative mean error between calculated and observed values is determined for each basin and each model. Only the observed domain (T ≤ 20 years) has been considered, because the extrapolations cannot been validated with observed data. Concerning the "reference basin" approach, the three reference basin models are studied, and the choice criterion is applied. Results show that this choice criterion is not relevant. Concerning the convergent local model, the observed mean relative error is lower than in the "reference basin" approach. These good results are confirmed by a very small error dispersion. Consequently, the convergent local model is robust. As a conclusion, this paper presents new developments of the QdF approach: the convergent local continuous model. This model, locally adjusted, yields very satisfactory results. The next step is to apply it on ungauged basins, as is possible in the "reference basins" approach. This could be done by adapting regional methods, such as the index flood method...|$|R
40|$|Dans le contexte pluviométrique déficitaire de l'Afrique intertropicale, l'hydraulicité des fleuves soudano-sahéliens a beaucoup diminué depuis 25 ans. Les fleuves des régions humides, relativement épargnés jusqu'en 1980, montrent aussi, avec un retard de {{plusieurs}} années une hydraulicité qui baisse dans des proportions importantes, alors qu'un retour à la normale du régime des pluies paraît amorcé. Le déficit des apports est pour l'Afrique humide de 16 % pour la décennie 80 (365 km 3 an- 1), contre 7 % pour la décennie 70, et pour l'Afrique sèche de 27 % (65 km 3 an- 1) pour la décennie 80 contre 13 % pour la décennie 70. Les maximums annuels de crue sont systématiquement plus faibles dans la période récente. En régime équatorial, la crue de printemps est la plus affectée par le déficit hydrologique et la différence entre crue de printemps et crue d'automne a triplé entre les années 1950 - 1960 et les années 1980. L'ensemble de la région connaît des étiages exceptionnels répétés. En zone soudano-sahélienne, le tarissement s'est considérablement accéléré et montre une vidange des écoulements de base deux fois plus rapide dans la période récente. Le phénomène est également sensible en Afrique humide et traduit un amenuisement des réserves souterraines dû aux effets cumulés des déficits pluviométriques et décalé dans le temps, que l'on retrouve dans la baisse du niveau piezométrique des nappes phréatiques. Un effet mémoire est donc observé sur les écoulements de base, avec pour conséquence un un appauvrissement durable des ressources hydriques. Celui-ci restera indépendant, pour un temps, d'une éventuelle amélioration des conditions climatiques, comme le montrent les observations des années les plus récentes. The {{extent of}} the current drought phenomenon in Sudano-Sahelian regions no longer needs to be proven. The study of rainfall deficits in intertropical Africa shows a global climatic degradation which {{has been going on}} for about twenty five years. These deficits concern also the humid areas of Western and Central Africa and finally all the african rivers draining the flows to the Atlantic Ocean. Various studies have showed that the current phenomenon greatly differed, in intensity and duration, from other 20 th century deficit situations (Sircoulon et Olivry, 1986, Lamb, 1985, Nicholson et al, 1988). Despite very great fluctuations which could remind pseudocyclic variations, the current data pointed out a global downward trend since 1860 (Olivry, 1987). Moreover, some authors have seen a statistical break in the rainfall conditions in 1970 (Carbonnel et al, 1985). The necessity to obtain common continual data series led to select the period from 1950 to 1990 with a large number of operational rainfall and <b>jauging</b> stations (Mahe, 1993) (figures 2 et 3). Without expecting a continuation in this trend, or, on the contrary, a return to a humid period, the current drought will obviously have durable consequences on some hydrological parameters. After a relative improvement of rainfall conditions, observed in 1985 and 1986 and even more recently, as shown by the evolution of the Lamb index (1985). African drought and rainfall deficits observed since 25 years have important repercussions on the flow regime of rivers and especially on the annual runoff and the strenght of annual floods. This phenomenon has intensified during the last ten years while, paradoxically, rainfall deficit greatly has diminished. For instance, the upper Niger river,with the Bani river, (surface basins 250, 000 km 2) shows an annual runoff deficit of 20 % during the 70 's and of 46 % during the 80 's and an annual rainfall deficit respectively of 15 and 20 %. In the regional context of Western and Central Africa, the global runoff deficit varies from - 7 % to - 16 % for the decades 1970 and 1980 in the humid areas, and from - 13 % to - 27 % in the dry areas (deviations calculated in relation to the 1951 - 1990 mean values) (Olivry, 1993). The global annual runoff deficit during the 80 ís decade reached 430 km 3 year- 1 for the atlantic african tributaries (figures 4 et 5, table 1). During the two last decades, flood hydrographs of large river basins have been greatly reduced in volume and duration; maximum values are much smaller. the flood hydrographs showed lower annual maximum discharges and shorter high water seasons than during the preceding period. In the equatorial areas, with two flood periods by year, the datas showed that the spring floods were more affected than the autumn floods by the climatic changes. (figure 6). A frequential study of flood maxima shows a clear break in data series, and emphasizes the danger of flooding estimations which are based upon recent years only. The long term effects of rain shortage are more marked still for the low flow regimes and different studies have showed that, in addition to the immediate effects of the drought, a large reduction of the groundwater storage can explain the persistent fall of the hydrological resource. In the case of recession-depletion period and low flows, the memory effect of the current deficit period is particularly clear. An unusual repetition of exceptionally dry low flows can be observed, especially an abrupt change in the depletion regime, unprecedented in hydrological time series. It also may be observed that a return to more favourable climatic conditions does not involve an immediate return to the earlier hydrosystem. The figure 7 shows two representative curves of the variability of the low flows (absolute minimum daily discharge) between 1950 and 1990 for a Sudano-Sahelian basin (the Bani river) and for a tropico-equatorial basin (the Sangha river, tributary of the Congo river). It is clear that the dry Africa is more affected by drought and rainfall deficits than the humid Africa, but during the last decade the low flows of the Sangha river have been divided by 2 in relation to the low waters observed before 1970 (Laraque et al, 1996). The large deficit of the low flows was also observed on the flows of the Ubangi, Congo/ZaÔre, Ogowe, Sanaga, Kwilu, Bandama and Konkure rivers in the humid areas during the last decade (Olivry, 1993). In the dry Africa the deficit of low flows is larger still and it has been observed during the last two decades. After the annual flood and the recession, which occur especially as fast as the rainy season ends, there is a classical pattern of flow drop in the rivers in this region. This corresponds to the basin aquifers draining, also called depletion. This depletion is linked to an exponential law : Qi=Qo e-a(ti-to) with the flow Qo on a to day, the flow Qi on a ti day, and (, a coefficient expressed in days- 1, according to the physical and geometrical characteristics of the aquifers. The studies show a significant degradation of the depletion [...] This phenomenon, resulting from a deterioration of aquifers, was first noted on the Senegal river in 1983 (Olivry, 1987). Since then, it has been observed again and specified, in relation to all the flows in the Sudano-Sahelian region. On a regional scale, it can be considered as a likely model of the progressive decrease of flows, In the Senegal river (218, 000 km_ at Bakel), the depletion coefficient has been relatively stable for over seventy years during humid as well as dry periods. The average is 0. 0186 day- 1 and the variation coefficient is only 0. 075. With the current drought, the alteration in the pattern only becomes significant after 1975. The depletion coefficient rapidly rises, to reach values such as 0. 04 day- 1 around 1985. The Niger river (120, 000 km_ at Koulikoro and data since 1907) shows before 1975 an average coefficient of 0. 023 day- 1. The current period shows an average coefficient over the first 8 years as being around 0. 028 day- 1 and then an abrupt increase to values as high as 0. 040 day- 1 in the beginning of the 90 's. The Bani river(102, 000 km_ at Douna), tributary of the Niger river, shows a significant evolution (figures 8 et 9). It is easy to give many examples in the Sudano-Sahelian region and the phenomenon is still likely in humid tropical areas, even it is less marked. Thus in the case of the Ubangui river at Bangui (500, 000 km_); the average coefficient from 1935 to 1975 was 0. 021 day- 1. It has been equal to 0. 025 day- 1 during the last fifteen years. The increase of the depletion coefficient of the Sangha river is lower, but in the equatorial regions, it is often difficult to observe the depletion periods, the flows being affected by rains during a short dry season (figure 10). The depletions similarity in the case of different rivers and even of streams which was observed in the flow time series before the current period must be underlined. The (values of 0. 02 day- 1 are characteristic of a low water supply deriving from small hillslope aquifers. These aquifers are typical of the intertropical african geomorphology, where there is no large groundwaters. A good relationship appears between the coefficients variations of recession and of drainage (Olivry, 1976). According to Darcy's law, the deviations from the norm would therefore mainly correspond to the variations in the aquifers width. The hydrogeological datas showed a drop of 10 m and more of the water table above hillslope aquifers in Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso during the 80 ís. Consequently, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the decrease of these small aquifers results in a comparable ´†hyperdepletion†ª in the basins of various areas affected by the same climatic hazards. A return to better sustained discharges during the dry season first requires the aquifers reconstitution. This cannot happen immediately, as shown by the low effect of the last better rainfall on depletion coefficients. There is no exact convergence between the variations of Lamb's rainfall index and the depletion coefficient ones. Through the aquifers, reactions to the low water restitution are slower; they require a response time of several years and only become effective with the accumulation of similar climatic variations. The groundwater supply deficit in rivers, considered here, which is noticeable in the dry season, is obviously underlying during the flood period and this also explains the low annual runoff and the poor flood maxima we still observe despite some rainfall recovery. The"memory effect" of the droughtness indicates the important part taken by the base flow in the flood hydrographs of large rivers. A specific stream drought, which could be refered to as a "phreatic drought", is to be added to the climatic drought with a pluriannual gap. The hydrogeological laws are such that, under good rainfall conditions, a restoring of the hydrological regime should last as long as it took to bring it to its current degradation...|$|R

40|$|N= 4 SYM {{theory has}} been drawing the {{attention}} of a lot of physicists during two last decades mainly due to the two aspects: AdS/CFT correspondence and integrability. AdS/CFT correspondence is the first precise realization of the gauge/string duality whose history starts in the 60 's, when a string theory was considered as a candidate for describing the strong interactions. In 1997 Maldacena made a proposal about the duality between certain conformal field theories (CFT) and string theories defined on the product of AdS space and some compact manifold, which implies a one to one map between the observables of the gauge and string counterparts. Up to now AdS/CFT correspondence still remains a conjecture. The duality of N= 4 SYM and the appropriate string counterpart is the most notable example of the AdS/CFT correspondence. One of the main obstructions to exploring it is the fact that weak coupling regime for the gauge theory is the strong coupling regime for the string theory and vice versa. Therefore as long as perturbative methods are applied, one can not compare the observables of dual counterparts directly apart from some specific cases. At this point the huge symmetry of N= 4 SYM plays an important role allowing exact computation of the theory observables at least in the planar limit. This property of the theory is called integrability. The observables of the N= 4 SYM are Wilson loops and correlation functions built out of gauge invariant operators. The space-time dependence of the two- and three-point correlators is fixed by the conformal symmetry up to some parameters: dimensions of the operators in the case of two-point functions and dimensions of the operators and structure constants in the case of three-point functions. It's commonly accepted to refer to the problem of finding the dimensions of the operators as the spectral problem. On the classical level the operator dimension is equal to the sum of the dimensions of the fundamental fields out of which the operator is composed. When the interaction is turned on, the conformal dimension gets quantum correction. In order to compute three-point functions, apart from the conformal dimensions of corresponding operators one needs to compute the structure constants. In CFT computation of the higher-point correlators eventually can be reduced to computation of two- and three-point functions by means of the operator product expansion. Therefore two- and three-point functions appear to be building blocks of any correlator of the theory. This thesis is devoted to computation of three-point functions and consists of two parts. In the first part we consider the general approach for computing three-point functions based on the so-called spin vertex, which is inspired from the string field theory. In the second part we consider a specific kind of three-point functions called heavy-heavy-light, which are characterized by the property that the length of one of the operators is much smaller the lengthes of other two. It happens that this kind of correlators can be considered as diagonal form factors which supposes that in this case one can apply the results obtained in the form factor theory. La correspondance AdS/CFT est la première réalisation précise de la dualité jauge/gravité. Jusqu’à maintenant la correspondance AdS/CFT reste une conjecture. La dualité de N = 4 SYM et la théorie des cordes est un exemple le plus notable de correspondance AdS/CFT. Un des obstacles principaux à l’explorer est le fait que le régime de couplage faible pour la théorie de <b>jauge</b> est le régime de couplage fort pour la théorie des cordes et vice versa. Par conséquent, aussi longtemps que les méthodes perturbatives sont appliquées, on ne peut pas comparer les observables de deux cotés de la correspondance directement en dehors de quelques cas particuliers. A ce stade, l’énorme symétrie de N = 4 SYM joue un rôle important en permettant le calcul exact des observables de la théorie au moins dans la limite planaire. Cette thèse est consacrée au calcul des fonctions à trois, l’un des principaux observables de N = 4 SYM, et est composée de deux parties. Dans la première partie nous considérons l’approche générale pour le calcul des fonctions à trois points sur la base de soi-disant vertex de spin, qui est inspiré de la théorie de champs des cordes. Dans la deuxième partie, nous considérons un type spécifique de fonctions à trois points appelés lourd-lourd-léger, qui sont caractérisés par la propriété que la longueur de l’un des opérateurs est beaucoup plus petite des longueurs de deux autres. Il s’avère que ces fonctions de corrélations peuvent être identifiées à des facteurs de forme diagonaux et ainsi on peut appliquer les résultats concernant les facteurs de forme...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{presents the}} results of a semeiological study of 170 children that has enabled us to identify a condition that we call “Unease in the Situation of Being Alone. ” As the name suggests, the essence of this condition is a feeling of unease that appears when the subject is alone. This sense of unease develops according to the following pattern: Already as an infant, the subject requires the presence of another person {{in order to be able}} to fall asleep. At around 2. 5 years, with the beginning of schooling away from home, the child has difficulties accepting separation from his or her parents. At around 5 years, the child shows an aversion to playing alone without the presence of another person or an animal; if he or she does play alone, then he or she will constantly ask where the adult is. With the onset of sleep, the child often calls out to his or her parents, and will sometimes even leave his or her bedroom or ask to sleep with the parents. At around 8 years, he or she will have no longer have any difficulties in leaving the house and the immediate presence of his or her parents, for example to go to play with neighbourhood friends. Nevertheless, he or she will be ill at ease if one of the parents should leave the house temporarily. At around 9 years, the child begins to display the typical adult symptomology, which consists in a vague feeling of unease that descends prior to falling asleep. The adult has trouble verbalizing this feeling, which is in fact unaccompanied by any representational content; the best description he or she can manage is to speak of an empty “void” or a “nothingness. ” He or she tries to delay going to sleep, say by reading in bed, in order to avoid this feeling. He or she will also try to wear himself or herself out, so as to be able to fall asleep quickly. The adult who feels this “uneasiness” during the day will counter it by one or more of the following 4 means: 1. various activities; 2. sensory input (for example, keeping the radio or TV switched on); 3. filling his or her "internal world" (for example, by reading); 4. a pet. Some conclusions and hypotheses regarding “Unease in the Situation of Being Alone”: A) It should be distinguished from Separation Anxiety; B) It correlates with a delayed appearance of the ability to grasp temporal landmarks. Note, however, that this delay does not concern the understanding of time-sequencing, or of objective notions of time, but rather affects the subjective apprehension of time. The subject is deficient in developing what we might call a “foretaste” of how long a certain period of time will last. C) Hypothesis: This condition is related to a malfunctioning of the neurophysiological platform that serves as the physiological basis for the evaluation of duration, or the internal gauge by which we anticipate temporal duration. D) This hypothesis would help to explain why “mental representations” are insufficient to enable the child to acquire the subjective feeling of “permanent” selfhood, precisely because he is deficient in an internal feeling for temporal duration. E) The condition that we have described is systematically present in cases of bipolarity, even though it is not pathognomic for bipolarity. It is found both in an isolated state and in other nosological entities. At a minimum, it is a simple characteristic of the person affected. Une recherche sémiologique sur 170 enfants a identifié ce que nous appelons : le "Mal-être en situation d'être seul". Un malaise apparaît lorsque le sujet est seul. Voici son décours développemental. Certains bébés réclament une présence physique pour s'endormir. Vers 2, 5 ans, l'enfant connaît une séparation difficile lors des premiers jours d'école. Vers 5 ans, l'enfant n'aime pas jouer seul dans une pièce sans la présence d'une autre personne ou d'un animal, et s'il le fait, il cherche à savoir en permanence où se trouve l'adulte. À l'endormissement, l'enfant appelle souvent, sort de la chambre. La nuit, il voudrait rejoindre les parents. Vers 8 ans, il n'aura pas de difficultés à quitter la maison et à se séparer de ses parents pour aller jouer avec des copains du quartier, mais il sera beaucoup plus mal à l'aise si l'un de ses parents quitte momentanément la maison. Vers 9 ans, la symptomatologie se limite à celle retrouvée chez l'adulte : un sentiment vague de mal-être à l'endormissement. L'adulte a des difficultés à mettre des mots sur ce ressenti qui est sans représentation : du "vide" ou un "rien". Il cherche à retarder la mise au lit, à s'occuper au lit pour éviter ce ressenti, et à s'endormir rapidement de fatigue. L'adulte qui ressent ce "mal-être" en journée va le contrer par 4 moyens : 1. des activités 2. un apport sensoriel (radios ouvertes, TV), 3. remplir son "monde interne" par la lecture, 4. un animal de compagnie. Le "mal-être en situation d'être seul" : A) Est à distinguer de l'angoisse de séparation; B) Est corrélé à un retard d'apparition des repères temporels, non pas séquentiels ou notionnels, mais dans l'appréhension subjective du temps : "goûter anticipativement ce que dure un certain laps de temps"; C) Hypothèse : il serait lié à un manque d'efficience d'un support neurophysiologique permettant l'évaluation de la longueur du temps : "la <b>jauge</b> interne d'évaluation anticipative du temps"; D) Ceci expliquerait qu'il ne suffit pas à l'enfant d'avoir des représentations mentales pour acquérir le sentiment subjectif d'une permanence mais qu'il faut y joindre ce "feeling" du temps; E) Il est systématiquement présent dans la bipolarité sans en être pathognomonique. Il se retrouve à l'état isolé et dans d'autres entités nosologiques. A minima, il est une caractéristique de la personne. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|De nombreuses méthodes régionales ont été développées pour améliorer l'estimation de la {{distribution}} des débits de crues en des sites où l'on dispose de peu d'information ou même d'aucune information. Cet article présente une synthèse de modèles hydrologiques utilisés en France et au Québec (Canada), à l'occasion d'un séminaire relatif aux " méthodes d'estimation régionale en hydrologie " tenu à Lyon en mai 1997. Les modèles français sont fortement liés à une technique d'extrapolation de la distribution des crues, la méthode du Gradex, qui repose sur l'exploitation probabiliste conjointe des séries hydrométriques et pluviométriques. Ceci explique les deux principaux volets d'études régionales pratiquées en France : les travaux liés à la régionalisation des pluies et ceux liés à la régionalisation des débits. Les modèles québecois comprennent généralement deux étapes : la définition et la détermination de régions hydrologiquement homogènes, puis l'estimation régionale, par le transfert à l'intérieur d'une même région de l'information des sites jaugés à un site non-jaugé ou partiellement <b>jaugé</b> pour lequel on ne dispose pas d'information suffisante. Après avoir donné un aperçu des méthodes pratiquées dans les deux pays, une discussion dégage les caractéristiques principales et les complémentarités des différentes approches et met en évidence l'intérêt de développer une collaboration plus étroite pour mieux tenir compte des particularités et des complémentarités des méthodes développées de part et d'autre. Une des pistes évoquées consiste à combiner l'information régionale pluviométrique (approche française) et hydrométrique (approche québécoise). Design flood estimates at ungauged {{sites or}} at gauged sites with short records {{can be obtained}} through regionalization techniques. Various methods have been employed {{in different parts of}} the world for the regional analysis of extreme hydrological events. These regionalization approaches make different assumptions and hypotheses concerning the hydrological phenomena being modeled, rely on various types of continuous and non-continuous data, and often fall under completely different theories. A research seminar dealing with " regional estimation methods in hydrology " took place in Lyon during the month of May 1997, and brought together various researchers and practitioners mainly from France and the Province of Quebec (Canada). The present paper is based on the conferences and discussions that took place during this seminar and aims to review, classify, comparatively evaluate, and potentially propose improvements to the most prominent regionalization techniques utilized in France and Quebec. The specific objectives of this paper are :· to review the main regional hydrologic models that have been proposed and commonly used during the last three decades;· to classify the literature into different groups according to the origin of the method, its specific objective, and the technique it adopts; · to present a comprehensive evaluation of the characteristics of the methods, and to point out the hypotheses, data requirements, strengths and weaknesses of each particular one; and · to investigate and identify potential improvements to the reviewed methods, by combining and extending the various approaches and integrating their particular strengths. Regionalization approaches adopted in France include the Gradex method which represents a simplified rainfall-runoff model which provides estimates of flood magnitudes of given probabilities and is based on rainfall data which often cover longer periods and are more reliable than flow data (Guillot and Duband, 1967; CFGB, 1994). It is based on the hypotheses that beyond a given rainfall threshold (known as the pivot point), all water is transformed into runoff, and that a rainfall event of a given duration generates runoff for the same length of time. These hypotheses are equivalent to assuming that, beyond the pivot point, the rainfall-runoff relationship is linear and that the precipitation and runoff probability curves are parallel on a Gumbel plot. In Quebec (and generally in North America), regional flood frequency analysis involves usually two steps : delineation of homogeneous regions, and regional estimation. In the first step, the focus is on identifying and regrouping sites which seem sufficiently homogeneous or sufficiently similar to the target ungauged site to provide a basis for information transfer. The second step of the analysis consists in inferring flood information (such as quantiles) at the target site using data from the stations identified in the first step of the analysis. Two types of " homogeneous " regions can be proposed : fixed set regions (geographically contiguous or non-contiguous) and neighborhood type of regions. The second type includes the methods of canonical correlation analysis and of the regions of influence. Regional estimation can be accomplished using one of two main approaches : index flood or quantile regression methods. The results of this work indicate that the philosophies of regionalization and the methods utilized in France and Quebec are complementary to each other and are based on different needs and outlooks. While the approaches followed in France are characterized by strong conceptual and geographic aspects with an emphasis on the utilization of information related to other phenomena (such as precipitations), the approaches adopted in Quebec rely on the strength of their statistical and stochastic components and usually condense the spatial and temporal information to a realistic functional form. This dissimilarity in the approaches being followed on either side may be originated by the distinct topographic and climatic characteristics of each region (France and Quebec) and by the differences in basin sizes and hydrometeorologic network densities. The conclusions of the seminar point to the large potential of improvements in regional estimation methods, which may result from an enhanced exchange between scientists from both sides : indeed, there is much to gain from learning about the dissimilarities between the various approaches, comparing their performances, and devising new methods that combine their individual strengths. Hence, the Gradex method for example could benefit from an increased utilization of regional flood information, while flood regionalization methods utilized in Quebec could gain much from the formalization of the use of rainfall information and from the integration of an improved modeling of physical hydrologic phenomena. This should result in the enhancement of the efficiency of regional estimation methods and their ability to handle various practical conditions. It is hoped that this research will contribute towards closing the gap between French and Quebec literature, and more generally between the European and the North American hydrological schools of thought, by narrowing the large literature that is available, by providing the necessary cross-evaluation of regional flood analysis models, and by providing comprehensive propositions for improved approaches for regional hydrologic modeling...|$|E
