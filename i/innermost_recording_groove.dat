50|$|Early {{methods of}} {{recording}} sound included phonograph cylinders (a stylus would draw wax grooves {{on the outside}} of a cylinder), gramophone <b>records</b> (<b>grooves</b> on the flat side of a disk) and magnetic recordings.|$|R
50|$|Holt was {{technically}} correct, as the Dynagroove process used tracing compensation, which pre-distorted the <b>record</b> <b>groove</b> {{to cancel}} out the distortion created by playback with a conical-shaped phonograph stylus, which could not track the <b>record</b> <b>groove</b> accurately in the high frequencies, especially in the inner grooves of an LP. The process worked well with playback via a conical stylus, typical of most phonograph cartridges prior to about 1964. However, if one played a Dynagroove record with an elliptical-shaped stylus, this pre-distortion became audible. As {{the decade of the}} 1960s progressed, high quality playback cartridges increasingly used elliptical styli. This development made tracing compensation obsolete by about 1970, and RCA quietly stopped using the technique.|$|R
50|$|A smooth-tipped stylus (in popular usage {{often called}} a needle {{due to the}} former use of steel needles for the purpose) is used to play the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove.</b> A special chisel-like stylus is used to engrave the groove into the master record.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Delta Groove {{launched}} a new <b>record</b> label, Eclecto <b>Groove</b> <b>Records,</b> as a home and showcase for {{a wide spectrum of}} musical styles.

50|$|In {{a moving}} magnet cartridge, the stylus {{cantilever}} carries a tiny permanent magnet, which is positioned between {{two sets of}} fixed coils (in a stereophonic cartridge), forming a tiny electromagnetic generator. As the magnet vibrates {{in response to the}} stylus following the <b>record</b> <b>groove,</b> it induces a tiny current in the coils.|$|R
50|$|In a {{phonograph}} reproducer, {{the diaphragm}} is a flat disk of typically mica isinglass that converts the mechanical vibration imparted on the buttress from the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove</b> into sound. In {{the case of}} acoustic recording the reproducer converts the sound into {{the motion of the}} needle that scribes the <b>groove</b> on the <b>recording</b> media.|$|R
50|$|In his {{analysis}} of voice and speech, he made use of photographic registration and magnification of the surface features of a phonograph <b>record's</b> <b>grooves</b> to visually display the sounds of speech. Through his work, he determined that the passage of air through the mouth cavity, modified for each vowel, strongly affected the harmonics of tones from the larynx.|$|R
5000|$|The RIAA {{was formed}} in 1952. [...] Its {{original}} mission was to administer recording copyright fees and problems, work with trade unions, and do research relating to the record industry and government regulations. [...] Early RIAA standards included the RIAA equalization curve, {{the format of the}} stereophonic <b>record</b> <b>groove</b> and the dimensions of 33 1/3 rpm, 45 rpm, and 78 rpm records.|$|R

50|$|The {{tone arm}} (or tonearm) holds the pickup {{cartridge}} over the groove, the stylus tracking the groove with the desired force {{to give the}} optimal compromise between good tracking and minimizing wear of the stylus and <b>record</b> <b>groove.</b> At its simplest, a tone arm is a pivoted lever, free to move in two axes (vertical and horizontal) with a counterbalance to maintain tracking pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first known}} hit single {{to have a}} <b>recorded</b> locked <b>groove</b> is [...] "Muskrat Love" [...] by Captain & Tennille. A few years later, in December 1975, a British artist known as Chris Hill did a {{break-in}} record (see Dickie Goodman or Bill Buchanan) called, [...] "Renta Santa" [...] on Philips 6006-491 that included a <b>recorded</b> locked <b>groove</b> {{at the end of}} the side.|$|R

5000|$|I {{believe that}} the use of noise to make music will {{continue}} and increase until we reach a music produced through the aid of electrical instruments which will make available for musical purposes any and all sounds that can be heard.

50|$|A new stylus {{invented by}} Keller made {{possible}} the first high-fidelity musical recordings after he worked with sound engineer, Irad S. Rafuse. Their ideas led the way for single-groove stereo records when they proposed recording two sound channels on a master disk. On April 19, 1938, Keller was issued US patent number 2,114,471 for his idea of recording the two channels of a stereo recording in one <b>record</b> <b>groove,</b> each at 45 degrees from vertical.|$|R
50|$|Phono cartridges, {{also known}} as pickups, are {{electromechanical}} devices which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The cartridge contains a removable or permanently mounted stylus, the tip of which makes physical contact with the <b>record's</b> <b>groove.</b> In popular usage and in disc jockey jargon, the stylus, and sometimes the entire cartridge, is often called the needle. The electrical signal generated by the cartridge can be amplified and then converted into sound by a loudspeaker.|$|R

5000|$|The design {{attacked}} the [...] "high-ground" [...] by eschewing the spring isolation, {{which was then}} regarded as a major strength. Instead, it addressed the issues of Groove drag and lateral rigidity, the ultimate objective of which was to stabilise the relationship between cartridge stylus and the spinning <b>record</b> <b>groove.</b> Springs were not considered sufficiently rigid in the lateral plane, and permitted too much rotation of the suspended parts relative to the motor.|$|R
5000|$|Welsh band Super Furry Animals {{released}} the album Rings Around The World as a 3-record set on Epic Records. Sides 1, 2 and 4 played normally. Side 3 played {{from the inside}} out and side 5 was on a 7-inch single. The side consisted of one <b>recorded</b> <b>groove</b> {{in the center of the}} record and was a perfectly timed loop of the music for a non-album song called, [...] "All the Shit U Do." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Decca Record Brush. The idea {{of using}} carbon fibre (CF) to clean LPs came from Tristan Cooper who {{obtained}} some CF for use in his GRP racing car body. CF is very fine, stiff, and conducts electricity, making it ideal for cleaning narrow <b>record</b> <b>grooves</b> and conducting away any static electricity build-up. Tristan's brother Warwick developed the manufacturing process for the brushes, producing {{hundreds of thousands of}} [...] "Million Bristle" [...] CF brushes under the Decca brand.|$|R

The company took its name from its top managers: Harry, Fred and Clarence Gennett. Earlier, the company had produced recordings under the Starr Records label. The early issues were vertically cut in the gramophone <b>record</b> <b>grooves,</b> using the hill-and-dale method of a U-shaped groove and sapphire ball stylus, but they switched to the more popular lateral cut method in April 1919.|$|R
