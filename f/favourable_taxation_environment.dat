40|$|Excluding {{the cost}} of carbon {{pollution}} from decision-making creates market distortions and the undervaluation of emission reduction, argues this report. Overview Australia’s energy sector {{has a long history}} of subsidies, ranging from government-built infrastructure to <b>favourable</b> <b>taxation</b> regimes. The most significant current subsidy is the unpriced cost of carbon emissions, measured as the impacts of climate change on economic growth, environmental systems, health, and security. Excluding {{the cost of}} carbon pollution from decision-making creates market distortions and the undervaluation of emission reduction. Other countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, and institutions like the International Monetary Fund have begun to address this “carbon subsidy” by incorporating the costs of carbon pollution in public policy-making. Without policies to significantly cut energy emissions, the carbon subsidy to energy will continue to grow. The annual carbon subsidy to non-electricity energy is projected to be about $ 12 - 36 billion by 2020 and $ 16 - 49 billion by 2030...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{demonstrate}} that, during the fixed charge years, Divisions 420, 820 and 855 Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (ITAA 97 ) are {{inconsistent with the}} object contained in s 3 (a) of the Clean Energy Act 2011 (Cth) (Clean Energy Act). Section 3 (a) states the Clean Energy Act was enacted {{to give effect to}} Australias obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. Broadly, the obligations that arise under these agreements are the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Clean Energy Act introduces a GHG pricing mechanism commencing 1 July 2012. The mechanism has two distinct phases; the fixed charge years and the flexible charge years. There are three fixed charge years where the price of carbon is statutorily defined and operates like a tax. The mechanism adopts a carbon unit as the basis of operation during both phases. The thesis identifies that the mechanism introduced by the Clean Energy Act is inconsistent with s 3 (a) Clean Energy Act during the fixed charge years due to the unlimited availability of carbon units and the inability to surrender units generated under the Kyoto Protocol. However, as obligations arising under the Kyoto Protocol are limited to the first commitment period (2008 - 2012), only fixed charge years were considered. Division 420 of the ITAA 97 was enacted to address the taxation treatment of carbon units. This thesis demonstrates that the operation of Division 420 does not provide an incentive to limit GHG emissions. This is principally due to the <b>favourable</b> <b>taxation</b> treatment of free carbon units. Free carbon units are generated through the Jobs and Competitiveness Program introduced by the Clean Energy Act. Free carbon units are allocated based on the entitys production levels. Therefore, incentives to hold free carbon units are inconsistent with a reduction of GHG emissions. In addition, this thesis identifies distortions that arise to the operation of Divisions 820 and 855 ITAA 97 resulting from the allocation of free carbon units. For foreign entities, these distortions amplify the <b>favourable</b> <b>taxation</b> treatment when free carbon units are held...|$|R

The distribution of income is then endogenously determined by both technological parameters of production, {{and the distribution of}} agents' discount parameters. Degenerate wealth distributions, in which only the most patient agents have any wealth, are avoided by having a fraction of the agents die each period, and bequeath their wealth to descendants with independently random discount parameters. On average, more patient agents will have higher wealths and incomes, but in the short run agents' stocks of wealth depend on their inherited wealth. If a patient individual lives long enough, she will retire and live on only investment income, while if an impatient individual lives long enough, he will deplete all his wealth and live on only labour earnings. The effects of a general increase in patience are an increase in the wage rate, a lowering of the return on capital, and general increases in wealth, income, and utility. Possibilities for engineering such an increase, by promoting 'artificial patience', could include <b>favourable</b> <b>taxation</b> of investment income, forced savings such as payroll-tax financed pension plans, or public subsidies for education and health. time-preference, patience, wealth...|$|R

Results. “Predominant” RYO use (i. e., > 50 % of cigarettes smoked) increased {{significantly in the}} UK and USA {{as a proportion of}} all cigarette use (both P <. 001) and in all countries as a proportion of any RYO use (all P <. 010).

Relative cost was the major reason given for using RYO, and predominant RYO use is consistently and significantly associated with low income. Conclusions. RYO market trends reflect the price advantages accruing to RYO (a product of <b>favourable</b> <b>taxation</b> regimes in some jurisdictions reinforced by the enhanced control over the amount of tobacco used), especially following the impact of the Global Financial Crisis; the availability of competing low-cost alternatives to RYO; accessibility of duty-free RYO tobacco; and tobacco industry niche marketing strategies.
