5|$|All of the {{buildings}} in Lakeshore East are luxury condos and <b>high-end</b> apartment highrises. Many of them are named with an aquatic theme. In addition to the luxury skyscrapers, the development will include 24 ultra-luxury town homes in the $2 million price range.|$|E
5|$|Although Itanium did attain {{limited success}} in the niche market of <b>high-end</b> computing, Intel had {{originally}} hoped it would find broader acceptance {{as a replacement for}} the original x86 architecture.|$|E
5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a <b>high-end</b> audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's <b>high-end</b> electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E
5|$|Appraised <b>high-end</b> {{restaurants}} serving international gourmet cuisine include Frederikshøj, Restaurant Varna, Nordisk Spisehus, Det Glade Vanvid, La Pyramide, Restaurant ET and Dauphine, all considered {{among the}} best places to eat in Denmark. Restaurants in Aarhus were the first in Denmark outside Copenhagen to receive Michelin stars since 2015.|$|E
5|$|During development, Intel, HP, and {{industry}} analysts predicted that IA-64 would dominate in servers, workstations, and <b>high-end</b> desktops, and eventually supplant RISC and complex instruction set computing (CISC) architectures for all general-purpose applications.|$|E
5|$|Ghost in the Shells {{recording}} {{was done}} with a <b>high-end</b> studio to achieve superior sound throughout the film. A spatializer was used to alter the sound, specifically in the electronic brain conversations, to modify the voices.|$|E
5|$|Makemake is {{currently}} visually the second-brightest Kuiper belt object after Pluto, having a March opposition apparent magnitude of 17.0 {{in the constellation}} Coma Berenices. This is bright enough to be visible using a <b>high-end</b> amateur telescope.|$|E

5|$|The low-end {{model was}} sold with 1MB memory, a 1.44 MB floppy drive, no hard disk, and {{included}} a keyboard for $999. The <b>high-end</b> model cost $1,499 but contained an additional 1MB memory expansion card and a 40MB hard disk.|$|E
5|$|HBO has {{licensed}} {{a variety}} of merchandise based on Game of Thrones, including games, replica weapons and armor, jewelry, bobblehead dolls by Funko, beer by Ommegang and apparel. <b>High-end</b> merchandise includes a $10,500 Ulysse Nardin wristwatch and a $30,000 resin replica of the Iron Throne. In 2013 and 2014, a traveling exhibition of costumes, props, armor and weapons from the series visited major cities in Europe and the Americas.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the hotel's {{management}} {{sought to}} create more elaborate features {{to compete with the}} other modern Las Vegas developments. The Forum Shops at Caesars opened in 1992; {{it was one of the}} first venues in the city where shopping, particularly at <b>high-end</b> fashion house stores, was an attraction in itself. A new redevelopment opened on October 22, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Oberon was {{discovered}} by William Herschel on January 11, 1787; {{on the same day}} he discovered Uranus's largest moon, Titania. He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites, although they were subsequently revealed as spurious. For nearly fifty years following their discovery, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel's, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day <b>high-end</b> amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{initially}} forecast Rick {{to make landfall}} {{in southern}} Baja California as a <b>high-end</b> Category2 hurricane, prompting hurricane watches. Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after the storm had weakened. Overall, the damage from Rick was significantly less than initially anticipated. In Mexico, three people {{were killed by the}} storm, one in Oaxaca and two in Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Shinan is {{a center}} for political, {{business}} and finance activities, and is home to investment from {{an increasing number of}} Fortune 500 companies. To facilitate urban planning, it is divided into a number of areas, including a port and logistics area, tourism area, software/IT area, <b>high-end</b> retail area and financial area.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro is {{a series}} of {{workstation}} and server computers manufactured by Apple Inc. The Mac Pro, in most configurations and in terms of speed and performance, is the most powerful computer that Apple offers. It is the <b>high-end</b> model of the three desktop computers in the current Mac lineup, the other two being the iMac and Mac Mini.|$|E
5|$|The MacBook Pro (sometimes {{abbreviated}} MBP) {{is a line}} of Macintosh {{portable computers}} introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc. Replacing the PowerBook G4, the MacBook Pro was the second model to be announced during the Apple–Intel transition, after the iMac. It is the <b>high-end</b> model of the MacBook family and is currently available in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. A 17-inch version was available between April 2006 and June 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of a {{movement}} in London wherein <b>high-end</b> restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La Tante Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel. The Restaurant's location in a hotel was thought at the time to have changed the mantra of not eating in a hotel-based restaurant to one where it was more openly acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The low {{weight and}} high {{rigidity}} of beryllium make it {{useful as a}} material for high-frequency speaker drivers. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to <b>high-end</b> home, pro audio, and public address applications. Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed {{to be made of}} the material.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mamilla Street {{extended from}} the Mamilla Pool to Jaffa Gate. Along this street, wealthy Arabs constructed homes, offices and stores in the 1800s. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, and especially during the British Mandate era, the street became a fashionable commercial district. Both Arab and Jewish businessmen operated <b>high-end</b> shops for furniture, textiles, housewares, art, photography, and automobile showrooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{service is}} {{typically}} used for valuable and somewhat time-sensitive cargo where the time advantage of rail over ship is essential, which, however, is heavy {{enough to make}} the cost saving vs. air transport noticeable. Typical cargoes include complex machinery and spare parts (in both directions), as well as <b>high-end</b> groceries and consumer goods (primarily toward China). While major customers ship their products by full container load, freight forwarders also make it possible to send less-than-container shipments.|$|E
5|$|Thorium was {{formerly}} {{used as an}} alloying element in TIG welding electrodes, as a material in <b>high-end</b> optics and scientific instrumentation, and as the light source in gas mantles, but these have become marginal uses. It has been suggested {{as a replacement for}} uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors, and several thorium reactors have been completed.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many <b>high-end</b> California Thoroughbred trainers, {{who usually}} are {{headquartered}} at Santa Anita Park, the Shermans kept horses at Hollywood Park, {{but when it}} closed in December 2013, Los Alamitos Race Course picked {{up some of the}} Thoroughbred races and trainers who had stabled horses at Hollywood Park, including Sherman. The success of California Chrome, who was conditioned there over the track that had been recently expanded to accommodate longer races, created good publicity for Los Alamitos.|$|E
5|$|An article {{published}} by Politico in September 2017, cited a self-assessment by the 173rd Airborne Brigade as {{stating that the}} brigade lacked “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed”. The document detailed a number of “capability gaps”, which had been identified during the brigade′s training with Ukrainian troops that had experience fighting against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The report described deficiencies in air defense and electronic warfare units {{as well as an}} over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems. These are said to make the unit vulnerable to an enemy with <b>high-end</b> equipment and technology.|$|E
5|$|As Danielle tracked westward {{into the}} open Atlantic early on August14, the storm {{encountered}} warmer water southwest of Cape Verde and began to gradually intensify, becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50mph (85km/h) winds that morning. At that point, a bout of rapid intensification began to take place, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Danielle that evening as an eye began to form. Over a 24‑hour period ending {{in the morning of}} August15, the pressure fell from 1004 to 978mbar and the winds increased to 90mph (145km/h), making it a <b>high-end</b> Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|At Panola, Oppong earned all-conference {{honors and}} led them to a fairly {{successful}} season in the NJCAA Region XIV. Entering the next season, he became a <b>high-end</b> Canadian recruit for programs in the NCAA. Oppong ultimately chose to play for Eastern Kentucky under head coach Jeff Neubauer. He was a starter {{from time to time}} as his junior season progressed. However, he suffered a shoulder injury {{in the middle of the}} season that sidelined him for several of his games. He returned to the starting lineup by the postseason. Oppong did not earn any major awards at the Division I level, but was considerably more effective as a senior, as he developed into a bigger scorer for Eastern Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and {{dimensional}} stability {{over a wide}} temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme <b>high-end</b> bicycle frames have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the storm}} crossed 180°, {{entering}} the western Pacific basin and being re-designated as a typhoon. The storm tracked steadily northwestward, attaining a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a <b>high-end</b> Category 3 storm, before turning {{back towards the}} east. The storm gradually weakened, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September17 and again crossing the International Date Line. The system dissipated shortly thereafter over open waters. Throughout its existence, Hurricane/Typhoon Della traveled roughly , the longest known track of any Pacific hurricane at the time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} ten years the city has {{experienced}} an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning. Today, Amman is known as a modern, liberal and westernized Arab city, with major mega projects such as the Abdali Urban Regeneration Project and the Jordan Gate Towers. The city contains several <b>high-end</b> hotel franchises including the Four Seasons Hotel Amman, Sheraton Hotel Amman, Fairmont Amman, St. Regis Hotel Amman, Le Royal Hotel and others.|$|E
5|$|From the students, 10 were handpicked for the Mumbai mission. They also {{received}} training in swimming and sailing, besides {{the use of}} <b>high-end</b> weapons and explosives {{under the supervision of}} LeT commanders. According to a media report citing an unnamed former Defence Department Official of the US, the intelligence agencies of the US had determined that former officers from Pakistan's Army and Inter-Services Intelligence agency assisted actively and continuously in training. They were given blueprints of all the four targets– The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Oberoi Trident, Nariman House and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the <b>high-end</b> of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Lexus became {{among the}} first premium car marques to equip models with premium audio systems, in {{partnership}} with stereo firm Nakamichi. Since 2001, optional surround sound systems are offered via <b>high-end</b> audio purveyor Mark Levinson. For reduced cabin noise, the first LS 400 introduced sandwich steel plating, and later models added acoustic glass. In 2006, the LS 460 debuted the first ceiling air diffusers and infrared body temperature sensors in a car. Telematics services include G-Book with G-Link in Asia and Lexus Enform in North America.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, Microsoft {{released}} a refreshed Xbox One model, Xbox One S, {{which has a}} streamlined design, native support for 4K video playback and upscaling, and HDR10 high-dynamic-range color. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as {{the lack of a}} native Kinect port were noted. A <b>high-end</b> model, Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 2017 for release in November, which features major hardware upgrades focused on enabling games to be rendered at 4K resolution.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, YouTube {{introduced}} videos {{playing at}} 60 frames per second, {{in order to}} reproduce video games with a frame rate comparable to <b>high-end</b> graphics cards. The videos play back at a resolution of 720p or higher. YouTube videos are available {{in a range of}} quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports Windows XP, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.|$|E
5|$|Late on 10April, {{the center}} of Olivia passed near Barrow Island at peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed near Varanus Island as a <b>high-end</b> Category4 or low-end Category5 cyclone. Within several hours of passing by Varanus Island, Olivia made {{landfall}} near Mardie at peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to weaken overland. Accelerating to the southeast, the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below hurricane-force. During the afternoon of 11April, Olivia weakened to a tropical low over southern Australia. It moved over the Great Australian Bight and lost its identity as a gale-force low on 12April, after it was absorbed by a trough.|$|E
