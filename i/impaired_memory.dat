25|$|Alzheimer's Disease: A study {{published}} in Archives of Neurology in February 2003 suggested that the intake of both trans fats and saturated fats promote the development of Alzheimer disease, although not confirmed in an animal model. It {{has been found that}} trans fats <b>impaired</b> <b>memory</b> and learning in middle-age rats. The trans-fat eating rats' brains had fewer proteins critical to healthy neurological function.

25|$|Though no universally {{accepted}} definition of postconcussive syndrome exists, {{most of the}} literature defines the syndrome as the development of at least 3 of the following symptoms: headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, <b>impaired</b> <b>memory</b> and concentration, insomnia, and lowered tolerance for noise and light. One complication in diagnosis is that symptoms of PCS also occur in {{people who have no}} history of head injury, but who have other medical and psychological complaints. In one study 64% of people with TBI, 11% of those with brain injuries, and 7% of those with other injuries met the DSM-IV criteria for post-concussion syndrome. Many of these PCS sufferers were misdiagnosed as having other unrelated conditions due to commonality of symptoms. (see diagnosis, below).|$|E
25|$|Associated {{features}} are clinical phenomena that often accompany the disorder {{but are not}} part of the diagnostic criteria. In adults with the condition, bipolar disorder is often accompanied by changes in cognitive processes and abilities. These include reduced attentional and executive capabilities and <b>impaired</b> <b>memory.</b> How the individual processes the universe also depends on the phase of the disorder, with differential characteristics between the manic, hypomanic and depressive states. Some studies have found a significant association between bipolar disorder and creativity. Those with bipolar disorder may have difficulty in maintaining relationships. There are several common childhood precursors seen in children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder; these disorders include mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).|$|E

[...] These encoding problems are associated with an <b>impaired</b> <b>memory</b> for faces, which is in turn associated with impairments in social functioning.|$|E
40|$|Although {{nicotine}} {{can enhance}} some cognitive functions, cigarette smoking may <b>impair</b> <b>memory</b> and sleep quality. Our {{aim was to}} investigate the impact of cigarette smoking on memory and sleep quality in healthy smokers. Sixty-eight healthy participants (34 smokers and 34 controls) completed the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and a Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test was performed, and Hochberg’s Sharpened Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. The results show that current smokers had a worse visual memory compared to nonsmokers. There was no significant correlation between the index of Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and Fagerström test for nicotine dependence. Moreover, smokers had poorer sleep quality. Cigarette smoking might <b>impair</b> <b>memory</b> and adversely influence sleep quality...|$|R

2500|$|A formal {{survey of}} {{dextromethorphan}} users showed {{that more than}} half of users reported experience of the following withdrawal-symptoms individually for the first week after long-term/addictive dextromethorphan use: fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. Over a quarter reported insomnia, nightmares, anhedonia, <b>impaired</b> <b>memory,</b> attention deficit and decreased libido. Rarer side effects included panic attacks, impaired learning, tremor, jaundice, urticaria (hives) and myalgia. DXM has also been [...] "known to increase the frequency of complex partial seizures in epileptics by 25% compared to placebo." [...] Frequent and long-term usage at high doses could possibly lead to toxic psychosis and other permanent psychological problems. It is important to note that medical DXM use has not been shown to cause the above issues.|$|E
2500|$|An older 2003 {{review of}} linkage studies also listed seven genes {{as likely to}} {{increase}} risk for a later diagnosis of the disorder. Two recent reviews suggested that the evidence was strongest for two genes known as dysbindin (DTNBP1) and neuregulin (NRG1), and {{that a number of}} other genes (such as COMT, RGS4, PPP3CC, ZDHHC8, DISC1, and AKT1) showed some early promising results. Knockout studies in Drosophila show that reduced expression of dysbindin reduced glutamatergic synaptic transmission, resulting in <b>impaired</b> <b>memory.</b> [...] Variations near the gene FXYD6 have also been associated with schizophrenia in the UK but not in Japan. In 2008, rs7341475 SNP of the reelin gene was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in women, but not in men. This female-specific association was replicated in several populations. Still another review found evidence that the protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) might be involved in susceptibility to schizophrenia.|$|E
2500|$|Bromazepam {{is similar}} in side effects to other benzodiazepines. The most common side effects {{reported}} are drowsiness, sedation, ataxia, memory impairment, and dizziness. Impairments to memory functions are common with bromazepam and include a reduced working memory and reduced ability to process environmental information. [...] A 1975 experiment on healthy, male college students exploring the effects of four different drugs on learning capacity observed that taking bromazepam alone at 6mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks impaired learning capacities significantly. In combination with alcohol, impairments in learning capacity became even more pronounced. Various studies report <b>impaired</b> <b>memory,</b> visual information processing and sensory data and impaired psychomotor performance; deterioration of cognition including attention capacity and impaired co-ordinative skills; impaired reactive and attention performance, which can impair driving skills; drowsiness and decrease in libido. Unsteadiness after taking bromazepam is, however, less pronounced than other benzodiazepines such as lorazepam.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{learning}} and <b>memory</b> functions are <b>impaired</b> by centrally administered oxytocin. Also, systemic oxytocin administration can <b>impair</b> <b>memory</b> retrieval in certain aversive memory tasks.

30|$|Numerous {{scientific}} {{studies have been}} carried on Ganoderma lucidum for evaluating the pharmacological activities of the mushroom.

2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is most {{marked for}} events {{occurring}} in the weeks or months before treatment, with one study showing that although some people lose memories from years prior to treatment, recovery of such memories was [...] "virtually complete" [...] by seven months post-treatment, with the only enduring loss being memories {{in the weeks and}} months prior to the treatment. Anterograde memory loss is usually limited to the time of treatment itself or shortly afterwards. In the weeks and months following ECT these memory problems gradually improve, but some people have persistent losses, especially with bilateral ECT. One published review summarizing the results of questionnaires about subjective memory loss found that between 29% and 55% of respondents believed they experienced long-lasting or permanent memory changes. In 2000, American psychiatrist Sarah Lisanby and colleagues found that bilateral ECT left patients with more persistently <b>impaired</b> <b>memory</b> of public events as compared to RUL ECT.|$|E
2500|$|Accordingly, {{several studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that the presentation of emotionally arousing stimuli (compared to neutral stimuli) results in enhanced memory for central details (details central to the appearance or meaning of the emotional stimuli) and <b>impaired</b> <b>memory</b> for peripheral details. Also consistent with this hypothesis are findings of weapon focus effect, in which witnesses to a crime remember the gun or knife in great detail but not other details such as the perpetrator's clothing or vehicle. In laboratory replications it was found that participants spend a disproportionate amount of time looking at a weapon in a scene, and this looking time is inversely related to the likelihood that individuals will subsequently identify the perpetrator of the crime. Other researchers have suggested arousal may also increase the duration of attentional focusing on the arousing stimuli, thus delaying the disengagement of attention from it. [...] Ochsner (2000) summarized the different findings and suggested that by influencing attention selectivity and dwell time, arousing stimuli are more distinctively encoded, resulting in more accurate memory of those stimuli.|$|E

40|$|The {{concurrent}} {{application of}} subtoxic doses of soluble oligomeric forms of human amyloid-beta (oAβ) and Tau (oTau) proteins <b>impairs</b> <b>memory</b> and its electrophysiological surrogate long-term potentiation (LTP), effects {{that may be}} mediated by intra-neuronal oligomers uptake. Intrigued by these findings, we investigated whether oAβ and oTau share a common mechanism when they <b>impair</b> <b>memory</b> and LTP in mice. We found that as already shown for oAβ, also oTau can bind to amyloid precursor protein (APP). Moreover, efficient intra-neuronal uptake of oAβ and oTau requires expression of APP. Finally, the toxic effect of both extracellular oAβ and oTau on memory and LTP is dependent upon APP since APP-KO mice were resistant to oAβ- and oTau-induced defects in spatial/associative memory and LTP. Thus, APP might serve as a common therapeutic target against Alzheimer's Disease (AD) {{and a host of}} other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal levels of Aβ and/or Tau...|$|R
50|$|The {{neurological}} {{changes that}} take place during adolescence improve the regulation of emotion {{over the course of}} adolescence, particularly maturation of the frontal lobes. The frontal lobes are essential for controlling attention and inhibiting thoughts and behaviors. This leads to them being able to inhibit undesirable or painful emotions and enhance desirable or pleasant emotions. By learning this adolescents can attempt to suppress their emotions and attempt to reappraise the situation. Suppression may decrease expression but it tends to increase arousal and it tends to <b>impair</b> <b>memory.</b> While reappraisal may be more difficult to do, it can decrease the subjective experience of the emotion the expression of the emotion, and it does so without <b>impairing</b> <b>memory.</b> Therefore, as adolescents grow in maturity they also learn how to regulate their emotions, which has both positive and negative effects on their relationships with family and friends.|$|R
