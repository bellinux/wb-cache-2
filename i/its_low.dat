5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by <b>its</b> <b>low</b> logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As a result of <b>its</b> <b>low</b> lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is {{less than that of}} phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E
