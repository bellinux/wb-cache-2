5|$|SST Records {{released}} Double Nickels on the Dime {{on double}} vinyl in July 1984. SST delayed {{the release of}} Zen Arcade by Hüsker Dü so that both albums could be released simultaneously. After the release of Double Nickels on the Dime, Minutemen toured almost constantly to promote the record. One 1984 tour saw the band playing 57 dates in 63 days. The album sold <b>fifteen</b> <b>thousand</b> copies during 1984, a respectable amount for a band on an independent record label. As of 2008, Double Nickels on the Dime remains Minutemen's best-selling record.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{begins with}} the {{character}} of Harriet Byron leaving the house of her uncle, George Selby, to visit Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, her cousins, in London. She is an orphan who was educated by her grandparents, and, though she lacks parents, she is heir to a fortune of <b>fifteen</b> <b>thousand</b> pounds, which causes many suitors to pursue her. In London, she is pursued by three suitors, Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Orme. This courtship is followed by more suitors: Mr. Fowler, Sir Rowland Meredith and Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. The final one, Pollexfen, pursues Byron vigorously, which causes her to criticise him over a lack of morals and decency of character. However, Pollexfen does not end his pursuits of Byron until she explains that she could never receive his visits again.|$|E
5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen {{who had heard}} the news were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of the}} march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, <b>fifteen</b> <b>thousand</b> guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E

40|$|The {{project was}} {{motivated}} by an ASME 2016 design challenge. The challenge was to design and manufacture a device that would turn a single sheet of paper into a paper airplane and launch it. The project {{is divided into three}} portions. The three portions are the frame and paper loading, folding mechanism, and launching. The circumference equation is used, to determine what is the proper speed of the paper loading motor. Notably, a slow rpm motor is needed for the loading mechanism to prevent the paper from being damaged. To avoid any deflection in the frame, the total weight of the machine had to be considered. The shear and moment diagram is used to calculate the reaction forces, and to calculate the proper thickness of the material being used. Four motors are used for the paper loading and folding processes, in which each motor has fifteen RPM. Additionally, two linear actuators are used in the paper folding process. Moreover, the launching process requires two motors, each has <b>fifteen</b> <b>thousands</b> RPM. All of the motors that have been mentioned require a twelve-volt battery. Both the launcher motors and the actuators are connected to a single battery. For the other motors, each two motors are connected to one battery. Each battery is connected to on-off switch. As a result, the machine is able to fold a standard sheet of paper into an airplane shape and launch it within 2 minutes. The launcher is able to shoot the paper airplane 10 meters...|$|R

Haussmann forced them to consolidate into a single company, the Compagnie parisienne d'éclairage et de chauffage par le gaz, with rights to provide gas to Parisians for fifty years. Consumption of gas tripled between 1855 and 1859. In 1850 there were only 9000 gaslights in Paris; by 1867, the Paris Opera and four other major theaters alone had <b>fifteen</b> <b>thousand</b> gas lights. Almost all the new residential buildings of Paris had gaslights in the courtyards and stairways; the monuments and public buildings of Paris, the arcades of the Rue de Rivoli, and the squares, boulevards and streets were illuminated at night by gaslights. For the first time, Paris was the City of Light.|$|E

Burton had the fastest time (46.557 seconds, <b>fifteen</b> <b>thousands</b> of a second faster than Jamie McMurray) in the first practice session. Kyle Busch (with a time of 46.581 seconds) was third, ahead of Michael Waltrip and Mark Martin. Jimmie Johnson, Ryan Newman, Kasey Kahne, Joey Logano and Bowyer rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session and were six-tenths of a second within Burton's time. Denny Hamlin got into the rear of Martin in the first turn {{towards the end of the}} session, beginning a chain-reaction accident involving cars driven by Bowyer, Logano, Greg Biffle and Brian Vickers. McMurray, Martin, Bowyer, Biffle and Hamlin were required to use their backup cars. Kahne was fastest in the second practice session, with a time of 46.955 seconds. Ken Schrader was second, ahead of Matt Kenseth and Johnson. Tony Stewart was fifth fastest, with a time of 47.054 seconds. Vickers, Burton, Juan Pablo Montoya, Carl Edwards and Logano rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers. John Andretti slowed which caused Kurt Busch to slow in avoidance; Montoya hit the rear of Kurt Busch which sent him into the wall. Kurt Busch was required to go into a back up car. Stewart drove to his garage in the middle of the session and had his radiator changed because debris went through it, and Johnson stopped his car after a completing one lap after the earlier accident.|$|R
