50|$|<b>Head-on</b> <b>collisions</b> {{often have}} poor {{outcomes}} {{because of the}} speed involved when the collision takes place. The typical cause of <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions</b> is when one vehicle inadvertently strays {{into the path of}} an oncoming vehicle. However, the root cause sometimes lies in a steering overcorrection after veering {{to the side of the}} road as opposed to the centre.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} conjectured that in <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions</b> of neutron stars (NSs), the merged object would not {{collapse}} promptly {{even if the}} total mass {{is higher than the}} maximum stable mass of a cold NS. In this paper, we show that the reverse is true: even if the total mass is less than the maximum stable mass, the merged object can collapse promptly. We demonstrate this for the case of NSs with a realistic equation of state (the Lattimer-Swesty EOS) in head-on and near <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions.</b> We propose a "Prompt Collapse Conjecture" for a generic NS EOS for head on and near <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Phy.

5|$|A set {{of events}} {{similar to those}} that doomed Star Dust also caused the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 in 1972 (depicted in the film Alive), though there were {{survivors}} from that crash because it involved a glancing blow to a mountainside rather than a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision.</b>|$|E
5|$|An inquest in April 2008 {{found that}} Jones had sped over a {{pedestrian}} crossing {{on the wrong}} side of the road, leading to a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision.</b> His death was recorded as an accident, but it was confirmed that had he survived, he would have been facing two charges of death by dangerous driving.|$|E

5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr had {{its share}} of accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back {{from the front of the}} locomotive to above a large nose, as on EMD F-unit and EMD E-unit locomotives.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 1960, {{an empty}} stock train formed of two 4COR {{electric}} multiple units overran signals {{and was in}} a sidelong collision with a steam-hauled passenger train that was departing for , Dorset. A few people suffered slight injuries. On 11 April the following year, an electric multiple unit overran signals and was in a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> with a steam locomotive. One person was killed and fifteen were injured.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{at least}} two fatal {{accidents}} have occurred on the portion of NY210 that runs alongside Greenwood Lake. On July15, 1940, a Brooklyn couple was killed when their car struck a stone ledge near the lake. Two others were injured in the accident. On December1, 1968, three were killed and one person was injured when two cars had a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> {{just north of the}} New Jersey state line.|$|E
50|$|Sealing {{of safety}} zones {{along the side}} of the road (also known as a hard-shoulder) can also reduce the risk of <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions</b> caused by {{steering}} over-correction.|$|R
5000|$|Lane {{departure}} crashes, which {{occur when}} a driver leaves the lane {{they are in}} and collide with another vehicle or a roadside object. These include <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions</b> and run-off-road collisions.|$|R
25|$|For {{major roads}} risk {{can be reduced}} by {{providing}} limited access from properties and local roads, grade separated junctions and median dividers between opposite-direction traffic to reduce likelihood of <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bokhary's {{vehicle was}} {{involved}} in a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> with a bus on Stubbs Road shortly after midnight on 27 January 2010. She refused paramedics' attempts to put her on a stretcher, returned to her vehicle, and continued to refuse to cooperate. She then attempted {{to walk away from the}} scene, but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 A.R. Angus, an Australian inventor, brought two {{locomotives}} {{onto the}} lower {{section of the}} line to test and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device. The demonstration of the system took place at Kentsford on 5 July 1912, which turned into something of a gala for local people, watching two hired GWR tender locos, the only tender locos to work this line, being brought safely to a halt rather than the anticipated <b>head-on</b> <b>collision.</b> Testing of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision,</b> but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
50|$|The Pattullo Bridge is 1227 m {{in total}} length, and {{consists}} of four lanes, with two in each direction. The bridge has no barrier of any sort in the centre, making it highly prone to <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions,</b> especially at excessive speed or in bad weather. In recent years, TransLink has closed the middle lanes to traffic from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. {{in an effort to}} lower the high number of <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions,</b> and installed a series of plastic pillars to raise the visibility of the centre-lane divider. On January 2, 2006, four people were killed in a T-bone collision between two cars on the southern approach lane.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{measures}} can also reduce the frequency and severity of <b>head-on</b> <b>collisions.</b> Median barriers are a form of guard rail that turn head-on crashes into fixed object crashes. Curve delineation and cross-section improvements can reduce loss-of-control incidents.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of a tramway between Manchester and Stretford in 1901, the British Electric Traction Company applied to Parliament for an extension to Sale. The proposal was amended to continue the line further south, into Altrincham. The line through Sale was owned by Sale Urban District Council and leased to the Manchester Corporation. Services to Sale commenced in 1907. A branch along Northenden Road from the line to Sale Moor was created in 1912. Sale Moor's line had only a single track which in 1925 resulted in a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> between two tramcars, injuring eight passengers. Bus services were first introduced to the area in the 1920s, but became more widespread in the 1930s. The buses did not suffer the drawback of being limited to tracks and were therefore more practical than the tram services, which from the 1930s went into decline. The tramlines along Northenden Road were removed between 1932 and 1934, and throughout Sale in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Specifically, the HPP lattice gas model {{consists}} of particles moving at unit velocity {{in the four}} axis-parallel directions. When two particles meet on the same line in opposite directions, they collide and are sent outwards from the collision point on the perpendicular line. This system obeys the conservation laws of physical gases, and produces simulations whose appearance resembles the behavior of physical gases. However, it was found to obey unrealistic additional conservation laws. For instance, the total momentum within any single line is conserved. As well, the differences between axis-parallel and non-axis-parallel directions in this model (its anisotropy) is undesirably high. The FHP lattice gas model improves the HPP model by having particles moving in six different directions, at 60 degree angles to each other, instead of only four directions. In any <b>head-on</b> <b>collision,</b> the two outgoing particles are deflected at 60 degree angles from the two incoming particles. Three-way collisions are also possible in the FHP model and are handled {{in a way that}} both preserves total momentum and avoids the unphysical added conservation laws of the HPP model.|$|E
5|$|When Robbins wins {{a prestigious}} grant to help treat {{children}} in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position {{will last for}} three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, {{and they have a}} one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a <b>head-on</b> <b>collision</b> with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s attitude toward the wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony.|$|E
