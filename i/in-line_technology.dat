40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The World Health Organisation estimates that 100 million people worldwide suffer from asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth {{leading cause of death}} worldwide. Pulmonary drug delivery is widely accepted as the firstchoice method for the treatment of respiratory diseases by glucocorticosteroids. Delivering these drugs to the lung by inhalation has many advantages in comparison to the same drug delivered orally. These include rapid onset of action, reduced dose and minimised side effects such as adrenal suppression, electrolyte imbalance, muscle weakness and growth retardation in children. Pulmonary drug delivery is also increasingly used for pain-controlling therapies and for administration of medications which are difficult to formulate orally such as proteins and peptides. The advantages of delivering drugs to the lung are undisputed, however, there are practical challenges still remaining to achieve repeatable and accurate dose delivery to the deep lung. An enabling technology for actuation-by-actuation, in-line measurement of pulmonary drug delivery is part of this greater challenge. The aerosol particles can penetrate into the deep lung only if their aerodynamic size is in the narrow range of O. 5 μm to 5 μm. The larger particles contribute to the oropharyngeal deposition diminishing the pulmonary-delivery advantages, and the smaller particles are exhaled. Particles of this size-range agglomerate easily through adhesion/cohesion interactions. Agglomerates have to disperse in the patient's inspiration flow. Therefore, the respirable dose and therapeutic efficacy depend on the drug formulation, the inhalation device, the ambient conditions and also heavily rely on the patient's inspiratory effort, which is highly variable. An ability to assess the efficacy of the pulmonary delivery in-line with a patient will ultimately improve the effectiveness and efficiency of medical therapy. This thesis presents a novel optical technology for non-invasive and in-line measurement of the respirable cloud during pulmonary drug delivery. The technology {{can be used as a}} stand-alone instrument, in conjunction with standard laboratory analytic apparatus and ultimately in-line with a patient. It is shown how the technology concept is based on the Mie theory for light scattering by particles and on the Lambert-Beer law for light extinction by a turbid medium. A prototype device is developed to implement this concept and a series of experimental investigations are conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the approach. Comparisons between the novel <b>in-line</b> <b>technology</b> and conventional in vitro measurements using physical chemistry apparatus suggest that the approach can become a useful enabling technology in pulmonary drug delivery assessment...|$|E

Basic investigations {{were carried out}} in a laboratory scale deposition apparatus (0. 04 m 3 chamber) and after that the processes were transferred to an industrial scale PECVD machine (1 m³) and optimized therein. The application of an asymmetric bipolar pulsed midfrequency substrate bias allowed controlling the ion fluxes to the growing films independently of the generation of film forming species (radicals and ions) by the microwave plasma source. After preliminary experiments using five different hydrocarbon precursors, more thorough investigations were done with the selected precursors acetylene (C 2 H 2) and isobutene (C 4 H 8; isobutylene, 2 -Methyl- 1 -propene).

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] recent years, the direct coupling of solid phase microextraction (SPME) and mass spectrometry (MS) has shown its great potential to improve limits of quantitation, accelerate analysis throughput, and diminish potential matrix effects when compared to direct injection to MS. In this study, we introduce the open port probe (OPP) as a robust interface to couple biocompatible SPME (Bio-SPME) fibers to MS systems for direct electrospray ionization. The presented design consisted of minimal alterations to the front-end of the instrument and provided better sensitivity, simplicity, speed, wider compound coverage, and high-throughput {{in comparison to the}} LC-MS based approach. Quantitative determination of clenbuterol, fentanyl, and buprenorphine was successfully achieved in human urine. Despite the use of short extraction/desorption times (5 min/ 5 s), limits of quantitation below the minimum required performance levels (MRPL) set by the world antidoping agency (WADA) were obtained with good accuracy (>= 90 %) and linearity (R- 2 > 0. 99) over the range evaluated for all analytes using sample volumes of 300 mu L. <b>In-line</b> <b>technologies</b> such as multiple reaction monitoring with multistage fragmentation (MRM 3) and differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) were used to enhance the selectivity of the method without compromising analysis speed. On the basis of calculations, once coupled to high throughput, this method can potentially yield preparation times as low as 15 s per sample based on the 96 -well plate format. Our results demonstrated that Bio-SPME-OPP-MS efficiently integrates sampling/sample cleanup and atmospheric pressure ionization, making it an advantageous configuration for several bioanalytical applications, including doping in sports, in vivo tissue sampling, and therapeutic drug monitoring.

These inspection tools collect highly precise data regarding the geometry of flaws and defects in the pipe wall. In turn this data is used for fitness-for-purpose investigations, the final goal of the operator being an understanding of the true state of integrity for a given pipeline. Different physical principles are applied during the non destructive testing of pipelines, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Choosing the most suitable non destructive testing technology and therefore in line inspection tool for a given inspection task requires an understanding of these different techniques and their system specific measurement thresholds, accuracies and resolutions.

With advances in <b>in-line</b> inspection <b>technology,</b> the pipeline industry is being called upon to evaluate an ever-increasing number of features.

In this paper the authors provide guidance on the benefits associated with full-scale testing for evaluating mechanical integrity, referred to Intentional Destructive Testing (IDT). Unlike many assessment techniques that require {{the development and implementation}} of assumed operating and boundary conditions, well-designed IDT programs are able to replicate in situ conditions to provide operators with a clear understanding regarding the behavior of pipeline features and anomalies by simulating operating conditions and loading. Three case studies are included in this paper to demonstrate the merits of the IDT approach including the assessment of dents subjected to cyclic pressures, burst testing vintage pipes having long seam weld crack-like features, and evaluating the reinforcement of girth welds using composite materials.

40|$|The American Petroleum Institute {{sponsored}} a research program starting in 1996 {{to determine the}} effects of smooth dents and rock dents on the integrity ofliquid pipelines. Fort-four different dent configurations were used in the course of testing. While the primary thrust of the work was experimental, analytical efforts were made to address dent mechanics using finite element methods. A test matrix using seventy-two test cases was developed to assess the effects of pipe D/t, dent profie and depth, level of constraint and different pressure cycles on the fatigue life of dented pipelines. Results were examined in terms of stress changes resulting from denting, pressurization, and the associated residual stress states. The shell model finite element results permitted the development of stress concentration factors for use in calculating fatigue lives for the respective dent configurations. Favorable results were obtained in comparing the calculated values to the experimentally-determined fatigue lives. The project had two primary contributions to the study of dent mechanics. First, the program ilustrates how finite element methods can be used to compare the effects of different size dents involving different pipe geometries.

This paper describes experiments with four pressure chambers made from 12 -inch line pipe. Internal scanner hardware, driven from the outside under computer control, deploys nonlinear harmonics probes against the pipe inner surface. Data collected represents residual strain patterns on the pipe surface and can be analyzed to indicate the length, width, and depth of the outside gouge.

This significance of the outside force cause of incidents has prompted funding agencies to make investment in R&D for detection and characterization of that type of defect. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that detection of outside force defects by in-line means will not prevent the 70 to 80 percent of such defects that fail immediately upon their initiation.

40|$|Improper base {{vacuum level}} in any vacuum microelectronic device, {{such as a}} Plasma Display Panel(PDP), will damage the overall {{performance}} of the device due to impurities such as H 2, O 2, CO, CO 2, and N 2. In conventional tubulation packaging technology, the obtainable base vacuum level before plasma gas filling will be very poor because of the pumping conductance limitation for such a large panel size with a small gap of 150 µm, especially due to the barrier ribs inside the PDP panel. The time required to reach any reasonable level will be too long. In this study, we performed the sealing of the two glass plates composing the PDP panel, a plasma gas filling into the panel and a hole-off (named instead of a conventional ‘tip-off’) process, all in a vacuum chamber, called as ‘vacuum in-line sealing’. Several factors related with the heating process of a frit glass were investigated. A prepared frit glass was successfully applied for the vacuum in-line sealing approach without suffering bubbles.

40|$|Magnetic {{flux leakage}} (MFL) is a {{technique}} used widely in non-destructive testing (NDT) of natural gas and petroleum transmission pipelines. This inspection method relies on magnetizing the pipe-wall in axial direction. The MFL inspection tool is equipped {{with an array of}} Hall sensors located around the circumference of the pipe, which registers the flux leakage caused by any defects present in the pipe-wall. Currently, the tool magnetizes the pipewall in axial direction making it largely insensitive to axially oriented defects. One type of defect, which is of a growing concern in the gas and petroleum industry is the stress corrosion crack (SCC). The SCCs are a result of aging, corrosion, fatigue and thermal stresses. SCCs are predominantly axially oriented and are extremely tight, which makes them impossible to be detected using current inspection technology. A possible solution to this problem is to utilize the remote field eddy current (RFEC) effect to detect axially oriented defects. The RFEC method has been widely used in industry in the inspection of tubular products. The method uses a pair of excitation and pick-up coils. The pick-up coil located in the remote field region, usually two, three pipe-diameters away from the excitation coil. With RFEC the presence of defects is detected by the disturbance in the phase of the signal measured by the pick-up coil relative to that of the excitation coil. Unlike conventional eddy current testing the RFEC method is sensitive to defects on the exterior of the inspected product, which makes it a good candidate for the development of <b>in-line</b> inspection <b>technology.</b> This work focuses on the development of non-destructive testing technique, which uses remote field eddy currents induced by rotating magnetic field (RMF). A major advantage of the RMF is that it makes possible to not only detect a defect but also localize its position in circumferential direction. Also, it could potentially allow detection of defects, regardless of their shape and orientation. In this work the RFEC-RMF technique is investigated and is shown to be a useful tool in the detection of axially oriented, circumferentially oriented and skewed notches, SCCs and round defects. Finally, a data acquisition system is designed, capable of performing the RFEC-RMF measurements automatically...|$|R

It is a high level objective for many international governments and operators that highways should be managed {{in a way that is}} both sustainable i. e. environmental, social and economically sound and supportive of a Low-Carbon-Energy Future. Some clarity is therefore needed to understand how Intelligent Transport Systems perform within the constraints of that objective. This thesis describes the development of performance criteria that reflect the contributions of Information Communication Technology (ICT) emissions, vehicle emissions and the embedded carbon within the physical transport infrastructure that typically comprises three types of Intelligent Transport System. Active Traffic Management, Intelligent Speed Adaptation and the Automated Highway System are a collection of systems designed to transform the road network into a highly efficient and congestion free transport solution and all possess varying levels of uncertainty in terms of sustainability performance. The performance criteria form part of a new framework methodology ‘EnvFUSION’ (Environmental Fusion for ITS) outlined here. An attributional LCA and c-LCA (consequential lifecycle assessment) are both undertaken which forms part of a data fusion process using data from various sources. The models forecast improvements for the three ITS <b>technologies</b> <b>in-line</b> with social acceptability, economic profitability and major carbon reduction scenarios up to 2050 on one of the UK's most congested highways. Analytical Hierarchy Process and Dempster-Shafer theory are used to weight criteria which form part of an Intelligent Transport Sustainability Index. Overall performance is then synthesized. Results indicate that there will be a substantial increase in socio-economic and emissions benefits, provided that the policies are in place and targets are reached which would otherwise delay their realisation. To conclude, an integrated strategic performance management framework is proposed which performs socio-technical comparisons of four key performance areas between ITS schemes in order to identify energy and emission hotspots...|$|R

Historically, mechanical damage is the single largest cause of failures on pipelines (transporting both natural gas and hazardous liquids).

Likewise, much as been invested in research regarding detection of mechanical damage using <b>in-line</b> inspection (ILI) <b>technologies,</b> evaluating the severity of mechanical damage, and mitigation measures. However, no single endeavor has adequately addressed each of these considerations or their interrelationships in sufficient detail with adequate industry support for the outcome to receive broad acceptance by all stakeholders as the benchmark for advancing the technology to address mechanical damage issues. In an effort to collaboratively approach the problem, PHMSA and the National Association of Pipeline Safety Representatives (NAPSR) held a major public workshop on February 28 -March 1, 2006, in Houston to discuss issues associated with the role of technology in preventing, detecting, characterizing, and mitigating mechanical damage risks to energy pipelines. The workshop was organized in collaboration with several stakeholder organizations. It drove the scope for a major synthesis study on mechanical damage being conducted by Michael Baker Jr. Inc. (Baker). The study will evaluate the state of technology as well as gaps in the accepted technology necessary to understand, identify, assess, manage, and mitigate mechanical damage of pipelines.
