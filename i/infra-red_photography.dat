40|$|Abstract—Our {{investigation}} entailed {{a thermal}} analysis of hornets engaging in ventilation {{activity at the}} nest entrance. In the hot summer months, between July–October, ventilating worker hornets are seen just outside the nest entrance, where they assume a typical stance, namely, with their feet erect and fastened to the substrate, their abdomen bent downward at a 90 ◦ angle to the thorax, their antennae vibrating, and their wings beating rapidly for minutes at a time. Eventually these hornets leave their position, either to retreat into the nest or else to fly off to the field, and are replaced by new hornets that assume the ventilation task. <b>Infra-red</b> (IR) <b>photography</b> reveals that {{in the course of}} the ventilation activity, the warmest region in the ventilating hornet body is the anterior upper part of the thorax, and the coolest regions are the wings, limbs, antennae and abdomen. This study involved precise and repeated measurements via IR photography of the temperature in the various body parts of the ventilating hornets, and it also offers a preliminary, tentative explanation for the observed differential body temperature.

40|$|State Highway 289 (a. k. a. {{circumferential}} highway) in Essex, Vermont, {{was constructed}} in 1993 {{as a means of}} shifting growing traffic volumes in the area around Burlington, Vermont, to reduce traffic congestion in some areas. This highway bisects streams, wetlands, upland and deer winter habitats important for the survival of area wildlife such as white-tailed deer, beaver, mink and otter. A divided concrete underpass was installed under the highway to accommodate an existing stream channel on one side and wildlife passage on the other. The underpass was located along the stream to connect wetland habitat that exists both up and down stream from the structure thereby facilitating the movement of wildlife and related ecological processes across the road. This project evaluates the use of this structure by wildlife. We used trailmaster <b>infra-red</b> monitoring and <b>photography</b> equipment and track beds to document the use of the underpass by wildlife. This technology allowed us to determine what species were using the underpass, the time of year they used the structure, the time of day, the direction of movement, and how frequently the structure was used. Based on the results of this project, it appears that the diversity of wildlife using this structure is limited, but raccoons and mink use the underpass frequently. Further, underpass design, substrate, vegetation near entrances, and other parameters may be limiting the ability of wildlife to use the structure for moving across the roadway...|$|R

40|$|The {{alteration}} of hydrological regimes through {{the construction of}} dams and minor diversion weirs has significant detrimental ecological effects on the downstream river reaches. In the case whereby approximately 99 % of the Mean Annual Flow (MANF) has been diverted, the flow regulation has often resulted in a constriction in the river channel and a reduction in complexity of the aquatic and riparian vegetation and encroachment of terrestrial plant species. The Snowy River Increased Flows (SRIF) environmental flow program aims to return 21 % of the MANF to the Snowy River below Jindabyne. This revised flow regime attempts to re-introduce the hydrological cues such as seasonal flow patterns, annual floods and greater daily flow variability. In the case of the Snowy River, a higher magnitude annual flood was introduced to flush sediment and vegetation within the river channel and the more variable daily flow rate aims create a more natural and complex riparian and aquatic vegetated habitat. This study examined the changes in aquatic and riparian vegetation at two sites in the Dalgety Uplands macro-reach of the Snowy River using four band colour <b>infra-red</b> high-resolution aerial <b>photography</b> in 2007, 2010 and 2013. A supervised maximum likelihood classification to determine vegetation classes and post-classification change detection was used to quantify the vegetation changes. The results indicated than an increase in flow magnitude was able to create a more open water and aquatic habitats. Furthermore an increase in the frequency of inundation across the lower benches increased the abundance of flood tolerant amphibious species and removed water susceptible species. These changes are reflective {{of the importance of the}} moisture gradient in riparian zones and the zonation of riparian plant species is largely determined by the flow regime...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The planned {{large-scale}} abstraction {{of groundwater}} from the Karst area in northern Namibia prompted concern {{with respect to}} possible negative effects on the plant ecology of that area. Although it was thought improbable that the lowering of the groundwater table {{would result in the}} deterioration of the vegetation, it was considered necessary to examine the existing vegetation status in order to establish a pre-abstraction baseline datum. It was thus important to establish a broad overview of the current vegetation, any changes in its condition within a two years period, and also the prevailing environmental factors in the Karst area. This was achieved through both manual and photographic monitoring of selected representative transects within the proposed abstraction area during 1986 and 1987. The manual monitoring exercise included the usual measures of density cover and frequency of all species, whereby a full inventory of the transects was established. The environmental conditions were assessed through the collection and evaluation of data on rainfall, groundwater levels and soil conditions, both within the transects and for the area as a whole. Below average rainfall during and prior to the baseline study years, resulting in poor recharge to the groundwater table, was recorded for most of the karst area. Both the vegetation and environmental data were utilized in two ways. Firstly, the 1986 and 1987 vegetation data were analysed, and those aspects indirectly related to the vegetation's vitality status, were then evaluated. A comparison of the parameters such as the quantity of dead material, and the number of standing dead trees, reflected a general decline in vitality over the two year period. In view of the poor rainfall conditions, this decline was interpreted as that which can be expected under natural adverse climatic conditions. Secondly, in order to establish and critically examine the possible relationships between the vegetation data and components of the environmental data, a Canonical Correspondence Analysis was performed. Despite a large amount of "noise" caused by the broad nature of the environmental data, it was possible to identify a number of species which occur within precisely defined environmental conditions. A change in abundance or distribution of these species can in the future first be investigated in terms of their defined vegetation-habitat relationships, and thereafter in terms of any other introduced factors which may be suspected of having an influence. <b>Infra-red</b> aerial <b>photography</b> was another monitoring technique used to obtain a pre-abstraction record of the vitality status of the vegetation. Two surveys were carried out during the baseline period and counts made of stressed and dead trees. A comparison of the counts reflected an increase in stress within the vegetation over this period, thus supporting the findings of the manual surveys. Selected sections of vegetation at various points of interest within the transects, were monitored using fixed point photography on a bi-annual basis. Although these photographic records ret 1 ected small changes, these were not considered significant. The main purpose of this method is to provide a pre-abstraction record of vegetation at potentially "sensitive" points with which future surveys. could be compared. The usefulness and cost-effectiveness of the three central monitoring methods were evaluated, and an indication provided of how monitoring may continue in the long term as large-scale abstraction goes ahead...|$|R

50|$|A {{painting}} {{now called}} the Ashbourne portrait {{was identified as a}} portrayal of Shakespeare in 1847, and it currently hangs in the Folger Shakespeare Library.

The restoration revealed that the portrait had been retouched to have the hairline recede, while the inscribed age had been altered by one year and Hamersley's coat of arms had been painted over. Nevertheless, some Oxfordians continue to support the de Vere identification, claiming that the fashions worn by the sitter date the painting to about 1580 when Hamersley would have been only 15.|$|E
5000|$|The work is {{the best}} known and famous of {{one of a number}} of {{paintings}} after the death of Mary attributed to van der Goes or followers. Some art historians, including Friedrich Winkler (1964), believe he painted at least three versions, although it is generally accepted that preparatory sketches made for the Bruges work were later copied reproduced as paintings by late 15th century followers. Two similar paintings in the Berlin State Museums, the National Gallery, London, are attributed as [...] "after van der Goes". They are usually thought to be later versions of a pen on paper drawing in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, Brunswick, probably a copy of an original preparatory sketch by van der Goes. These works are similar to the Bruges paintings, but show the image in reverse. <b>Infra-red</b> <b>photography</b> shows that the composition was planned a highly detailed manner before the underdrawing was applied.

The emphasis is now on the redevelopment of existing cities rather than on building new ones. This has created an urgent need to carry out detailed surveys and inventories of many aspects of urban land use in metropolitan areas: this study concentrates on just one aspect - urban open space. In the first stage a comparison was made between 1 : 10, 000 scale black and white and 1 : 10, 000 scale colour infra-red aerial photographs, to compare the type and amount of open space information which could be obtained from these two sources. The advantages of using colour <b>infra-red</b> <b>photography</b> were clearly demonstrated in this comparison. The second stage was the use of colour <b>infra-red</b> <b>photography</b> as the sole source of data to survey and map the urban open space of a sample area in Merseyside Metropolitan County. This sample area comprised eleven 1 / 4 km 2 squares, on each of which a 20 m x 20 m grid cell was placed to record, directly from the photography, 625 sets of data. Each set of data recorded the type and amount of open space, its surface cover, maintenance status and management. The data recorded were fed into a computer and a suite of programs was developed to provide output in both computer map and statistical form, for each of the eleven - 1 / 4 km 2 -sample areas. The third stage involved a comparison of open space data with socio-economic status. Merseyside County Planning Authority had previously conducted a socio-economic survey of the county, and this information was used to identify ' the socio-economic status of the population in the eleven ilkm 2 areas of this project. This comparison revealed many interesting and useful relationships between the provision of urban open space and socio-economic status...|$|E

Multi-spectral techniques, which are superior to conventional <b>infra-red</b> <b>photography,</b> appear as an exciting new development, enabling one to distinguish at a glance between diseased and healthy trees.

In California it is estimated that over 2, 200 hectares of avocadoes have been destroyed by this pathogen. This amounts to approximately 23 % of the total planting (Borst, 1970). In South Africa the infection in individual orchards may vary from 5 % to as high as 80 %. The overall root rot infection in South African avocado orchards is thought to be approximately 20 %.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{results of}} {{an evaluation of the}} spectral signatures of vegetation communities recognised on multispectral photography, at scales of 1 : 15, 000 and 1 : 5, 000, in North West Queensland, Australia, with reference to specific environmental parameters, notably bedrock mineralization, and microdensitometer optical density measurements. Detailed ground-truth information obtained for the evaluation included plant species frequency recording and plant and soil sampling along a series of transects located across known mineralized zones and across spectral anomalies detected on the photography. Overlays of the spectral signature units, including those subjected to enhancement techniques, were prepared and correlated with the ground-truth data and a number of microdensitometer scan lines measuring the optical density within each of the eight spectral bands of the multispectral photography. The spectral signatures of vegetation, and especially the distinct spectral signature of geobotanically anomalous plant communities forming surface expression of mineralized bedrock and related geochemical soil anomalies, are best displayed on false colour <b>infra-red</b> <b>photography</b> which covers the visible and near infra-red part of the spectrum in which plant reflectivity is most sensitive, consequently yielding most information. Ground-truth investigations, confirming the interpretation of infra-red spectral signatures, reveal the composition of anomalous and background vegetation units and indicatethe influence of the mineral status of the soil, relief, drainage and lithology on plant species distribution. Over mineralized terrain, higher reflectivity in all spectral bands and especially the true colour green, panchromatic green and false colour infra-red are recorded by microdensitometer optical density measurements which positively correlate with the above average concentrations of metal in the indicator plants and surface soils. In the semi-arid environment of North West Queensland, the use of multispectral photography, in conjunction with detailed field studies, is shown to have application in the study of vegetation associations and plant conmunities forming surface expression of characteristic ground conditions. The recognition of geobotanical anomalies and differences in soil and plant reflectivity indicative of bedrock mineralization offers considerable promise in mineral exploration for the detection of ore bodies. <p...|$|E
