40|$|The use of {{lightweight}} roofs {{for long}} span structures has become popular. Architects find these structures attractive because they {{allow for a}} wide scope of innovative design, and can be cost effective and aesthetically pleasing. Although extensive research has already been devoted to many aspects of lightweight structures, this thesis examines the effects of wall openings on self-supported roofs backed by cavities, {{the nature of the}} response of air-supported roofs to turbulent wind, and theoretical methods for response prediction.;The first part of the study comprises a free vibration analysis of self-supported, lightweight roofs backed by cavities with openings. A simplified theoretical approach is formulated to evaluate the modal parameters of the roof-air system considering air leakage through the openings, the pneumatic stiffness, and the structural and acoustical damping of the system. The accuracy of the approximate formulae is assessed by comparison with a complex eigenvalue analysis. An exact solution is derived to evaluate the modal parameters for a circular membrane roof backed by a cavity with openings. Closed form solutions are presented for the damped response of circular membrane roofs backed by cavities with openings.;Free vibration laboratory experiments were conducted on two different structural models to verify the theoretical approach. The first model had a membrane roof, and the second had a flexible plate roof. The effects of wall openings and volume scaling on the roof-air system were examined and the experimental results were then compared with the theoretical ones.;The second part of the study is an examination of the behaviour of air-supported structures. The free vibration of cylindrical and spherical air-supported structures is investigated analytically for different internal pressures and <b>enclosure</b> <b>volumes</b> and the results are compared with those obtained from a finite element solution.;Wind tunnel tests were conducted on an aeroelastic model of a hemispherical, air-supported structure to investigate the wind-induced response and the internal pressure fluctuations. Parameters considered in the aeroelastic experiments included different gradients wind speeds, exposures, <b>enclosure</b> <b>volumes</b> and internal pressures.;A semi-analytical approach is established for predicting the wind-induced response of air-supported structures. This approach depends on external pressure measurements and static deflections. A rigid hemispherical model was tested in a boundary layer wind tunnel to measure the external pressures for different exposure conditions. For different internal pressures, the static deflections were calculated theoretically using the finite element method.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} small, time-dependent, perturbations to geometric wave-equation domains is hardly existent. Acoustic enclosures are typical examples featuring locally reacting surfaces that {{respond to a}} pressure gradient or a pressure difference, alter the <b>enclosure's</b> <b>volume</b> and, hence, the boundary conditions, and do so locally through their vibrations. Accordingly, the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the acoustic wave equation lives in a temporally varying domain depending on the displacement of the locally reacting surface from equilibrium. The resulting partial differential equations feature nonlinearities and are coupled though the time-dependent boundary conditions. The solution to the afore-mentioned problem, as presented here, integrates techniques from differential geometry, functional analysis, and physics. The appropriate space is {{shown to be a}} (perturbation) fiber bundle. In the context of a systematic perturbation theory, the solution to the dynamical problem is obtained from a combination of semigroup techniques for operator evolution equations and metric perturbation theory as used in AdS/CFT. Duhamel's principle then yields a time-dependent perturbation theory, called geometric perturbation theory. It is analogous to, though different from, both Dirac's time-dependent perturbation theory and the Magnus expansion. Specifically, the formalism demonstrates that the stationary-domain approximation for vibrational acoustics only introduces a small error. Analytic simplifications methods are derived in the framework of the piston approximation. Globally reacting surfaces (so-called pistons) replace the formerly locally reacting surfaces and reduce the number of independent variables in the underlying partial differential equations. In this way, a straightforwardly applicable formalism is derived for scalar wave equations on time-varying domains. Comment: 121 pages and 16 figure...|$|R

The frequency response is manipulated electronically in a strong nonlinear fashion, which has consequences for the sound quality, but it then turns out that systems using much lower force factors can provide greater usable efficiency, at least over a limited frequency range. For these low-force-factor loudspeakers, a practically relevant and analytically tractable optimality criterion, involving the loudspeaker parameters, will be defined. This can be especially valuable in designing very compact loudspeaker systems. An experimental {{example of such a}} design is described.

CELSS is a plant-based bioregenerative life support system for long term manned space flights where resupply is costly or impractical. The plants in a CELSS will function to convert the carbon dioxide (exhaled by the crew) into oxygen, purify non-potable water into potable quality water, and provide food for the crew. Prior to implementing a CELSS life support system, one must have knowledge on growing plants in a closed chamber under low gravity. This information will come from research to be conducted on the CELSS Test Facility that will operate on the Space Station Freedom. Currently a ground-based CELSS Test Facility is being built at NASA Ames Research Center. It is called the EDU (Engineering Development Unit). This system will allow researchers to identify issues that may cause difficulties {{in the development of the}} CELSS Test Facility and aid in the development of new needed technologies. The EDU consists of a 1 m 2 crop growth chamber that is surrounded by a containment enclosure. The containment enclosure isolates the system so there is very little mass and thermal exchange with the ambient.

Room pressure development during clean agent discharges is dependent upon several system-and enclosure-related factors. A major factor influencing the development of room pressure {{is the nature of the}} clean agent. The discharge of inert gas agents is characterized by a rapid buildup of pressure to a maximum, followed by a relatively slow decay in pressure with time. The discharge of halocarbon-based agents on the other hand, is characterized by an initial, relatively rapid negative pressure pulse, due to initial cooling of the enclosure and its contents, followed by a relatively rapid positive pressure pulse. Additional factors influencing the development of room pressure during a clean agent discharge include the enclosure construction, the enclosure integrity (leakage area, hold time), the fire size per <b>enclosure</b> <b>volume</b> ratio, and the agent flow rate.

The accuracy is discussed first in terms of mass balance at the steady-state stage for the <b>enclosure</b> <b>volume.</b> The required fineness of the grid is determined by analyzing the mass balance using two non-dimensional length scales. The first considers the ratio of the ventilation factor to the grid cell size, and the second considers the ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the opening to the grid cell size. When these two length scales are larger than 10, the corresponding mass balance error as obtained from post-processing the output is lower than 4 %. The simulation results, including flow through the vertical opening, heat release rate inside the enclosure, gas temperature inside the enclosure, neutral plane height, and external flame height are compared with experimental data and empirical correlations. The air inflow rate through the opening is found to correlate linearly to the ventilation factor as m˙= 0. 41 *A*H^(1 / 2). For the heat release rate inside the enclosure, the predictions follow the empirical correlation Qin= 1131 *A*H^(1 / 2).

By comparison, NASNJPL's recently flown Mars Pathfinder rover Sojourner is an 1 I+ kilogram flight experiment (carrying a 1 kg APXS instrument) having-, 45 x. 6 meterA 2 (WxL) footprint and 15 cm ground clearance, and about half the warm electronics <b>enclosure</b> (WEE) <b>volume</b> with twice the diurnal temperature swing (- 40 to + 40 °C) of LSR-I in nominal Mars environments. We are also developing a new, smaller 5 kilogram class LSR-type vehicle for Mars sample return- the travel to, localization of, pick-up, and transport back to an Earth return ascent vehicle of a sample cache collected by earlier science missions.
