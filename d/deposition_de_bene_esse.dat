5000|$|<b>De</b> <b>bene</b> <b>esse</b> {{has been}} used in English law for {{hundreds}} of years. For example, in Equity Cases Abridged (1744), it was used to describe the deposition of a witness before trial in the Court of Chancery: After a Bill filed in any Cause, the Court will, on Affidavit, that any of the Witnesses are aged or infirm, sick, or going beyond Sea, so that the Party is in Danger of losing their Testimony, order them to be examined <b>de</b> <b>bene</b> <b>esse,</b> which will make their Depositions valid in that Cause only, and against those who are Parties to it; but if it appear, that they might afterwards have been examined in Chief, regularly, such Depositions shall not be made use of.|$|R
5000|$|In R v Mirza (2004), Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough {{used the}} term to refer to {{evidence}} which a court receives provisionally {{for the purpose of}} assessing its admissibility: A jury note or letter will, save in exceptional circumstances, always be looked at by the trial judge and, if there is an appeal, by the Court of Appeal (the legal expression is <b>de</b> <b>bene</b> <b>esse</b> - ie for what it is worth); its existence and character will normally be disclosed to the parties counsel and submissions as to its significance, and/or responded to, be invited.|$|R
50|$|In past times, an {{appearance}} <b>de</b> <b>bene</b> <b>esse</b> {{was a special}} appearance made solely to contest jurisdiction. The procedure has long been abolished in {{most if not all}} jurisdictions in favor of allowing jurisdictional objections to be made either by motion or set out as an affirmative defense in a responsive pleading (an answer to the complaint): in the Federal courts, the procedure was superannuated by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and, in Pennsylvania, by a 1965 amendment to the state rules of civil procedure. The procedure has been referred to by sovereign citizens.|$|R

Both Amaury <b>de</b> <b>Bene</b> and Gioacchino <b>de</b> Fiori, whose ideas could be said to be at the fountainhead of the movement, underwent examination and persecution {{at the hands of the}} Church.

In 1209 ten of his followers were burnt at the stake in Paris, and Amaury's body was exhumed, also burnt and the ashes scattered. By 1215 his work and followers were formally condemned by the Fourth Lateran Council and denounced as officially heretical.|$|R

The Church, once confining itself to only {{the powers of}} canon law, increasingly appealed to secular powers. Heretics such as the Vaudois, Albigenses, Beghards, Apostolic Brothers, and Luciferians were thus [...] "treated with cruelty" [...] which culminated in the 13th century establishment of the Inquisition by Pope Innocent III. Jews were not ignored by such legislation, either, as they allegedly instigated Christians to judaizations, either directly or unconsciously, by their existence. They sent forth metaphysicians such as Amaury <b>de</b> <b>Béne</b> and David <b>de</b> Dinan; the Pasagians followed Mosaic Law; the Orleans heresy was a Jewish heresy; the Albigens taught Jewish doctrine as superior to Christian; the Dominicans preached against both the Hussites and their Jewish supporters, and thus the imperial army sent to advance on Jan Ziska massacred Jews along the way. In Spain, where Castilian custom (fueros) had granted equal rights to Muslims, Christians, and Jews, Gregory XI instituted the Spanish Inquisition to spy on Jews and Moors wherever [...] "by words or writings they urged the Catholics to embrace their faith".|$|R
