In two-sided {{matching}} {{markets in}} which some doctors form couples, we present an algorithm that <b>finds</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stable matchings whenever one exists, and otherwise shows {{that there is no}} stable matching. Extending the methodology of Echenique and Yenmez (2006), we characterize the set of stable matchings as the fixed points of a monotone decreasing function with respect to a certain partial order. Based on that result, an algorithm is presented that <b>finds</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stable matchings, if any, in a market with couples...|$|R

500|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the events of the first film, Elsa tries to make Anna's 19th {{birthday}} as perfect as possible a way of making up for the years they spent apart. To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, Sven and Olaf to make this a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace courtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna. However, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure hunt to <b>find</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> gifts that have been made for her. Without realizing it, each sneeze she makes creates small snowmen called [...] "snowgies", which create trouble for Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting worse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking medicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold cause her to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner, and she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her. Upon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous incident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined everything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as well as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated, she ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn, which inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball {{all the way to the}} Southern Isles and hits the now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall into a pile of horse manure. Afterwards, Anna tells a now bed-ridden Elsa that she has given her the best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.|$|E

Adolfo Antonio Cardenal Suárez Rivera", ("Library of the Minor Seminary of Monterrey Donated by Sr. Eminentísimo Adolfo Cardinal Suárez Rivera"), for many years Cardinal Archbishop of the Diocese of Monterrey. This Spanish edition of Michelini's writings where supposedly Christ himself defends Valtorta's Work, comes with a copy of two letters between Bishops. The first letter is from the Bishop of León, México Anselmo Zarza Bernal and is addressed to Bishop Miguel García Franco at the time Bishop of Mazatlán. The response to Bishop Zarza is the second letter. In the first letter, Bishop Zarza recommends to Bishop García Franco the reading and reflection of Michelini's book, in response Bishop García wrote: [...] "I received your letter...that came with the book" [...] (Michelini's Book) [...] "...I <b>find</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> doctrine contained in the book 100% orthodox, more yet, in whole coincident with the writings of Mrs. Conchita Cabrera de Armida...".|$|E
