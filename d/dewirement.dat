25|$|On {{some older}} systems, the poles were raised and lowered using a long pole {{with a metal}} hook. Where available, these may have been made of bamboo due to its length, natural {{straightness}} and strength, combined with its relative light weight {{and the fact that}} it is an insulator. Trolleybuses usually carried one with the vehicle, for use in the event of <b>dewirement,</b> but tram systems usually had them placed along the route at locations where the trolley pole would need reversing.|$|E
40|$|In {{the design}} of new types of {{electric}} train, one of the design criteria used in the UK is a limit on the displacement in high wind conditions between the pantograph head (which collects the electrical current) and the overhead conductor wire to prevent the process known as <b>dewirement.</b> To meet this criterion it is often necessary for the train suspension to b...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of passenger trains and the <b>dewirement</b> of pantographs from overhead power cables {{are just two}} instances where the effect of cross winds can be of paramount importance. In order to examine either of these two problems in detail, a knowledge concerning the behav-iour of the approaching wind and the induced response of the train is required. However, th...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dewirements</b> â€” Trolley poles {{sometimes}} {{come off}} of the wire. <b>Dewirements</b> are relatively rare in modern systems with well-maintained overhead wires, hangers, fittings and contact shoes. Trolleybuses are equipped with special insulated pole ropes which drivers use to reconnect the trolley poles with the overhead wires. When approaching switches, trolleybuses usually must decelerate {{in order to avoid}} dewiring, and this deceleration can potentially add slightly to traffic congestion.|$|R
