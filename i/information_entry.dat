The game has a pooling Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium in which the incumbent firm chooses the optimal price corresponding to low demand. With this strategy entry is deterred.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare {{the costs of}} two {{regulatory}} policies about the entry of new firms. We consider an incumbent firm that has {{more information about the}} market demand than the regulator. Then, the incumbent firm can use this advantage to persuade the regulator to make entry more difficult. With the first regulatory policy the regulator uses the incumbent price pre-regulation to get information about the demand. With the second regulatory policy the regulator design a mechanism to motivate the incumbent firm to price truthfully. We conclude that, for enough high values of the probability of low demand, the welfare is higher with the second (more active) regulatory policy. asymmetric <b>information,</b> <b>entry</b> regulation, signalling, adverse selection...|$|E
