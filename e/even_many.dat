5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and <b>even</b> <b>many</b> of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|These {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbons also {{activate the}} AH receptor, {{but less than}} TCDD and only temporarily. <b>Even</b> <b>many</b> natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor. This phenomenon {{can be viewed as}} adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during {{the crash of}} the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he compared it to the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, <b>even</b> <b>many</b> modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after the crash of 1987), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality. Tulip mania again became a popular reference during the dot-com bubble of 1995–2001.|$|E
5|$|Polo {{was finally}} {{released}} from captivity in August 1299, {{and returned home}} to Venice, where his father and uncle in the meantime had purchased a large palazzo in the zone named contrada San Giovanni Crisostomo (Corte del Milion). For such a venture, the Polo family probably invested profits from trading, and <b>even</b> <b>many</b> gemstones they brought from the East. The company continued its activities and Marco soon became a wealthy merchant. Marco and his uncle Maffeo financed other expeditions, but likely never left Venetian provinces, nor returned to the Silk Road and Asia. Sometime before 1300, his father Niccolò died. In 1300, he married Donata Badoèr, the daughter of Vitale Badoèr, a merchant. They had three daughters, Fantina (married Marco Bragadin), Bellela (married Bertuccio Querini), and Moreta.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, {{and it can be}} difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. <b>Even</b> <b>many</b> of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E

50|$|Small {{businesses}} and bodegas in New York City owned by Yemeni immigrants closed {{from noon to}} 8pm on February 2 in protest against the executive order.

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} increasing resistance by the Catholic Church and its defiance of the laws, new regulations increasingly went beyond state matters referring to purely internal affairs of the church. <b>Even</b> <b>many</b> liberals saw them as encroachment on civil liberties, compromising their own credo.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the game}} was known and popular in the seventeenth century, it is logical to suppose it may have existed {{at least a few}} decades (or perhaps <b>even</b> <b>many</b> centuries) before its {{earliest}} literary reference; but no conclusive evidence has yet been presented to support this theory.|$|E
25|$|Motorcycles must be {{leaned in}} order to make turns. This lean is induced by the method known as countersteering, in which the rider {{momentarily}} steers the handlebars in the direction opposite of the desired turn.

25|$|The term {{epidemiology}} is {{now widely}} applied {{to cover the}} description and causation of not only epidemic disease, but of disease in general, and <b>even</b> <b>many</b> non-disease, health-related conditions, such as {{high blood pressure and}} obesity.

25|$|The Ethiopian government's {{unwillingness to}} deal with the 1984–85 famine {{provoked}} universal condemnation by the international community. <b>Even</b> <b>many</b> supporters of the Ethiopian regime opposed its policy of withholding food shipments to rebel areas. The combined effects of famine and internal war had by then put the nation's economy into a state of collapse.|$|E

25|$|The {{books have}} been criticized for their {{derivative}} nature. The two most commonly discussed sources are Star Wars (because of numerous similarities in the plots) and The Lord of the Rings (because of the setting, elf and dwarven races, the language and character and place names). <b>Even</b> <b>many</b> positive reviews note that the work pulls strongly from the conventions of fantasy, in characters, maps, dialogue and concepts.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{many people}} start the {{fireworks}} already on New Year's Eve or <b>even</b> <b>many</b> days before.
