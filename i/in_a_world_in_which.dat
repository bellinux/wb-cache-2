The play was set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Doctor Who had never been created, existing only in the imagination and memories of fictional writer Martin Bannister, played by Derek Jacobi. As part of {{the plot of the}} play, Bannister was unable to clearly remember whether Newman had been Canadian or Australian, with the Newman character's accent changing according to Bannister's varying memories.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key {{to the success of the}} American dream.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the djinn that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon Azazel. He and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) were not raised to be hunters of supernatural creatures, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In the new reality, Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (Michelle Borth), and Sam is at law school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet. He realizes that {{all the people that}} he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, that he and Sam have a distant and somewhat adversarial relationship. After visiting the grave of his father John, who died the previous year of a stroke, Dean decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them.|$|E

25|$|A year later, in 1944, William T. R. Fox, an American {{foreign policy}} professor, {{elaborated}} {{on the concept}} in the book The Superpowers: The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union — Their Responsibility for Peace, which spoke of the global reach of a super-empowered nation. Fox used the word Superpower to identify a new category of power able to occupy the highest status <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which,</b> as the war then raging demonstrated, states could challenge and fight each other on a global scale. According to him, there were (at that moment) three states that were superpowers: the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The British Empire was the most extensive empire in world history and considered the foremost great power, holding sway over 25% of the world's population and controlling about 25% of the Earth's total land area, while the United States and the Soviet Union grew in power before and during World War II.|$|E

He followed this in 1953 with another taboo-breaking story from Farmer, [...] "Mother", in Thrilling Wonder, in which a spaceman makes his home in an alien womb. In the December 1952 Thrilling Wonder, Mines published Edmond Hamilton's [...] "What's It Like Out There?", a downbeat story about the realities of space exploration that had been considered too bleak for publication when it had originally been written in the 1930s.

500|$|In {{his speeches}} and public writings, Oppenheimer {{continually}} stressed {{the difficulty of}} managing the power of knowledge <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the freedom of science to exchange ideas was more and more hobbled by political concerns. Oppenheimer delivered the Reith Lectures on the BBC in 1953, which were subsequently published as Science and the Common Understanding. In 1955 Oppenheimer published The Open Mind, a collection of eight lectures that he had given since 1946 {{on the subject of}} nuclear weapons and popular culture. Oppenheimer rejected the idea of nuclear gunboat diplomacy. [...] "The purposes of this country in the field of foreign policy", he wrote, [...] "cannot in any real or enduring way be achieved by coercion". In 1957 the philosophy and psychology departments at Harvard invited Oppenheimer to deliver the William James Lectures. An influential group of Harvard alumni led by Edwin Ginn that included Archibald Roosevelt protested against the decision. Some 1,200 people packed into Sanders Theatre to hear Oppenheimer's six lectures, entitled [...] "The Hope of Order". Oppenheimer delivered the Whidden Lectures at McMaster University in 1962, and these were published in 1964 as The Flying Trapeze: Three Crises for Physicists.|$|E
500|$|... "The Only One" [...] was {{originally}} called [...] "Tuna Afternoon" [...] and lyrically delves on Lee's experiences with close-mindedness and {{people around her}} who seemed lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they did not belong. It starts with a piano introduction {{similar to that of}} the band's Fallen era and songs by Sarah McLachlan. In the song, Lee [...] "decries human guidance" [...] with the chorus lines, [...] "All our lives / We've been waiting / For someone to call our leader / All your lies / I'm not believing / Heaven shine a light down on me". [...] "Your Star" [...] was motivated by Lee's loneliness during the band's tour in support of Fallen. She was inspired to write the chorus in Lisbon when she looked at the night sky and could see no stars. Other inspiration came from the works of [...] Pantera. Guitars and piano provide the track's instrumentation; while Lee sings about God according to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone. [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] was co-written by guitarist John LeCompt; it describes Lee's night-time writing process, which is showcased in the opening line, [...] "I can feel the night beginning / Separate me from the living". It contains [...] "power chords", elements of electronica, and abrasive guitars. [...] "Good Enough" [...] was solely written by Lee, and was placed at the end of the album for symbolizing its themes and those of the singer's life. While featuring a string section, it resembles Tori Amos' and Sarah McLachlan's songs. Inspired by her then-future husband Josh Hartzler, [...] "Good Enough" [...] has a similar composition to [...] "My Immortal" [...] because of their piano sounds.|$|E

2500|$|A {{proposed}} maxim {{can fail}} to meet the above requirement {{in one of two}} ways. First, one might encounter a scenario in which one’s proposed maxim would become impossible <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it is universalized. For example, suppose a person in need of money makes it her maxim to attain a loan by making a false promise to pay it back. If everyone followed this principle, nobody would trust another person when she made a promise, and the institution of promise-making would be destroyed. But, the maxim of making a false promise in order to attain a loan relies on the very institution of promise-making that universalizing this maxim destroys. Kant calls this type of contradiction a ‘contradiction in conception’ because it is impossible to conceive of the maxim being universalized. (4:424) ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a paradox}} that haunts these charges of anti-Semitism. On the one hand, Rosenfeld, Harris, and others want {{to deny that}} American Jews and American Jewish {{organizations}} like AIPAC [...] suffer from dual loyalty in trying to influence U.S. foreign policy. It's anti-Semitic or contributes to anti-Semitism, they say, to make that charge. On the other hand, they want to demand of American Jewish intellectuals a certain loyalty to Israel, Israeli policies, and to Zionism {{as part of their}} being Jewish. They make dual loyalty an inescapable part of being Jewish <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a Jewish state exists. And that's probably the case. Many Jews now suffer from dual loyalty – the same way that Cuban-Americans or Mexican-Americans do. By ignoring this dilemma – and, worse still, by charging those who acknowledge its existence with anti-Semitism – the critics of the new anti-Semitism are engaged in a flight from their own political selves.|$|E
