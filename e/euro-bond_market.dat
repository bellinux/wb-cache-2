40|$|An issue confronting U. S. policymakers {{is whether}} {{restrictions}} on securities activities of U. S. commercial banks {{ought to be}} abolished within a broader program of banking and financial market deregulation. The <b>Euro-bond</b> <b>market</b> offers an opportunity to examine {{the performance of a}} largely unregulated securities market and the behavior of U. S. commercial bank affiliates within that market. In this paper, we present evidence on the development and performance of the <b>Euro-bond</b> <b>market</b> over the last 20 years and then infer the likely consequences if a similar level of deregulation and competition were permitted in the United States. Data on the level of competition is presented along with an analysis of underwriting strategies and innovations that have been pursued in the market. The most serious criticisms concerning <b>Euro-bond</b> <b>market</b> operations [...] e. g. excessive spreads, conflicts of interest, and the Grey market [...] are reviewed. Overall, the evidence suggests that the <b>Euro-bond</b> <b>market</b> has experienced dynamic and vigorous growth, resulting in net benefits to both borrowers and lenders without exposing the financial instituitons to significant risks. Large U. S. companies regularly tap the <b>Euro-bond</b> <b>market</b> and capture some of these benefits. Allowing U. S. commercial bank affiliates to compete in the U. S. securities markets could make these benefits more certain and expand their availability toall firms with a minimal increase in risk to the safety and soundness of the banking system. ...|$|E

Initially associated with international syndicated loans, <b>euro-bonds</b> and euro-currency <b>markets,</b> Luxembourg has developed as a center for private banking and is currently the second largest center for the domiciliation of investment funds in the world after the US - with a portfolio equivalent to about sixty times the country’s GDP -, and the first captive reinsurance market in the European Union. As in many other financial centers, the interbank market plays an important role. This partly reflects intra-group operations of foreign banks using their Luxembourg branches and subsidiaries to adjust their liquidity position. More generally, Luxembourg has attracted foreign banks seeking to benefit from its favorable regulatory framework, political stability, language skills of the local workforce and the agglomeration of specialized skills in accounting and legal services. The importance of the financial sector in Luxembourg implies that a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with explicit modeling of the financial sector is indispensable in order to properly take into account the interaction between the financial and the real sector in the economy and the interconnectedness between different financial institutional sectors (e. g. commercial banks and investment funds). Explicit modeling of the financial sector also allows for an analysis of how the economy might respond to financial shocks.
