5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a <b>float</b> at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line <b>float</b> should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the <b>float</b> if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the <b>float</b> to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not <b>float</b> away.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims on {{the design}} of a {{reversible}} fused 32 -Point Radix- 2 single precision <b>floating</b> point FFT unit using 3 : 2 compressor. The work focuses on the realization of three reversible fused <b>floating</b> point units: reversible <b>floating</b> point add-sub unit, reversible <b>floating</b> point multiply-add unit and reversible <b>floating</b> point multiply-subtract unit. The proposed work requires the design of a reversible single precision <b>floating</b> point adder, a reversible single precision <b>floating</b> point subtractor and a reversible single precision <b>floating</b> point multiplier. A reversible single precision <b>floating</b> point adder and subtractor is designed with less quantum cost, less number of reversible gates and less constant inputs. A reversible single precision <b>floating</b> point multiplier is implemented using 3 : 2 compressor as the 24 x 24 bit multiplier based on 3 : 2 compressor is highly efficient when compared with the design using 4 : 3 compressors.

40|$|Context: Development of <b>floating</b> drug {{delivery}} systems (FDDS) is challenging. To facilitate this task, an evaluation method was proposed, {{which allows for}} a combined investigation of drug release and flotation. Objective: It was {{the aim of the}} study to use functionalized calcium carbonate (FCC) -based lipophilic mini-tablet formulations as a model system to design FDDS with a <b>floating</b> behavior characterized by no <b>floating</b> lag time, prolonged flotation and loss of <b>floating</b> capability after complete drug release. Materials and methods: Release of the model drug caffeine from the mini-tablets was assessed in vitro by a custom-built stomach model. A cellular automata-based model was used to simulate tablet dissolution. Based on the in silico data, <b>floating</b> forces were calculated and analyzed as a function of caffeine release. Results and discussion: Two <b>floating</b> behaviors were identified for mini-tablets: linear decrease of the <b>floating</b> force and maintaining of the <b>floating</b> capability until complete caffeine release. An optimal mini-tablet formulation with desired drug release time and <b>floating</b> behavior was developed and tested. Conclusion: A classification system for a range of varied <b>floating</b> behavior of FDDS was proposed. The FCC-based mini-tablets had an ideal <b>floating</b> behavior: duration of flotation is defined and <b>floating</b> capability decreases after completion of drug release...|$|R

40|$|<b>Floating</b> point units form an {{important}} component of many reconfigurable computing applications. The creation of <b>floating</b> point units under a collection of area, latency, and throughput constraints is {{an important}} consideration for system designers. Given the range of possible tradeoffs, most commercial or academic <b>floating</b> point libraries for FPGAs provide a small fraction of possible <b>floating</b> point units. In contrast, the <b>floating</b> unit generation approach outlined in this paper allows for the creation of more than 200 different <b>floating</b> point units, with differing area, throughput, and latency characteristics. These variations are supported through selection of a <b>floating</b> point architecture and the use of <b>floating</b> point unit pipelining. Each of these <b>floating</b> point units can be generated with a variable number of bits for the mantissa and the exponent. Given requirements on throughput, area and latency, our generation flow automatically chooses the proper algorithm and architecture to create a <b>floating</b> point unit which fulfills design requirements. Our approach is fully integrated into standard C++ using ASC, a stream compiler for FPGAs, and the underlying PAM-Blox II module generation environment [13]. The <b>floating</b> point units created by our approach are competitive in size and performance with ones created by commercial vendors...|$|R
