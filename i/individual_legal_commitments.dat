40|$|Abstract This paper aims to {{understand}} and compare the development paths of European and Asian regional environmental institutions, based on the variation of expected value with/without <b>legal</b> <b>commitment.</b> It seeks to answer why most Asian environmental institutions lack any significant enforcement on participants and are not legally binding, as Asian countries are reluctant to establish any significant <b>legal</b> <b>commitment.</b> The hypothesis {{of this paper is}} that for Asian countries, the expected value of establishing <b>legal</b> <b>commitment</b> in Asian regional environmental institutions is less than the expected value of not establishing <b>legal</b> <b>commitment.</b> The argument would also explain why European countries are more willing to set formal conventions and treaties in European regional environmental institutions. The Net Present Expected Value (NPEV) of establishing <b>legal</b> <b>commitment</b> in regional environmental institutions is affected by the total benefits and total costs expected by the participants, probability, and Social Discount Rate (SDR). The case studies of Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia (EANET) in Asia and Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) in Europe were analyzed in detail to test the argument. The results of analysis show that the NPEV of establishing <b>legal</b> <b>commitment</b> in Asian regional environmental institutions is relatively low. Asian countries prefer not to commit legally to any collective action for environment, in contrast to European countries whom have developed higher environmental awareness and have a higher NPEV from establishing legally binding regional environmental institutions. ...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{accounts}} {{in both the}} international law and international relations literature largely assume that great powers like the United States enter into international <b>legal</b> <b>commitments</b> in order to resolve global cooperative problems or to advance objective state interests. Contrary to these accounts, this Article suggests that an incumbent regime (or partisan elites within the regime) may often seek to use international <b>legal</b> <b>commitments</b> to overcome domestic obstacles to their narrow policy and electoral objectives. In this picture, an incumbent regime may deploy international law to expand the geographical scope of political conflict across borders in order to isolate the domestic political opposition and increase the influence of foreign groups or governments sympathetic to the regime 2 ̆ 7 s objectives. The political opposition may in turn seek to exploit {{the existence of a}} fragmented system of domestic institutions to thwart both the adoption and enforcement of any international law that strengthens the ruling regime and weakens its own position. Finally, this Article sketches a framework for predicting when distributive international <b>legal</b> <b>commitments</b> are likely to be sustainable across electoral cycles and when they are not. More specifically, the framework suggests that an international <b>legal</b> <b>commitment</b> is likely to be electorally sustainable when the veil of ignorance underlying the commitment is sufficiently thick; in other words, an international commitment entered into by a partisan regime has more staying power if it produces policy outcomes that are favored by some salient groups in the political opposition. The Article uses examples from the United States experience with human rights and international trade to illustrate how partisan dynamics between Republicans and Democrats has helped spawn and restrict the scope of international <b>legal</b> <b>commitments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Why do {{sovereign}} governments make international <b>legal</b> <b>commitments,</b> {{and what}} impact does international law have on state behavior? Very little empirical research exists {{that tries to}} answer these questions in a systematic way. The research in this Article examines patterns of commitment to and compliance with international monetary law. Countries commit themselves legally to liberal monetary policies not only to signal an intention to comply, but also because other governments so commit (an example of policy convergence). They comply largely to preserve their reputation for providing a stable framework for the protection of property rights, but once again, are greatly influenced by the compliance record of neighboring governments. <b>Legal</b> <b>commitment</b> has a tremendous positive impact on governments that have recently removed restrictive policies, indicative of a desire to reestablish a reputation for compliance.

In the commentary section, the case note {{examines the}} Court’s treatment of the ‘minimum harmonisation’ exception. It argues that, despite the Court’s embrace of a broad reading of the ERTA doctrine, the exception remains good law; it thus allows the Member States to incur international <b>legal</b> <b>commitments,</b> provided that both pre-existing common EU rules and the proposed international <b>legal</b> <b>commitments</b> establish minimum requirements.
