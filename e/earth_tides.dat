25|$|Though the {{gravitational}} forcing causing <b>earth</b> <b>tides</b> and ocean tides is the same, the responses are quite different.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of a systematic theory of <b>Earth</b> <b>tides</b> was started by George H. Darwin in 1879, and was then furthered by numerous authors, most notably by William Kaula in 1964.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{class of}} {{theories}} is the quasilinear theories such as Whitehead's theory of gravitation. For these [...] The relative magnitudes of the harmonics of the <b>Earth's</b> <b>tides</b> depend on [...] and , and measurements show that quasilinear theories disagree with observations of <b>Earth's</b> <b>tides.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> (also {{known as}} solid <b>Earth</b> <b>tide,</b> crustal tide, body tide, bodily tide or land tide) is the {{displacement}} of the solid earth's surface caused by {{the gravity of the}} Moon and Sun. Its main component has meter-level amplitude at periods of about 12 hours and longer. [...] The largest body tide constituents are semi-diurnal, but there are also significant diurnal, semi-annual, and fortnightly contributions.|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between temporal variation of earthquake frequencies and the <b>earth</b> <b>tide</b> {{in the vicinity}} of Mount Erebus, Antarctica was investigated. No significant correlation was found between the <b>earth</b> <b>tide</b> and seismic activity. Interestingly, remarkable periodicities of about 2 - 4 days and 10 - 20 days were found by the spectral analysis of this seismic activity. These may be explained as peculiar rhythms of the seismic activity. The effect of the <b>earth</b> <b>tide</b> on the seismic activity seems very small, as Mount Erebus is located at a very high latitude of about 80 °S. This enabled us to observe an intrinsic nature of the seismic activity and to reveal these periodicities...|$|R
25|$|Geodesy, {{also called}} geodetics, is the {{scientific}} discipline {{that deals with}} the measurement and representation of the Earth, its gravitational field and geodynamic phenomena (polar motion, <b>Earth</b> <b>tides,</b> and crustal motion) in three-dimensional time-varying space.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to oceanic tides, large lakes can experience small tides and even planets can experience atmospheric tides and <b>Earth</b> <b>tides.</b> These are continuum mechanical phenomena. The first two {{take place in}} fluids. The third affects the Earth's thin solid crust surrounding its semi-liquid interior (with various modifications).|$|E
25|$|The semidiurnal {{amplitude}} of terrestrial tides can reach about 55cm at the equator {{which is important}} in GPS, VLBI, and SLR measurements. Also to make precise astronomical angular measurements requires knowledge of the Earth's rate of rotation (length of day, precession, and nutation), which is influenced by <b>earth</b> <b>tides</b> (so-called pole tide). Terrestrial tides {{also need to be}} taken in account in the case of some particle physics experiments.|$|E
5000|$|For <b>Earth's</b> <b>tides</b> one can {{calculate}} the tilt factor as [...] and the gravimetric factor as , where suffix two is assumed.|$|R
40|$|In the {{vincinity}} of earthquake focal regions, {{conditions may}} not be equal. Crustal rocks stressed to more than approximately 0. 6 of their failure strength exhibit material properties over and above that of linear elasticity. Interactions between the <b>earth</b> <b>tide</b> and crustal rocks that are under high tectonic stress are {{discussed in terms of}} simple phenomenological models. In particular, the difference between a nonlinear elastic model of dilatancy and a dilatancy model that exhibits hysteresis is noted. It is concluded that the small changes in stress produced by the <b>earth</b> <b>tide</b> act as a probe of the properties of crustal rocks. Observations of <b>earth</b> <b>tide</b> tilts and strains in such high stress zones may, therefore, provide keys to the constitutive properties and the tectonic stress rate tensor of these zones...|$|R
40|$|Zero drift {{and solid}} <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> {{corrections}} to static relative gravimetric data cannot be ignored. In this paper, a new {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) algorithm is presented to extract the zero drift and the solid <b>Earth</b> <b>tide,</b> as signals, from static relative gravimetric data assuming that the components contained in the relative gravimetric data are uncorrelated. Static relative gravity observations from Aug. 15 to Aug. 23, 2014 are used as statistical variables to separate the signal and noise with PCA to obtain desired signals. The results of the linear drift extracted by PCA {{are consistent with those}} calculated by the least squares linear fitting, and the differences only reach to 10 − 2  μGal/day order of magnitude. Furthermore, PCA is used to estimate the solid <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> from the relative gravimetric data corrected by the zero drift. The statistical results are consistent with the results derived from the solid <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> correction provided by the internal software of the CG- 5 gravimeter (SCINTREX Limited Ontario Canada). The statistical results {{of the differences between the}} two methods are both less than 8  μGal, and the RMSs for 9 days are all less than 5  μGal...|$|R
25|$|In December 2012, a {{research}} team in China {{announced that it}} had produced measurements of the phase lag of <b>Earth</b> <b>tides</b> during full and new moons which seem {{to prove that the}} speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light. This means that if the Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would keep orbiting it normally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to travel that distance. The team's findings were released in the Chinese Science Bulletin in February 2013.|$|E
25|$|Real amplitudes differ considerably, {{not only}} because of depth {{variations}} and continental obstacles, but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period: if there were no land masses, it would take about 30 hours for a long wavelength surface wave to propagate along the equator halfway around the Earth (by comparison, the Earth's lithosphere has a natural period of about 57 minutes). <b>Earth</b> <b>tides,</b> which raise and lower the bottom of the ocean, and the tide's own gravitational self attraction are both significant and further complicate the ocean's response to tidal forces.|$|E

The Earth's crust shifts (in/out, east/west, north/south) in response to lunar and solar gravitation, ocean tides, and atmospheric loading. While negligible for most human activities, terrestrial tides' semi-diurnal amplitude can reach about [...] at the equator— due to the sun—which is important in GPS calibration and VLBI measurements. Precise astronomical angular measurements require knowledge of the Earth's rotation rate and polar motion, {{both of which are}} influenced by <b>Earth</b> <b>tides.</b> The semi-diurnal M2 <b>Earth</b> <b>tides</b> are nearly in phase with the moon with a lag of about two hours.|$|E
2500|$|Impacts by meteorites and comets are {{the only}} abrupt {{geologic}} force acting on the Moon today, though the variation of <b>Earth</b> <b>tides</b> {{on the scale of}} the Lunar anomalistic month causes small variations in stresses. Some of the most important craters used in lunar stratigraphy formed in this recent epoch. For example, the crater Copernicus, which has a depth of 3.76km and a radius of 93km, is believed to have formed about 900 million years ago (though this is debatable). The Apollo 17 mission landed in an area in which the material coming from the crater Tycho might have been sampled. The study of these rocks seem to indicate that this crater could have formed 100 million years ago, though this is debatable as well. The surface has also experienced space weathering due to high energy particles, solar wind implantation, and micrometeorite impacts. This process causes the ray systems associated with young craters to darken until it matches the albedo of the surrounding surface. However, if the composition of the ray is different from the underlying crustal materials (as might occur when a [...] "highland" [...] ray is emplaced on the mare), the ray could be visible for much longer times.|$|E

40|$|Based on rapid {{analyses}} done in near real-time and {{in support}} of scientific advice, I present two cases of prima facie evidence for an <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> triggering effect on earthquake activity during two volcanic eruption episodes: the first in relation to large magnitude earthquakes during August 2014 in the 2014 - 15 Bárðarbunga-Holuhruan, Iceland, eruption; and the second concerning the timing of VT strings at the Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat. In both cases, statistical testing of {{the hypothesis that the}} timings of the seismic events of interest and vertical <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> phase were not correlated produced probabilities at or below a 5 % significance level, suggesting rejection of the hypothesis can be argued. This note outlines the method used for computing <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> amplitudes at the two volcanoes and the basis and results of the Schuster test for relative phase timings; some comments on the volcanological contexts are added. These findings suggest further, more formal analysis may be warranted...|$|R
30|$|During the {{analysis}} of the transfer functions, we used a similar data-processing method to Lai et al. (2013 b). In the intermediate-frequency band, we calculated the transfer functions of the water-level response to barometric pressure and <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> from Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. In the low- and high-frequency bands, the influence from the <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> is small, so we only calculated the transfer functions of the water-level response to barometric pressure, from Eq. (3). For the calculation, we also used the data from December 1, 2010, to March 10, 2011, which is continuous, stable, and not influenced by earthquakes or rainfall (Fig.  2).|$|R

40|$|Observations {{by means}} of a rotationmeter were carried out at Otsu Observatory, and their {{analysed}} value for three months is given in this paper. It has been proved that the gradient of the displacements with respect to their orthogonal directions can be obtained by use of the observations of the ground extensions in azimuth of more than three in the <b>earth</b> <b>tide.</b> Then the results of the orthogonal gradient of the tidal horizontal displacement which is observed directly {{by means of}} a rotationmeter, which is calculated from the strain elements observed by extensometers, and which is calculated by the elastic theory in the <b>earth</b> <b>tide</b> are compared with each other. There are good agreements between the amplitudes and the phase lags of the calculated values from the observations of the extensometers and that from the elastic theory.

50|$|Not all {{deformations}} originate {{within the}} Earth. The {{gravity of the}} Moon and Sun cause the Earth's surface at a given point to undulate by tenths of meters over a nearly 12-hour period (see <b>Earth</b> <b>tide).</b>|$|R

40|$|Satellite laser ranging (SLR) as {{a proven}} {{geodetic}} technique provides a wide and {{significant contribution to}} scientific studies of the Earth/Atmosphere/Ocean systems. In particular, modelling of the <b>Earth</b> and pole <b>tides</b> plays {{a very important role}} when analyzing SLR data. The accuracy of the determined satellite orbits is highly dependent on the models used for dynamic orbit determination. Gravity field models, which are represented by a series of spherical harmonic coefficients, {{have an impact on the}} satellite orbit and its precision. In addition, different empirical model parameterization used during SLR data analysis also has significant influence on the computed spherical harmonics, satellite orbits and their accuracies. In this contribution we investigate the impact of different SLR parameterizations on gravity field models used for precise satellite orbit determination. Data from satellites LAGEOS 1 and 2 were analysed using four different parameterization schemes namely: IERS 1, IERS 2 and IERS 3 <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> models and pole tides. These are compatible <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> modelsofdifferentcomplexity derived fromIERS 2010,astandard modeloftheInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and the standard IERS 2010 pole tide model, and they aim to study their impacts on SLR solutions. The results indicate that the combination of IERS 3, which is the most complex <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> model and the standard IERS 2010 pole tide model, has a significant influence on the accuracy of gravity field models in precise orbit determination. In particular almost all the evaluated models give the smallest RMS values when IERS 3 and pole tides are jointly selected in the analysis software during SLR data analysis, which indicates that the most complex models are also the most accurate. This work therefore validates the currently accepted IERS 2010 <b>Earth</b> <b>tide</b> and pole tide models. [URL]...|$|R
