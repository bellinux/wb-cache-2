25|$|Contrary {{to western}} popular perception, the Kama Sutra is not {{exclusively}} a sex manual; it presents {{itself as a}} guide to a virtuous and gracious living that discusses the nature of love, family life, and other aspects pertaining to pleasure-oriented faculties of human life. The Kama Sutra, in parts of the world, is presumed or depicted as a synonym for creative sexual positions; in reality, only 20% of the Kama Sutra is about sexual positions. The majority of the book, notes Jacob Levy, is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad.</b>|$|E
25|$|They go on {{to discuss}} what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> in writing. Socrates tells a brief legend, {{critically}} commenting on the gift of writing from the Egyptian god Theuth to King Thamus, who was to disperse Theuth's gifts {{to the people of}} Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} on his Ethics is scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad,</b> or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E

25|$|Multimodality {{also can}} be used to {{associate}} a text with a specific argumentative purpose, e.g., to state facts, make a definition, cause a value judgment, or make a policy decision. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, professors at the University of Maryland and the Pennsylvania State University, labeled the fulfillment of these purposes stases. A text’s stasis can be altered by multimodality, especially when several mediums are juxtaposed to create an individualized experience or meaning. For example, an argument that mainly defines a concept is understood as arguing in the stasis of definition; however, it can also be assigned a stasis of value if the way the definition is delivered equips writers to evaluate a concept, or judge whether something <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad.</b> If the text is interactive, the audience is facilitated to create their own meaning from the perspective the multimodal text provides. By emphasizing different stases through the use of different modes, writers are able to further engage their audience in creating comprehension.|$|E
25|$|Karma, also {{refers to}} a {{conceptual}} principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the principle of karma, sometimes as the karma theory or the law of karma. In the context of theory, karma is complex and difficult to define. Different schools of Indologists derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, that <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth. Other Indologists include {{in the definition of}} karma theory that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in past. These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives. The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.|$|E

Both Annette O'Toole and Al Gough said Lionel was slightly attracted to Martha, but {{that she would never}} act on that feeling. The producers had no intentions to create a romantic relationship between the two characters. Most of Lionel's motivations in season five are shrouded in mystery. Glover said he could not determine whether his character <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad,</b> so when he is portraying him in season five he tried to present everything as if it was [...] "good".

Writer Stephen James Walker notes similarities have been found between Jack and Angel (David Boreanaz), the heroic vampire from America's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel; Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal pointed out that [...] "Back alley fights, knowledge of the paranormal and an unwanted task of defending the helpless are {{only a few of the}} correlations between the two characters." [...] Jack has also been compared to the title character of America's , which featured lesbian subtext between Xena (Lucy Lawless) and her close friend Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor). Polina Skibinskaya, writing for AfterElton.com, an American gay men's website, notes both are [...] "complex characters" [...] haunted by their past misdeeds. Furthermore, like Xena, Jack is [...] "a gay basher’s worst nightmare: a queer weapon-wielding, ass-kicking superhero gleefully chewing his way through awesome fight scenes". One academic article refers to Jack as [...] "an indestructible Captain Scarlet figure". In a comparative contrast, where the Doctor is a pacifist, Jack is more inclined to see violent means to reach similar ends. The BBC News website refers to Jack's role within Doctor Who as [...] " [...] what began with Ian Chesterton and continued later with Harry Sullivan". [...] Whereas in the classic series the female [...] "companions" [...] were sometimes exploited and sexualised for the entertainment of predominantly male audiences, the producers could reverse this dynamic with Jack, citing an equal need amongst modern audiences to [...] "look at good looking men". John Barrowman linked the larger number of women watching the show as a key factor in this.|$|E

2500|$|The Phaedrus {{also gives}} us {{much in the}} way of {{explaining}} how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates's role as a [...] "midwife of the soul" [...] in the Theaetetus; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must have an idea of what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what that art is for and what it can help one achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Karma {{translates}} literally as action, work, or deed, {{and also}} {{refers to a}} Vedic theory of [...] "moral law of cause and effect". The theory {{is a combination of}} (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, that <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth. Karma theory is interpreted as explaining the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in past. These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Hinduism, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives. This cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth is called samsara. Liberation from samsara through moksha is believed to ensure lasting happiness and peace. Hindu scriptures teach that the future is both a function of current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the circumstances.|$|E

2500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest, {{the leak}} that Tony Harnischfeger had spotted was cited as {{evidence}} that the dam was leaking {{on the day of the}} break, and that both the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and Mulholland were aware of it. Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break, due to the dam keeper's call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the Inquest Mulholland said, [...] "This inquest is a very painful thing for me to have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful. The only ones I envy about this thing are the ones who are dead." [...] In subsequent testimony, after answering a question he added, [...] "Whether it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad,</b> don't blame anyone else, you just fasten it on me. If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human, I won't try to fasten it on anyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Socrates and Phaedrus {{proceed to}} recount the various tools of speechmaking as written {{down by the}} great orators of the past, {{starting}} with the [...] "Preamble" [...] and the [...] "Statement Facts" [...] and concluding with the [...] "Recapitulation", Socrates states that the fabric seems a little threadbare. He goes on to compare one with only knowledge of these tools to a doctor {{who knows how to}} raise and lower a body's temperature but does not know when it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> to do so, stating that one who has simply read a book or came across some potions knows nothing of the art. One who knows how to compose the longest passages on trivial topics or the briefest passages on topics of great importance is similar, when he claims that to teach this is to impart the knowledge of composing tragedies; if one were to claim to have mastered harmony after learning the lowest and highest notes on the lyre, a musician would say that this knowledge is what one must learn before one masters harmony, {{but it is not the}} knowledge of harmony itself. This, then, is what must be said to those who attempt to teach the art of rhetoric through [...] "Preambles" [...] and [...] "Recapitulations"; they are ignorant of dialectic, and teach only what is necessary to learn as preliminaries.|$|E
2500|$|When {{we try to}} be definite, as to what we {{mean when}} we say that this or that is [...] "the Good," [...] we find {{ourselves}} involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case — or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to [...] "values" [...] — that is to say, as to what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> on its own account, independently of its effects — lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to [...] "values" [...] lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge.

[...] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) effectively announced its opposition to Ellison's candidacy, issuing a press release saying that his statement [...] "raises serious concerns about whether Ellison faithfully could represent the Democratic Party's traditional support for a strong and secure Israel." [...] CNN also reported on his past support for anti-Semitic and radical organizations and individuals, particularly the Nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan, but noted they found no anti-Semitic writings or public statements by Ellison, and cited his public rejection of the group [...] "due to its propagation of bigoted and anti-Semitic ideas and statements". The New York Times reported that one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, Haim Saban, said in his 2016 foreign policy forum that Ellison is [...] "clearly an anti-Semitic and anti-Israel person.” Reporters from the Washington Post, Slate and the Huffington Post have described this as part of a smear campaign against Ellison, and note that Ellison's rivals agreed that Saban should apologize for the comments. Schumer replied to critics, saying that Ellison has supported pro-Israeli policies within the Democratic Party, telling The Atlantic that [...] "while I disagree with some of [...] past positions, I saw him orchestrate one of the most pro-Israel platforms in decades by successfully persuading other skeptical committee members to adopt such a strong platform." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{critics of}} the concept of {{adolescence}} do point at individual differences in brain growth rate, citing that some (though not all) early teens still have infantile undeveloped corpus callosums, concluding that [...] "the adult in *every* adolescent" [...] is too generalizing. These people tend to support the notion that a more interconnected brain makes more precise distinctions (citing Pavlov's comparisons of conditioned reflexes in different species) {{and that there is a}} non-arbitrary threshold at which distinctions become sufficiently precise to correct assumptions afterward as opposed to being ultimately dependent on exterior assumptions for communication. These people argue that this threshold is the one at which an individual is objectively capable of speaking for himself or herself, as opposed to culturally arbitrary measures of [...] "maturity" [...] which often treat this ability as a sign of [...] "immaturity" [...] merely because it leads to questioning of authorities. These people also stress the low probability of the threshold being reached at a birthday, and instead advocate non-chronological emancipation at the threshold of afterward correction of assumptions. They sometimes cite similarities between [...] "adolescent" [...] behavior and KZ syndrome (inmate behavior in adults in prison camps) such as aggression being explainable by oppression and [...] "immature" [...] financial or other risk behavior being explainable by a way out of captivity being more worth to captive people than any incremental improvement in captivity, and argue that this theory successfully predicted remaining [...] "immature" [...] behavior after reaching the age of majority by means of longer-term traumatization. In this context, they refer to the fallibility of official assumptions about what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> for an individual, concluding that paternalistic [...] "rights" [...] may harm the individual.
