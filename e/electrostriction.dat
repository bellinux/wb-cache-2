50|$|<b>Electrostriction</b> is a {{property}} of all dielectric materials, and {{is caused by}} a slight displacement of ions in the crystal lattice upon being exposed to an external electric field. Positive ions will be displaced {{in the direction of the}} field, while negative ions will be displaced in the opposite direction. This displacement will accumulate throughout the bulk material and result in an overall strain (elongation) in the direction of the field. The thickness will be reduced in the orthogonal directions characterized by Poisson's ratio. All insulating materials consisting of more than one type of atom will be ionic to some extent due to the difference of electronegativity of the atoms, and therefore exhibit <b>electrostriction.</b>|$|E
50|$|Magnetostriction (cf. <b>electrostriction)</b> is a {{property}} of ferromagnetic materials that {{causes them to}} change their shape or dimensions {{during the process of}} magnetization.

The effect was first identified in 1842 by James Joule when observing a sample of iron.|$|E

50|$|A crystal oscillator, {{particularly}} {{one made}} of quartz crystal, works by being distorted by an electric field when voltage {{is applied to}} an electrode near or on the crystal. This property is known as <b>electrostriction</b> or inverse piezoelectricity. When the field is removed, the quartz - which oscillates in a precise frequency - generates an electric field as it returns to its previous shape, and this can generate a voltage. The result is that a quartz crystal behaves like an RLC circuit.|$|E

5000|$|Piezomagnetism {{differs from}} the related {{property}} of magnetostriction; if an applied magnetic field is reversed in direction, the strain produced changes signs. Additionally, a non-zero piezomagnetic moment can be produced by mechanical strain alone, at zero field - {{this is not true}} of magnetostriction. According to IEEE: [...] "Piezomagnetism is the linear magnetomechanical effect analogous to the linear electromechanical effect of piezoelectricity. Similarly, magnetostriction and <b>electrostriction</b> are analogous second-order effects. These higher-order effects can be represented as effectively first-order when variations in the system parameters are small compared with the initial values of the parameters".|$|E

The effect appears to be quadratic at low field strengths (up to 0.3 MV/m) and roughly linear after that, up to a maximum field strength of 4 MV/m [...] Therefore, devices made of such materials are normally operated around a bias voltage in order to behave nearly linearly.

5000|$|The first {{mechanism}} {{above is}} mostly conspicuous in a photosynthesizing plant leaf. There, the light induced oxygen evolution causes pressure {{changes in the}} air phase, resulting in a photoacoustic signal, which is comparable in magnitude to that caused by the photothermal mechanism. This mechanism was tentatively named [...] "photobaric". The second mechanism shows up in photosynthetically active sub-cell complexes in suspension (e.g. photosynthetic reaction centers). There, the electric field which is formed in the reaction center, following the light induced electron transfer process, causes a micro <b>electrostriction</b> effect with {{a change in the}} molecular volume. This, in turn, induces a pressure wave which propagates in the macroscopic medium. Another case for this mechanism is Bacteriorhodopsin proton pump. Here the light induced change in the molecular volume is caused by conformational changes that occur in this protein following light absorption.|$|E

50|$|A {{relevant}} suggested {{scheme of}} sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation using gas bubbles as the active medium was introduced around 1995 The pumping {{is created by}} mechanical oscillations of a cylindrical resonator and the phase bunching of bubbles is realized by acoustic radiation forces. A notable fact is that gas bubbles can only oscillate under an external action, but not spontaneously. According to other proposed schemes, the <b>electrostriction</b> oscillations of the dispersed particle volumes in the cylindrical resonator are realized by an alternating electromagnetic field. However, a SASER scheme with an alternating electric field as the pump has a limitation. A very large amplitude of electric field (up to tens of kV/cm) is required to realize the amplification. Such values approach the electric puncture intensity of liquid dielectrics. Hence, a study proposes a SASER scheme without this limitation. The pumping is created by radial mechanical pulsations of a cylinder. This cylinder contains an active medium—a liquid dielectric with gas bubbles. The radiation emits through {{the faces of the}} cylinder.|$|E
50|$|A piezo (or piezo-electric) tweeter {{contains}} a piezoelectric crystal coupled to a mechanical diaphragm. An audio signal {{is applied to}} the crystal, which responds by flexing in proportion to the voltage applied across the crystal's surfaces, thus converting electrical energy into mechanical. The conversion of electrical pulses to mechanical vibrations and the conversion of returned mechanical vibrations back into electrical energy is the basis for ultrasonic testing. The active element {{is the heart of the}} transducer as it converts the electrical energy to acoustic energy, and vice versa. The active element is basically a piece of polarized material (i.e. some parts of the molecule are positively charged, while other parts of the molecule are negatively charged) with electrodes attached to two of its opposite faces. When an electric field is applied across the material, the polarized molecules will align themselves with the electric field, resulting in induced dipoles within the molecular or crystal structure of the material. This alignment of molecules will cause the material to change dimensions. This phenomenon is known as <b>electrostriction.</b> In addition, a permanently polarized material such as quartz (SiO2) or barium titanate (BaTiO3) will produce an electric field when the material changes dimensions as a result of an imposed mechanical force. This phenomenon is known as the piezoelectric effect.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecules}} of some crystals and ceramics are permanently polarised: {{some parts of}} the molecule are positively charged, while other parts are negatively charged. These materials produce an electric charge when the material changes dimension {{as a result of an}} imposed external force. The charge produced is referred to as piezoelectricity. Many crystalline materials such as the natural crystals of quartz and rochelle salted together with manufactured polycrystalline ceramics such as lead titanate zirconate and barium titanate exhibit piezoelectric effects. Piezoelectric materials are used as buzzers inside pagers, ultrasonic cleaners and mobile phones, and in gas igniters. In addition, these piezoelectric sensors are able to convert pressure, force, vibration or shock into electrical energy. Being capable only of measuring active events, they are also used in flow meters, accelerometers and level detectors, as well as motor vehicles to sense changes in the transmission, fuel injection and coolant pressure. When a voltage or an applied electric field stresses a piezo element electrically, its dimensions change. This phenomenon is known as <b>electrostriction,</b> or the reverse piezoelectric effect. This effect enables the element to act as a translating device called an actuator. Piezoelectric materials are used in power actuators, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, and in acoustic transducers, converting electric fields into sound waves.|$|E
50|$|Coding is {{the process}} during which the video inputs are {{transferred}} into binary digit (0, 1) because digits can be much more easily transmitted. A crystal oscillator is used in coding. It is an electronic oscillator that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal or piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. Inside the crystal oscillator, there is usually a crystal or elastic material whose constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are in a regular order. For example, the quartz is often used in crystal oscillators due to its elasticity. After a crystal is accurately installed, electric field can be distorted by {{a change in the}} voltage due to an electrode near or on the crystal. This characteristic is called <b>electrostriction</b> or inverse piezoelectricity. When the video signals are inputted into the oscillators, the crystal with electrodes attaching to it starts to vibrate as a resonator. The crystal's piezoelectric property converts the mechanical vibrations into an oscillating voltage and then the voltage is picked up by the attached electrodes. Thus, the electric field is distorted due to the potential differences between the electrodes. Since the original video signal exists as a time-varying voltage on a wire, the distorted electric field is also time-varying. The changing electric field is converted into waveform, a signal in the shape/form of wave. Finally, the output signals are combined with a carrier wave and transferred into RF signals, then transmitted to the receiver.|$|E
5000|$|Solid state magnetic-dielectric bistability. Similar to the {{mentioned}} above molecular bistability {{induced by the}} hidden PJTE, a magnetic-dielectric bistability due to two coexisting equilibrium configurations with corresponding properties may take place also in crystals with transition metal centers, subject to the electronic configuration with half-filled e2 or t3 shells. As in molecular systems, the latter produce a hidden PJTE and local bistability which, distinguished from the molecular case, are enhanced by the cooperative interactions, thus acquiring larger lifetimes. This crystal bistability was proved by calculations for LiCuO2 and NaCuO2 crystals, in which the Cu3+ ion has the electronic e2(d8) configuration (similar to the CuF3 molecule). Giant enhancement of observable properties in interaction with external perturbations. In a recent development of the PJTE applications in materials science it was shown that in crystals with PJTE centers, in which the local distortion are not ordered (before the phase transition to the cooperative phases), the effect of interaction with external perturbations acquires an orientational contribution which enhances the observable properties by several orders of magnitude. This was demonstrated on the properties of crystals like paraelectric BaTiO3 in interaction with electric fields (in permittivity and <b>electrostriction),</b> or under a strain gradient (flexoelectricity). These giant enhancement effects occur due to the dynamic nature of the PJTE local dipolar distortions (their tunneling between the equivalent minima); the independently rotating dipole moments on each center become oriented (frozen) along the external perturbation resulting in an orientational polarization which is not there {{in the absence of}} the PJTE ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrostriction</b> {{has been}} known for long as a major source of {{internal}} stress developing in oxide films during anodising. However, in many studies, the contribution of <b>electrostriction</b> is estimated using an oversimplified equation, leading to a systematic underestimation. In this work, a modified theory is first presented for linking the in-plane <b>electrostriction</b> stress to the applied electric field. The corrected equation explicitly takes into account the dielectric properties of the deformed material through the appropriate <b>electrostriction</b> parameters of the oxide film. A new experimental procedure is then described for measuring <b>electrostriction</b> stresses in situ during anodising, and applied to ultrathin (< 100 nm) TiO 2 films. Oxide films were first grown potentiodynamically on one side of cantilevered electrodes. The electric field in the oxide film was then systematically changed by repeatedly cycling up to the forming voltage. At the same time, the resulting in-plane <b>electrostriction</b> stress was determined from high-resolution in situ curvature measurements. For the TiO 2 films considered, compressive in-plane <b>electrostriction</b> stresses up to - 240 MPa were measured. This is an order of magnitude higher than previous predictions which neglected the contribution of the <b>electrostriction</b> parameters. Moreover, the measured stress values, their field-dependence and the derived <b>electrostriction</b> parameters are shown to be in agreement with the modified theory. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A problem {{encountered}} in quadratic <b>electrostriction</b> research in polymers is that viscoelasticity {{is usually not}} {{taken into account in}} theoretical predictions of intrinsic <b>electrostriction</b> whereas the apparent value obtained by experiment is a superposition of ?true? <b>electrostriction</b> and spurious contributions from other cross-effects and viscoelasticity.

The method is purely macroscopic to ensure general applicability to different experimental situations and to avoid the use of any model or of assumptions on the molecular structure. Irreversible thermodynamics is used to derive the time-dependent equation of state of the viscoelastic dielectric.

Perovskite ferroelectrics demonstrating high piezoelectric performance, including BaTiO 3, Pb(Zr 1 -xTix) O 3, and relaxor-PbTiO 3 materials, have been widely used in various electromechanical devices. To improve the piezoelectric activity of these materials, efforts have been focused on the ferroelectric phase transition regions, including shift the composition to the morphotropic phase boundary or shift polymorphic phase transition to room temperature. However, there is not much room left to further enhance the piezoelectric response in perovskite solid solutions using this approach. With the purpose of exploring alternative approaches, the electrostrictive effect is systematically surveyed in this paper. Initially, the techniques for measuring the electrostrictive effect are given and compared. Second, the origin of <b>electrostriction</b> is discussed.
