In order to transfer the horizontal shear loads from the concrete structure to the steel braced frame, a reliable {{connection between the two}} is essential.

The behavior of two different fixing methods has been investigated in research programs in Japan and in Europe.

Inspired from circular sailing (or called globular sailing), which sails on the arc of a great circle to make the shortest distance between two places on the earth, we propose a new routing algorithm called Circular Sailing Routing (CSR). In CSR, wireless nodes in a 2 D network are mapped to a sphere using reversed stereographic projection and the routing decision is made based on a newly defined [...] "circular distance" [...] on the sphere instead of the Euclidean distance in 2 D plane. By doing so, the traffic {{from one side to}} another side of the network area will avoid the center area. Thus, [...] "hot spots" [...] are eliminated and the load is balanced.|$|E

This type of converter has many potential advantages like high efficiency, low fuel consumption and low emissions, which make it suitable for a series hybrid vehicle.

This paper presents a comparative study on how different generator force profiles affect the electric power pulsations produced by the FPEC. In addition, the influence of these profiles on translator motion and the needed power converter current is investigated. A dynamic free piston model is used for the investigation. Results show that the generator force profile has a major impact on the power pulsation amplitude and peak current demand. Thus the chosen force profile will affect dimensioning of power converter, electrical machine and energy storage. Furthermore, loading the translator heavily in the beginning or end of the stroke seems to affect the peak translator velocity more than <b>evenly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> profiles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Most of the {{topology}} control protocols for wireless ad hoc networks {{focus on}} minimizing power consumptions while maintaining connectivity. Those protocols are static in nature {{due to the}} fact that all the nodes use only a fixed set of (energy efficient) relays. However, using the same set of relays all the time causes some nodes to become heavily loaded creating congestion, unbalanced traffic and high latency in the network. Instead of generating a single topology with fixed relay sets, we propose a distributed algorithm that generates a family of connected topology with (possibly) disjoint relay sets. Thus, by creating different energy aware relay sets of each node the proposed algorithm performs a time-delayed rotation of data forwarding duty among those sets in order to <b>evenly</b> <b>distribute</b> <b>loads</b> in the network. We illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed algorithm through simulation experiments. I...|$|R
40|$|Ankara : The Department of Computer Engineering and the Institute of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2002. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2002. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 73 - 78. Sorting {{is perhaps}} one of the most widely studied problems of computing. Numerous asymptotically optimal sequential algorithms have been discovered. Asymptotically optimal algorithms have been presented for varying parallel models as well. Parallel sorting algorithms have already been proposed for a variety of multiple instruction, multiple data streams (MIMD) architectures. In this thesis, we adapt the multiwaymerge sorting algorithm that is originally designed for product networks, to MIMD architectures. It has good load balancing properties, modest communication needs and well performance. The multiway-merge sort algorithm requires only two all-to-all personalized communication (AAPC) and two one-to-one communications independent from the input size. In addition to <b>evenly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> balancing, the algorithm requires only size of 2 N/P local memory for each processor in the worst case, where N is the number of items to be sorted and P is the number of processors. We have implemented the algorithm on the PC Cluster that is established at Computer Engineering Department of Bilkent University. To compare the results we have implemented a sample sort algorithm (PSRS Parallel Sorting by Regular Sampling) by X. Liu et all and a parallel quicksort algorithm (HyperQuickSort) on the same cluster. In the experimental studies we have used three different benchmarks namely Uniformly, Gaussian, and Zero distributed inputs. Although the multiwaymerge algorithm did not achieve better results than the other two, which are theoretically cost optimal algorithms, there are some cases that the multiway-merge algorithm outperforms the other two like in Zero distributed input. The results of the experiments are reported in detail. The multiway-merge sort algorithm is not necessarily the best parallel sorting algorithm, but it is expected to achieve acceptable performance on a wide spectrum of MIMD architectures.

40|$|In current bridge {{engineering}} {{an idealized}} model {{is used to}} apply the parapet load to the bearing pads of a bridge. In this idealized model {{it is assumed that}} the parapet load is evenly distributed across all of the bridge bearing pads. However, this assumption is incorrect. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate that the parapet load distribution is more complicated than an <b>evenly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>load.</b> Instead, this study shows that a majority of the parapet load is applied to the exterior bearing pad. This means that the real world exterior bearing pad reactions will be much larger than the reactions found using the idealized, evenly distributed model. 	This study utilizes the finite element program, NISA, to model and analyze a simple span bridge. The bridge used in this study was developed using a prestressed concrete girder design example from the Texas Department of Transportation. The design example specified the span length, clear roadway width, prestressed girder type, and girder spacing of the bridge. The bridge is modeled under two different loading conditions to ensure a comprehensive array of results is obtained. The two loading conditions were carefully designed to compare the idealized model, utilized by the Federal Highway Administration, to the real world parapet load distribution. 	The focus of this study is to determine how the parapet load distribution will affect the bearing pad reactions in a simple span bridge. The results of this study are provided in several tables depicting the bearing pad reactions obtained from the finite element models. The results of each parapet load distribution are compared to one another and percent differences are calculated between each condition. This allows for the use of a single number to define the effect the parapet load distribution has on the bearing pad reactions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development and effectiveness of a mathematical model used to predict the behavior of cantilever beams whose loading conditions include parallel combinations of <b>evenly</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>loads</b> and endpoint forces. The large deflection of cantilever beams has been widely studied. A number of models and mathematical techniques have been utilized in predicting the endpoint path coordinates and load-deflection relationships of such beams. The Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model (PRBM) is one such method which replaces the elastic beam with rigid links of a parameterized pivot location and torsional spring stiffness. In this paper, the PRBM method is extended to include cases of a constant <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> combined with a parallel endpoint force. The phase space of the governing differential equations is used to store information relevant to the characterization of the PRBM parameters. Correction factors are also given to decrease the error in the load-deflection relationship and extend the angular range of the model, thereby further aiding compliant mechanism design. The calculations suggest a simple way of representing the effective torque caused by a <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> in a PRBM {{as a function of}} easily calculated model parameters...|$|R

The beam’s misalignment and the supports’ reaction forces are calculated numerically for varying stiffness parameters of the supports and are compared with and without semi-active auxiliary kinematic guidance elements.
