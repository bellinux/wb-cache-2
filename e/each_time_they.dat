5|$|The enemy {{made many}} {{attempts}} to encircle the regiment, but <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> failed {{because of the}} many casualties inflicted by the 65th.

5|$|Friends with Benefits is a 2011 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Will Gluck, and starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis {{in the lead}} roles. The film features Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Bryan Greenberg, Nolan Gould, Richard Jenkins, and Woody Harrelson in supporting roles. The plot revolves around Dylan Harper (Timberlake) and Jamie Rellis (Kunis), who meet in New York City, and naively believe adding sex to their friendship will not lead to complications. Over time, they begin to develop deep mutual feelings for each other, only to deny it <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> are together.|$|E

5000|$|Back Draft is a draft variant {{where each}} player tries {{to build the}} worst deck possible, because each player gives another player that deck {{to play in the}} tournament. To avoid mana problems, players choose what lands to add in the deck after they are [...] "backdrafted". Scoring is usually done where a player gains a point <b>each</b> <b>time</b> the deck <b>they</b> play with wins and <b>each</b> <b>time</b> the deck <b>they</b> built loses.|$|R

These parameters are used to produce the synthetic-panel estimates of yearly per-capita income.|$|R
5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E
5|$|Uru is {{a revolutionary}} {{adventure}} game {{that takes the}} best qualities of the Myst franchise and makes them even better. The single-player experience will eclipse the beauty, grandeur, and mind-challenging elements of previous titles. Plus, with the option to join a constantly updated online universe, the adventure never has to end. From new machines and puzzles to special events and entirely new Ages, players will find more to do, more to see, and more to explore <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> return—and this time, they can discover everything with old and new friends.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2009, at {{the closing}} {{performance}} of the show Yulong, a set of bleachers with a carrying capacity of 450 people and holding 420 at the time collapsed, sending seven people to the hospital. In the ensuing investigation, it came to light that Juventas had not had the bleachers inspected <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> were set up, as required by their lease with the city. They had been issued a permit in 2006 for the bleachers, and had not had them inspected since. The school was fined $500 and shut down until the legal and safety issues could be fully investigated. It reopened about a month later and installed new bleachers with molded plastic seats the next March.|$|E
5000|$|Singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam {{has stated}} that it took 23 takes to make the {{recording}} OK by Ilaiyaraja, because the guitarist was not getting it right with the pattern <b>each</b> <b>time</b> and <b>they</b> had to record {{it all the time}} from beginning.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason to}} {{experiment}} with mixing was rivalry among sound systems. Sound systems' sound men wanted the tracks they played at dances to be slightly different <b>each</b> <b>time,</b> so <b>they</b> would order numerous copies of the same record from a studio, each with a different mix.|$|R

5|$|Shiren the Wanderer was {{developed}} by Chunsoft for the Super Famicom, with the core concept of repeated play, with the player improving their equipment and items <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> play, making progress through several playthroughs. The developers noted that Shiren the Wanderer differed from other Mystery Dungeon titles in that the Chunsoft staff create characters themselves, allowing them to express the Mystery Dungeon series more fully than with the other titles, which are set in already created worlds which Chunsoft cannot change. The game {{was developed}} in parallel with the Game Boy game Shiren the Wanderer GB, which used modified source code from the Super Famicom game.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the roller}} coaster comes from the story of Hercules in Greek Mythology. According to the story, Hercules had to perform twelve labours. After {{defeating}} the Nemean lion for the first labour, the second was to defeat the Hydra, a nine-headed creature with eight serpentine heads that would regrow <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> were cut off, including one that was immortal. Dorney Park altered {{the remainder of the}} story- after Hercules managed to defeat the Hydra initially, he buried the immortal head stuck under a stone, with the intention of sealing it for all time. Years later however, the head slowly grew back, resurrecting the Hydra and taking its revenge on Hercules by killing him; hence why the Hydra roller coaster sits where Hercules once did.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which {{determine the number of}} times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|E
50|$|Automatic 401(k)s are {{designed}} to encourage high participation rates among employees. Therefore, employers can attempt to enroll non-participants as often as once per year, requiring those non-participants to opt out <b>each</b> <b>time</b> if <b>they</b> {{do not want to}} participate. Employers can also choose to escalate participants' default contribution rate, encouraging them to save more.|$|R

50|$|Pollution is {{exacerbated}} by several city facilities such as factories and oil refineries. On the flip side, some facilities such as recycling plants and nuclear reactors will reduce the production of pollution. Additionally, certain events such as space launches and {{use of nuclear weapons}} will result in one-time additions of pollution <b>each</b> <b>time</b> that <b>they</b> occur.|$|R
5|$|William Easton, an {{insurance}} executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed {{to heart disease}} after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo, {{where he and his}} janitor, Hank, awaken in vises designed to tighten around their torsos <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> breathe into oxygen masks strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath for long and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a hanging room, a steam room, and a shotgun aimed at seats of a carousel. It is shown that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.|$|E

25|$|Mario Kart Wiis Battle mode {{is similar}} to that seen in {{previous}} installments in which players drive around an enclosed arena and attack each other using items. The players are divided into two teams, red and blue, and teammates cannot harm each other with their items. There are two variants of Battle mode available: Balloon Battle and Coin Runners. In Balloon Battle, each player has balloons attached to his or her kart. A player gains a point <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> pop or steal a balloon belonging to an opposing team player, but loses a point <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> lose all balloons. In Coin Runners, the players collect coins scattered throughout the arena and attack opposing team members to make them drop coins. The team that has accumulated the most points or coins total when the three-minute time limit expires wins.|$|E
