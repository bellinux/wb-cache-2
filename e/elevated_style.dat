It was a traditional formula in an <b>elevated</b> <b>style</b> and used {{between two people}} (or two companies of many people) each going on a path that crosses that of the other: [...] "A star shines upon the hour of the meeting of our ways".|$|E
2500|$|Dante {{called the}} poem [...] "Comedy" [...] (the {{adjective}} [...] "Divine" [...] was added {{later in the}} 16th century) because poems {{in the ancient world}} were classified as High ("Tragedy") or Low ("Comedy"). Low poems had happy endings and were written in everyday language, whereas High poems treated more serious matters and were written in an <b>elevated</b> <b>style.</b> Dante {{was one of the first}} in the Middle Ages to write of a serious subject, the Redemption of humanity, in the low and [...] "vulgar" [...] Italian language and not the Latin one might expect for such a serious topic. Boccaccio's account that an early version of the poem was begun by Dante in Latin is still controversial.|$|E

As the industry and designs have expanded, the term [...] "athletic shoes" [...] is based more {{on the design of}} the bottom of the shoe than the aesthetics of the top of the shoe. Today's designs include sandals, Mary Janes, and even <b>elevated</b> <b>styles</b> suitable for running, dancing, and jumping.|$|R
5000|$|To the consternation of his colleague, Ernst Curtius, Auerbach's work {{is marked}} by an openly anti-rhetorical position. Classical writers such as Homer, Tacitus and Petronius, as well as Medieval theologians (except St. Augustine), and writers of the seventeenth century, like Racine, are criticized for {{adherence}} to the rhetorical doctrine of [...] "styles" [...] with their corresponding subject matters: the low style's association with the comedic and the popular classes, and the <b>elevated</b> <b>style's</b> association with the tragic, the historic and the heroic. Auerbach sees the Bible as opposing this rhetorical doctrine in its serious and poignant portrayals of common folk and their encounter with the divine. As Auerbach notes in chapter two when discussing the New Testament: ...|$|R
50|$|Arellius Fuscus (or Aurelius Fuscus) was {{an ancient}} Roman orator. He spoke with ease in both Latin and Greek, {{in an elegant}} and ornate style. Charles Thomas Cruttwell says Arelius was an Asiatic, that is, a {{practitioner}} of an <b>elevated</b> oratorical <b>style.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Astaire's {{execution}} of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality, and precision. He drew {{from a variety of}} influences, including tap and other black rhythms, classical dance, and the <b>elevated</b> <b>style</b> of Vernon and Irene Castle to create a uniquely recognizable dance style which greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged. He termed his eclectic approach his [...] "outlaw style," [...] an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry. His dances are economical yet endlessly nuanced. As Jerome Robbins stated, [...] "Astaire's dancing looks so simple, so disarming, so easy, yet the understructure, the way he sets the steps on, over or against the music, is so surprising and inventive." [...] Astaire further observed: ...|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{language}} of the translation also provoked widespread criticism. [...] It was not just demotic, but Psycharis' 'scientifically derived' demotic; and Pallis {{did not seem to}} realise that many of Psycharis' innovations, while perhaps charming and natural in the chatty reminiscences of My Journey, might seem out of place and even offensive {{in the context of a}} holy book. [...] Psycharis' rigid linguistic rules did not allow for a change of register to a more <b>elevated</b> <b>style.</b> [...] In fact, any such change was deprecated as contamination from katharevousa. [...] "Many readers were shocked by the sheer novelty of seeing a familiar text in the unfamiliar guise of a highly colloquial and sometimes idiosyncratic variety of their language. [...] Protestors objected, for example, to the rendering of 'Mount of Olives' by the folksy-sounding 'Ελαιοβούνι' instead of the original 'Ορος [...] των [...] Ελαιών'."

2500|$|The spoken {{language}} of the plays is not fundamentally different in style from that of Aeschylus or Sophoclesit employs poetic meters, a rarefied vocabulary, fullness of expression, complex syntax, and ornamental figures, all aimed at representing an <b>elevated</b> <b>style.</b> However, its rhythms are somewhat freer and more natural than that of his predecessors, and the vocabulary has been expanded to allow for intellectual and psychological subtleties. Euripides was also a great lyric poet. In Medea, for example, he composed for his city, Athens, [...] "the noblest of her songs of praise". His lyric skills however are not just confined to individual poems: [...] "A play of Euripides is a musical whole...one song echoes motifs from the preceding song, while introducing new ones." [...] For some critics, the lyrics often seem dislocated from the action but the extent and significance of this is [...] "a matter of scholarly debate". See Chronology for details about his style in the original Greek.|$|E

[...] Another critic includes negative critiques for the city of Dubai as well: [...] "both the hotel and the city, after all, are monuments to the triumph of money over practicality. Both <b>elevate</b> <b>style</b> over substance."

60|$|The reader {{must make}} himself {{acquainted with the}} general style of {{composition}} that {{was at that time}} deemed poetry, in order to understand and account for the effect produced on me by the Sonnets, the Monody at Matlock, and the Hope, of Mr. Bowles; for it is peculiar to original genius to become less and less striking, in proportion to its success in improving the taste and judgment of its contemporaries. The poems of West, indeed, had the merit of chaste and manly diction; but they were cold, and, if I may so express it, only dead-coloured; while in the best of Warton's there is a stiffness, which too often gives them the appearance of imitations from the Greek. Whatever relation, therefore, of cause or impulse Percy's collection of Ballads may bear to the most popular poems of the present day; yet in a more sustained and <b>elevated</b> <b>style,</b> of the then living poets, Cowper and Bowles [6] were, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, the first who combined natural thoughts with natural diction; the first who reconciled the heart with the head.|$|E

5000|$|Rondò texts usually employ an <b>elevated</b> rhetorical <b>style</b> and {{are almost}} always either laments of unhappy lovers or {{conventional}} calls to love.

6000|$|The {{slightest}} matters {{have their}} vulgarity fumigated {{out of them}} by the same <b>elevated</b> <b>style.</b> Commonplace {{people would say that}} a copy of Shakespeare lay on a drawing-room table; but the authoress of “The Enigma,” bent on edifying periphrasis, tells you that there lay on the table, “that fund of human thought and feeling, which teaches the heart through the little name, ‘Shakespeare.’” A watchman sees a light burning in an upper window rather longer than usual, and thinks that people are foolish to sit up late when they have an opportunity of going to bed; but, lest this fact should seem too low and common, it is presented to us in the following striking and metaphysical manner: “He marvelled—as a man will think for others in a necessarily separate personality, consequently (though disallowing it) in false mental premise—how differently he should act, how gladly he should prize the rest so lightly held of within.” A footman—an ordinary Jeames, with large calves and aspirated vowels—answers the door-bell, and the opportunity is seized to tell you that he was a “type of the large class of pampered menials, who follow the curse of Cain—‘vagabonds’ {{on the face of the}} earth, and whose estimate of the human class varies in the graduated scale of money and expenditure. [...] . These, and such as these, O England, be the false lights of thy morbid civilization!” We have heard of various “false lights,” from Dr. Cumming to Robert Owen, from Dr. Pusey to the Spirit-rappers, but we never before heard of the false light that emanates from plush and powder.|$|E

Later, he main passenger vessels used for these journeys were the Canadiana and, until 1929, the Americana, each of which could carry 3,000 passengers per trip. In 1896, the Ontario Southern Railway began to provide connection between the park and the mainline rail station at Ridgeway. This service consisted of a unique <b>elevated</b> monorail <b>style</b> train, and ran for only three summers, through 1898.|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas, 4th Duke of Leuchtenberg, {{was named}} as Duke of Leuchtenberg in the Russian Empire in 1890 by Alexander III of Russia, {{as they were}} by then members of the {{extended}} Russian Imperial Family. This creation <b>elevated</b> the <b>style</b> from Serene to Imperial Highness, and was to be carried by all male line descendants of Nicholas born of marriages of corresponding rank, of the incumbent Duke from 1852 to 1891.

5000|$|Carlyle expresses {{his ideas}} about the Condition of England {{question}} in an <b>elevated</b> rhetorical <b>style</b> invoking classical allusions (such as Midas and the Sphinx) and fictional caricatures (such as Bobus and Sir Jabesh Windbag). Carlyle complains that despite England's abundant resources, the poor are starving and unable to find meaningful work, as evinced by the Manchester Insurrection. Carlyle argues that the ruling class needs to guide the nation, and supports an [...] "Aristocracy of Talent." [...] But in line with his concept of [...] "hero-worship", Carlyle argues that first the English must themselves become heroic in order to esteem true heroes rather than quacks.|$|R
50|$|King Frederick VI didn't {{have any}} sons, so {{it became clear}} that the Danish throne would be {{inherited}} by Julianes oldest brother Prince Christian.

50|$|In {{classical}} rhetoric, magnificence {{is one of}} {{the models}} of the grand or <b>elevated</b> <b>style.</b> However the most important work on magnificence in the classical world is On Style (Perì hermēnēías) written by Demetrius of Phalerum probably in the first century B.C. Demetrius gives a technical description of the typical features of the <b>elevated</b> <b>style.</b> The historian Thucydides and the poet Sappho are presented as the leading exponents of this style. Demetrius’s treatise did not gain the same success as Longinus’s On the Sublime. Although magnificence and the sublime both belong to the grand style, there are significant differences between them. Magnificence insists more on formal correctness and stylistic solemnity. Whereas the sublime inspires awe, veneration, loss of rationality, ecstasy and pathos, the magnificent aims to impress without causing fear or indignation.|$|E
50|$|In this striving {{after an}} ornate and <b>elevated</b> <b>style</b> the {{adoption}} of a species of composition, that had raised pulpit oratory above the language of everyday life, seems to be a natural result, and thus rhymed prose became the essential feature not only of official writing, but also of the private correspondence of the learned and the cultured.|$|E

2500|$|The glide step, also {{commonly}} known as the roll step, involves bringing the heel gently to the ground with the toe pointed up, and then rolling forward onto the toes before lifting the foot to continue forward. [...] While marching to the rear, the weight is placed continually on the ball of the foot with the heel <b>elevated.</b> This <b>style</b> is used by both marching bands as well as drum and bugle corps. [...] The style, in comparison to high step, gives drill formations a more fluid appearance, allowing for better control of more difficult formations and various styles of music. With this control also comes the ability to perform a much broader range of tempos. Proper execution of a roll step gives a player marching at 40 beats per minute the same smooth tone as a player marching at 180. The roll step allows for much better control of the upper body, and thus better control of the air support needed for playing.|$|R
