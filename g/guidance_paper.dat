The purpose of this legislation was to prevent financial exchanges from being used to launder money or finance crime, including terrorism. [...] The European Central Bank has also recommended registering exchanges to “reduce the incentive for terrorists, criminals and money launderers to make use of these virtual currency schemes for illegal purposes.”In spite of the BSA applying to VC exchanges and administrators, VC is still used to finance crime and launder money because not every transaction in VC networks are required to comply with the BSA and not every online exchange complies with the BSA. In September 2014, Robert M. Faiella, a/k/a “BTCKing,” pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed exchange that exchanged over a million in cash for Bitcoin, used for criminal enterprise and known as “Silk Road.” [...] In spite of the BSA regulations, Faiella and the users of his exchange, were able to hide their identity through both pseudonymous Bitcoin addresses and an anonymous network that hid their I.P. addresses.|$|E

5000|$|The first plan, {{following}} the White House policy guidance, {{was developed in}} 1960, consisting of a list of targets (the National Strategic Target List, or NSTL) and the assets to be used against each target. The targets themselves were pulled from the Bombing Encyclopedia, which listed over 80,000 targets of interest. This first SIOP was extensively revised by a team at the RAND Corporation to become SIOP-62, describing a massive strike with the entire US arsenal of 3,200 warheads, totaling 7847 megatons, against the USSR, China, and Soviet-aligned states with urban and other targets being hit simultaneously. 9 weapons were to be [...] "laid down" [...] on 4 targets in Leningrad, 23 weapons on 6 target complexes in Moscow, 18 on 7 target areas in Kaliningrad, etc. Weapon scientist, George Rathjens, looked through SAC's atlas of Soviet cities, searching for the town that most closely resembled Hiroshima in size and industrial concentration. When he found one that roughly matched, he asked how many bombs the SIOP [...] "laid down" [...] on that city. The reply: one 4.5 megaton bomb and three more 1.1 megaton weapons in case the big bomb was a dud (the Hiroshima bomb was 12.5 kilotons). The execution of SIOP-62 was estimated to result in 285 million dead and 40 million casualties in the Soviet Union and China. Presented with all the facts and figures, Thomas D. White of the Air Force found the Plan [...] "splendid." [...] Disregarding the human aspect, SIOP-62 represented an outstanding technological achievement: SIOP-62 represented a technical triumph {{in the history of}} war planning. In less than fifteen years the United States had mastered a variety of complex technologies and acquired the ability to destroy most of an enemy's military capability and much of the human habitation of a continent in a single day. The first SIOP, based on the massive retaliation doctrine, had little flexibility, treating all Communist countries as a uniform bloc. Document JCS 2056/220 expressed the concerns of U.S. Marine Commandant David Shoup that the 1961 draft was inconsistent with an 1959 NSC policy <b>guidance</b> <b>paper</b> approved by Eisenhower. Shoup was especially concerned with language in the draft SIOP that said The United States should utilize all requisite force against selected targets in the USSR—and as necessary in Communist China, European Bloc and non-European bloc countries—to attain the above objectives. Military targets in Bloc countries other than the USSR and Communist China will be attacked as necessary.|$|E

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} of this systematic review is to investigate the use of Bayesian data analysis in epidemiology {{in the past decade}} and particularly to evaluate the quality of research papers reporting the results of these analyses. Study Design and Setting Complete volumes of five major epidemiological journals in the period 2005 – 2015 were searched via PubMed. In addition, we performed an extensive within-manuscript search using a specialized Java application. Details of reporting on Bayesian statistics were examined in the original research papers with primary Bayesian data analyses. Results The number of studies in which Bayesian techniques were used for primary data analysis remains constant over the years. Though many authors presented thorough descriptions of the analyses they performed and the results they obtained, several reports presented incomplete method sections and even some incomplete result sections. Especially, information on the process of prior elicitation, specification, and evaluation was often lacking. Conclusion Though available <b>guidance</b> <b>papers</b> concerned with reporting of Bayesian analyses emphasize the importance of transparent prior specification, the results obtained in this systematic review show that these <b>guidance</b> <b>papers</b> are often not used. Additional efforts should be made to increase the awareness of the existence and importance of these checklists to overcome the controversy with respect to the use of Bayesian techniques. The reporting quality in epidemiological literature could be improved by updating existing guidelines on the reporting of frequentist analyses to address issues that are important for Bayesian data analyse...|$|R

40|$|The European {{debate on}} abuse of {{dominance}} issues in antitrust has been recently {{characterized by an}} emphasis on purely economic aspects, and by an emerging consensus {{on the merits of}} taking an “effects-based approach” aimed at the maximization of consumer welfare and the protection of competition. The European Commission has recently issued a <b>Guidance</b> <b>Paper</b> on exclusionary abuses which purports to move EU enforcement on abuse of dominance in this direction. In spite of these developments, we are still far from reaching any consensus on the best way to apply competition policy to specific issues such as predatory pricing, bundling, vertical restraints, exclusive dealing and so on. We analyze the genesis of the European approach to antitrust and discuss the leading economic theories on competition policy and abuse of dominance, as developed by the Chicago School, the post-Chicago approach and the endogenous market structures approach. Finally, we use these economic foundations to analyze the EU approach to abuse of dominance, we examine the <b>Guidance</b> <b>Paper,</b> we provide a comparison with the American approach, and we discuss the implications of some recent important cases. ...|$|E
