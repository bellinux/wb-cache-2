40|$|The {{author has}} studied the {{influence}} of acetylcholine solutions directly applied on the motor cortex of dogs, cats monkeys and rabbits. For this purpose small squares of filter paper were soaked in the acetylcholine solution and soon afterwards laid on the motor cortex. Solutions varying from 0, 2 to 10 per cent have been experimented. It {{has been shown that}} local application of the solutions on the motor points, previously localized by induction coil, produced motor reactions. It has been found, in the dogs that 10 per cent acetylcholine solutions cause localized muscular twitchings (clonus) in almost all the animals experimented. Generalised <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions</b> were obtained in 44, 4 % of the dogs. Convulsions were also obtained by employing 1 per cent solution of acetylcholine. Definite response has been obtained with 0, 2 per cent solution. Failure of motor action, pointed out by other authors, has been related to the use of anesthetics. Convulsions were easily produced by rapid light mechanical stimulations of the skin covering the muscles in conection with the excited motor point, and the application on the motor point of acetylcholine. The results on monkeys can be summarized as follows. Two species of monkeys were experimented: Cebus capucinus and Macaca mulata. In the monkeys C. capucinus generalised convulsive reactions were induced with actylcholine solutions in a concentration as low as 0, 5 per cent. Motor reaction or convulsive seizeres were obtained in seven of the eight monkeys used. Three monkeys M. mulata were stimulated with 10 per cent acetylcholine solution but only localized muscular contraction hae been observed. Similar results has been obtained on the motor cortex of cats and rabbits. One of the three cats employed has shown <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions</b> and the remaining only localized muscular contractions. In the rabbits muscular twitchings have been also induced. The sensitizing power of eserine on the action of acetylcholine has been also searched. The results indicate that a previous application of eserine solution on the motor center, potentiates the action of acetylcholine. The intensity of the muscular twitchings is greater than the obtained before the application of the eserine solution. Generalised <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions</b> sometimes appeared following the use of lower concentrations of acetylcholine than those previously employed. Experiments have been carried out by injecting eserine and prostigmine by parenteral route. A dosis dufficient for induce small muscular tremors did not enhance obviously the motor effects produced by the application of the acetylcholine solutions on the motor cortex. From seven dogs experimented, all previously tested for convulsive seiruzes by application of 1 and 10 per cent acetylcholine solution with negative results, only one has shown <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions</b> after the injection of prostigmine. Morphine has also been tested as facilitating substance for convulsions induced by acetylcholine. Six from the nine dogs submitted to the experiments, developed epileptiform seizures after injection of morphine and stimulation of the motor cortex with acetylcholine. (Table IV). In another series of experiments atropine and nicotine have been studied as for to their action on the motor effects of acetylcholine. Nicotine has a strong convulsant action, even when employed in very high concentration. Since a depressant effect has not appeared even by the applications of high concentrations of nicotine in the motor corteõ of dogs, unlike the classical observations for the autonomus nervous system, {{it was not possible to}} verify the action of acetylcholine on a motor center paralised by nicotine. It is important to not that the motor phenomena observed after the first aplication of acetylcholine, can desappear by the renewal of the pieces of filter paper soaked in the acetylcholine solution. Atropine, either applied on the motor point in low concentration, or injected in sufficient amount for inhibiting the “muscarinic effects” of acetylcholine on the autonomous nervous system, did not prevent the motor reactions of acetylcholine on the cerebral cortex...|$|R

Chronic exposure of rats to the closely relatedepoxide, dieldrin, {{has been suggested}} to reduce their muscular efficiency in performing a work exercise. Dieldrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide widely used in crop protection andpreservation. Among the diverse symptoms resulting from intoxication are muscular twitching increasing in severity to <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions</b> with loss of consciousness. Strychnine,which has a spinal locus of activity, causes tonic hind limb extension in mice, which {{is thought to be}} due to a removal of the effect of inhibitory interneurons on the nervouspathway to extensor muscles. Leptazol, on the other hand, produces a similar tonic extension by an excitatory action predominantly on cerebral structures. Diphenylhydantoin selectively elevated the threshold convulsive dose of leptazol but not that of strychnine hydrochloride, indicating an anticonvulsant activity on the nervous pathway between the predominant locus of activity of leptazol and the hind limbs.|$|R

Accidental electric shocks have caused severe injuries to the spine and limbs, but with electro-convulsive therapy the passage of the current is briefer, the voltage is lower, the amperage is less {{and the size of the}} terminals is smaller.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The {{concentration}} of H 2 S in groundwater {{is a significant}} problem in various areas across Canada. Hydrogen sulphide dissolves in ground water imparting undesirable taste and irritating rotten egg smell which makes it unpalatable. Ingestion of sulphides through drinking water can result in stomach discomfort, nausea and vomiting. Humans exposed to high concentrations of H 2 S for prolonged periods show symptoms of gastro-intestinal upset, anorexia, nausea, somnolence, amnesia, loss of consciousness, delirium, hallucinations, difficulty in swallowing, low blood pressure, slowing of heart rate, double vision and <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions.</b> Hydrogen sulphide in blood is rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen and thus reduces the oxidation power of haemoglobin. Unoxidized hydrogen sulphide can act upon {{the central nervous system}} and cause either paralysis or respiratory failure. It is therefore, necessary to have a very low {{concentration of}} H 2 S in the water. Approach: An automatic system for the addition of KMnO 4 and removal of hydrogen sulphide from ground water was developed and tested. The system consisted of a freshwater tank, a pump, a chemical storage tank, a solenoid valve, a photocell and electronic circuit, a drainage tank, a filter and a set of valves.

40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} with {{acute renal failure}} of diverse aetiology showed myoglobinuria and elevated levels of serum creatine phosphokinase (mean 119 · 2 Sigma u. /ml) and adolase (mean 88 · 5 Sibley-Lehninger (SL) u. /ml), indicating the presence of diffuse muscle cell injury. The primary conditions which led to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure were burns, eclampsia, prolonged labour, crush injury, <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions,</b> status asthmaticus, viral myositis and intoxication with chemicals including copper sulphate, mercuric chloride and zinc phosphide. In 10 non-myoglobinuric {{patients with}} acute renal failure, serum creatine phosphokinase was normal (mean 8 · 9 Sigma u. /ml) and serum aldolase was only slightly elevated (mean 11 · 2 SL u. /ml). Although uric acid was elevated in both groups, the values were significantly higher in myoglobinuric (mean 0 · 728 ± 0 · 199 mmol/l) compared to non-myoglobinuric patients (mean 0 · 583 ± 0 · 093 mmol/l). During the oliguric phase, hypocalcaemia was observed in 82 · 2 % of myoglobinuric patients and in 20 % of non-myoglobinuric patients.

40|$|A case of {{congenital}} anieurysmal defect of the ventricular septumi {{is reported}} {{which appears to}} be unique in that this lesion was the only significant finding at autopsy. The patient had evidence of auriculoventricular block for a period of 26 years, at first partial and then complete. She succumbed at the age of 47 to a series of Adams-Stokes attacks which were demonstrated to be set off by parox-ysmal ventricular flutter followed byr ventricular tachy (caridia and ventricular standstill. Pertinent literature is briefly reviewed. T HE FOLLOWING case is conisidered worthy of recording since it appears to be the only one which we can find on record where an aneurysmal defect of the ventricular septum was the sole significant anatomic lesion found at autopsy. It demon-strates that ventricular flutter, unsuspected without cardiographic evidence, may precipi-tate the Adams-Stokes type of syncope. PREVIOUS LITERATURE Aneurysm of the Ventricular Septum. Because of its presumed lack of clinical significance, little has been written on the subject of anetu-rysm of the ventricular septum.

40|$|SINCE von Meduna 1 first {{reported}} {{his success in}} the treatment of schizo-phrenia by the induction of convulsions with metrazol, his method has en-joyed considerable popularity, and has been employed in many hundreds of cases. His method consists essentially in the repeated (three times weekly) in-duction of severe <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions</b> of a specific type by the rapid intravenous injection of large doses of metrazol (pentamethylenetetrazol, formerly known as cardiazol), in a 10 per cent aqueous solution. The ini-tial dose usually employed is 3 to 5 c. c. and it is usually increased progres-sively so that convulsions are regularly obtained—until a course of treatment producing 20 to 30 convulsions has been administered. Such a schedule at times necessitates pushing up the individual injection dose to amounts as high as 25 c. c, and it is quite usual for doses of 12 to 15 c. c. to be reached in the average case. In view of the original introduction and use of this drug as a cardio-respiratory stimulant (as the name cardiazol implied), and then generally only in doses of 1 to 2 c. c. administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, {{it is not surprising that}} we frequently hear expressed concern about the pos-sible danger to the heart of employing such massive doses intravenously. The purpose of this paper is to supply a definite answer to this question. A priori one might assume that there are no significant dangers to the cardiovascular system inherent in the metrazol treatment because in the nu-merous cases treated no serious cardiovascular complications have been reported. The solitary instance of cardiac death reported in the literature (L. von Angyal and K. Gyarfas 2 obviously should not be attributed to the therapy but to improper case selection: A female patient, aged 31, was given her second injection, 0. 7 gm. of metrazol and did not have a seizure; however, one-half hour later she suddenly col-lapsed and died.

Conclusion: The photocell and circuit could be used to add an amount of chemical that is constantly proportional to the amount of hydrogen sulphide in the water.

The speed of the pump could be controlled in such a manner that would allow a very small excess amount of potassium permanganate to be maintained in the system...|$|R
5000|$|Santonin was {{an agent}} which (compared to more modern anthelminthic drugs) was very {{complicated}} {{to use and}} entailed rather serious risk to the patient. Nearly every formulary and herbal which lists santonin or santonin-containing plants lists the real risk of yellow vision and of fatal reactions; even small doses of santonin cause disturbances of vision, usually yellow vision or perhaps green (xanthopsia or chromatopsia). Even the Encyclopædia Britannica noted:...These effects usually pass off in a few days. Large doses, however, produce toxic effects, aphasia, muscular tremors and <b>epileptiform</b> <b>convulsions,</b> and the disturbances of vision may go on to total blindness.More typical is the warning given regarding side effects of santonin in King's American Dispensatory:Santonin is an active agent, and, in improper doses, is capable of producing serious symptoms, and even death. As small a dose as 2 grains {{is said to have}} killed a weakly child of 5 years, and 5 grains produced death in about 1/2 hour in a child of the same age. Among the toxic effects may be mentioned gastric pain, pallor and coldness of the surface, followed by heat and injection of the head, tremors, dizziness, pupillary dilatation, twitching of the eyes, stertor, copious sweating, hematuria, convulsive movements, tetanic cramps stupor, and insensibility. Occasionally symptoms resembling cholera morbus have been produced, and in all cases the urine presents a characteristic yellowish or greenish-yellow hue. We have observed convulsions caused by the administration of [...] "worm lozenges." [...] Death from santonin is due to respiratory paralysis, and post-mortem examination revealed in one instance a contracted and empty right ventricle, and about an ounce of liquid, black blood in the left heart, an inflamed duodenum, and inflamed patches in the stomach (Kilner).[...] [...]Santonin often produces a singular effect upon the vision, causing surrounding objects to appear discolored, as if they were yellow or green, and occasionally blue or red; it also imparts a yellow or green color to the urine, and a reddish-purple color if that fluid be alkaline. Prof. Giovanni was led to believe that the apparent yellow color of objects observed by the eye, when under the influence of santonin, did not depend upon an elective action on the optic nerves, but rather to the yellow color which the drug itself takes when exposed to the air. Santonin colored by the air does not produce this effect, which only follows the white article. The air gives the yellow color to santonin, to passed urine containing it, and to the serum of the blood when drawn from a vein, and, according to Giovanni, it is owing to its direct action upon the aqueous humor, where it is carried by absorption, that objects present this color. The view now held, however, is that of Rose, that the alkaline serum dissolves the santonin, which then acts upon the perspective centers of the brain, producing the chromatopsia or xanthopsia.At least one modern herbal has also noted these same severe side effects of santonin.|$|R
40|$|Despite of {{established}} and effective therapy for epilepsy, 20 – 25 % patients develop therapeutic failure; this encourages finding newer drugs. Novel approaches target receptors which remain unaffected by conventional therapy or inhibit epileptogenesis. AMPA receptor antagonists have shown faster and complete protection compared to diazepam. Protein kinase (PK) {{plays an important}} role in the development of epilepsy. PK inhibitors such as K 252 a, VID- 82925, and Herbimycin A have been found effective in inhibition of spread of epileptiform activity and epileptogenesis. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G protein-coupled receptors classified into three groups. Group 1 mGluRs antagonist and Groups 2 and 3 mGluRs agonists inhibited pentylenetetrazole-induced kindled seizures. Combined use of these agents has also shown favorable results. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a central role in multiple mechanisms of epileptogenesis. mTOR causes transcription, induction of proapoptotic proteins, and autophagy inhibition. Rapamycin was effective in suppression of recurrent seizures as well as in tuberous sclerosis and acute brain injury model. 5 % CO 2 showed potent effects on cortical <b>epileptiform</b> activity and <b>convulsions</b> in animal epilepsy models and in humans with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. It is found to be rapidly acting, safe and cheap, thus it can be a good option in emergency for suppression of seizure. Neurosteroids are considered as fourth generation neuromessengers, they act as positive allosteric modulators of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors.

40|$|Detailed neuro-histopathological {{investigations}} were performed, being grounded on {{the general}} point of view, on thirty-one naturally occurring cases gathered during the years 1948 to 1957,of a swine disease in Janan, so-called "encephalitis eosinophilica suis. " The cardinal symptoms of it consist of circular movement, <b>convulsions,</b> <b>epileptiform</b> seizures, etc. Histopathological lesions of the disease in {{the central nervous system}} are chracterized by various processes consisting of nerve cells diffusely extending over all areas of the brain and spinal cord, mainly pseudolaminar focal necroses (pallidness or focal pallor to malacia) principally being located in the grey matter of the prosencephalon especially in the cerebral cortex and perivascular and tissue infiltration of eosinophil leucocytes principally observed in the cortex and meninges of the telencephalon. The focal necroses, furthermore, are occasionally located in the grey matter such as in the cerebral nuclei, diencephalon, mesencephalon and medulla oblongata. Histo-pathogenetically, a great importance is attached to the fact that most basic pathological processes in the central nervous system of the disease may possibly have much connection with a certain toxic condition originating from systemic metabolic disturbances of fat substances of certain kinds. Such disturbances were proved by the degenerative condition of nerve cells (acute cell change), metamorphosis of fat tissues belonging to the category of changes of "yellow fat disease, " degeneration in the parenchymatous organs and deposition of acid-fast pigment substances detected in the central nervous system, etc. It was confirmed that the necrotic-desolated processes of the central nervous system offer much evidence that they had origin in local functional disturbances of the blood circulation (SPIELMYER); such changes were regarded as secondary ones. There is no wholly denying the surmise that the acid-fast pigment substances which were regarded as an abnormal product of metabolism of fat substances of a certain kind may take part in the functional disturbances. It is conceivable, in conformity with histological findings, that these acid-fast substances may have various chemical states ranging morphologically from non-phanerous to phanerous, the latter showing acid-fastness for the most part. With the exception of reparative symptomatic inflammatory infiltration into the necrotic-desolated processes, as to eosinophil cell infiltration which was recognized in almost all the cases, {{the author would like to}} comprehend it as likely manifestation of the function of the cells which acceleratedly act to counteract to the abnormal pigment substances; in other words, such infiltration is a phenomenon which belongs to a simple reactive process of the body. With the exception of glio-mesenchymal reactive process to the necroticdesolated lesions, mesenchymal changes consisting of swelling, increase, etc. of cells of the walls of the blood vessels, being observed particularly in the grey matter and meninges of the prosencephalon, were regarded as changes reactive to the disorder of the tissue and the abnormal metabolic substances. Edematous focal tissue loosening of various degrees observed frequently in the cerebral cortex are considered to be a secondary process having to do with hyperemia and fibrin thromboses of the blood vessels principally of the veins. As to the causal genesis of the present disease, "yellow fat disease" of various creatures and encephalomalacia of chicks are referred to as interesting objects from the morphological standpoint. A certain swine disease in Europe and America, having a name similar to that of the present disease, is clinically and morphologically similar, if not identical, to the present disease...|$|R
