40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is {{frequently}} found as a contaminant in raw and ready-to-eat foods. The ability of L. monocytogenes to multiply at refrigeration temperatures and {{to grow in}} a wide range of pH values is of particular concern for food safety. According to the European Union regulation on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs, L. monocytogenes must be absent in some categories of ready-to-eat foods. The standard microbiological method for L. monocytogenes detection in foods (ISO 11290 - 1 : 1996 (ISO, International Organization for Standardization)) is cost and time consuming. Developments of rapid, cost-effective and automated diagnostic methods to detect food-borne pathogens in foods continue to be a major concern for the industry and public health. The aim of this study was the development of a rapid, sensitive and specific molecular detection method for L. monocytogenes. To this purpose, we have applied a capillary electrophoresis method to a PCR protocol (PCR-EES (EES, experion automated <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>system))</b> for detecting L. monocytogenes in food. In particular, a microfluidic chip-based automated <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>system</b> (experion automated <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>system,</b> Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) was used for the rapid and automatic analysis of the amplicons. Fifty naturally contaminated samples were analysed with this method and the results were compared with those obtained with ISO method.

The results showed that after 24 h of culture enrichment, the PCR-EES showed a relative accuracy of 100 % with ISO, while using PCR-CGE decreased it down to 96 %. After 48 h of enrichment, both PCR-EES and PCR-CGE showed an accuracy of 100 % with ISO...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Currently, most {{laboratories}} identify yeasts routinely on {{the basis}} of morphology and biochemical reactivity. This approach has quite often limited discriminatory power and may require long incubation periods. Due to the increase of fungal infections and due to specific antifungal resistence patterns for different species, accurate and rapid identification has become more important. Several molecular techniques have been described for fast and reliable identification of yeast isolates, but interlaboratory exchangeability of identification schemes of molecular techniques has hardly been studied. Here, we compared amplified ITS 2 fragment length determination by an ABI Prism 310 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Ca.) capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>system</b> with that obtained by a CEQ 8000 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Ca.) capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>system.</b> Results Although ITS 2 size estimations on both systems differed and separate libraries had to be constructed for each system, both approaches had the same discriminatory power with regard to the 44 reference strains, identical identifications were obtained for 39 / 40 clinical isolates in both laboratories and strains from 51 samples were correctly identified using CEQ 8000, when compared to phenotypic identification. Conclusion Identification of yeasts with ITS 2 -PCR followed by fragment analysis can be carried out on different capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>systems</b> with comparable discriminatory power. </p...|$|R
