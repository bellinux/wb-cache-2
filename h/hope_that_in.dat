25|$|Spedan Lewis also {{retained}} {{for himself}} {{the right to}} choose his successor when he retired on his 70th birthday in 1955. He had originally intended that Michael Watkins, his right-hand man for many years, would succeed him as chairman, but Watkins died in 1950. Spedan asked his son, Edward Lewis, if he would fill the role but he declined. Spedan appointed a loyal, long-serving lieutenant, Bernard Miller, but expressed the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> due course Edward would succeed Miller as chairman. In the event, Miller was succeeded by Peter Lewis, the son of Oswald Lewis.|$|E
25|$|The Sultan {{also ordered}} his vassal Muhammad Ali not to {{withdraw}} his army from the Peloponnese. But the Allies despatched envoys to Alexandria {{to demand that}} the Egyptian prince do precisely that. This left Muhammad Ali in a dilemma. On the one hand, as an experienced statesman, he knew that with the Great Powers backing Greek autonomy, the game {{was up in the}} Peloponnese. On the other, he was reluctant to be seen as betraying his overlord, especially now that he had declared jihad, and also to inflict on his son Ibrahim the humiliation of a forced withdrawal. So he played for time, engaging the Allies in lengthy but inconclusive negotiations, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the meantime the Sultan would himself reach an agreement with the Allies that would permit Ibrahim a face-saving departure.|$|E
500|$|Harrison found {{frustration}} in this {{next phase of}} the Bangladesh project, as the various record companies associated with the concerts' performers attempted {{to profit from the}} forthcoming release. Chief among these was the Beatles' US distributor, Capitol Records, who delayed issuing the album in the hope of negotiating a royalty rate to cover what they perceived as high distribution costs for the boxed three-record set. Harrison was resolute that Capitol should absorb the costs, just as the Beatles' Apple record label had already paid for the album's lavish packaging and full-colour booklet. All those involved with the concerts and post-production on the live album had given their services for free, in keeping with Harrison's <b>hope</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> Tillery's words: [...] "Every penny of income – from the gate receipts to the profits from an album and a film – would go toward alleviating the suffering." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another effort {{involves}} {{a program designed}} to manage wild copal supplies in a municipality called San Juan Bautista Jayacatlán. This arrangement has economic advantages for both the alebrije-makers and the owners of the forests where the wood is produced. It has not been developed sufficiently yet to affect the illegal harvest of wood, but its organizers <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> time, it will become the more economical and preferred method. The difference between this program and others is that this works within the broader ethnobotanical context by promoting the management of the species within its native habitat. Jayacatlán is located next to the recently established biosphere reserve of Tehhuacán-Cuicatlán. The benefit to Jayacatlán is to give the municipality a way to exploit its copal supplies and preserve its biodiversity at the same time. The benefit to carvers is to promote a reliable source of wood, as well as a trademark called “ecoalebrijes” to help them sell more alebrijes at a higher price. [...] However, the wood from Jayacatlan is only sold to Arrazola and not to the other major center of Tilcajete. The enthusiasm of Arrazola’s woodcarvers stems more from having a supply of good wood than from notions of ecology.|$|E
2500|$|In Jacques Derrida's response, [...] "Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious," [...] first {{published}} in Le Monde, Derrida writes that the Sokal hoax is rather [...] "sad," [...] not only because Alan Sokal's name is now linked primarily to a hoax, not to science, {{but also because the}} chance to reflect seriously on this issue has been ruined for a broad public forum that deserves better. Derrida reminds his readers that science and philosophy have long debated their likenesses and differences in the discipline of epistemology, but certainly not with such an emphasis on the nationality of the philosophers or scientists. He calls it ridiculous and weird that there are intensities of treatment by the scientists, in particular, that he was [...] "much less badly treated," [...] when in fact he was the main target of the US press. Derrida then proceeds to question the validity of their attacks against a few words he made in an off-the-cuff response during a conference that took place thirty years prior to their publication. He suggests there are plenty of scientists who have pointed out the difficulty of attacking his response. He also writes that there is no [...] "relativism" [...] or a critique of Reason and the Enlightenment in his works. He then writes of his <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the future this work is pursued more seriously and with dignity {{at the level of the}} issues involved.|$|E
2500|$|Ibárruri {{offered a}} string of speeches, some of them radio {{broadcasts}} from Madrid: [...] "Danger! To arms!" [...] (July 19), [...] "Our fighters must lack for nothing!"

[...] (September 3), [...] "A salute to our militiawomen on the front line" [...] (September 4), [...] "Our battle cry has been heard by the whole world" [...] (September 15). It can be inferred that the majority in Madrid rallied {{to the side of the}} Republic, that uncontrolled elements roamed the capital that many rounds of gunfire were wasted out of nerves (July 29), that Nationalist propaganda was more effective (July 30) and that she understood early on that the war would be lost without foreign aid (August 24). On October 2 she wrote a revealing letter to her son in Russia, apologizing for not having written earlier and described the harrowing situation, [...] "You cannot even imagine, my son, how savage is the struggle going on in Spain now...Fighting is going on daily and round the clock. And in this fighting some of our finest and bravest comrades have perished."

Ay, no man, I say, ever <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> vain.

2500|$|Prior to World War I, Emden was {{operating}} {{as part of}} the German East Asia Squadron. Shortly after the war began, the threat of the Australian battlecruiser , plus the likelihood that Japan would join the Allies, prompted the German squadron to head into the Pacific Ocean, as the first stage of a retreat to Germany. Unlike the rest of the force, Emden, on von Müller's suggestion, was ordered to head into the Indian Ocean and commence a raiding campaign, as she was the most modern vessel in the East Asia Squadron. Over the next two months, the German ship captured or sank 25 civilian vessels, shelled Madras, and destroyed the Russian protected cruiser [...] and French destroyer Mousquet at Penang. During these two months, none of Emdens personnel were killed. At some point during the deployment, a fake fourth funnel was erected to disguise Emden as a British cruiser, specifically [...] Military historian George Odgers described Emdens activities as [...] "one of the most daring careers of maritime destruction in naval history". Aware of the increasing efforts to find his ship, von Müller selected the wireless station at Direction Island as his next target, with the <b>hope</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> addition to hampering communications between Australia and the United Kingdom, disabling it would frustrate efforts to coordinate the search for Emden (which by this point included sixteen warships from five Allied nations), and direct them away from the Aden-India shipping route, which was where he intended Emden to operate next. She was being supported by Buresk, a British collier that had been captured on 27 September. Although operating independently at the time under a prize crew, Emden had arranged to transmit a signal summoning the collier to the Cocos Islands, allowing the cruiser to refuel before heading west.|$|E
