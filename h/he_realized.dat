5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. <b>He</b> <b>realized</b> very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|About {{ten minutes}} after the surrender, Pritchard heard rapid gunfire to the north. He left Davis and the {{captured}} men {{in the hands of}} his 21-year-old adjutant.

Pritchard immediately ordered his men to stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded.|$|E
5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial problems. As {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game, but the only option for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up the idea for a while. Howse finally created the game when <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these services would incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1976, Bob Lewis, an {{environmental}} activist in Aspen, organized revegetation efforts on some {{sections of the}} pass near the road that were having serious erosion problems. <b>He</b> <b>realized</b> eventually that a dedicated nonprofit organization {{would be a better}} way to address the many issues that remained. The Independence Pass Foundation (IPF) was established in 1989. Its first project, coordinated with the Forest Service, CDOT and Pitkin County, was the reconstruction of a curve near the popular Weller Lake trailhead.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, and <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's idea {{was to keep the}} Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{he took a}} {{leave of}} absence from The Tennessean to attend Vanderbilt University Law School. His {{decision}} to become an attorney was a partial result of his time as a journalist, as <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that, while he could expose corruption, he could not change it.
