5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same <b>glass</b> <b>rod,</b> it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the <b>glass</b> <b>rod,</b> and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E

These were then cut in cross-section, and the resulting discs could be fused together to create complex patterns. Alternately, two strips of contrasting-coloured glass could be fused together, and then wound round a <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> whilst still hot to produce a spiral pattern. Cross-sections of this were also cut, and could be {{fused together to form}} a plate or fused to plain glass.|$|E
5000|$|This {{experiment}} introduces {{students to}} the concept of an index of refraction in a liquid. <b>Glass</b> <b>rods</b> are placed in beakers of liquid, in this case oil and water. In water, the <b>glass</b> <b>rods</b> are visible because the refractive index of water is different for water and glass. In the oil, however, the <b>glass</b> <b>rods</b> seem to disappear because they have a refractive index very similar to that of glass, so the light doesn't bend as it crosses the glass/oil interface.|$|R

2500|$|In 1600, the English {{scientist}} William Gilbert {{returned to}} the subject in De Magnete, and coined the New Latin word electricus from [...] (ēlektron), the Greek word for amber, which soon {{gave rise to the}} English words [...] "electric" [...] and [...] "electricity". He was followed in 1660 by Otto von Guericke, who invented what was probably the first electrostatic generator. Other European pioneers were Robert Boyle, who in 1675 stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum; Stephen Gray, who in 1729 classified materials as conductors and insulators; and C. F. du Fay, who proposed in 1733 that electricity comes in two varieties that cancel each other, and expressed this in terms of a two-fluid theory. When glass was rubbed with silk, du Fay said that the glass was charged with vitreous electricity, and, when amber was rubbed with fur, the amber was charged with resinous electricity. In 1839, Michael Faraday showed that the apparent division between static electricity, current electricity, and bioelectricity was incorrect, and all were a consequence of the behavior of a single kind of electricity appearing in opposite polarities. It is arbitrary which polarity is called positive and which is called negative. Positive charge can be defined as the charge left on a <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> after being rubbed with silk.|$|E

An apparatus was therefore constructed (Plate III. fig. 46.), in which AB is an insulated <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> upon which two copper wires, C, D, are fixed firmly; to these wires are soldered two pieces of fine platina wire, the ends of which are brought very {{close to each other}} at e, but without touching; the copper wire C was connected with the positive pole of a voltaic battery, and the wire D with a decomposing apparatus (312. 316.), from which the communication was completed to the negative pole of the battery. In these experiments only two troughs, or twenty pairs of plates, were used.|$|E

It may be supposed, {{that the}} oxygen and {{hydrogen}} had been evolved in such small quantities {{as to have}} entirely dissolved in the water, and finally to have escaped at the surface, or to have reunited into water. That the hydrogen can be so dissolved was shown in the first vessel; for after several days minute bubbles of gas gradually appeared upon a <b>glass</b> <b>rod,</b> inserted to retain the zinc and platina apart, and also upon the platina plate itself, and these were hydrogen. They resulted principally in this way:--notwithstanding the amalgamation of the zinc, the acid exerted a little direct action upon it, so that a small stream of hydrogen bubbles was continually rising from its surface; {{a little of this}} hydrogen gradually dissolved in the dilute acid, and was in part set free against the surfaces of the rod and the plate, according to the well-known action of such solid bodies in solutions of gases (623. &c.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1350. As an {{illustration}} of {{the condition of the}} polarized particles in a dielectric under induction, I may describe an experiment. Put into a glass vessel some clear rectified oil of turpentine, and introduce two wires passing through glass tubes where they coincide with the surface of the fluid, and terminating either in balls or points. Cut some very clean dry white silk into small particles, and put these also into the liquid: then electrify one of the wires by an ordinary machine and discharge by the other. The silk will immediately gather {{from all parts of the}} liquid, and form a band of particles reaching from wire to wire, and if touched by a <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> will show considerable tenacity; yet the moment the supply of electricity ceases, the band will fall away and disappear by the dispersion of its parts. The conduction by the silk is in this case very small; and after the best examination I could give to the effects, the impression on my mind is, that the adhesion of the whole is due to the polarity which each filament acquires, exactly as the particles of iron between the poles of a horse-shoe magnet are held together in one mass by a similar disposition of forces. The particles of silk therefore represent to me the condition of the molecules of the dielectric itself, which I assume to be polar, just as that of the silk is. In all cases of conductive discharge the contiguous polarized particles of the body are able to effect a neutralization of their forces with greater or less facility, as the silk does also in a very slight degree. Further we are not able to carry the parallel, except in imagination; but if we could divide each particle of silk into two halves, and let each half travel until it met and united with the next half in an opposite state, it would then exert its carrying power (1347.), and so far represent electrolytic discharge.|$|E

The optical manipulation of rods is also investigated through numerical simulations, which are used to quantitatively explain the experimental results.

The Cristal di Baschet differs mainly from the other glass instruments in that the identical length and thickness <b>glass</b> <b>rods</b> are set horizontally, and attach to the tuned metal stems that have added metal blocks for increasing resonance. The result is a fully acoustic instrument, and impressive amplification obtained using fiberglass or metal cones fixed on wood and by a tall cut out multi-resonant metal part {{in the shape of}} a flame. Some thin added metallic wires resembling cat whiskers are placed under the instrument, supposedly to increase the sound power of high-pitched frequencies.|$|R
50|$|When {{attempting}} {{to take the}} temperature of the mound of erupting oil with a glass thermometer, Wood and Loomis discovered another set of effects quite serendipitously. They note that although the mercury in the thermometer only read 25 C, the glass was so hot that it was painful to touch, and they noticed that the pain became unbearable if they tried to squeeze the thermometer tightly. Even if very fine thread of glass only 0.2 mm in diameter and 1 m long was put in the oil at one end, holding a bulge in the glass at the other end still resulted in a groove being left in the skin and the skin being seared, with painful and bloody blisters forming that lasted several weeks, showing the ultrasound generated was quite powerful indeed. In a similar vein, when a <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> was put lightly in contact with dried woodchips, the rod would burn the wood and cause it to smoke, or if pressed against a woodchip, it would quickly burn through the chip, leaving behind a charred hole. All the while the <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> remained cool, with the heating confined to the tip. When a <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> is pressed lightly against a glass plate, it etches the glass plate, while if it is pressed, it bores right through the plate. Microscopic examinations showed that the debris given off includes finely powdered glass and globules of molten glass.|$|E
50|$|Glass rods {{can also}} be used to {{demonstrate}} electrification by friction. This occurs when there are two surfaces rubbing together. In this instance, rubbing a <b>glass</b> <b>rod</b> with silk transfers negative charge from it. This effect is known as the triboelectric effect and can be performed with a variety of materials. Because glass rods and silk are relatively common, they are often chosen to demonstrate this effect.|$|E
