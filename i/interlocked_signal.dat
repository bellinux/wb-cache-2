25|$|Kuranda Railway Station {{includes}} three early (c.1914) surviving Queensland examples of pre-cast concrete railway station buildings, and {{has one of}} the few mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins still commissioned in Queensland. The complex is also a rare surviving resort station, comparable with those at Spring Bluff (Main Range Railway) and Yeppoon railway station.|$|E
50|$|Ascot {{railway station}} {{is the last}} station in {{metropolitan}} Brisbane to retain semaphore signalling and a mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabin, {{and is one of}} only seven such systems intact in Queensland. In 2008 the seven mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins still commissioned were Ascot (not used), Charters Towers, Ingham, Innisfail, Kuranda, Laidley (rarely used) and Mackay. There are about 19 surviving decommissioned <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins complete with their frames in Queensland (six have been relocated), along with 36 signal cabins minus their signal frames, and 10 known signal frames in various states of intactness. Approximately 100 mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins have been demolished at stations around Queensland.|$|E
50|$|The {{signal box}} at Drouin was closed in February 1988, with the block post abolished, all fixed signals covered and lights extinguished. The <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> frame was also abolished.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> {{also tell}} switch {{operators}} which way {{switches on the}} subway are set. The top part of an <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> indicates {{the condition of the}} block ahead, while the lower part indicates the route selected. The following <b>interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> are used on the New York City Subway: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> {{are used}} in interlockings, which are any areas where train {{movements}} may conflict with each other. They are controlled by either human operators or a computer, not by the trains. <b>Interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> also tell operators which way points are set. The following <b>interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> are used on the TTC.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanically}} <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> box at {{the station}} opened in 1887, and was decommissioned in June 2008. Originally built with 120 levers, it had 191 when it closed, making it the world's largest.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened to}} {{unofficial}} traffic on 18 March 1886, {{with the line}} extended to Bacchus Marsh on 16 February 1887. By 1890, Parwan had a platform, goods shed, a 20-lever <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> box and a three road yard.|$|E
50|$|Being on {{a single}} track section of track, the station served as a {{crossing}} loop, with an <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> box erected in 1890. In 1893 a turntable was added, and by 1908 the station had a four road yard, passenger platform, and a goods shed and platform.|$|E
50|$|Conflicting routes must be {{controlled}} by <b>interlocked</b> <b>signals</b> to prevent collisions.|$|R
50|$|A {{distant signal}} {{can either be}} an {{automatic}} <b>signal</b> before an <b>interlocking,</b> or the <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> itself when interlockings are back to back. Distant signals typically display more aspects than a typical block or <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> to warn trains of diverging movements at the next interlocking however {{this is not always}} the case if there are no diverging paths available.|$|R
50|$|With the {{widespread}} availability of electrically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signalling</b> in modern times, the rule against facing turnouts has been relaxed.|$|R
5000|$|Severn Bridge Junction is {{the area}} of railway lines just south of Shrewsbury railway station, in Shropshire, England. It is {{controlled}} by a mechanical <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> box of the same name, which is now the largest operational mechanical signal box in the world. The Network Rail signalling area code is 'SBJ.' ...|$|E
50|$|Kuranda Railway Station {{includes}} three early (c.1914) surviving Queensland examples of pre-cast concrete railway station buildings, and {{has one of}} the few mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins still commissioned in Queensland. The complex is also a rare surviving resort station, comparable with those at Spring Bluff (Main Range Railway) and Yeppoon railway station.|$|E
50|$|Melton station {{opened on}} 2 April 1884, when {{the line from}} Braybrook Junction opened. The line was {{extended}} westward to Parwan station in 1886, and being on a single track section of track, the station served as a crossing loop from this time. By 1889 the station had an <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> box, single passenger platform, and a three road yard. A goods shed also existed across from the passenger platform.|$|E
50|$|To {{cope with}} {{increasing}} traffic, <b>interlocked</b> <b>signals</b> and points were installed in 1875, and the Port line was upgraded to double track in 1881.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternative}} to grade separation is a level junction or flat junction, where tracks cross at grade, and conflicting routes {{must be protected}} by <b>interlocked</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station foreman on duty at Oakworth {{also has}} {{responsibility}} for the level crossing {{at the end of}} the platform, which is controlled by <b>interlocked</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station opened as Kororoit on 2 April 1884, at {{the same}} time as the Serviceton line though it, and was renamed Deer Park in 1899, by which time the station had a three road yard, {{passenger}} platform on the southern track, a goods platform on the northern track, and an <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> box. Being on a single track railway, it served as a crossing loop for trains though it, which remained until 1913, when the signal box was abolished.|$|E
50|$|The station opened as Mount Atkinson on 2 April 1884, at {{the same}} time as the Serviceton line though it, and was renamed Rockbank in 1889. Being on a single track railway line, it {{provided}} a crossing loop for trains, and continues to do so today. By 1914, it had a three road yard, a passenger platform on the southern track, a goods platform on the northern track, and an <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> box. The station served the local farming community. With a chaff mill established in the 1890s, and the recreation reserve and tennis club located nearby, the station became the focus of the Rockbank community.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1872, {{along with the}} line though it, and became a {{junction}} for the Mansfield branch line to Yea in 1883, with the line extended to Mansfield in 1891, and Alexandra in 1909. A turntable was added when the station became a junction, and the main line was duplicated from Broadford in the same year, with the double track being extended north in 1886. The first <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> box was erected in 1885, controlling three platforms and a four road yard. The crossovers for the branch line initially faced Seymour, requiring Melbourne-bound trains to reverse; a Melbourne-facing crossover was added in 1911.|$|E
50|$|So Westinghouse Continuous Air Brakes were {{fitted to}} rolling stock, and <b>interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> installed, plus Tyer's tablet {{machines}} on single lines (as most NZR lines were).|$|R
50|$|The {{system of}} <b>interlocked</b> <b>signals</b> is {{surviving}} {{evidence of the}} former size {{and complexity of the}} Charters Towers Railway Station and yards. The multitude of sidings, which required <b>interlocked</b> <b>signals,</b> was a product of the extensive mining and commercial activity in Charters Towers during the late nineteenth century. The presence of a pedestrian underpass (1890), usually a feature of large metropolitan railway stations, also is evidence of the extent of activity at the Charters Towers Railway Station when Charters Towers was Queensland's largest and wealthiest gold-mining town.|$|R
25|$|Interlockings {{are places}} where tracks are {{connected}} by switches and where routes may conflict. They are arranged in a specific way, with switches and signals that prevent conflicting movements once one route is set up. <b>Interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> are fixed <b>signals</b> within an <b>interlocking,</b> containing two separate red-yellow-green signal heads and often other indications. A home signal is defined as an <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> {{at the entrance to}} a route or block to control trains entering that route or block. These terms are used interchangeably, as most interlockings only have one controlled signal on each track.|$|R
50|$|The use of Murphy's Creek as {{a station}} diminished with the {{introduction}} of diesel-electric motive power in 1952, and complete dieselisation of Brisbane to Toowoomba services in June 1956. Prior to the introduction of the new motive power, on goods trains up to 12 hours could be spent working between Brisbane and Toowoomba. Prior to dieselisation in 1956, over 49 light engine movements alone were timetabled on the Toowoomba-Murphy's Creek section. 83 working hours a day was taken up in light engine running and banking time on the range from the Willowburn depot. Engines would also attach to trains at Helidon or Lockyer stations depending on how locomotives were performing. The new motive power eliminated the need to run attached locomotives on the range section.In 1963 the raised timber platform at Murphy's Creek station (similar to that at Grandchester) was removed and replaced by a ground level gravel platform and a new 14-lever <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabin was provided with the rearrangement of signalling of the Murphy's Creek shunting yard. Steam operations on the Main Range had ceased by the mid 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The Denison Street {{double line}} {{is also a}} rare Australian example of road and rail traffic sharing the same corridor, and the station {{contains}} rare surviving remnants of its <b>interlocking</b> <b>signalling</b> system.|$|R
40|$|Analyzing {{the causes}} of various trip events is helpful to improve {{reliability}} of a synchrotron light source. To identify {{the causes of}} trips at Taiwan Light Source (TLS), various diagnostics tools were employed. These diagnostic tools can capture beam trips, <b>interlock</b> <b>signals</b> of superconducting RF system, waveforms of the injection kickers, quench and <b>interlock</b> <b>signals</b> of the superconducting insertion device, and instability signals of the stored beam for post-mortem analysis. These diagnostic systems can routinely monitor signals and record beam trip events. Features of trip diagnostic tools are available now. System configuration and experiences will be summarized in this report...|$|R
50|$|The three-storey timber {{signal cabin}} at Ipswich {{containing}} an 1881 McKenzie and Holland mechanical <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> frame {{and the nearby}} locomotive turntable and semaphore signal were once important components of the Ipswich railway station infrastructure.|$|R
25|$|Fixed block {{signalling}} {{has been used}} throughout the subway system since the opening of Toronto's first subway in 1954. Along with automatic signalling, used to prevent rear-end train collision, <b>interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> are used to prevent collisions from conflicting movements on track crossovers.|$|R
50|$|At the {{formation}} of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway in 1899, Sykes retired from the railway and formed the W.R. Sykes <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Signal</b> Company. The company became part of the Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd after Syke’s death in 1917.|$|R
5000|$|In 1866 the Great Eastern Railway (GER) {{took over}} the LBR on a long-lease and instigated a series of repairs and in 1869 {{provided}} improved signalling arrangements with a new <b>signal</b> box and <b>interlocked</b> <b>signals</b> and block working between adjacent signal boxes.|$|R
50|$|Wise was {{committed}} to the safe operation of the railway, and introduced <b>interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> at most of the stations. He developed and patented the signalling staff system which bears his name and is described in patent 1030 of 1896. He also gave the BNCR its characteristic somersault signal.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1996 Silver Spring Collision, the Federal Railroad Administration amended its regulations for push-pull train operation to prevent locomotive engineers from forgetting that they were approaching a stop signal after making a station stop. The resulting [...] "Delay in Block Rule" [...] requires that all distant signals, located in territory where push-pull trains operate in the absence of cab signals, be marked with a [...] "D" [...] placard. The placard is intended to remind engineers that they are bound by a 40 mph speed restriction, and must approach the <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> prepared to stop, whenever a station stop is made or train speed drops below 10 mph in the approach block. The restrictions hold until the <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> is clearly visible and is displaying a [...] "proceed" [...] indication.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>interlocked</b> <b>signaling</b> {{system was}} {{installed}} at the Bricklayers Arms junction, near the Old Kent Road in South London. It consisted of eight semaphore signals and six pairs of points controlling the routes {{in and out of}} London bridge Station and neighbouring goods yards, with linkages to a signal box.|$|R
5000|$|... "This {{accident}} {{was caused by}} failure of Engineman Wescott of train № 33 to be governed by automatic and <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> indications, which resulted in train № 33 taking the diverging route at {{a high rate of}} speed and being derailed due to the outer rail of the curve giving way." ...|$|R
50|$|The ladies {{waiting room}} and the station lamp room were both {{destroyed}} by fire in February 1887. A new <b>signal</b> cabin and <b>interlocked</b> <b>signalling</b> was installed in 1913, {{as part of the}} duplication work being completed between Laidley and Helidon to speed up workings on the western main line, and increase train movements.|$|R
