5|$|Aviation in Oslo {{started in}} 1909, when Carl Cederström of Sweden made {{exhibition}} flights from fields at Etterstad. Following this, the Norwegian Army {{decided that it}} needed a military land airport, and established <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> Kjeller, outside Oslo, in 1912. Kjeller Airport served as the main airport for Norway until the 1930s, being the main base of the newly established Norwegian Army Air Service and {{the first place to}} have air services.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} obvious {{deficiency}} of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East.|$|E
5|$|Since its completion, {{the road}} has acted {{as the primary}} access point to St. Peter's Square, and by {{extension}} to the Vatican City <b>itself.</b> <b>At</b> times, such as during the funeral of Pope John Paul II, it has acted as an extension to the square itself, allowing a greater number of visitors to attend functions conducted there.|$|E

5|$|The first {{teaser trailer}} was shown at E3 2005, {{depicting}} Dante traveling through a snow-covered environment. A more substantial trailer was released at that year's Tokyo Game Show, {{with a more}} rugged and older Dante in a city-like setting. Both teasers show very little detail of the game <b>itself.</b> <b>At</b> the 2006 Tokyo Game Show, a more complete trailer debuted, along with a playable demo, featuring the character Nero.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of Main St and Rutgers Street in Belleville forms {{the end of}} one section of Route 7 (signed north, directionally west). Rutgers Street is named for Colonel Henry Rutgers, an American Revolutionary War hero and benefactor of what is now Rutgers University. For its entire length, Rutgers carries Essex County Route 506, which ends, like Rutgers Street <b>itself,</b> <b>at</b> the Rutgers Street Bridge.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{the roadway}} loops around <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> a {{section in the}} roadway locally known as The Helix, {{descending}} the New Jersey Palisades to reach {{the entrance to the}} Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson River. The route has a westbound exit for CR677 (John F. Kennedy/Hudson Boulevard East) and another exit for Boulevard East with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. After interchanging with Boulevard East, the road features an eastbound toll plaza and enters the Lincoln Tunnel. At the New York state line, which is located at the midpoint of the Hudson River, the road continues as NY 495, which is separate from I-495, and heads into Midtown Manhattan in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Bentworth was {{the largest}} parish within the Hundred of Odiham, after Odiham <b>itself.</b> <b>At</b> {{the time of the}} Domesday Survey the area of the Hundred of Odiham were {{included}} in two separate hundreds, Odiham and Hefedele (also known as Edefele and Efedele). The former comprised Lasham and Shalden and half a hide which had been taken from the nearby village of Preston Candover, and the latter included Odiham, Winchfield, Elvetham, Dogmersfield, and a former parish named Berchelei. For the manors of Bentworth, Greywell, Hartley Wintney, Liss, Sherfield-upon-Loddon, and Weston Patrick, there are no entries in the Survey, but they were believed to have been included in the large manor of Odiham.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an action {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, the {{services}} were gradually {{taken over by}} Lufttransport, who used both small aircraft and helicopters. These gradually became more regular and became de facto scheduled services every fortnight. Lufttransport replaced the helicopter service with a two-engine five-seat aircraft in 1989, which cut the cost of transport significantly. In 1993, Widerøe established <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-Ålesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made an agreement that the airline would fly once per week during the winter and up to five times per week during the summer. The airline would use a Dornier Do 228, which was also used for flights from Longyearbyen to Svea Airport for Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.|$|E
5|$|During the Peninsular War (1809–1814) in Spain, the Vistula Legion gained fame at the Battle of Zaragoza. In the Battle of Fuengirola, a small Polish force {{managed to}} defeat an Anglo-Spanish expeditionary force outnumbering them 10-1, {{capturing}} their {{commander in the}} process. Other troops served in Napoleon's Imperial Guard and the Polish Chevau-léger regiment distinguished <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Somosierra in 1808. Another Polish cavalry regiment– the Vistula uhlans– also fought in Spain. They distinguished themselves many times there, including at the Battle of Albuhera in 1811, where they destroyed a British infantry brigade. Their valour in that conflict inspired the British {{to create their own}} lancer units equipped with Polish-style uniforms and weapons.|$|E

5|$|Farrell {{was also}} awarded the Croix de guerre with palm for his actions, and the 1st Battalion {{received}} a citation from Major General Charles Summerall, {{the commander of}} V Corps. After the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, the 1st Engineers participated in the occupation of the Rhineland, with Farrell's 1st Battalion basing <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> Ebernhahn. The 1st Engineers returned to the United States in August and September 1919. After the war, Farrell joined the Regular Army. He served as an instructor at the Engineer School at Camp A. A. Humphreys from 1921 to 1924, {{and then at the}} United States Military Academy at West Point until 1926.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn <b>itself.</b> <b>At</b> the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E
5|$|Headlam {{was given}} command of No.2 Squadron at Laverton on 15April 1941, and raised to wing {{commander}} on 1July. Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5December, when {{four of its}} aircraft were ordered to Darwin, Northern Territory, in response to fears of Japanese aggression in the Pacific. On 7December, this detachment established <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> Penfui, near Koepang in Dutch Timor, while No.2 Squadron's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby. The following day, aware that Australia was now at war in the Pacific, one of the Penfui-based Hudsons attacked the Japanese pearler Nanyo Maru, which was suspected of being a radio ship, and forced it aground. By 12December, Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base, as well as No.2 Squadron.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, {{the college}} moved {{location}} {{several times before}} establishing <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> its present campus in Hereford. The first of these moves occurred {{at the beginning of}} the Second World War, when the college was evacuated from its London site and moved to a mansion named Great Maytham in Rolvenden in west Kent. However, because of the threat of a German invasion, the authorities soon advised another move, and this time, with 24 hours notice and the help of the London Society for the Blind, a temporary home was found for RNC in Dorton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. At the time of the move most of the students were on holiday, although some thirty had remained at the college along with several staff members.|$|E
5|$|Other {{units at}} Horn Island {{included}} No.28 Operational Base Unit, {{which had been}} located there since being formed in May 1942; No.112 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters (formerly No.12 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters); and a detachment of No.7 Squadron (headquartered at Townsville), operating Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance bombers. No.33 Operational Base Unit, formed at Townsville in April 1943, established <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> Higgins Field on 23October. No.1 Repair and Salvage Unit was also headquartered at Higgins, but maintained a detachment on Thursday Island. No.23 Air Stores Park, based on Thursday Island, was responsible for logistical support of No.75 Wing units.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, {{opened in}} 1975, {{allowing}} better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established <b>itself</b> <b>at</b> Svalbard Airport. During {{the summer of}} 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny-Ålesund Airport to support their expeditions. During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-Ålesund, but the air strip was kept operational for the few groups of researchers who did visit. A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-Ålesund receiving a telephone connection. A radio beacon was subsequently installed at the airport.|$|E
