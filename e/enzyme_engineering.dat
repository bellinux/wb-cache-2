Anthocyanins, the water-soluble colored pigments found in terrestrial {{plants that are}} responsible for the red, blue and purple coloration of many flowers and fruits, are extensively used in food and cosmetics industry; however, their current supply heavily relies on complex extraction from plant-based materials. A promising alternative is their sustainable production in metabolically engineered microbes.

40|$|Streptomyces venezuelae synthesizes pikromycin (pik), a {{macrolide}} antibiotic, using a {{modular system}} of <b>enzymes.</b> <b>Engineering</b> these <b>enzymes</b> could enable facile biosynthesis {{of new and}} diverse antibiotics. New products have proven difficult to access because the pik thioesterase enzyme (pikTE) selectively cyclizes the linear pik polyketide into a macrolactone intermediate. Macrolactones are not formed when pikTE is fed an epimerized substrate. This substrate is cyclized when the active site nucleophile is mutated from serine to cysteine. Density functional theory [M 06 - 2 X/ 6 - 31 +G(d,p) ] predicts that the cysteine mutant produces a thioorthoester intermediate with S-C bonds of 1. 964 Angstroms and 1. 933 Angstroms between pikTE and the acyl carrier protein (pikACP), respectively, facilitating faster handoff of the substrate from pikACP to pikTE. A more exothermic cyclization reaction in the cysteine mutant slows the reversibility of cyclization, limiting the opportunities for premature substrate hydrolysis. Mutating another enzyme in this pathway, pikC hydroxylase, shows up to a 38 -fold increase in catalytic activity towards non-natural substrates than the wild type or single mutant pikC(D 50 N). Simulations revealed that pikC(D 50 ND 176 QE 246 A) has a more compact active site than pikC(D 50 N) or the wild type enzyme and that mutations improve the stability of polar interactions with the substrate’s anchoring group...|$|R

50|$|Directed {{evolution}} is an <b>enzyme</b> <b>engineering</b> strategy designed to mimic natural selection {{in a laboratory}} setting. Due to the difficulty in implementing rational design strategies, directed evolution has become the strategy of choice for P450 engineering. Here, mutations can be introduced either semi-rationally or randomly via site-saturation mutagenesis. The resulting P450 mutant (typically mutant library) is then screened for desired activity. Mutants displaying enhanced properties are forwarded to subsequent rounds of mutagenesis, repeating this cycle until the desired function is adequately met.|$|E

50|$|Rational <b>enzyme</b> <b>engineering</b> is {{characterized}} by making specific amino acid mutations based on mechanistic or structural information. While P450 enzymes are mechanistically well understood, mutations based on structural information are often limited by crystallization difficulty. Although, when obtainable, {{the high degree of}} flexibility and active site plasticity present in P450s make crystal structures largely obsolete for rational design. Another issue presents itself when attempting to expand substrate scope. This is often achieved by increasing the P450 active site size, which in turn can result in multiple substrate docking orientations, resulting in poor regio-/stereoselectivity.|$|E

BM3 variants have been particularly useful to produce fragrances, flavors, pheromones and pharmaceuticals. Artemisinic acid (used in the production of the pharmaceutical natural product artemisinin) was produced utilizing a BM3 variant responsible for epoxidizing the two alkenes present in amorpha-4,11-diene. Oxidation of valencene to nootkatone (a prized grapefruit flavor) was accomplished utilizing a F87T and I263A mutant (Figure 1).|$|E
30|$|Several {{reaction}} parameters affect the yield of AGs using glycosidases. These are water activity, temperature, time of incubation, pH {{of the reaction}} system, nature of the substrate and source of enzyme [15, 16]. These operating conditions can be manipulated to give high yield of the end products. Some other strategies such as immobilization of glycosidases, presence of organic solvents and use of reverse micelle system [13, 17 – 19] have been adopted to make the enzymatic route more economical than the chemical route by allowing reuse of enzymes and suppressing parasitic hydrolysis of the synthesized products to give high yield per unit of <b>enzyme.</b> Medium <b>engineering</b> has also been successfully used for improving yield and employs micro-aqueous, two-phase and ionic liquid systems [20 – 22].|$|R

40|$|Engineering of {{microbes}} {{can allow}} for the sustainable production {{of a variety of}} useful chemical compounds upon which we rely in our everyday lives. The many advantages of metabolic engineering include the use of renewable resources, mild reaction conditions, such as ambient pressure, pH and temperature, as well as the avoidance of toxic chemicals in the conversion process. The 3 -hydroxyacid (3 HA) pathway, also known as coenzyme-A (CoA) dependent chain elongation, can {{allow for the}} synthesis of dozens of diverse classes of chemicals. However, this pathway suffers from byproduct formation, which is due to the promiscuous activities of the pathway enzymes. On one hand, this enables the synthesis of such a diverse set of chemicals, but on the other, prohibits commercialization due to high downstream separation costs and low yields of desired longer chain products. The goal of this thesis was to improve this pathway though engineering and bioprospecting of more selective pathway <b>enzymes.</b> <b>Engineering</b> efforts were focused on the thiolase enzyme, which catalyzes the first step of the 3 HA pathway, while bioprospecting efforts were focused on the enzyme immediately downstream of the thiolase - the 3 -ketoacyl-CoA reductase. Our computationally guided protein engineering efforts identified a thiolase point mutant which allowed for more selective synthesis of longer chain 3 HAs. Bioinformatics approaches were used to identify a set of ten diverse 3 -ketoacyl-CoA reductases which were then screened and characterized {{within the context of the}} 3 HA pathway. Two of the reductases led to increased selectivity for longer chain products. Combinations of the most selective thiolase and reductase enzyme pairs almost eliminated C 4 byproduct formation by the 3 HA pathway. In all, the thiolase and 3 -ketoacyl-CoA reductase enzyme variants identified in this work should be applicable to other heterologous pathways where formation of short chain products is undesired, bringing such pathways closer to commercialization. by Yekaterina Tarasova.

50|$|Chemoenzymatic glycorandomization was {{inspired}} by the early pathway engineering work of Hutchinson and coworkers that suggested natural product glycosyltransferases were capable of utilizing non-native sugar nucleotide donors. The initial platform for chemoenzymatic glycorandomization was based upon a set of two highly permissive sugar activation enzymes (a sugar anomeric kinase and sugar-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase) to afford sugar nucleotide libraries as donors for these promiscuous glycosyltransferases where the permissivity of the corresponding sugar kinase and nucleotidyltransferase was expanded by <b>enzyme</b> <b>engineering</b> and directed evolution. The first application of this three enzyme (kinase, nucleotidyltransferase and glycosyltransferase) strategy enabled the product of a set of >30 differentially glycosylated vancomycins, some members of which were further diversified chemoselectively by virtue of the installation of sugars bearing chemoselective handles. This enzymatic platform has been further advanced through glycosyltransferase evolution and capitalizing upon the discovery of the reversibility of glycosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions first discovered in the context of calicheamicin biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|Recently, Wang et al. {{reported}} a BM3 variant capable of performing styrenyl olefin cyclopropanation. As native BM3 displays poor cyclopropanation activity, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>engineering</b> effort was undertaken. At their core, P450s are heme-thiolate enzymes which utilize molecular oxygen (O2) and NAD(P)H to perform oxygenation reactions. As such, BM3 prefers to perform epoxidation opposed to cyclopropanation reactions {{in the presence}} of olefins. The reaction between ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) and 1 was chosen as a model reaction due to the known difficulty of epoxidizing electron-deficient olefins utilizing transitional metal catalysis (Figure 2). This reaction generates compound 2, which can easily be converted to levomilnacipran (Fetzima), a pharmaceutical used to treat clinical depression. To begin, mutants were generated where the axial coordinating cysteine residue in the catalytic center was replaced with amino acids serine, alanine, methionine, histidine and tyrosine. The mutant T268A-axH, which has an axial histidine ligand catalyzed the reaction between EDA and 1 in 81% yield with 6:94 diastereoselectivity and 42% enantioselectivity. Subsequent rounds of site-saturation mutagenesis were then performed, resulted in the variant named BM3-Hstar (containing T268A-axH, L437W, V78M and L181V mutations), which could catalyze the model reaction with greater than 92% yield, 92% enantioselectivity and 2:98 diastereoselectivity. As an added advantage, BM3-Hstar was also capable of performing the desired cyclopropanation reaction {{in the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen (O2) (the only known BM3 variant capable of this).|$|E
