For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of <b>Gender,</b> explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of <b>gender.</b> In Delusions of <b>Gender,</b> Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} <b>gender</b> classifies nouns {{as either}} animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode the <b>gender</b> of the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode the <b>gender</b> of the grammatical subject, creating {{a set of}} four verb subclasses. The {{distinction between the two}} genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and <b>gender.</b> Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in <b>gender</b> with the noun they refer to.|$|E
5|$|The {{freedom to}} display {{femininity}} and <b>gender</b> equality seem incompatible in Chinese society. <b>Gender</b> equality appeared prevailing only when women were restricted to desexualization in the Mao era. Opening up policy guarantees women's freedom for resexualization, but it simultaneously brings back <b>gender</b> inequality.|$|E

The results showed that women described their lived experiences in distinctly <b>gendered</b> terms. The four superordinate themes that were present in their stories were <b>Gendered</b> Adaptation, <b>Gendered</b> Resilience, <b>Gendered</b> Violence, and <b>Gendered</b> Discrimination. Implications of these results for counseling practice, research, and advocacy are discussed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{organisational}} {{literature on the}} <b>gendered</b> body, we argue that much of this literature remains disembodied. We therefore seek to further embody the study of <b>gendered</b> bodies and organisations by viewing the body as lived <b>gendered</b> embodiment and by writing our own viscerally embodied experiences into our discussion. We first discuss the phenomenological approach to lived <b>gendered</b> embodiment and how this has been utilised in organisation studies. We then discuss how research on lived <b>gendered</b> embodiment might become more viscerally self-reflective. Throughout, we integrate these discussions with our own visceral and <b>gendered</b> self-reflections from teaching and research...|$|R

5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome <b>gender</b> bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. <b>Gender</b> disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by <b>gender.</b> Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how <b>gender</b> effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew <b>gender</b> ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on <b>gender</b> skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in <b>gender</b> ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the <b>gender</b> of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect <b>gender</b> differences.

Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and <b>gender</b> in their research.|$|E

5|$|The Social Institutions and <b>Gender</b> Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of <b>gender</b> inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame <b>gender</b> norms within a society.

Through its analysis of the institutional sources of <b>gender</b> inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E
