25|$|During a tag team {{match on}} April 3, 1983 {{he was injured}} by Dynamite Kid; two days later, {{he was forced to}} vacate the NWA World Junior Heavyweight title after it became clear that he would need time off to recuperate. However, once the {{determined}} Tiger Mask recovered, he regained his NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi on June 2, 1983, making him a simultaneous NWA/WWF Jr. champion for the second time. By 1983, however, Sayama started feeling dissatisfied as he hated the politics behind-the-scenes. As a result, he announced his retirement from active competition on August 12, 1983. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to the wrestling world, as Tiger Mask was going to retire while he {{was at the top of}} his game and as the holder of two Junior Heavyweight Championships. Both titles were declared vacant, as he became a trainer to martial arts fighters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighties}} NAC relegated two times. After the second relegation, it {{appeared}} the financial situation of NAC was terrible. NAC was almost bankrupt {{and had to}} sell its belongings to survive. For years NAC struggled to survive, {{but at the end}} of the eighties NAC’s situation improved and the club began to play in the top of the Eerste Divisie. On June 7, 1989, NAC player Andro Knel died in a plane accident. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to the club, especially since Knel was one of the popular players. Hundreds of fans of both NAC Breda and Sparta Rotterdam, Knel’s former club, came together in memorial of Knel. A temporary Knel monument was revealed and the numbers of supporters visiting the monument proved his popularity. Due to the sad moments of Knel's death a special relationship between fans of NAC and Sparta was created.|$|E
500|$|The set {{was already}} being broken down {{the day after}} filming finished. Debra Messing, who plays Grace, said it was [...] "cordoned off like an {{accident}} scene. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to see parts of it gone already." [...] Each cast member was allowed to keep their favorite souvenir from the set. Messing took the door to Grace's office; she wanted to lean it {{up against the wall}} at her house as a piece of modern art. Sean Hayes was given a couple of pieces from Will's apartment: [...] "There's a leather box that was on Will’s desk that I want to find a place for." [...] Mullally chose a simple portrait from one of the walls, and McCormack took a small ceramic dog, though he said he would have taken everything if he could.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shocking</b> play in {{its time}} {{partly because it}} dealt with an incestuous {{relationship}} between a brother and sister.|$|R
50|$|On {{a mission}} for Lara Raith, Justine seeks shelter from Johnny Marcone under the Unseelie Accords. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shocking</b> {{discovery}} that he's no fool. Narrated by Johnny Marcone.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shocking</b> {{story of}} {{official}} prejudice... Though the more even balanced {{rank and file}} (of the AFL) does not approve of the radical wing, yet they cannot safely abandon the radicals to the vengeance of the common enemies.|$|R
500|$|After {{revealing}} their deception to a busy Queen Victoria public house, Peggy slapped both Pat and Frank, rebuffed Frank's {{attempt at}} reconciliation {{and left him}} to depart alone. In December 2000, Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror voted the scene in which Peggy slaps both Pat and Frank {{as one of the}} [...] "TV fights of the year", saying [...] "It was Peggy's speech which really made it a Bonfire Night to remember. But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when I found out he was leaving because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I got my own back when I had to slap him after I found out he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn't think I did it hard enough the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fles {{was widely}} {{known as an}} {{opponent}} of Nazism when the German army occupied the Netherlands in May 1940. Even so, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to many of his family members when, on May 25, 1940, Levie Jacob [...] "Louis" [...] Fles committed suicide by means of pills acquired from a pharmacist in Keppel. He was buried in Amsterdam in Zorgvlied Cemetery.|$|E
6000|$|Dodging in {{from the}} rain-swept street, I {{exchanged}} {{a smile and a}} glance with Miss Blank in the bar of the Three Crows. This exchange was effected with extreme propriety. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to think that, if still alive, Miss Blank must be something over sixty now. How time passes! ...|$|R
6000|$|Of course <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shocking</b> sight, I <b>was</b> shocked myself. And I {{should not}} care to have my own {{daughter}} pollute her eyes with such a sight, or come within half a mile of it; but--and there we were, and there you are, and [...] "but" [...] is all that can be said.|$|R
50|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Critics {{praised the}} interactions between Carrie and Brody and the continued forward motion of the plot. The climactic gunfight, however, divided critics; some thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shocking</b> plot development, while others felt it strained credulity and was too similar in tone to 24 (which was also executive produced by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa).|$|R
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock,</b> {{coming from}} the short, square figure of such an obvious landsman. The farmer took him by the arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "By George, I {{believe you}} did!" [...] he cried. [...] "You must have! So, that's how it happened, is it? I don't wonder <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> when I said I {{knew about the}} necklace." ...|$|E
2500|$|In physics, <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> wave (also spelled shockwave), or <b>shock,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type of {{propagating}} disturbance. When a wave moves {{faster than}} the local speed of sound in <b>a</b> fluid, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> wave. [...] Like an ordinary wave, <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> wave carries energy and can propagate through <b>a</b> medium; however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> characterized by <b>an</b> abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in pressure, temperature and density of the medium.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>shock</b> {{within the}} world of Rugby League when he was {{appointed}} head coach.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{course he}} put all this on very general grounds. [...] "I hate to lose faith in any one. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> {{to know that}} I can be so wholly deceived by appearance. Clarke is really the one to blame in the deception. I can't believe the girl {{wilfully}} deceives, and yet Britt was explicit, {{and he seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> keen, dispassionate observer." ...|$|R
60|$|When Carol {{glanced at}} Erik again she {{discovered}} that Mrs. Bogart had an eye on her. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to know that at last there was something which could make her afraid of Mrs. Bogart's spying.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] she said, as I {{hastened to}} pour her out some water. [...] "I am all right again. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> {{to me to}} hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to me. I thought I had quelled the fellow. It {{was rather}} a solemn moment. What I mean is, if I {{weakened}} now, all my good work {{the night before}} would be thrown away. I braced myself.|$|E
50|$|He invites Wilmar {{for lunch}} and the two begin an affair, rekindling the kind of {{relationship}} he had with Alexis. Wilmar <b>is</b> also <b>a</b> killer, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shocking</b> revelation to Fernando when he finds out that Wilmar {{is the one who}} shot Alexis. He vows to kill Wilmar, but then learns <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Alexis who started the violence by killing Wilmar's brother, calling for vengeance on him by Wilmar.|$|R
50|$|The driver {{immediately}} {{notices the}} heaviness of the flywheel. The clutch, a beautifully smooth Hele-Shaw multi-plate, hisses as it engages {{and the heavy}} flywheel gives the car a lumbering gait but then, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock,</b> the engine shows <b>it</b> <b>is</b> longing to 'rev'. The gear-change is delightful and with each new higher gear the whole car seems to gather new life with a magnificent beat from the exhaust.|$|R
50|$|On August 27, 1980, without warning, the Tribune was {{abruptly}} {{closed and}} 375 people {{were out of}} work. Gene Telpner joked {{that he had just}} gotten new drapes and furniture. Val Werier, who was with the Trib for 35 years, said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shocking</b> moment. But people in the pressroom knew something was coming because management had stopped the presses that morning, something they did rarely, and only for major events.|$|R
60|$|But {{next morning}} Shefford understood. Nas Ta Bega and Joe Lake were gone. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to Shefford. Yet {{what could he}} have said to either? Joe had shirked saying good-by to him and Fay. And the Indian {{had gone out of}} Shefford's life as he had come into it.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to Evelyn; one {{she found}} it hard to face, though she was not convinced. The last piece of {{information}} agreed with something Mrs. Nairn had told her; but although she had on one occasion had the testimony of her eyes in support of it, Jessie's first statement sounded incredible.|$|E
60|$|What {{business}} had {{his father to}} come and upset his wife like this? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock,</b> after all these years! He ought to have known; {{he ought to have}} given them warning; but when did a Forsyte ever imagine that his conduct could upset anybody! And in his thoughts he did old Jolyon wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead," [...] said Miss Penny; [...] "she {{looked as}} though she <b>were</b> dead. <b>A</b> walking corpse, that's what she <b>was.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shocking</b> sight. I shouldn't have thought it {{possible}} for anyone to change so much in so short a time. She walked painfully, {{as though she had}} been ill for months, and she had great burnt rings round her eyes and deep lines in her face. And the general expression of unhappiness--that was something quite appalling." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the short}} story, Young Goodman Brown by Nathaniel Hawthorne (himself a {{descendant}} {{of one of the}} Salem witch trial magistrates), a social criticism of Puritan culture, a character named Goody Cloyse addresses the devil, confessing to practicing witchcraft. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to the protagonist (Brown) as she had taught him his catechism in his youth. She makes a reference to [...] "...that unhanged witch, Goody Cory...", a possible reference to Martha Corey, who actually <b>was</b> hanged as <b>a</b> witch in 1692.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock,</b> {{both to the}} man and the minister; and, {{when the}} worst was over, he left Polly to watch her brother, with eyes full of penitential tears, and went away, to reproach himself in private for devoting to ancient Fathers the time and thought he should have given to modern sons.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{were always}} alike," [...] she confided,--"the same figures, same shaped head {{and that sort}} of thing. Douglas was a little overfond of life, though, and Philip here hasn't found out yet what it means. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock,</b> though, Miss Dalstan. Philip was sitting in the dark when I arrived at his rooms this evening, and--I thought it was Douglas." ...|$|E
60|$|I took a lead to {{the extent}} of another £500, which was all that I could afford. I admit that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to such trust in human nature as {{remained}} to me when I discovered subsequently that the 1,000 shares which I bought for my £500 had really been the property of Jacob, although they appeared to be sold to me in various other names.|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{absolute}} <b>shock</b> to {{hear this}} man open his mouth and a song come out of <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences.|$|R
