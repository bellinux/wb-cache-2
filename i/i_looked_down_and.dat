500|$|He {{was hitting}} [...]476 when he dislocated his left thumb sliding head-first into second base on April 11, 2006, and {{was placed on}} the {{disabled}} list. [...] "I knew it wasn't good when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I saw the top part of the thumb pointing in at me", Kinsler said. He came back 41 games later on May 25, and went 3–4 with a single and two home runs, to lead the Rangers to an 8–7 victory over the Oakland Athletics. [...] "I hope the fans don't expect that much every night", he joked.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles had {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Washington's {{style of play}} complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player. Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver. [...] "I could feel it tearing inside. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> my kneecap was hanging {{on the side of}} my leg." [...] Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.|$|E
2500|$|Reserve sophomore {{running back}} Mikell Simpson racked up 119 yards rushing and two TDs {{to go along}} with 152 {{receiving}} yards, for 271 all-purpose yards, as 19th-ranked Virginia came from behind to defeat Maryland. The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." [...] Simpson himself stated, [...] "It crossed the line. I knew I scored because <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [...] they hit it out." [...] With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row {{for the first time since}} 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949. That season, Virginia won an NCAA record of five games by two points or less, with the other edged teams being North Carolina, Middle Tennessee State, Connecticut, and Wake Forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in {{his young}} bride's eyes!-- Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy {{kidnapping}} cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; <b>I</b> <b>look</b> deep <b>down</b> <b>and</b> do believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a little}} black ball {{in the middle of}} your eye; I should see myself in it no bigger than that," [...] and she marked off about an eighth of her little fingernail. [...] "There is a pool in the wood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> see myself there. That is better. Just as large as I am--not small and black like a small, small fly." [...] And after saying th{{is a little}} disdainfully, she moved away from my side and out into the sunshine; and then, half turning towards me, and glancing first at my face and then upwards, she raised her hand to call my {{attention}} to something there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{can take}} you back to the hut of the gardener's boy," [...] promised the Ork, [...] "for when I fly high in the air <b>I</b> can <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> easily spy the King's castle. That was how I {{happened}} to spy you, just entering the grove; so I flew <b>down</b> <b>and</b> waited until you came out." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{there was}} the ugly face of Hans wearing a grin that might have frightened {{the man in the}} moon.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{thick of}} the crowd had already passed. 'Looky there, Ted,' quoth the younger of the detectives, with the {{sharpness}} of surprise in his voice, and pointed straight to my feet. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> saw at once the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud. For a moment I was paralysed.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Brisket hesitated {{and lowered}} his voice. [...] "The other night I came on deck for a look round and saw one of them peeping down through your skylight," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "I sent him below, and after he’d gone <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> saw you and Mr. Tredgold and Stobell all bending over a paper." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew what}} that meant, and a cold shiver went up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> my backbone. But <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at him--spick-and-span <b>and</b> glossy--his neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three o'clock.|$|R
6000|$|Dor. Why {{could he}} not find more of us? Pray, sister, [...] Let you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> one day, [...] To find some little ones for us to play with.|$|R
60|$|Indeed for {{the moment}} I felt so {{agitated}} at thought of that beautiful angel's peril that <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> with anger <b>and</b> scorn at the fat old woman who ought to have remained beside her daughter to comfort and to shield her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard her}} singing, her or her wraith," [...] he swore afterwards. [...] "I'll {{never forget the}} moment <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> down, and the water seemed to grow clearer, and I saw her walking there at the bottom among the rocks, with him over her back, singing as she went, looking {{everywhere}} for George and the boys!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I dreamed," [...] he {{answered}} in his baby talk, [...] "that a woman, dressed as Mother {{was in the}} temple, took me {{by the hand and}} led me into the air. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> saw you and Mother with white faces and crying. I began to cry too, but the woman with the feather cap told me not as she was taking me to a beautiful big star where Mother would soon come to find me." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{storm had}} left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading {{pinpoint}} of Mars was dropping into the west, when a soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight scraping at the fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> saw him dimly, clambering over the palings. At the sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned {{out of the window}} eagerly.|$|E
6000|$|So I do {{not wait}} for my pursuers to arrive. I climb upon the upright {{ironwork}} of the platform and stand upon {{the wheel of the}} hand-brake. This has taken up the moment of grace and I hear the shacks strike the steps on either side. I don't stop to <b>look.</b> <b>I</b> raise my arms overhead until my hands rest against the down-curving ends of the roofs of the two cars. One hand, of course, is on the curved roof of one car, the other hand on the curved roof of the other car. By this time both shacks are coming up the steps. I know it, though I am too busy to see them. All this is happening in the space of only several seconds. I make a spring with my legs and [...] "muscle" [...] myself up with my arms. As I draw up my legs, both shacks reach for me and clutch empty air. I know this, for <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> see them. Also I hear them swear.|$|R
6000|$|The bugle blew again. <b>I</b> <b>looked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> came Sagramor riding again, {{with his}} dust brushed off and his veil nicely re-arranged. I trotted {{up to meet}} him, and pretended to find him {{by the sound of}} his horse's hoofs. He said: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at me without replying, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at him without {{pressing}} him too soon with a repetition of my idle question. Just then there came a vague vibration in the earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had force to draw me down. When such vapour as rose to my height from this rapid train had passed me, and was skimming away over the landscape, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> again, <b>and</b> saw him refurling the flag he had shown while the train went by.|$|R
6000|$|I was [...] "It" [...] {{the last}} time Broken-Tooth tried this. He had gained {{the end of the}} branch and begun his teetering, and I was {{creeping}} out after him, when suddenly there came a low warning cry from Lop-Ear. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> saw him in the main fork of the tree crouching close against the trunk. Instinctively I crouched down upon the thick limb. Broken-Tooth stopped teetering, but the branch would not stop, and his body continued bobbing up and down with the rustling leaves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must have}} thought at a frightful pace. It seemed {{a long time before}} I was sure that the thing meant to keep steady. At first it heeled sideways. Then I noticed the face of the rock which seemed to be {{streaming}} up past me, and me motionless. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> saw in the darkness the river and the dead Sepoy rushing up towards me. But in the indistinct light I also saw three Chins, seemingly aghast at the sight of me, and that the Sepoy was decapitated. At that I wanted to go back again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Day {{was just}} breakin' as we struck her, and there wasn't a soul {{to be seen}} on board. The water was very still, and the nigger-man gave me a lift from the boat, and I climbed onto the steamer where her side was sliced to the deck for loadin' fruit. The hatches was open, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> saw the cargo of bananas that filled the hold to within six feet of the top. I thinks to myself, 'Clancy, you better go as a stowaway. It's safer. The steamer men might hand {{you back to the}} {{employment}} bureau. The tropic'll get you, Clancy, if you don't watch out.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{inferred}} that on such gala occasions carriages {{were given}} an extra cleaning. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the street <b>and</b> perceived {{that there was little}} choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> in my memorandum book for the address of Azalea Adair.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there are}} times when I love to gallop through history on Sir Walter's broomstick. At other hours it is {{pleasant}} to sit in converse with wise George Eliot. From her garden terrace <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on Loamshire <b>and</b> its commonplace people; while in her quiet, deep voice she tells me of the hidden hearts that beat and throb beneath these velveteen jackets and lace falls.|$|R
6000|$|The {{poor girl}} {{struggled}} on: [...] "I saw Peregrine coming, and {{hoping he would}} not see me, I ran into the keep, meaning to get home by the battlements out of his sight, but when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> he <b>and</b> Mr. Archfield were fighting. I screamed, but I don't think they heard me, and I ran down; but I had fastened all the doors, and I {{was a long time}} getting out, and by that time Mr. Archfield had dragged him to the vault and thrown him in. He was like one distracted, and said it must be hidden, or it would be the death of his wife and his mother, and what could I do?" ...|$|R
60|$|We were {{ourselves}} {{by this time}} far on our frantic vertical journey. The mighty trunks were beginning to sway and shake slightly in the wind. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> saw something which made me feel that we were far from {{the world in a}} sense and to a degree that I cannot easily describe. I saw that the almost straight lines of the tall elm trees diminished a little in perspective as they fell. I was used to seeing parallel lines taper towards the sky. But to see them taper towards the earth made me feel lost in space, like a falling star.|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{the window}} I saw {{you on the}} waste ground that {{separated}} the school from our home. You were coming to me {{on your hands and}} feet, and stopping now and again to look back at your mother, who was at the door, laughing and shaking her fist at you. I beckoned to you, and took the book back to my desk to lock it up. While my head was inside the desk I heard the school-house door pushed open, and thinking it was you I smiled, without looking up. Then something touched my hand, and I still thought it was you; but <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> I saw Adam Dishart's black dog.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] said Captain Kittridge, [...] "not exactly; {{but things}} jist like it, you know. Mermaids and sich {{is common in}} foreign parts, and they has {{funerals}} for drowned sailors. 'Member once when we was sailing near the Bermudas by a reef where the Lively Fanny went down, and I heard a kind o' ding-dongin',--and the waters there is clear as the sky,--and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> see the coral all a-growin', and the sea-plants a-wavin' as handsome as a pictur', and the mermaids they was a-singin'. It was beautiful; they sung kind o' mournful; and Jack Hubbard, he would have it they was a-singin' for the poor fellows that was a-lyin' there round under the seaweed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} it is his {{business}} to know those things," [...] she replied, sipping her coffee. [...] "He is a very mysterious young man. He takes a room sometimes at the Milan Hotel and he sends for me to manicure his hands. Then he asks me very clever questions <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> give him--very clever answers. Then he thinks, perhaps, that his methods are not quite the best, and he sends me a great box of chocolates, some stalls for the theatre, some flowers--why not? Then he comes again to be manicured and he asks more questions, but I know so little. Then sometimes, not very often, he brings me out to dine. Imagine for yourself, monsieur," [...] she went on, {{with a wave of}} the hand, [...] "the excitement, the wonder of all this to a poor French girl! And again he asks questions, but again I know so little. And then, in the midst of our dinner, his employer has sent for him. He has to go on a journey. It is sad, is it not? He would like me to go with him to the station, to see him off, but I--" [...] she shrugged her shoulders. [...] "Why should I leave before I have finished my dinner? In truth, he wearies me, that young man. I do not think, Sir Julien Portel, that Englishmen are very clever." ...|$|R
60|$|So we {{came down}} this road. When we meet other ways, not always were we {{sure that they}} were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen, the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and they go on so patient. By and by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that {{wonderful}} diary of him. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep. She try, and she succeed. She sleep all the time, till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try. I {{do not wish to}} try too hard lest I harm her. For I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something. I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> find Madam Mina still asleep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep. For we are going up, and up, and all is oh so wild and rocky, as though it were the end of the world.|$|R
5000|$|Still, he felt {{something}} was lacking. He reached impasse {{while serving as}} a Visiting Research Associate studying {{the environmental impact of}} ethical theories at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University in the 1975-1976 academic year. Relates Schedler, [...] "I was sitting {{on the side of a}} hill, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> see the San Francisco Bay. My eyes went over two interstates, each of which had 12 lanes and all these people. I was thinking, do I want to go back to Purdue with twenty-something faculty, 30,000 students, and all the hassles of that, or do I want to go to an 'underdeveloped country,' to a small university where I can spend a lot of time with students, raise my kids, and not be under that kind of pressure." ...|$|R
6000|$|The steamer {{was quickly}} alongside, heaving wildly in the sea, with the Ramsgate {{lifeboat}} [...] "Bradford" [...] in tow far astern. She merely slowed {{a little to}} admit of the same brief question and reply, the latter being repeated, as the boat passed, {{for the benefit of}} the coxswain. As she swept by us <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> observed that the ten men who formed her crew crouched flat on the thwarts. Only the steersman sat up. No wonder. It must be hard to sit up in a stiff gale with freezing spray, and sometimes heavy seas sweeping over one. I knew that the men were wide awake and listening, but, as far as vision went that boat was manned only by ten oilskin coats and sou'-westers! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{your foot}} off the drag, and I 'll tell you. Arter we left Ring Tail Canon, Dusenberry, as usual, got on. Presently one of the {{outsides}} turned round to me, and says he, 'D--d if Ugly Mug ain't got the inside track of all of you this time!' <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> dern my skin if there wasn't Dusenberry a-sittin' up alongside of the lady, quite comfortable, {{as if they had}} ben children together. At the next station Dusenberry gets off. So does the lady. 'Ain't you goin' on to Wingdam,' says I. 'No,' says she. 'Mayn't we have the pleasure of your kempany further?' says the judge, taking off his hat. 'No, I've changed my mind,' says she, and off she got, and off she walked arm in arm with him as cool as you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have seen}} the Destroyer; the Invisible has {{revealed}} himself to me!' he murmured. 'I stood on the iron bars; the restless waters toiled and struggled beneath my feet as I {{looked up into the}} place of darkness. A voice called to me, [...] "Get light, and behold me from above! Get light! get light!" [...] Sun, and moon, and stars gave no light there! but lamps burnt in the city, in the houses of the dead, when I walked by them in the night-time; and the lamp gave light when sun, and moon, and stars gave none! From the top steps <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> saw the Powerful One in his golden brightness; and approached not, but watched and listened in fear. The voice again!--the voice was heard again!--"Sacrifice to me in secret, as thy brethren sacrifice! Give me the living where the living are, and the dead where the dead!" [...] The air came up cold, and the voice ceased, and the lamp was like sun, and moon, and stars--it gave no light in the place of darkness!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{soon as we}} had {{got over}} the bridge, we struck into a {{beautiful}} road across the country, and the postilion cracked on faster and harder than ever. We had five horses, three abreast before, and two behind. They went upon the gallop, and the postilion kept cracking his whip about them and over their ears all the time. I thought for a while that he was whipping them; but when I leaned forward, so that <b>I</b> could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> see, <b>I</b> found {{that he did not}} touch them with his whip at all, but only cracked the snapper about them, and shouted at them in French, to make them go. The road was as hard and smooth as a floor, and it was almost as white as a floor of marble.|$|R
60|$|The {{shadow of}} poor Ransome, to be sure, lay {{on all four}} of us, and on me and Mr. Shuan in particular, most heavily. And then I had another trouble of my own. Here I was, doing dirty work for three men that <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> upon, <b>and</b> one of whom, at least, should have hung upon a gallows; that was for the present; {{and as for the}} future, I could only see myself slaving {{alongside}} of negroes in the tobacco fields. Mr. Riach, perhaps from caution, would never suffer me to say another word about my story; the captain, whom I tried to approach, rebuffed me like a dog and would not hear a word; and as the days came and went, my heart sank lower and lower, till I was even glad of the work which kept me from thinking.|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} day {{was drawing}} to a close, and as I watched the sun slide down behind multi-colored clouds, its satellite rays trailing after, it seemed that with it went something of the human quality of this earth, leaving me alone {{in the presence of}} the unknown. Standing topside in the prow, <b>I</b> could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> watch the slender ship cut the never-ending swells. On either side, the smooth hull sent the backwash sliding along its sides, crested with foam at first, and gradually spiralling out into shining ripples amidships, all the while roaring like a hungry beast. But the water 2 ̆ 7 s rest was not for long, the pounding propeller catching and churning the mass up again, and then, their savagery gratified, leaving it to lose itself in the immensity of the ocean...|$|R
