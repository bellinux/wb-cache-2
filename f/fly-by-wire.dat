5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} <b>fly-by-wire</b> commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many <b>fly-by-wire</b> fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The <b>fly-by-wire</b> system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The <b>fly-by-wire</b> system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
5|$|The A320 was {{the first}} civil {{airliner}} to include a full digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight control system. At {{the time of the}} aircraft's introduction, the behaviour of the <b>fly-by-wire</b> system equipped with full flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of <b>fly-by-wire</b> is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The <b>fly-by-wire</b> system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of <b>fly-by-wire</b> facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The <b>fly-by-wire</b> system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|A single Jaguar was {{converted}} into the Jaguar Active Control Technology (ACT) with <b>fly-by-wire</b> controls and aerodynamic alterations to the airframe; the aerodynamic instability improved manoeuvrability {{and the test}} data {{was used in the}} development of the Eurofighter.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the An-124, the An-70 design makes {{extensive}} use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance. Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on control surfaces and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used {{for the rest of}} the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000hours over 15,000flights. The prototypes had a <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a four-channel digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> system. Aircraft and system information are mainly relayed to the pilot and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary electro-mechanical instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Su-37: Technology demonstrator, {{converted}} from the eleventh developmental Su-27M (T10M-11). The Su-37 featured a digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight-control system, a glass cockpit, the N011M radar, and AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. The aircraft was later fitted with standard-production AL-31F engines, and had its flight-control system and cockpit systems revised.|$|E
5|$|KC-767 Tanker Transport – the 767-200ER-based aerial {{refueling}} platform {{operated by the}} Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare), and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Modifications conducted by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems include {{the addition of a}} <b>fly-by-wire</b> refueling boom, strengthened flaps, and optional auxiliary fuel tanks, as well as structural reinforcement and modified avionics. The four KC-767Js ordered by Japan have been delivered. The Aeronautica Militare received the first of its four KC-767As in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|Su-35UB: Two-seat trainer {{designed}} and built by KnAAPO. The single aircraft (T-10UBM-1) featured the canards and taller vertical tails of the Su-27M and a forward fuselage similar to the Su-30MKK. The Su-35UB also shared the avionics suite of the Su-30MKK, although it had a different <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight-control system to accommodate the canards. The aircraft was powered by AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. Although a training aircraft, the Su-35UB {{was designed to be}} fully combat-capable.|$|E
5|$|The first {{member of}} the A320 {{aircraft}} family was the A320, which first flew on 22 February 1987 after the program was launched in March 1984. The family was soon extended to include the stretched A321 (first delivery 1994), the shortened A319 (first delivery 1996), and the further shortened A318 (first delivery 2003). The A320 family pioneered the use in commercial aircraft of digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight control systems, as well as side stick controls.|$|E
5|$|The first {{member of}} the A320 family—the A320—was {{launched}} in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was first delivered in March 1988 to launch customer Air France. The family was extended to include the A321 (first delivered 1994), the A319 (1996), and the A318 (2003). The A320 family pioneered the use of digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight control systems, as well as side-stick controls, in commercial aircraft. There has been a continuous improvement process since introduction.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the <b>fly-by-wire</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E
5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{introduced}} {{a number of}} advanced technologies with the 777 design, including fully digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> controls, fully software-configurable avionics, Honeywell LCD glass cockpit flight displays, and the first use of a fiber optic avionics network on a commercial airliner. Boeing made use of work done on the cancelled Boeing 7J7 regional jet, which utilized similar versions of the chosen technologies. In 2003, Boeing began offering the option of cockpit electronic flight bag computer displays. In 2013, Boeing announced that the upgraded 777X models would incorporate airframe, systems, and interior technologies from the 787.|$|E
5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|KC-767 Advanced Tanker – the 767-200ER-based aerial tanker {{developed}} for the USAF KC-X tanker competition. It is {{an updated version of}} the KC-767, originally selected as the USAF's new tanker aircraft in 2003, designated KC-767A, and then dropped amid conflict of interest allegations. The KC-767 Advanced Tanker is derived from studies for a longer-range cargo version of the 767-200ER, and features a <b>fly-by-wire</b> refueling boom, a remote vision refueling system, and a 767-400ER-based flight deck with LCD screens and head-up displays. Boeing was awarded the KC-X contract to build a 767-based tanker, to be designated KC-46A, in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|The wing profile {{remained}} {{the same as the}} F-5E, but had modified leading edge extensions (LEX), which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12% with an increase in wing area of only 1.6%. The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch, so the horizontal stabilizer was increased in size by 30% and a new dual-channel <b>fly-by-wire</b> control system was added. Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach0.8 and 15,000ft (4,572m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16's 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% higher than those of the F-5E.|$|E
5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and operational research, {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's <b>fly-by-wire</b> control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the <b>fly-by-wire</b> system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
5|$|The Panavia Tornado is a multirole, twin-engined {{aircraft}} {{designed to}} excel at low-level penetration of enemy defences. The mission envisaged during the Cold War was {{the delivery of}} conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe; this dictated several significant features of the design. Variable wing geometry, allowing for minimal drag during the critical low-level dash towards a well-prepared enemy, had been desired from the project's start. Advanced navigation and flight computers, including the then-innovative <b>fly-by-wire</b> system, greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during low-level flight and eased control of the aircraft. For long range bombing missions, the Tornado has a retractable refuelling probe.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.|$|E
5|$|While sharing broadly the blended {{wing-body}} {{design of}} the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version {{by the addition of}} canards, which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft, the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing leading-edge extension, redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-g manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 g on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement. More importantly, when working with the relaxed-stability design and the accompanying <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight-control system, the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target. Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller vertical tails, provisions for in-flight refuelling and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.|$|E
25|$|The AGC {{formed the}} basis of an {{experimental}} <b>fly-by-wire</b> (FBW) system installed into an F-8 Crusader to demonstrate the practicality of computer driven FBW. The AGC used in {{the first phase of the}} program was replaced with another machine in the second phase, and research done on the program led to the development of <b>fly-by-wire</b> systems for the Space Shuttle. The AGC also led, albeit indirectly, to the development of <b>fly-by-wire</b> systems for the generation of fighters that were being developed at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{most modern}} version is the F-15 Advanced, which {{features}} <b>fly-by-wire</b> controls.|$|E
25|$|Optical fiber <b>fly-by-wire</b> Ship Control System replaces {{electro-hydraulic}} {{systems for}} control surface actuation.|$|E
25|$|UH-60M Upgrade Black Hawk: UH-60M with <b>fly-by-wire</b> {{system and}} Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) cockpit suite. Flight testing began in August 2008.|$|E
25|$|Several {{modified}} F-8s {{were used}} by NASA in the early 1970s, proving the viability of both digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> and supercritical wings.|$|E
25|$|A <b>fly-by-wire</b> (FBW) system replaces {{manual flight}} control of an {{aircraft}} {{with an electronic}} interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the <b>fly-by-wire</b> term), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the expected response. Commands from the computers are also input without the pilot's knowledge to stabilize the aircraft and perform other tasks. Electronics for aircraft flight control systems {{are part of the}} field known as avionics.|$|E
25|$|One key {{innovation}} of the rotorcraft is the four-channel <b>fly-by-wire</b> {{control system}} employed; the NH90 {{is the first}} helicopter {{in the world to}} be equipped with full <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight controls. A four-axis autopilot is also integrated with the <b>fly-by-wire</b> system, as are mission and navigation systems to enable greater autonomy during operations and to reduce pilot workload. The flight envelope of the NH90 is capable of all-weather day-and-night operations, ship-borne operations during high sea states, across a temperature range from −40°C to +50°C, and up to a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet. Power is provided by a pair of turboshaft engines, dependent on customer selection, the NH90 is either fitted with Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 or General Electric T700E powerplants; exhaust gases from the engines are filtered through an infrared suppression system for decreased sensory visibility. According to Airbus Helicopters, the NH90 possesses the lowest radar signature in its class, principally due to its diamond-shaped composite fuselage.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, Airbus {{rolled out}} new design {{advances}} to {{a gathering of}} 100 representatives from existing and potential XWB customers. The A350 XWB {{is based on the}} technologies developed for Airbus A380 and includes a similar cockpit and <b>fly-by-wire</b> systems layout.|$|E
25|$|The Apollo Guidance Computer {{software}} {{influenced the}} design of Skylab, Space Shuttle and early <b>fly-by-wire</b> fighter aircraft systems. The AGC code was uploaded to the internet in 2003, and the software itself was uploaded by a former NASA intern to GitHub on July 7, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{program was}} {{introduced}} in April 2008, Embraer planned to invest US$750 million and to introduce the larger model in 2012 and the smaller in 2013. Honeywell HTF7500E turbofans were selected along a Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion avionics suite integrated cockpit and a Parker Hannifin <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight control system.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Air France was {{a launch}} {{customer}} for the <b>fly-by-wire</b> (FBW) A320 narrowbody twin, along with Air Inter and British Caledonian. It {{became the first}} airline to take delivery of the A320 in March 1988, and along with Air Inter became the first airlines to introduce Airbus A320 service on short-haul routes.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 Bombardier {{decided to}} {{redesign}} its wing, and along other development challenges it has delayed the programme by over two years. The redesign {{goal was to}} reduce its weight without altering its aerodynamic profile. The aircraft <b>fly-by-wire</b> system architecture {{is based on the}} CSeries one. Its airframe will use Aluminium-lithium alloys like the new airliner.|$|E
