5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focusing,</b> which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|Historically, CDGs are {{classified}} as Types I and II (CDG-I and CDG-II), depending on the nature and location of the biochemical defect in the metabolic pathway relative to the action of oligosaccharyltransferase.

HDP are known to interfere with <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focussing,</b> a cornerstone of fractionation strategies for the identification of proteins by mass spectrometry. In addition to the challenge presented by this material, as in most proteomes, there exists in this parasite a considerable dynamic range between proteins {{of high and low}} abundance. The enzymes of the folate pathway, a proven and widely used drug target, are included in the latter class.

In the experiments, four bubble separation parameters were used with β-lactoglobulin, albumin bovine, and starch (soluble) preferred as foaming agents and without additives. The enrichment of glycyrrhizic acid ammonium salt into the foam was influenced by different additive substances. The results showed that highest enrichment values were obtained from β-lactoglobulin as much as 368. 3 times. The lowest enrichment values (5. 9 times) were determined for the application without additive. After enrichment, each experiment of glycyrrhizic acid ammonium salt confirmed that these substances could be quantitatively enriched into the collection vessel with <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focused</b> adsorptive bubble separation technique.

Their main features were psychomotor retardation, cerebral and cerebellar atrophy and fluctuating hormone levels (e.g.prolactin, FSH and GH).

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple and rapid method is presented for {{the extraction of}} protein from adult tissues of four species of Pinus. Protein was extracted using a low pH mixture containing reducing agents, thiols, and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone. The protein interferring components were separated and removed from the protein solution on a Sephadex column. Protein extracted using this method {{was found to be}} useful for separation and analysis by electrophoresis and <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focussing,</b> for enzyme analysis following separation by these techniques, and for antibody production used in serological techniques. These techniques were evaluated for their ability to provide information on the taxonomy of the Pinus species examined.

The relationship between these species suggested by the results support the division of the genus Pinus into two subgenera, Haploxylon and Diploxylon, as suggested by Koehne (1893).

2500|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) is {{a family}} of electrokinetic separation methods performed in submillimeter diameter capillaries and in micro- and nanofluidic channels. Very often, CE refers to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), but other electrophoretic techniques including capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), capillary <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focusing</b> (CIEF), capillary isotachophoresis and micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) belong also to this class of methods. In CE methods, analytes migrate through electrolyte solutions {{under the influence of}} an electric field. Analytes can be separated according to ionic mobility and/or partitioning into an alternate phase via non-covalent interactions. Additionally, analytes may be concentrated or [...] "focused" [...] by means of gradients in conductivity and pH.|$|E
2500|$|Separation of the {{proteins}} by isoelectric point is called <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focusing</b> (IEF). Thereby, a gradient of pH {{is applied to}} a gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel, making one end more positive than the other. [...] At all pH values other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged. [...] If they are positively charged, they will be pulled towards the more negative end of the gel {{and if they are}} negatively charged they will be pulled to the more positive end of the gel. [...] The proteins applied in the first dimension will move along the gel and will accumulate at their isoelectric point; that is, {{the point at which the}} overall charge on the protein is 0 (a neutral charge).|$|E
2500|$|Before {{separating}} the proteins by mass, {{they are treated}} with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) along with other reagents (SDS-PAGE in 1-D). [...] This denatures the proteins (that is, it unfolds them into long, straight molecules) and binds a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's length. [...] Because a protein's length (when unfolded) is roughly proportional to its mass, this is equivalent to saying that it attaches a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's mass. [...] Since the SDS molecules are negatively charged, {{the result of this}} is that all of the proteins will have approximately the same mass-to-charge ratio as each other. [...] In addition, proteins will not migrate when they have no charge (a result of the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focusing</b> step) therefore the coating of the protein in SDS (negatively charged) allows migration of the proteins in the second dimension (SDS-PAGE, it [...] is not compatible for use in the first dimension as it is charged and a nonionic or zwitterionic detergent needs to be used).|$|E

40|$|The storage globulins of Vicia faba were {{extracted}} and {{the component}} proteins separated using various procedures. The sub-unit {{structures of the}} resulting globulin fractions were investigated and, {{in the case of}} legumin, the isolation of the constituent sub-units examined. These sub-units were characterised using gel electrophoresis, <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focussing,</b> amino acid composition, N-terminal amino acid and N-terminal sequence data. Possible causes of artifactual heterogeneity and anomalous behaviour in gel electrophoresis and gel <b>isoelectric</b> <b>focussing</b> were discussed. The onset of synthesis and composition of the globulins during seed development were investigated. Legumin was prepared in a very pure form by extraction in a neutral saline buffer followed by zonal isoelectric precipitation; in contrast, vicilin, prepared by this method, was contaminated with legumin. Structural studies on legumin indicated that it was composed of equimolar proportions of two types of sub-unit, acidic (a) and basic (P), with molecular weights of 36, 200 and 22, 000 respectively. <b>Isoelectric</b> <b>focussing,</b> sequence data and electrophoresis in a variety of gel systems showed these sub-units to be heterogeneous, and, on the basis of electrophoretic information five sub-units were positively identified viz, ɑ(_ 1), ɑ(_ 2),β(_ 1),β(_ 2) and β(_ 3). It was proposed that legumin consisted of twelve sub-units, six acidic and six basic, but because of the heterogeneous nature of the a and g sub-units, the exact composition of the native legumin molecule could not be ascertained. The possibility of naturally-occurring variants of legumin was suggested. The proposed sub-unit model was compared with those published for other legumin-like seed proteins. Vicilin was formed prior to legumin during seed development, although the rate of synthesis of the latter was faster, so that in the mature seed the ratio of legumin to vicilin was between 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 by weight. While the sub-unit structure of legumin, as examined by SDS gel electrophoresis, remained reasonably constant during seed development, that of vicilin changed, suggesting the existence of more than one protein in the vicilin fraction. Together with this evidence, results from electrophoretic studies of various preparations of the 4. 7 soluble globulin (vicilin) indicated that the latter probably consisted of at least three distinct proteins...|$|R
