5|$|By {{the time}} the provincial {{election}} was called in September 2011, support for Dunderdale, her government and the Progressive Conservatives <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> in public opinion polls. However, her party entered the campaign with support levels in the high fifties and Dunderdale remained the top choice for premier. On October 11, 2011, Dunderdale led her party to victory winning 56 per cent of the popular vote, which was consistent with polling throughout the campaign. After an initial bounce in the polls following the election, support for Dunderdale would decline right up until her resignation as premier in 2014. Throughout 2012, Dunderdale saw her personal numbers take a big hit, while PC Party support and government satisfaction would also decline. In November 2012, 36 per cent of respondents to a CRA poll thought Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, down from 59 per cent a year earlier. Although the Progressive Conservatives still remained in first place their support <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> 14 points over the year to 46 per cent. While government satisfaction <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> it remained high, with 58 percent of respondents either being completely or mostly satisfied. An Angus Reid poll released in December 2012, also showed declining support for Dunderdale over the year. Just 37 per cent of those polled approved of the job Dunderdale was doing as premier, while 55 per cent disapproved.|$|E
