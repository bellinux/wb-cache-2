40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is the {{research}} of a possibility of a direct and reverse titration usage for the critical pH determination. pH value change of the silicate-alkali mixture was analyzed while addition of alkalis, salt water and sodium hydrogen carbonate solutions. Methods: Methods of direct and reverse titration were used for the determination of various additives influence on results of pH measuring of sodium silicate mixtures. Results: Additives method or reverse titration of the alkali solution are the most appropriate methods for the determination of <b>free</b> <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> in silicate solutions. Dilution of silicate-alkali solutions by salt water or its model leads to the faster decrease of pH value, than in case of water without any salts of hardness. Hydrogen carbonates influence should be accounted when execution of accurate calculations used in the development of silicate-alkali mixtures usage technology. Discussion: Alkali-silicate mixtures would be solutions for a long time when filtration proceeds in the porous medium at рН > рН crit. The time of such solutions existence must be characterized by a before inductive period. When reaching the critical pH value, a gel is formed during an inductive period or the time of gel formation. As a rule, the before inductive period is in ten times or even more greater than the time of gel formation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Alkali silica reation (ASR) is {{a common}} {{deterioration}} mechanism of concrete. During ASR, reactive aggregate containing silicon oxide (SiO 2) can react with the alkaline fluid in the concrete pores. To test whether a concrete mix is prone to ASR, several concrete prism tests (CPT) are developed. Performance tests are defined as a CPT where the alkali content in the concrete is {{comparable to that of}} a conventional concrete. During CPT, leaching or ingress of alkalis can affect the result of the test, as proven by Lindgård et al. (2013 b). However, Lindgård measured leaching and ingress by testing the leachate, lining and wrapping in the test container for alkali, but not the prisms themselves. In my master thesis project, I have investigated four concrete prisms that have been tested with different concrete prism performance tests. The prisms had experienced different degrees of leaching or ingress according to Lindgårds measurements. The prisms were cut and ground to give concrete powder samples that I tested using cold water extraction (CWE) and hot acid extraction (HAE). Aggregates were also ground and tested with these methods to account for alkali contribution from the aggregates during CWE and HAE. All samples were tested with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the paste content. CWE and HAE produced solutions which were measured for alkali content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results were compared to the expected alkali content in the prisms given from the alkali content in the cement from the recipe, minus the measured leaching or ingress. I have investigated all measurements and calculations, and calculated the error based on these. The calculations of errors are based on the principle of error propagation, and I assume all errors are uncorrelated. My results show that HAE is not suitable for measuring total alkali content. CWE does not measure the expected 50 - 60 % of the expected alkali content, but gives consistent results that are not affected by contribution from the aggregates. <b>Free</b> <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> measured CWE has low errors. Leaching and ingress is indicated in the bulk samples, but the ground profiles does not give any conclusive evidence because of alkali redistribution due to drying. However, transportation of alkali {{from the top of the}} prisms to the bottom is indicated, aswell as leaching in the top and bottom surfaces of the prisms. Because I have not been able to measure the total alkali content, I am not able to prove alkali release from aggregates, due to HAE not being able to measure total alkali content. For a future study XRF should be used for this...|$|E

40|$|From a {{material}} viewpoint, modern concrete’s frequent propensity to plastic shrinkage cracking can {{be attributable to}} a combination of low water-binder ratio use and ever-changing properties of binding materials. To obtain a better understanding of this phenomenon, this paper explores the effects of cement fineness and <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> on the plastic shrinkage cracking of concrete manufactured with two water-binder ratios. Results indicate that within the range 275 – 385 m 2 /kg, cement specific surface area is approximately directly and inversely proportional to hydration rate and evaporation rate respectively; a trend generally leading to higher plastic shrinkage and resulting areas of plastic cracking. Similar effects were observed for <b>alkali</b> <b>contents</b> which resulted in increased levels of plastic shrinkage. Furthermore, while decreasing crack tendency was noted as <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> increased from 0. 4 to 0. 8 % by mass of cement, further increases in <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> caused significant decreases of compressive strength and slump; thereby lowering overall concrete performance. It is also found that plastic shrinkage cracking is closely related to the kinetics of plastic shrinkage. In summary, the experimental programme confirmed that cement with relatively low surface area (less than 340 m 2 /kg) and low <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> (less than 0. 8 %) is preferred for modern concretes with minimal plastic cracking problems...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> in cement and the molecular weight of PNS on the properties of cement pastes and concretes. Moreover, the dispersing mechanism of the PNS superplasticizer and the role of alkali in the dispersing mechanism are also proposed in this study. Six cements, having a wide range of C 3 A and Na 2 O equivalent contents, have been carefully selected for this study. Three commercial PNS superplasticizers, having different molecular weights, were selected and were characterized by their molecular weight distribution. The results obtained from the study of the effects of <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> show that there is an optimum <b>content</b> of soluble <b>alkali</b> with respect to fluidity and fluidity loss, which was found to be 0. 4 - 0. 5 % Na 2 O soluble equivalent in the cements. It was found that there is not a close relation between the total alkali and the soluble <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> measured in the cement pastes having a W/C = 0. 35. Therefore, it is important to measure the soluble <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> rather than the total <b>alkali</b> <b>content.</b> It was found that the three incompatible cements containing a low amount of soluble alkalies have a tendency to adsorb a high amount of PNS superplasticizer, while the three compatible cements containing a higher amount of soluble alkalies do not, leaving a higher amount of PNS superplasticizer in solution. It was found that the influence of the molecular weight of PNS superplasticizer on the rheological behavior of cement pastes depends greatly on the <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> in the cement; relatively high-molecular-weight PNS is more effective in fluidizing pastes made with high-alkali cements than low-molecular-weight PNS, however, PNS molecular weight has little effect in fluidizing pastes made with low-alkali cements. However, in the study on concretes, the high-molecular weight PNS is always better in improving the fluidity of concretes than low-molecular weight PNS. The fluidity of cement pastes containing a high molecular weight PNS is more affected by the addition of Na 2 SO 4 because the amount of large molecules remaining in solution is determined by the <b>alkali</b> <b>content</b> in the cement.

The relationship between the pore solution alkalinity and ASR was explored by the use of expansive mortar bars submerged in alkaline solutions of varying concentration. This technique enabled the blended cement's control over expansion to be assessed at given `pore solution' alkali concentrations. It was established that the cement blend, the concentration and quantity of alkali present in the pore solution were the factors which determined the rate and extent of ASR.

Hence, in many instances the fly ash has already been incorporated into concrete before the test results are available. This complicates the job of the fly ash marketing agencies and it leads to disputes with fly ash users who often are concerned with accepting projects that contain materials that fail to meet specification limits.
