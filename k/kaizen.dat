40|$|AbstractThe ceramic {{industry}} has witnessed fast growth in emerging {{and developing countries}} primarily due to growth in power, construction and housing sectors. The production of ceramic products can be divided in to two distinct phases: pre-kiln operations and post-kiln operations. The rejections in pre-kiln operations can be pushed back into the process without much loss to the environment. However, the post-kiln rejections cannot be recycled. Also, most of the energy is spent in the kiln process leading to high damage to environment. This paper presents {{a case study of}} {{ceramic industry}} to reduce the post-kiln rejections in the manufacturing of insulators for power sector. Ishikawa diagrams have been used to find the root causes of various rejections in post-kiln operations. The implementation of simple <b>kaizens</b> has led to more than 40 % reduction in post-kiln rejections thus saving energy and loss to environment...|$|R
2500|$|In the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin {{was very}} {{impressed}} by Taylorism, which he and Joseph Stalin sought to incorporate into Soviet manufacturing. Taylorism and the mass production methods of Henry Ford thus became highly influential {{during the early years}} of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, [...] " [...] Frederick Taylor's methods have never really taken root in the Soviet Union." [...] The voluntaristic approach of the Stakhanovite movement in the 1930s of setting individual records was diametrically opposed to Taylor's systematic approach and proved to be counter-productive. The stop-and-go of the production process – workers having nothing to do at the beginning of a month and 'storming' during illegal extra shifts at the end of the month – which prevailed even in the 1980s had nothing to do with the successfully taylorized plants e.g., of Toyota which are characterized by continuous production processes (heijunka) which are continuously improved (<b>kaizen).</b>|$|E

50|$|In the Toyota Way Fieldbook, Liker and Meier {{discuss the}} <b>kaizen</b> blitz and <b>kaizen</b> burst (or <b>kaizen</b> event) {{approaches}} to continuous improvement. A <b>kaizen</b> blitz, or rapid improvement, is a focused activity {{on a particular}} process or activity. The basic concept is to identify and quickly remove waste.

30|$|The central {{premise of}} {{statistical}} process control (SPC) is that operators should refrain from adjusting the process providing the part-to-part variability produced by a stable process is within the control limits. To needlessly adjust such a process is to tamper with it (Deming 1986). Yet that assumes that the process genuinely is stable, which {{is not always the}} case. In general, a process may have episodes of stability punctuated by instability, and it is not always possible, except in hindsight, for operators to determine when the transitions are occurring. Furthermore, it is impractical to control every variable within a production process, and everything that is not being controlled may be changed by operators. Indeed, a quality culture expects operators to be taking initiative to improve quality and productivity in their work area, hence quality circles and <b>kaizens.</b> Consequently, there are conflicting organisational forces that discourage operator intervention in some situations and encourage it in others. This leads to incongruence, and difficulty in knowing how to handle the borderline processes where stability is weak, or the variable is not designated for active control.|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} Gas Lift Mandrels(GLM) {{in the oil}} and gas {{industry}} is expected to increase over the next few years, requiring Schlumberger's GLM assembly line to increase their manufacturing capacity. Given the labor-intensive nature of Schlumberger's GLM assembly line, other than implementing <b>kaizens</b> and purchasing more equipment, it is important to also consider manpower issues. This research analyzes manpower management issues in the GLM assembly line to meet the projected increase in customer demand over the next three years. A detailed time study was conducted to understand and characterize all processes in the assembly line, before manpower plans were drawn up for each year till 2013. Several manpower scheduling concepts were incorporated in the manpower plan, such as Job Rotation and Workforce Flexibility to optimize the rate of utilization, human performance and well-being. By clustering processes together, the labor utilization rate can be increased to more than ninety percent. A new position of grinders has also been proposed to assist in various grinding operations, in order to reduce the cycle times of processes, to help workers gain better focus in their work and to reduce the cost of labor. by Shao Chong Oh.

40|$|Companies today {{constantly}} seek {{to lower}} costs, maintain {{high level of}} quality and improve delivery for both manufactured products and services to achieve and sustain competitive advantage. Most companies seek to achieve all this through the implementation of continuous improvement initiatives. Amongst the various continuous improvement initiatives, Lean and Six Sigma {{have been the most}} popular and widely adopted. In recent years, the term Lean Six Sigma has been used to describe a management initiative or framework that combines these two proven methodologies. This management project is a case study research of an aviation facility in Singapore that first implemented Six Sigma in 1996, before introducing Lean and combining both initiatives together as Lean Six Sigma in 2005. Qualitative research techniques, namely semi-structured interviews and documentation, were used for primary and secondary data collection. The research findings revealed that Lean is increasingly being applied and valued at the facility, although Six Sigma tools remain dominant in projects while Lean tools are used mainly during Lean events (AWOs and <b>Kaizens).</b> Four challenges to Lean Six Sigma implementation were successfully identified, namely lack of employees trained in Lean, inadequate Lean training curriculum, poor planning and implementation, and lack of benefit identification. This purpose of this research is to identify the challenges to Lean Six Sigma implementation and provide recommendations for the management’s consideration.
