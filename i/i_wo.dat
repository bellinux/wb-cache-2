Finally she set out again on 9 September, joining other U-boats in mid-Atlantic. On 22 September, the U-boat was attacked by a B-24 Liberator, wounding the commander.

Johann-Friedrich Wessels left Kiel on 16 November 1939. U-47 attacked a British cruiser on 28 November 1939. Prien had identified the ship to be a London-class cruiser. Prien intended to launch a spread of three torpedoes, but only a single torpedo cleared the tube and detonated {{in the wake of the}} cruiser. When the periscope cleared the surface, Prien observed what he believed major damage to the stern of the cruiser, her starboard torpedo launchers dislogded and an aircraft tilted. U-47 surfaced and tried to pursue the cruiser but was driven off by depth charges dropped from the escort. It turned out the cruiser was [...] which was slightly damaged by the detonation. The attack was reported in the daily Wehrmachtbericht on 29 November 1939, claiming the destruction of the cruiser. The war diary of the Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU) on 17 December 1939 stated that even though a hit was observed the cruiser was not sunk.|$|E

40|$|The {{asymmetry}} of Daubechies' scaling {{functions and}} wavelets can be diminished by minimizing a special second {{moment in time}} for the wavelet generating discrete-time filter. The moment is involved in an uncertainty relation for discrete-time signals. Other measures of asymmetry are addressed too and corresponding results compared. I INTRODUCTION Daubechies' wavelets are continuous-time functions whose mother wavelet has a finite support width. They constitute an orthonormal basis for the functions of finite energy [1, 2]. Moreover the mother wavelet w(ø) has the highest number of vanishing moments for a given support width, where N vanishing moments mean + 1 Z Γ 1 ø <b>i</b> <b>w(ø)</b> dø = 0; (1) for i = 0; 1; : : :; N Γ 1.

40|$|M. A. Research on Type A {{behaviour}} {{has produced}} many contradictory results. Some studies, for example, {{have found that}} Type A individuals experience less work satisfaction, and others that they experience more work satisfaction. In the light of these contradictions, some researchers are {{of the opinion that}} Type A behaviour has to be explored as a multidimensional instead of a global construct. Some components of Type A behaviour have been proved to have healthy consequences, while others have been proved to be "toxic" and therefore have different correlations with personality factors. This study explored the differential relationships of <b>I</b> <b>wo</b> components of Type A behaviour, namely -achievement-striving and impatience-irritability, with academic achievement, self concept and preference Ibr sensation, a Jungian personality factor. Two groups of students, in Accounting and Psychology respectively, served as research subjects. Data for 25 men and 24 women taking Accountancy 1, and 19 men and 68 women taking Psychology 1, was gathered with regard to achievement-striving, impatienceirritability, academic aptitude, scholastic achievement, self-concept and preference for sensation. As predicted, achievement-striving correlated positively with academic achievement for - most groups. Impatience-irritability correlated negatively with academic achievement for some groups. Achievement-striving showed a positive relationship and impatienceirritatability a negative relationship with self-concept, also as predicted. Achievementstriving showed a positive relationship with preference for sensation and impatienceirritability correlated negatively with preference for sensation. No prediction was made with regard to the direction of the relationship for preference for sensation, yet the negative correlation found between preference for sensation and impatience-irritability came as a surprise. Attempts have been made to explain this finding. Subject groups were small and the abovementioned relationships were not statistically significant for all group...|$|E
