5|$|In February 1941, Roosevelt sent Conant to Britain {{as head of}} {{a mission}} that also {{included}} Frederick L. Hovde from Purdue University and Carroll L. Wilson from MIT, to evaluate the research being carried out there and the prospects for cooperation. The 1940 Tizard Mission had revealed that American technology was some years behind that of Britain in many fields, most notably radar, and cooperation was eagerly sought. Conant <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Frederick Lindemann, his leading scientific adviser, and an audience with King George VI at Buckingham Palace. At a subsequent meeting, Lindemann told Conant about British progress towards developing an atomic bomb. What most impressed Conant was the British conviction that it was feasible. That the British program was ahead of the American one raised the possibility in Conant's mind that the German nuclear energy project might be even further ahead, as Germany was generally acknowledged to be a world leader in nuclear physics. Later that year, Churchill, as Chancellor of the University of Bristol, conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Conant in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Edward Norton {{flew out}} to Austin and met Malick, {{who had been}} {{impressed}} by the actor's screen test for Primal Fear. Matthew McConaughey reportedly took a day off filming A Time to Kill to see Malick. Others followed, including William Baldwin, Edward Burns, Josh Hartnett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Dorff, and Leonardo DiCaprio; the latter flew up from the Mexico set of Romeo + Juliet to meet Malick at the American Airlines lounge in the Austin airport. Before the casting was finalized, Nicolas Cage <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer {{only to find out}} that his phone number had been disconnected. Tom Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in Saving Private Ryan and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do Steven Spielberg's film instead. Actors Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time contraints. Publicity stills of Pullman (as Sgt. MacTae, in a scene opposite Brody and Chaplin) can be seen online, Haas is pictured in the booklet of the CD soundtrack, and one of Rourke's scenes was restored for the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film.|$|E

25|$|Days {{following}} the Second Vienna Award, the pro-German anti-Bolshevik régime of Prime Minister Marshal Ion Antonescu staged a coup d'état against Carol II, whom the Marshal {{claimed to be}} 'anti-German'. Antonescu suspended the Constitution, dissolved the Parliament, and re-installed the 18-year-old Michael as king, by popular acclaim in September 1940. (Although the Constitution was restored in 1944, and the Romanian Parliament in 1946, Michael did not either subsequently take a formal oath or have his reign approved retroactively by Parliament.) Michael was crowned with the Steel Crown and anointed King of Romania by the Orthodox Patriarch of Romania, Nicodim Munteanu, in the Patriarchal Cathedral of Bucharest, {{on the day of}} his accession, 6 September 1940. Although King Michael was formally the Supreme Head of the Army, and entitled to appoint the Prime Minister with full powers named 'Leader of the people' ("Conducător"), in reality he was forced to remain only a figurehead until August 1944. Michael <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Adolf Hitler twice, once with his father in Bavaria in 1937, and with his mother in Berlin in 1941. He also met Benito Mussolini in 1941, in Italy.|$|E

500|$|In 1984 Starkey {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and in 1994 a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

He {{has worked as}} curator on several exhibitions, {{including}} an exhibit in 2003 on Elizabeth I, following which he <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> her namesake, Elizabeth II. [...] Several years later he told a reporter that the monarch {{had no interest in}} her predecessors, other than those who followed her great grandfather. [...] "I don't think she's at all comfortable with anybody – I would hesitate to use the word intellectual – but it's useful. [...] I think she's got elements a bit like Goebbels in her attitude to culture – you remember: 'every time I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver.' [...] I think the queen reaches for her mask." [...] His remarks were criticised by Penny Junor, a royal biographer, and Robert Lacey, a royal historian.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Benchley {{worked as}} a {{freelance}} writer struggling to support his wife and children. In the meantime, his literary agent scheduled regular meetings with publishing house editors. One of them was Doubleday editor Thomas Congdon, who <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Benchley seeking book ideas. Congdon did not find Benchley's proposals for non-fiction interesting, but instead favored his idea for a novel about a shark terrorizing a beach resort. Benchley sent a page to Congdon's office, and the editor paid him $1,000 for 100 pages. Those pages would comprise the first four chapters, and the full manuscript received a $7,500 total advance. Congdon and the Doubleday crew were confident, seeing Benchley as [...] "something of an expert in sharks", given the author self-described [...] "knowing {{as much as any}} amateur about sharks" [...] as he had read some research books and seen the 1971 documentary Blue Water White Death. After Doubleday commissioned the book, Benchley then started researching all possible material regarding sharks. Among his sources were the Peter Matthiessen's Blue Meridian, Jacques Cousteau's The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea, Thomas B. Allen's Shadows In The Sea, and David H. Davies' About Sharks And Shark Attacks.|$|E

500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If I run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1942, Liberia {{signed a}} Defense Pact with the United States.

[...] The airport was originally built by the United States government as an Air Force base as part of these activities. [...] The runway was built long enough for B-47 Stratojet bombers to land for refueling, giving Liberia what was for many years the longest runway in Africa. President Franklin D.

2500|$|Later Alexander Cockburn criticised Hitchens for the {{affidavit}} he swore out against Sidney Blumenthal, in the Clinton impeachment trial, {{to the effect}} that [...] " [...] and his wife, Carol Blue, <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> White House aide Sidney Blumenthal last March 19 and that Blumenthal had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker". Effectively this left Blumenthal open to perjury charges and the additional costs that the legal proceedings would entail. It left a rift between Blumenthal and Hitchens. The major break was over the 'War on Terrorism' beginning in 2001 when Hitchens launched an attack on Noam Chomsky for the position he took in the aftermath of 9/11.

After Zhou politely offered to shake his hand, Dulles rudely turned his back and walked out of the room, saying [...] "I cannot". [...] Zhou was interpreted by onlookers as turning this moment of possible humiliation into a small victory by giving only a small, [...] "Gallic-style" [...] shrug to this behaviour. [...] Zhou was equally effective in countering Dulles' insistence that China not be given a seat at the sessions. [...] Furthering the impression of Chinese urbanity and civility, Zhou <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> British actor Charlie Chaplin, who had been living in Switzerland since being blacklisted in the United States for his radical politics.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1930s, Wallace K. Harrison had a {{personal}} relationship with Street. As a new partner in the architectural firm Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray, Harrison was invited to join other architects to design Rockefeller Center. Harrison was good friends with Street, who worked at National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and whom Harrison knew through his own wife, Ellen. During the planning of Rockefeller Center, the Metropolitan Opera dropped out as the main tenant; Harrison then needed a new tenant, so he <b>had</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> his friend, where Harrison told Street that {{he thought it would be}} best [...] "if it were NBC at Rockefeller Center broadcasting to the world". By this time, both NBC and RKO Pictures were under the control of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). After negotiations, RCA became the largest tenant for the central skyscraper of Rockefeller Center and RKO occupied the second building.|$|E
