5|$|Jean Beliveau's number 4 was {{retired in}} 1971 {{after he left}} the game as the all-time leading scorer in Stanley Cup playoff history. Beliveau was offered, but declined, the {{position}} of Governor General of Canada in 1994; he is the only hockey player known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to serve in this capacity. Guy Lafleur's number 10 followed in February 1985 after his first retirement. Lafleur was a six-time All-Star with the Canadiens, and won three scoring titles and two most valuable player awards. Also in 1985, Doug Harvey's number 2 was raised to the rafters. The defenceman won six Norris Trophies as the NHL's top defenceman in seven years between 1955 and 1961. Jacques Plante's number 1 was retired on October 17, 1995. Plante revolutionized the way goaltenders played the game, and he leads the Canadiens with 314career wins.|$|E
5|$|Walton's last {{work of the}} 1940s was {{his music}} for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On {{the advice of the}} BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's {{relations}} with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.|$|E

25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, Parliamentary {{elections}} have generally not {{resulted in a}} single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, Presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is {{in addition to the}} requirement that a Prime Minister prove he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote {{on the floor of the}} House) within weeks of being sworn into office.|$|E

He is further critical of how the Holmes County sheriff's office handled the investigation, saying they should have treated it as a crime scene from the beginning. In particular, he claims, the lie detector test that Taran passed was inadequate, as it had consisted of only three questions (he says he later learned that a properly administered examination with the device should take over an hour), and that Kelly and Cronin should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to take the test as well.|$|E

25|$|The Attorney General is a non-cabinet {{minister}} {{who leads the}} Attorney General's Office. The rule that no Attorney General may be a cabinet minister is a political convention rather than a law, and {{for a short time}} the Attorney General did sit in cabinet, starting with Lord Birkenhead in 1915 and ending with Douglas Hogg in 1928. There is nothing that prohibits Attorneys-General from attending meetings of the cabinet, and on occasion they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude Attorneys General from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which they are giving legal advice. As a government minister, the Attorney General is directly answerable to Parliament.|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} that the {{coalition}} between the Liberals and NDP would last until June 30, 2011, the proposed coalition having a cabinet of 24 ministers of the Crown, with {{the leader of the}} Liberal Party as prime minister, 17 other Liberal ministers (including the minister of finance), and six New Democratic ministers; if the prime minister chose a larger cabinet, the NDP proportion would be maintained. As the outgoing leader of the Liberal Party, Dion would have become prime minister, likely serving until the Liberal leadership convention in May 2009. Further, Liberal party elders Frank McKenna, Paul Martin, John Manley, and former NDP premier Roy Romanow, were reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to form an economic advisory body to the coalition if needed, though both McKenna and Manley declined to take part.|$|E
25|$|Griffith CJ & Barton J {{held that}} Melbourne Steamship {{could not be}} asked {{questions}} about pending prosecutions.

Barton J accepted that questions might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> for the purpose of prosecuting Melbourne Steamship, however the evidence as to the purpose of the investigation did not support that approach. Isaacs J agreed that once a prosecution had been commenced the investigation power in relation to a defendant had been exhausted. Isaacs J dissented on the basis that the motive of the Executive was irrelevant and that as Customs had the right to ask questions of a person who had not yet been charged, the request was lawful.|$|E
