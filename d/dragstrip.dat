Approximately 75% of the NASCAR industry's race teams, employees and drivers are based nearby.

500|$|The {{idea for}} Grindhouse came to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino when Tarantino set up {{screenings}} of double features in his house, complete with trailers before {{and in between}} the films. During one screening in 2003, Rodriguez noticed that he owned the same double feature movie poster as Tarantino for the 1957 films <b>Dragstrip</b> Girl and Rock All Night. Rodriguez asked Tarantino, [...] "I {{always wanted to do}} a double feature. Hey, why don't you direct one and I'll do the other?" [...] Tarantino quickly replied, [...] "And we've got to call it Grindhouse!" ...|$|E
50|$|The track {{measures}} 0.526 mi around, {{with a pair}} of 800 ft straightaways {{and tight}} turns banked at 12 degrees, described as two <b>dragstrips</b> with tight turns. The track was first paved in 1955. Unlike the superspeedways, Martinsville became a track where the skill and strategy of each individual driver could overcome the big money and horsepower of the larger teams.|$|R
2500|$|Hornets were {{campaigned on}} <b>dragstrips</b> from 1972 and became well known by their bold red, white, and blue graphics.

500|$|With {{early success}} {{following}} {{the opening of}} the track, the speedway began to expand reserved grandstand seating along the front stretch with an additional 15,777 seats. In May 1999, an additional 28 skyboxes were added {{to the top of the}} main grandstand. In 2001 the Auto Club Dragway, a 1/4 mile <b>dragstrip,</b> was built outside of the backstretch of the main speedway. That same year, the infield of the speedway was reconfigured to hold a multipurpose road course. On April 24, 2003 The San Bernardino County Planning Commission approved the changing of the speedway’s conditional use permit to allow the installation of lights around the track. Later that year NASCAR announced a second annual NASCAR Cup Series race at the track for the 2004 season, with the second race being run [...] "under the lights". NASCAR ran two weekends of racing annually until the 2011 season, when the track returned to a single annual race weekend.|$|E
500|$|The Amazing Colossal Man was {{released}} by a new company whose name was much bigger than its budgets. American International Pictures (AIP), founded in 1956 by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff in a reorganization of their American Releasing Corporation (ARC), soon became the leading U.S. studio devoted entirely to B-cost productions. American International helped keep the original-release double bill alive through paired packages of its films: these movies were low-budget, but instead of a flat rate, they were rented out on a percentage basis, like A films. The success of I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957) thus brought AIP a large return—made for about $100,000, it grossed more than [...] As the film's title suggests, the studio relied on both fantastic genre subjects and new, teen-oriented angles. When Hot Rod Gang (1958) turned a profit, hot rod horror was given a try: Ghost of <b>Dragstrip</b> Hollow (1959). David Cook credits AIP with leading the way [...] "in demographic exploitation, target marketing, and saturation booking, all of which would become standard procedure for the majors in planning and releasing their mass-market 'event' films" [...] by the late 1970s. In terms of content, the majors were already there, with [...] "J.D." [...] movies such as Warner Bros.' Untamed Youth (1957) and MGM's High School Confidential (1958), both starring Mamie Van Doren.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the speedway, there is a [...] <b>dragstrip</b> that hosts an annual NHRA event each year, the NHRA Thunder Valley Nationals. Prior to its status as an NHRA national event track, the Bristol Dragway was the flagship strip of the rival IHRA organization; the strip's owner Larry Carrier formed the IHRA at the Bristol Dragway in November 1970. The relationship ended when Bruton Smith took over its ownership. The <b>dragstrip</b> has long been nicknamed Thunder Valley due to its location and surrounding scenery.|$|E
50|$|New Hampshire Motor Speedway is an oval {{racetrack}} {{which has}} hosted several NASCAR and American Championship Car Racing races, whereas Lime Rock Park {{is a traditional}} road racing venue home of sports car races. Both NASCAR Cup races at New Hampshire Motor Speedway draw over 100,000 fans, thus making NHMS the largest capacity sports venue in New England.

2500|$|Bikes are {{typically}} built to impress {{with being the}} most extreme, and most innovative. For professional custom shops, the status as the first builder to introduce a new style or customization — a 300mm-series rear tire width, for example — is often hotly contested, and can pay dividends in media attention and in sales. Celebrity customers, such as rappers or NBA stars, also serve to build the credibility of a custom shop. The bikes themselves, at shows, racetracks, <b>dragstrips</b> and at build competitions, also serve as [...] "rolling billboards" [...] for their makers.|$|R
2500|$|The 1968 {{model year}} Rebels were {{introduced}} on 26 September 1967, and {{were no longer}} a Rambler in name. [...] The mid-sized models were now named the AMC Rebel, but little was changed except for the safety features and the mid-model year availability of the [...] AMX [...] V8 that was introduced for the new two-seat AMX model. For ten years AMC [...] "strictly observed the auto industry's anti-racing resolution" [...] but management changed and the AMC Rebel began to be campaigned on the <b>dragstrips.</b> The top-of-the-line model SST came standard with the [...] "Typhoon" [...] V8 while all the other models were available with the [...] I6 engine.|$|R
2500|$|In 1968, Ron Rosenberry {{drove the}} King Rebel of Ted McOsker using a blown fuel Chrysler Hemi engine {{and had a}} known best of 9.58 seconds at [...] in the quarter mile <b>dragstrip.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Auto Club Speedway, {{located in}} Fontana, opened in 1997. [...] It {{contains}} an oval, a road course, and a <b>dragstrip</b> for auto racing.

2500|$|Although the SC/360 {{could not}} compete with the {{holdover}} big-engined muscle cars, the SC combined respectable quickness (0 to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds and the 1/4 mile <b>dragstrip</b> in 14.9 at [...] with a taut suspension, big tires, and modest size; thus Motor Trend magazine described it as [...] "just a plain gas to drive... it handles like a dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|All engines {{incorporated}} new emissions controls. The 1973 [...] V8 {{was rated}} at net [...] and achieved 0 to 60 mph acceleration in 7.7seconds [...] {{with a top}} speed of , despite the Javelin's four-place size and weight. Performance figures conducted by Road Test magazine of a 1973 Javelin SST with the [...] 4-barrel V8 engine and 4-speed manual transmission resulted in [...] "respectable" [...] quarter-mile (402m) <b>dragstrip</b> runs of 15.5 seconds at [...]|$|E
2500|$|While V8 {{power was}} down for many {{domestic}} sedans, AMC used a [...] V8 engine that outpowered most other police vehicles. Tests of the 1972 AMC Javelin pony car and Matador sedan {{equipped with the}} 401 V8s resulted both running the quarter-mile <b>dragstrip</b> in the 14.7-second range. Zero to [...] times were within 7 seconds, comparable to a 2006 Hemi Charger police car. Top speed was about , which took 43 seconds, much faster than the previously used Plymouth Satellites.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1968 season, {{a new car}} {{was built}} and renamed the Grant Rebel SST and painted in the new hash red, white, and blue AMC {{corporate}} racing colors. With Hayden piloting, the car consistently ran the <b>dragstrip</b> in the mid-eight second range at speeds around [...] By the end of 1968, AMC dropped out of funny car racing to concentrate on its new Javelin pony car in SCCA Trans Am road racing, while Proffitt retired from racing for a few years.|$|E
