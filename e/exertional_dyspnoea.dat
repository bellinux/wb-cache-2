40|$|<b>Exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> {{is among}} the {{dominant}} symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure and progresses relentlessly as the disease advances, leading to reduced ability to function and engage in activities of daily living. Effective management of this disabling symptom awaits {{a better understanding of}} its underlying physiology. Cardiovascular factors are believed {{to play a major role}} in dyspnoea in heart failure patients. However, despite pharmacological interventions, such as vasodilators or inotropes that improve central haemodynamics, patients with heart failure still complain of <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea.</b> Clearly, dyspnoea is not determined by cardiac factors alone, but likely depends on complex, integrated cardio-pulmonary interactions. A growing body of evidence suggests that excessively increased ventilatory demand and abnormal “restrictive” constraints on tidal volume expansion with development of critical mechanical limitation of ventilation, contribute to <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> in heart failure. This article will offer new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> in patients with chronic heart failure by exploring the potential role of the various constituents of the physiological response to exercise and particularly the role of abnormal ventilatory and respiratory mechanics responses to exercise in the perception of dyspnoea in patients with heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Asthma is a {{heterogeneous}} condition, with dyspnoea during exercise affecting individuals to a variable degree. This narrative review explores the mechanisms and measurement of <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> in asthma and summarises {{the available evidence}} for the efficacy of various interventions on <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea.</b> Studies on the mechanisms of dyspnoea in asthma have largely utilised direct bronchoprovocation challenges, rather than exercise, which may invoke different physiological mechanisms. Thus, the description of dyspnoea during methacholine challenge can differ from what is experienced during daily activities, including exercise. Dyspnoea perception during exercise is influenced by many interacting variables, such as asthma severity and phenotype, bronchoconstriction, dynamic hyperinflation, respiratory drive and psychological factors. In addition to the intensity of dyspnoea, the qualitative description of dyspnoea may give important clues as to the underlying mechanism and {{may be an important}} endpoint for future interventional studies. There is currently little evidence demonstrating whether pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions specifically improve <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea,</b> which is an important area for future research...|$|E

40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is a fatal lung disease characterised by progressive remodelling {{of the small}} pulmonary vessels. The daily-life activities of patients with PAH are severely limited by <b>exertional</b> fatigue and <b>dyspnoea.</b> Typically, these symptoms have been explained by right heart failure. However, {{an increasing number of}} studies reveal that the impact of the PAH reaches further than the pulmonary circulation. Striated muscles other than the right ventricle are affected in PAH, such as the left ventricle, the diaphragm and peripheral skeletal muscles. Alterations in these striated muscles are associated with exercise intolerance and reduced quality of life. In this Back to Basics article on striated muscle function in PAH, we provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms causing muscle dysfunction in PAH and discuss potential new therapeutic strategies to restore muscle dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIn COPD, {{improvements}} in lung mechanics following bronchodilator, measured using the forced oscillation technique (FOT), {{are more sensitive}} than spirometry at detecting improvement in lung function following bronchodilator. The relationship between these {{improvements in}} lung mechanics and improvements in functional outcomes, such as <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea,</b> following bronchodilator, in COPD is unknown. Methods 17 COPD subjects were recruited into a double blind placebo controlled randomised cross over study. Dyspnoea was induced using a standardised six-minute walk test (6  MWT), and measured by borg score throughout the test. Measurement of respiratory system conductance (Grs), respiratory system reactance (Xrs), inspiratory capacity (IC) and spirometry were made at baseline and 1  h after a single dose of either 18  μg of tiotropium bromide plus 200  μg salbutamol, or placebo. ResultsSubjects had a mean baseline FEV 1 of 45. 5  ±  11. 0 % predicted. The bronchodilator induced reduction in <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> correlated significantly {{with the increase in}} Grs (rs =  0. 59, p =  0. 01) and approached significance with FEV 1 (rs =  0. 45, p =  0. 07) but not with FVC (rs =  0. 30, p =  0. 24), Xrs (rs =  0. 19, p =  0. 47) or IC (rs = − 0. 08, p =  0. 78). Increase in Grs was the best and sole predictor of reduction in <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea,</b> explaining 41 % of the variance. There was no additional contribution to the model from the increase in FEV 1 or IC. ConclusionBronchodilator induced improvements in <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> in moderate to severe COPD are predicted by improvements in Grs, measured by FOT, independent of improvements in spirometry or hyperinflation. The findings suggest that FOT may be useful for measuring response to bronchodilator in COPD...|$|E

40|$|The aortoventricular {{interface}} {{describes the}} functional syncytium between the left ventricle and proximal aorta, necessary for normal central haemodynamic operation. Normal function {{would be considered}} as providing for optimal passage of oxygenated blood delivered from the left ventricle through the aortic valve to the systemic circulation. Non-­‐optimal function of the aortic valve through congenital malformation or degenerative processes {{is associated with a}} clear constellation of clinical signs and symptoms and with a well established natural history. These can all be understood on the basis of loss of normal function. Narrowing of the aortic orifice results in decreased systemic blood pressure, syncope, decreased exercise ability, left ventricular remodelling compensating for increased wall stress, secondary mitral and atrial dysfunction and increased pulmonary pressures. Aortic incompetence with its well known features of left ventricular dilatation, <b>exertional</b> fatigue, <b>dyspnoea</b> and palpitations is also explained by the deranged haemodynamic effects due to loss of hydraulic separation (temporal and spatial) between the low and high pressure components across the aortoventricular interface. The common connection between these clinical entities is the disruption of appropriate flow across the left ventricular outflow tract – aortic valve – proximal aorta anatomical continuum. In health the structure of this interface functions to provide optimally matched volume blood flow with appropriate direction and timing for optimal energy utilisation and supply. Disturbance in the normal anatomy and its associated clinical symptoms or signs are well described but the failure in underlying function not usually acknowledged. This thesis aims, in the first instance, to review and, thereafter, to investigate, the potential influence of anatomy and function {{on both sides of the}} aortoventricular interface in populations without aortic valve disease, with aortic valve stenosis and post-­‐ treatment. Assessment based on modern anatomical imaging technology provides a concrete structural representation of left ventricular – aortic mechanisms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cardiopulmonary}} exercise testing (CPET) in the obese person, {{as in any}} cardiopulmonary exercise test, {{is to determine the}} patient's exercise tolerance, and to help identify and/or distinguish between the various physiological factors that could contribute to exercise intolerance. Unexplained dyspnoea on exertion is a common reason for CPET, but it is an extremely complex symptom to explain. Sometimes obesity is the simple answer by elimination of other possibilities. Thus, distinguishing among multiple clinical causes for <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> depends on the ability to eliminate possibilities while recognising response patterns that are unique to the obese patient. This includes the otherwise healthy obese patient, as well as the obese patient with potentially multiple cardiopulmonary limitations.

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) are progressively {{limited in their}} ability to undertake normal everyday activities by a combination of <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> and peripheral muscle weakness. COPD is characterised by expiratory flow limitation, resulting in air trapping and lung hyperinflation. Hyperinflation increases acutely under conditions such as exercise or exacerbations, with an accompanying sharp increase in the intensity of dyspnoea to distressing and intolerable levels. Air trapping, causing increased lung hyperinflation, can be present even in milder COPD during everyday activities. The resulting activity-related dyspnoea leads to a vicious spiral of activity avoidance, physical deconditioning, and reduced quality of life, and has implications for the early development of co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease. Various strategies exist to reduce hyperinflation, notably long-acting bronchodilator treatment (via reduction in flow limitation and improved lung emptying) and an exercise programme (via decreased respiratory rate, reducing ventilatory demand), or their combination. Optimal bronchodilation can reduce <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> and increase a patient’s ability to exercise, and improves the chance of successful outcome of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. There should be a lower threshold for initiating treatments appropriate to the stage of the disease, such as long-acting bronchodilators and an exercise programme fo...|$|E

40|$|Activity-related {{dyspnoea}} {{is often}} the most distressing symptom experienced by patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and can persist despite comprehensive medical management. It is now clear that dyspnoea during physical activity occurs across the spectrum of disease severity, even in those with mild airway obstruction. Our understanding of the nature and source of dyspnoea is incomplete, but current aetiological concepts emphasise the importance of increased central neural drive to breathe in the setting of a reduced ability of the respiratory system to appropriately respond. Since dyspnoea is provoked or aggravated by physical activity, its concurrent measurement during standardised laboratory exercise testing is clearly important. Combining measurement of perceptual and physiological responses during exercise can provide valuable insights into symptom severity and its pathophysiological underpinnings.

40|$|Abstract: Objective: A {{systematic}} review {{was carried out}} to determine the evidence for teaching pursed lips breathing (PLB) to patients with stable COPD. <b>Exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> {{is the single most}} important factor limiting function for people with COPD and PLB is commonly advocated for its management. Method: A literature search of Medline, PEDro and CINAHL Plus was conducted. Articles were included if they studied the effects of PLB in stable COPD and excluded when proxy interventions or significant modifications of PLB were used. Where comparable data were available they were pooled using weighted means. Results: Eleven studies involving 226 participants were included; four of the studies were of moderate quality according to The Grading of Recommendations Assessments, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, with the remaining studies being of low quality. Although no high quality evidence was identified, with the exception of one low quality study, the direction of effect for PLB was consistently towards benefit. Moderate quality evidence demonstrates that in stable COPD pursed lips breathing increases oxygen saturation and tidal volume, reduces respiratory rate during use at rest and reduces time taken to recover to pre-exercise breathlessness levels; one RCT showed reduction in <b>exertional</b> <b>dyspnoea</b> and improvement in functional performance at 3 months.

Chest examination revealed fine crepitations on lung bases. Bilateral hilar prominence were noted on chest X-ray (figure 2), confirmed on CT scan to be lymphadenopathy with interstitial thickening, parenchymal ground-glass appearance and architec-tural distortion. Histology from the skin (see online supplementary appendix) and lung lesions showed extensive non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. Culture from tissue and bronchial lavage for atyp-ical mycobacteria and deep fungal organisms were negative. These findings support the diagnosis of granulomatous tattoo reaction in association with systemic sarcoidosis. He was commenced on systemic corticosteroid therapy which improved his chest symptoms.
