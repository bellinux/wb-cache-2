5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> rear wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, {{the angle of the}} resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> rear wheels.|$|E

5000|$|Cold <b>fronts</b> <b>and</b> {{occluded}} <b>fronts</b> generally {{move from}} west to east, while warm fronts move poleward. Because {{of the greater}} density of air in their wake, cold <b>fronts</b> <b>and</b> cold occlusions move faster than warm <b>fronts</b> <b>and</b> warm occlusions. Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts. [...] When a <b>front</b> becomes stationary, <b>and</b> the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes, the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline. [...] This is most common over the open ocean.|$|R

5|$|Among the Eolambia {{specimens}} {{found to}} date, the best-preserved sacrum includes seven vertebrae. Given that this individual is immature, and hadrosaurs increase their sacral vertebra count with age, adults {{may have had}} more sacrals. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are amphicoelous, having both the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> back ends being concave. They have pedestal-like prezygapophyses and tab-like postzygapophyses, the latter of which are separated by a depression. The prezygapophyses lengthen to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink {{in the middle and}} rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (concave in <b>front</b> <b>and</b> convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well.|$|E
