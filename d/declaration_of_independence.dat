40|$|This article {{questions}} the common assumptions in legal theory regarding Derrida’s well-known <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independence.</b> Through a close reading of this text, well-known ground {{such as the}} relation between speech and writing, the notion of representation, speech act theory, the signature, and the proper name is covered. The contribution that this analysis makes in the present context lies in the additional ‘step’ that it takes. The article seeks to give {{an explanation of the}} laws at work in Derrida’s thinking in the above respects and to explain more specifically how they find expression in <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independence.</b> The article in this regard also investigates the importance and role of the ‘notions’ of death, loss of meaning, loss of ownership, and loss of sovereignty in Derrida’s thinking. The contention is that if we take account of Derrida’s reading in <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independence,</b> it is possible to view constitutions in a very different way, more specifically their ‘origins’, with inevitable implications for constitutional interpretation...|$|R

5|$|Historical {{coats of}} {{arms of the}} U.S. states {{date back to the}} {{admission}} of the first states to the Union. Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred to themselves as states shortly after the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independence,</b> and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War of Independence, {{although}} no formal <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> was issued {{at the time}} and the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A formal <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E

As he had done with the Tucumán Congress, San Martín urged a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence,</b> to legitimize the government and the military actions. The Chilean <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> was issued on 18 February 1818, one year after the battle of Chacabuco.|$|E
