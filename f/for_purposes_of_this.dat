25|$|Neither the DSM nor the ICD-10 {{diagnostic}} criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis {{can therefore be}} made based {{on the presence of}} fantasies or sexual urges even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. Acting on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts <b>for</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> diagnosis, and can sometimes include indecent exposure, voyeuristic or frotteuristic behaviors, or masturbating to child pornography. Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.|$|E
