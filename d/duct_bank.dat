50|$|Conduit may be {{installed}} underground between buildings, structures, or devices to allow installation {{of power and}} communication cables. An assembly of these conduits, often called a <b>duct</b> <b>bank,</b> may either be directly buried in earth, or encased in concrete (sometimes with reinforcing rebar to aid against shear forces). Alternatively, a <b>duct</b> <b>bank</b> may {{be installed}} in a utility tunnel. A <b>duct</b> <b>bank</b> will allow replacement of damaged cables between buildings or additional power and communications circuits to be added, without the expense of re-excavation of a trench. While metal conduit is occasionally used for burial, usually PVC, polyethylene or polystyrene plastics are now used due to lower cost, easier installation, and better resistance to corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The {{challenges}} {{posed by}} the complexity of estimating RCA and of estimating the local increase in ambient temperature obtained by co-locating many cables (in a <b>duct</b> <b>bank)</b> create a market niche in the electric power industry for software dedicated to ampacity estimation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{commercial}} and industrial, unenclosed NM cable is often prohibited {{in certain areas}} or altogether (depending on what the building is used for and local/state building codes). Therefore, it is almost never used by commercial electrical contractors. Most wiring is put in non-flexible conduit, usually EMT because of its cost and durability. Rigid may be required for certain areas and additionally, vapor-lock fittings may be required in areas where a fire or explosion hazard is present (such as gas stations, chemical factories, grain silos, etc.) PVC can be used where wire is run underground or where concrete will be poured. A <b>duct</b> <b>bank</b> is usually made of multiple PVC conduits encased in concrete. FMC or Flex is used where EMT or other non-flexible conduit is impractical or for short runs, known as [...] "whips", to lights or other devices. For power circuits, the color-coding uses the same colors as residential construction, and adds the additional wires used for three-phase systems. Black, Red and Blue are used for hot wires and White is used as the neutral wire in a 120/208 V circuit. Brown, Orange and Yellow are used as hot wires and gray is used as the neutral wire in a 277/480 V. For grounding, regardless of the voltage, Green is used.|$|E
5000|$|The NVRPA {{expected}} {{the project to}} result in a significant loss of trees, as the power company planned to dig trenches {{on each side of the}} paved trail while installing <b>duct</b> <b>banks</b> to house its conduits. [...] Supporting the NVRPA's expectation, Dominion Virginia Power noted that the environmental impacts associated with underground cable installation in suburban and rural areas are significantly greater than are those of overhead line construction. The W&OD Trail closed for a year in the project area while the power company constructed its underground lines. The trail reopened to the public in November 2010.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} IRT {{plan had}} been to resume trolley car operation, but this was rejected {{in favor of a}} regular rapid transit train service. The tunnels were measured, and it was found that only minor modifications were needed to allow for third rail installation. The loops and the ramp were unusable by regular subway cars due to the tight [...] radius of the loops and the steep 6% incline. However, the roadbed {{did not have to be}} lowered, nor was special low profile rail required; even so, the <b>duct</b> <b>banks</b> in the tunnels were replaced. The platforms could be easily extended, and it was also found that the tunnel's width corresponded to the width specifications of the existing IRT subway's car fleet.|$|R

40|$|Zone 1 is a 1400 -acre area {{outside the}} fence {{of the main}} plant at The East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Record of Decision for Interim Actions in Zone, ETTP (Zone 1 Interim ROD) (DOE 2002) {{identifies}} the remedial actions for contaminated soil, buried waste, and subsurface infrastructure necessary to protect human health and to limit further contamination of groundwater. Since the Zone 1 Interim Record of Decision (ROD) was signed, new information has been obtained that requires the remedy to be modified as follows: (1) Change the end use in Contractor's Spoil Area (CSA) from unrestricted industrial to recreational; (2) Remove Exposure Units (EU 5) ZI- 50, 51, and 52 from {{the scope of the}} Zone I Interim ROD; (3) Change the end use of the <b>duct</b> <b>bank</b> corridor from unrestricted industrial to restricted industrial; and (4) Remove restriction for the disturbance of soils below 10 feet in Exposure Unit (EU) Z 1 - 04. In accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 300. 435, these scope modifications are a 'significant' change to the Zone 1 Interim ROD. In accordance with CERCLA Sect. 117 (c) and 40 CFR 300. 435 (c) (2) (i), such a significant change is documented with an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD). The purpose of this ESD is to make the changes listed above. This ESD is part of the Administrative Record file, and it, and other information supporting the selected remedy, {{can be found at the}} DOE Information Center, 475 Oak Ridge Turnpike, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, from 8 : 00 a. m. to 5 : 00 p. m., Monday through Friday. The ORR is located in Roane and Anderson counties, within and adjacent to the corporate city limits of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ETTP is located in Roane County near the northwest corner of the ORR. ETTP began operation during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project. The original mission of ETTP was to produce enriched uranium for use in atomic weapons. The plant produced enriched uranium from 1945 until 1985. Uranium production was terminated in 1987. ORR was placed on the National Priorities List in 1989, so remediation activities are conducted under CERCLA. The primary contaminants of concern at ETTP follow: (1) In groundwater - volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at multiple locations (trichloroethene is generally the most prevalent compound); (2) In sediment - inorganic elements, radionuclides, and polychlorinated biphenyls; (3) In soil - inorganic elements, radionuclides, semivolatile organic compounds (particularly the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and VOCs; and (4) In facilities - radionuclides and polychlorinated biphenyls (abandoned facilities also pose a safety and health hazard to workers.) The purposes of the remedial actions selected in the Zone 1 Interim ROD are to allow unrestricted industrial use down to 10 feet and to remediate potential sources of groundwater contamination. Following is a summary of the major components of the Zone 1 Interim ROD remedy: (1) Excavation of the Blair Quarry burial area and associated contaminated soil; (2) Excavation of miscellaneous contaminated soil in the K- 895 Cylinder Destruct Facility area and in the Powerhouse Area; (3) Removal of sludge and demolition of the K- 710 sludge beds and Imhoff tanks; (4) Implementation of land use controls (LUCs); and (5) Characterization of soil and remediation of areas that exceed remediation levels...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{in-depth}} parametric analysis of shielding effectiveness obtained when using ferromagnetic or conductive screens {{to mitigate the}} field generated by <b>duct</b> <b>banks</b> is presented. Due to the need of a case-by-case approach, all the simulations, performed by a finite element software (GetDp), are applied to a case study composed by 9 (3 × 3) ducts, with six of them including high voltage single-core cables and the three left empty for eventual future expansion. Two shielding geometries are tested: horizontal and U-reverse, changing in each one the main parameters: width, thickness, clearance to conductors, etc. Moreover, the conductors are grouped in two balanced in-phase three-phase circuits arranged in three configurations: vertical, horizontal and triangular. The mutual phase ordering of both circuits {{is the one that}} minimizes the field, so no further field reduction can be obtained by simple methods. The power losses and cost of different shielding solutions are also presented, including the effect of adding a third circuit if required...|$|R
40|$|The Site Electrical Power System {{receives}} and distributes {{utility power}} to all North Portal site users. The major North Portal users are the Protected Area including the subsurface facility and Balance of Plant areas. The system is remotely monitored and controlled from the Surface Operations Monitoring and Control System. The system monitors power quality {{and provides the}} capability to transfer between Off-Site Utility and standby power (including dedicated safeguards and security power). Standby power is only distributed to selected loads for personnel safety and essential operations. Security power is only distributed to essential security operations. The standby safeguards and security power is independent from all other site power. The system also provides surface lighting, grounding grid, and lightning protection for the North Portal. The system distributes power during construction, operation, caretaker, and closure phases of the repository. The system consists of substation equipment (disconnect switches, breakers, transformers and grounding equipment) and power distribution cabling from substation to the north portal switch gear building. Additionally, the system includes subsurface facility substation (located on surface), switch-gear, standby diesel generators, underground <b>duct</b> <b>banks,</b> power cables and conduits, switch-gear building and associated distribution equipment for power distribution. Each area substation distributes power to the electrical loads and includes the site grounding, site lighting and lightning protection equipment.

The System interfaces with the Surface Operations Monitoring and Control System for monitoring and control. The System interfaces with MGR Site Layout System for the physical location of equipment and power distribution...|$|R
5000|$|Dating back to 1907, 15th Street was an {{original}} station along the Market-Frankford Line, {{and was not}} designed for ADA accessibility. In 2003, SEPTA rebuilt the station escalators, for which a lawsuit was filed by the Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania, citing that renovating one critical component would require {{the rest of the}} station complex (Including City Hall on the BSL) to be renovated, per building code requirements. As such, SEPTA would be required to make the station ADA accessible. [...] SEPTA and the City of Philadelphia had been proposing a US $100,000,000 refurbishment of City Hall Station, which included structural repairs, improvements in lighting and ventilation, aesthetic improvements, as well as ADA improvements. However, the project's progression had stalled due to lack of funds. [...] In November 2011, the Central Philadelphia Development Corporation awarded construction contracts totaling $50 million for the restoration of the Dilworth Plaza above the station, following the eviction of the Occupy Philly protesters occupying the area; the contract includes the accessibility improvements for the station. SEPTA awarded construction contracts for the improvements in January 2012. [...] The project currently consists of a restoration of the plaza, creating a [...] "gateway" [...] to the SEPTA transit station and installing elevators connecting to the street and Market-Frankford platforms at 15th. The contract does not include any accessibility for the disabled to the Broad Street Line platforms, which are outside the plaza boundaries. The total cost of the project has risen to $55 million, with most of the money coming from a federal grant, with additional contributions by the City of Philadelphia ($5 million), and non-profit organizations including the William Penn Foundation. The project, originally to have been completed July 2014, had been delayed due to the necessity to deal with stairways, <b>duct</b> <b>banks</b> and pipes construction crews encountered, that did not appear in any blueprints.The renovated Dilworth Plaza opened on September 4, 2014. [...] Further accessibility improvements for 15th Street and renovation of the City Hall station are in the early design stages and will be performed as funding becomes available.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Photocatalytic {{oxidation}} is {{an emerging}} technology for destruction of dilute air contaminants {{that is currently}} under commercial development, which using TiO 2 as photocatalyst. UV illumination of the TiO 2 film placed in a gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO) / air container resulted in the total degradation of formaldehyde to CO 2 and H 2 O. Despite its potential advantages, the key unresolved issues in the commercial application of photocatalytic oxidation technologies to contaminated air purification are that of optimum photocatalytic reactor design and the load of photocatalyst. In this paper, successive alternating banks of UV lamps and structured catalyst support monoliths are mounted directly in a square duct. The photocatalyst TiO 2 was loaded {{on the surface of}} honeycomb monoliths by different methods. The square <b>duct</b> including <b>banks</b> of UV lamps and structured catalyst support monoliths was put in a 4 cubic meters glass container. The polluted gas was injected into the container. The photocatalytic degradation of air contaminants was studied. The results shown that the air contaminants formaldehyde can be degraded by photocatalytic oxidation technology. The photocatalytic efficiency was different photo-initiated by UV lamps with peak wavelength at 254 nm and 365 nm. The distance between the UV lamps bank and the honeycombs monoliths was found to affect the efficient of photodegradation...|$|R
