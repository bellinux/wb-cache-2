40|$|DNA transposons and retroviruses are {{important}} transgenic tools for genome engineering. An important consideration affecting {{the choice of}} transgenic vector is their insertion site preferences. Previous large-scale analyses of Ds transposon <b>integration</b> sites <b>in</b> plants were done {{on the basis of}} reporter gene expression or germ-line transmission, making it difficult to discern vertebrate integration preferences. Here, we compare over 1300 Ds transposon <b>integration</b> sites <b>in</b> zebrafish with Tol 2 transposon and retroviral integration sites. Genome-wide analysis shows that Ds <b>integration</b> sites <b>in</b> {{the presence or absence of}} marker selection are remarkably similar and distributed throughout the genome. No strict motif was found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA associated with DNA flexibility (Twist, Tilt, Rise, Roll, Shift, and Slide) was observed. Remarkably, this feature is also found in transposon and retroviral <b>integrations</b> <b>in</b> maize and mouse cells. Our findings show that structural features influence the integration of heterologous DNA in genomes, and have implications for targeted genome engineering...|$|R

5|$|After the Romanian Communist Party seized {{political}} power, the sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, {{under the supervision of}} the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's <b>integration</b> <b>in</b> the strategic system of the Soviets, at the beginning of the Cold War.|$|E

Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945. Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their final withdrawal in 2002.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of techniques we developed, we infected zebrafish embryos using pseudotyped retroviruses and mapped the genomic locations of the proviral <b>integrations</b> <b>in</b> the F 1 offspring of the infected fish. From F 1 fish, we obtained 2, 045 sequences representing 933 unique retroviral integrations. A total of 599 were mappable to the current genomic assembly (Zv 6), and 233 of the integrations landed within genes. By inbreeding fish carrying proviral <b>integrations</b> <b>in</b> 25 different genes, {{we were able to}} demonstrate that in ≈ 50 % of the gene “hits,” the mRNA transcript levels were reduced by ≥ 70 %, with the highest probability for mutation occurring if the <b>integration</b> was <b>in</b> an exon or first intron. Based on these data, the mutagenic frequency for the retrovirus is nearly one <b>in</b> five <b>integrations.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a strong mutagenic effect is seen when murine leukemia virus integrates specifically in the first intron of genes but not in other introns. Three of 19 gene inactivation events had embryonic defects. Using the strategy we outlined, it is possible to identify 1 mutagenic event for every 30 sequencing reactions done on the F 1 fish. This is a 20 - to 30 -fold increase in efficiency when compared with the current resequencing approach [targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) ] used in zebrafish for identifying mutations in genes. Combining this increase in efficiency with cryopreservation of sperm samples from the F 1 fish, it is now possible to create a stable resource that contains mutations in every known zebrafish gene...|$|R

5|$|The Treaty on Increased <b>Integration</b> <b>in</b> the Economic and Humanitarian Fields {{signed in}} 1996 laid the first {{foundation}} for economic convergence.

It served as the blueprint for the future common market for goods, services, capital and labour. The Single Economic Space established a single market across the territory of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2015 with the entry into force of the EEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The countries represent a market of some 183 million people and a combined GDP of around $4 trillion.|$|E
