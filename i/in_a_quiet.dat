In 1902, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> {{ceremony}} at Christ Church Cathedral, she married Guilford Dudley (1854–1945), a banker and insurance broker.

Then, the next scene passes through the band playing their instruments circling around and Chris Martin walking on the purple snow. At {{the end of the}} video, Martin falls to the snow and the final scene shows the band walking away from the town. This video is shown on a small on-stage television screen at live shows, including the band's 2008 Viva la Vida tour.|$|E

5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack {{was to be}} made by three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E
5|$|When the United States entered World War II, Kouma {{was trained}} as a tank crew member. He was {{assigned}} to the 9th Armored Division. The Division landed in Normandy late in September 1944, and moved to the front lines on October 23. Its first mission was patrol duty <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> sector along the Luxembourg-German frontier. When the Germans launched their winter offensive, the 9th Armored Division was quickly involved in the Battle of the Bulge with next to no experience. The Division saw very heavy action at St. Vith, Echternach and Bastogne, its units, unprepared to counter the offensive, fighting in widely separated areas.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} PCS, Johansson dated classmate Jack Antonoff from 2001 to 2002. She dated her Black Dahlia co-star Josh Hartnett {{for about}} two years until the end of 2006, with Hartnett citing their busy lives as the reason for their split. Johansson began a relationship with Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds in 2007, and in May 2008, they became engaged. In September 2008, the couple married <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> ceremony near Tofino, British Columbia. In December 2010, the couple announced their separation; their divorce was finalized in July 2011.|$|E

5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had {{a higher rate of}} gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.|$|E
5|$|Five {{infantry}} {{divisions of}} the AIF saw action in France and Belgium, leaving Egypt in March 1916. I ANZAC Corps subsequently took up positions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> sector south of Armentieres on 7 April 1916 {{and for the next}} {{two and a half years}} the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front, earning a formidable reputation. Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme, within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed. The 5th Division, positioned on the left flank, was the first in action during the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916, suffering 5,533 casualties in a single day. The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July, assaulting Pozieres, and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July, they had suffered 5,286 casualties. Mouquet Farm was attacked in August, with casualties totalling 6,300 men. By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to reorganise, they had suffered 23,000 casualties in just 45 days.|$|E
5|$|In the 1926 {{season as}} a whole, Larwood took 137 wickets at 18.31; with the bat he scored 451 runs at 12.88. No Tests were played in 1927; Larwood's {{performances}} for Nottinghamshire, however, lifted him {{to the top of}} the national bowling averages—100 wickets at 16.95—and he was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His efforts could not quite secure the County Championship title for Nottinghamshire; they finished second after losing their final match to Glamorgan. The 1927 season saw the first appearance in the Nottinghamshire side of Bill Voce, a 17-year-old ex-miner who, after beginning as a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, later became Larwood's principal fast bowling partner for county and country. At the season's end, Larwood was married, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> and private ceremony, to Lois Bird, a miner's daughter whom he had first met in 1925.|$|E

5|$|TumbleSeed begins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> forest village {{disturbed}} by angry creatures creating {{holes in the}} ground. A seed is tasked to fulfill a vague prophecy by ascending the mountain, progressing through the forest, jungle, desert, and snow, to save the town. The player controls an ascending, horizontal, and slanted vine to balance a rolling seed past procedurally generated holes and enemy obstacles {{to reach the top}} of a mountain. With a controller, the player uses two analog sticks to raise and lower the two edges of the horizontal vine while managing the momentum of the seed. If the seed falls into a hole or hits an enemy, the player loses a life ("heart") and resumes from an earlier position, but the game ends once the player runs out of hearts. Some punishments are more severe: A seed that fall into a hole will resume from the last flagged checkpoint, but if the seed collides with spikes or loses all hearts, the game ends and the player returns {{to the bottom of the}} mountain to try again.|$|E
5|$|Torrijos {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on July 31, 1981. A later {{investigation}} by the aircraft manufacturer stated it was an accident; Noriega's authority over the government investigation led to speculation about his involvement. Florencio Flores Aguilar had inherited Torrijos position, but true power lay with the trio of Noriega, Díaz Herrera, and Rubén Darío Paredes, who ranked just below him. Flores was removed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> coup on March 3, 1982, after which Paredes was made leader until 1983 by general agreement, after which the military would work together to ensure his election as the president in the election scheduled for 1984. During this period Noriega became a full Colonel and the National Guard's chief of staff, effectively the second-highest rank in the country. He reformed the National Guard as the Panama Defense Forces (PDF), and with the financial assistance of the U.S., expanded and modernized it. The quick promotions they received earned him the officer corps' loyalty. Among the steps he took to consolidate his control was to bring the various factions of the army together into the PDF. On August 12, 1983, in keeping with Noriega's earlier deal with Paredes, Paredes handed over his position to Noriega, newly appointed a General, with the understanding that Noriega would allow him to stand for President. However, Paredes never received the political support he expected, and after assuming his new position Noriega reneged on the deal, telling Paredes he could not contest the election. Noriega, now head of the PDF, thus became the de facto ruler of Panama.|$|E
