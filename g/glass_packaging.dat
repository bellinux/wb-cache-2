It produces 20 percent of the UK's glass container requirements and provides a <b>glass</b> <b>packaging,</b> filling and distribution service for the drinks industry. The facilities at the plant include a beverage filling hall, warehousing, two glass melting furnaces and 13 production lines. The capacity of the second plant is currently 1.2 billion units, with production capacity of both plants estimated to be 2.4 billion units in 2008. The plant has five lines capable of bottling a total of 400 bottles of wine, or 1,000 bottles of beer a minute. Having manufacturing and bottling on the same site can reduce costs and keep prices competitive. By offering bottling services, there {{is the potential for}} glass makers to win more business as an overflow plant in times of high demand, and it is as a contract packing operation that the greatest benefits from bottling lines are likely to be had. However, the plant was constructed without the correct planning permission, and on 8 April 2009, the High Court ruled that it should be demolished.|$|E

40|$|Recent trends to {{miniaturized}} {{systems such}} as smartphones and wearables, {{as well as the}} rise of autonomous vehicles relying on all-electric and smart in-car systems, have brought unprecedented needs for superior performance, functionality, and cost requirements. Transistor scaling alone cannot meet these metrics unless the remaining system components such as substrates and interconnections are scaled down {{to bridge the gap between}} transistor and system scaling. In this regard, 3 D <b>glass</b> system <b>packages</b> have emerged as a promising alternative due to their ultra-short system interconnection lengths, higher component densities and system reliability enabled by the tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high dimensional stability and surface smoothness, outstanding electrical properties and low-cost panel-level processability of glass. The research objectives are to demonstrate board-level reliability of large, thin, <b>glass</b> <b>packages</b> directly mounted on PCB with conventional BGAs at pitches of 400 µm SMT and smaller. Two key innovations are introduced to accomplish the objectives: a.) Reworkable circumferential polymer collars providing strain-relief at critical high stress concentration areas in the solder joints, b.) novel Mn-doped SACMTM solder to provide superior drop test performance without degrading thermomechanical reliability. Modeling, package and board design, fabrication and reliability characterization were carried out to demonstrate reliable board-level interconnections of large, ultra-thin <b>glass</b> <b>packages.</b> Finite-element modeling (FEM) was used to investigate the effectiveness of circumferential polymer collars as a strain-relief solution on fatigue performance. Experimental results with polymer collars indicated a 2 X improvement in drop performance and 30 % improvement in fatigue life. Failure analysis was performed using characterization techniques such as confocal surface acoustic microscopy (C-SAM), optical microscopy, X-ray imaging, and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS). Model-to-experiment correlation was performed to validate the effectiveness of polymer collars as a strain-relief mechanism. Enhancement in board-level reliability performance with advances in solder materials based on Mn-doped SACMTM is demonstrated in the last part of the thesis. The studies, thus, demonstrate material, design and process innovations for package-to-board interconnection reliability with ultra-thin, large <b>glass</b> <b>packages.</b> M. S...|$|R

40|$|Although the use {{of plastic}} in {{packaging}} has largely increased, consumer research consistently indicates that consumers attach a high quality perception to <b>glass</b> <b>packaged</b> products. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine individuals’ recognition and affective judgments of 30 food packages after visual and haptic exploration. We included packages of three food products that are more often <b>packaged</b> in <b>glass</b> (wine, honey, chocolate cream) and three products that are usually plastic packaged (yogurt, milk, juice). For each product, five packages were used: a glass package; a transparent plastic package with a shape similar to the glass package; a transparent plastic package with a shape different from the glass package; a non-transparent plastic package; a plastic package with a very unusual shape. 30 participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: visual, haptic, and visual + haptic exploration. The visual group watched the packages while their eye-movements were recorded, whereas participants of the other two groups were video-recorded and haptic Exploration Procedures were coded. All participants were asked to name each package and to rate how much they liked it. Moreover, they blind tasted 20 products and were asked to judge liking and quality. Participants were unaware that, for each food category, they were tasting the exact same product repeatedly. The results show that pleasantness judgments were higher for <b>glass</b> <b>packages</b> than for plastic packages. Similarly, participants reported to like the products they believed to come from <b>glass</b> <b>packages</b> more than products contained in plastic packages.

40|$|Packaging for {{high-performance}} computing requires multiple logic and memory dies assembled {{on a single}} substrate. Such a 2. 5 D package demands a large (≥ 35 x 35 mm) and ultra-thin (≤ 100 μm) substrate with asymmetric build-up, high density wiring, and ultra-fine pitch interconnects (≤ 35 μm). Glass is an ideal substrate material for such packages due to its excellent electrical properties, tailorable {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE), high mechanical rigidity, availability in large and thin panel form, and smooth surface for fine line fabrication. However, <b>glass</b> <b>packages</b> do have challenges, such as glass cracking due to dicing-induced defects and RDL stresses as well as debonding of copper redistribution layers (RDL) from the smooth glass surface. To address these challenges, {{there is a need to}} understand plasticity effects on thin film adhesion, the role of dicing defects on glass cracking, and process-induced stresses due to RDL. However, the existing literature does not adequately address several of these. The objectives of this research are to understand the fundamental factors that contribute toward the cracking of glass and debonding of RDL, to design and demonstrate thermo-mechanically reliable 2. 5 D <b>glass</b> <b>packages,</b> and to develop design and process guidelines for such reliable <b>glass</b> <b>packages.</b> This work studies how RDL stresses propagate dicing-induced defects into cohesive cracks as well as interfacial delamination, how geometry and process modifications could mitigate such failures, demonstrates prototypes that are reliable through processing and thermal cycling, and develops design guidelines for current and future <b>glass</b> <b>packages.</b> As part of experimental validation, stresses in glass caused by RDL are measured through birefringence and are correlated to modeling. Warpage is predicted using sequential finite-element modeling that mimics the fabrication process, and shadow moiré measurements are used to validate the package warpage and thus, the model predictions. Various dicing methods and the associated dicing defects are comprehensively quantified, and are used to reduce the chance for glass cracking. Based on the findings of this work, test vehicles are designed and their reliability is demonstrated through 1000 thermal cycles. To enable a wider design space, three alternative solutions to glass cracking, edge coating, two-step dicing, and laser dicing, are proposed, analyzed, and demonstrated. An innovative method to determine the critical energy release rate for peeling of a copper thin film from a glass substrate is developed, and the developed technique is employed to enhance adhesion of copper wiring. In addition, general design and process guidelines for mechanical reliability, which are applicable to other packaging applications, such as mobile substrates, filters for RF, and power, are developed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to model and design copper-plated through-package-vias, leading to fabrication of test vehicles for characterization of defects, and validation of models by demonstration of reliability through accelerated lifetime testing. To meet these objectives, this study focusses on four main tasks, a) mechanical modeling and design of TPVs in glass, b) fabrication of test vehicles for reliability characterization, c) reliability characterization of TPVs, and d) analysis of failures to validate the models. Extensive parametric modeling of TPVs is performed to provide design guidelines for reliable TPVs. Three <b>glass</b> <b>package</b> structures are investigated: polymer-laminated glass, bare glass, and TPVs with polymer-liner. Test-vehicles with all the three structures are designed and fabricated. Various TPV formation approaches such as excimer, UV, CO 2 lasers and electrical discharge techniques were utilized to fabricate the test-vehicles. Quality of TPVs formed with each of these methods are analyzed through cross-section SEM imaging to identify characteristic defect sizes and geometries corresponding to each method. Thermo-mechanical reliability tests and failure analyses are performed to study TPV reliability. Micro Raman spectroscopy {{was used to measure}} stresses in <b>glass</b> <b>packages</b> for the first time.
