Around 1905, Coffin set up her own office at the National Arts Club and began taking commissions, using her family {{connections}} to find work. She was ideally situated; it was the height of the Country Place Era, when wealthy East Coast Americans were eager to develop elaborate European-style gardens for their estates. Coffin was well-connected in such circles, widely traveled, came <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> family, was professionally trained and was known for her good taste. She also joined the American Society of Landscape Architects, which had two other female members at the time.|$|E
5|$|The school {{initially}} housed 250 Navajo and Hopi children, {{and additional}} buildings were constructed to accommodate them.

During the 1950s, as the tribe was fighting against termination, the emphasis of the school was on vocational and technical training. Beginning in 1960, the BIA contracted for schools to be built near other tribes, and attendance at the school started to drop.|$|E

25|$|This {{intentional}} oversight {{was to play}} a part in {{the pilots}} being unable to see the vehicles on the runway (they could not from the air). In contrast, the runway crew saw the Tu-154 coming at them <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> distance, its landing lights on.

To achieve this, whilst only being slowly revealed on its approach from the main entrance, considerable height was required. William Hosking considered this to be best suited to a steeple – it would need to be much higher than any other in the vicinity, surpassing that of the local parish church, to produce maximum effect.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{the early}} {{railways}} employed policemen {{to time the}} intervals between trains and to give a 'stop' signal if a train had passed in the previous ten minutes. Developments led to many everyday workings (such as interlocking points) and signal boxes to house the levers that allowed signallers to change the points and signals over a given stretch of railway. These signalboxes were often elevated above the railway due to the locking mechanisms of the signals and points being accommodated on the lower storey. This also allowed the signaller {{to keep an eye}} on things <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> vantage point.|$|E

Soon afterwards, on 25 March 1616, Shakespeare modified his will for Judith to inherit £300 in her own name, leaving Quiney out of the will and giving most of his property to Susanna and her husband.|$|E

Halbertsma and his wife had five sons <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> marriage, which was however not without its share of problems. Of these sons Petrus, Hidde, and Tsjalling studied linguistics or medicine, while Watse en Binnert became mariners. As a father, Halbertsma experienced a large amount of grief, as his son Petrus died in 1851 in a psychiatric hospital, while Binnert passed away in 1861, and Hidde took his own life in 1865.|$|E
25|$|The Scots {{went into}} this tournament as favourites, being holders of the Intercontinental Cup and the ICC Trophy. However, rain in Utrecht {{prevented}} them <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start against the Dutch, who bowled well enough to have them all out for 217 on the first day. Ian Stanger hit his second first-class fifty and Ryan Watson 46, but South African-born Ryan ten Doeschate took three important, albeit expensive, wickets and medium-pacer Edgar Schiferli finished with four for 46. In reply, Maurits van Nierop lashed out, taking 24 off the Scottish bowlers as the Dutch made 31 for 0 to see them to stumps on day 1. Play was impossible on the next two days, and the Scots now needed to thump Ireland in Aberdeen {{if they were to}} have any hope of qualifying for the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{group were}} the Icaiche Maya, who dominated {{the jungles of}} the lower center of the peninsula. In the 1860s under their leader Marcus Canul, they had battled against the Mexicans, the Cruzob, and had also raided British Honduras. Marcus Canul and the Icaiche Maya defeated a detachment of British troops in December 21, 1866 the battle {{is known as the}} Battle of San Pedro Yalbac. In 1867 the British mounted a retaliatory raid, including in their weaponry incendiary rockets that set the houses of Icaiche on fire <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> distance away, to the awe of the local residents. The Maya briefly took Corozal town in 1870 and their last major attack was in September 1, 1872 when Canul was mortally wounded. The new Icaiche leaders promised respect and friendship with the British. They soon made an agreement with the Mexican central government {{similar to that of the}} Ixcanha. Years after the Belize Estate and Produce Company (BEC) began a series of campaigns to forcibly remove Maya from the Yalbac area.|$|E

25|$|During {{the second}} leg, Old Trafford hosted a very emotive night {{in which the}} home crowd vociferously {{supported}} United as they worked to achieve {{a place in the}} final. Following a shaky start (including Paul Scholes fouling Lionel Messi on {{the very edge of the}} penalty area within the first 45 seconds), United took the lead courtesy of an outstanding goal by Paul Scholes in the 14th minute. Despite surrendering huge swathes of possession to Barcelona, United nearly extended their lead shortly before half time, Nani heading wide <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> cross from Park Ji-sung. The second half of the match saw a challenging Barcelona that simply failed to get a vital away goal, mostly thanks to a very good defensive work by the Red Devils, the game ending 1–0. The win increased the number of consecutive home wins in the Champions League to a record 12, the previous record having stood at 10, and qualified United for their third European Cup final. With Chelsea beating Liverpool in the other semi-final, it set up the European Cup's first ever all-English final, to be played at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 21 May 2008.|$|E
25|$|From 1951 to 1953, most of {{her works}} are made from ripped {{drawings}} completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner. By ripping the paper instead of cutting it, {{the edges of the}} figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works. From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works. Some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by Pollock. Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used Pollock's unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage format. Others believe that she was creating a sense of intimacy between the two artists, which was lacking in their relationship by this time period, by combining their works together. By 1955, she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support, using either masonite, wood, or canvas. These works were first exhibited by Eleanor Ward at the Stable Gallery in 1955, but they received little public acclaim apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> review from Greenberg.|$|E
25|$|The {{second quarter}} would {{be full of}} missed {{opportunities}} and poor play from both teams. On the first play, a high snap from Bucs center Tony Mayberry went over quarterback Shaun King's head and into the end zone. King managed to knock {{the ball out of}} the end zone to prevent a touchdown, but it gave the Rams a safety and a 5–3 lead. Az-Zahir Hakim returned the free kick 15-yards to the Rams 40-yard line. Hakim also caught a 14-yard pass and ran for six as the team drove to the Bucs 26, but the drive was halted there and Wilkins missed a 44-yard field goal attempt. Following a punt from each team, Tampa Bay also got good field position <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> return, a 14-yard punt return from Karl Williams that gave them a first down on the Rams 45. Although they would drive to the St. Louis 26, they would ultimately fair no better than the Rams did. On third down, King lost a fumble while being sacked by Charlie Clemons. King recovered the ball, but the 13-yard loss pushed the team out of field goal range. The next time Tampa Bay had the ball, King threw a pass from the Rams 41 that went right into the arms of St. Louis defensive back Todd Lyght. A few plays later, the half ended with the score still 5-3, despite the Rams 159–75 advantage over the Buccaneers in total yards.|$|E
