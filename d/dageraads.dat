40|$|During {{the period}} 1898 - 1906 red romans Chrysoblephus laticeps {{dominated}} redfish landings at Strand and Hermanus, Republic of South Africa, ports subject to cool upwelling conditions. Red stumpnoses C. gibbiceps {{were the main}} species along the eastern Cape Peninsula and seventy-fours Polysteganus undulosus at most harbours east of Cape Agulhas. By the late 1970 's romans were dominant between Kalk Bay and Arniston and also important contributors else-where, but seventy-fours were only recorded in any significant quantities from Port Alfred. Interpretation of these trends is complicated by a lumping of catches, but {{the possibility of an}} environmental change favouring romans (cooler water) at the expense of seventy-fours (warmer water) cannot be discounted. Other marine forms having a biology associated with cooler waters have also increased along the southern Cape coast in recent years. Redfish resources at Gans Bay and Struts Bay are not currently overexploited, but provide a valuable source of remuneration for local fishermen when preferred target species are absent. Limited data collected in the Tsitsikamma Coastal National Park indicate that dageraad C. cristiceps populations could deteriorate rapidly if subjected to high fishing pressure. The contribution of <b>dageraads</b> to combined redfish landings is currently highest in areas of low exploitation...|$|E

25|$|On 12 October 1856, freethinkers {{association}} De <b>Dageraad</b> ("The Dawn") {{was founded}} in Amsterdam by the editorial staff of the magazine, including Günst (publisher of De <b>Dageraad)</b> and the first chair Rudolf Charles d'Ablaing van Giessenburg (1826–1904). In total, 44 men joined the new society. There was no balloting, and partly due to d'Ablaing's sympathy towards feminism, it was during his chairmanship (1856–1865) that women were readily admitted. A similar association, De Lichtstraal ("The Lightbeam"), founded in 1855 by Goose Wijnand van der Voo in Rotterdam with 20 members and an identically named magazine, merged with De <b>Dageraad</b> in 1857. De <b>Dageraad's</b> character had less and {{less to do with}} freemasonry and, increasingly, focused on rationalism and the natural sciences.|$|R

2500|$|A {{year before}} the {{association}} De <b>Dageraad</b> was founded, {{the first issue of}} the monthly periodical De <b>Dageraad</b> appeared on 1 October 1855. In the beginning, the magazine De <b>Dageraad</b> took on a rather autonomous, deistic approach under the influence of Junghuhn, while the association itself was open to atheists, pantheists, materialists, liberals, socialists and conservatives in the philosophical, religious or political sense. The radical chair d'Ablaing tried to publish three other magazines in 1858: Verbond der Vrije Gedachte ("League of the Free Thought", for the association), De Rechtbank des onderzoeks ("The Court of Inquiry", for Biblical criticism) and Tijdgenoot op het gebied der Rede ("Contemporarian on the Terrain of Reason", for philosophical questions). Due to a lack of funds in the next year, all three were bundled under the name Bliksemschicht der XIXe eeuw ("Lightning Bolt of the 19th Century"), after which it disappeared again. In 1867, De <b>Dageraad</b> did eventually become the association's official magazine. In 1859, Eduard Douwes Dekker used his pseudonym Multatuli {{for the first time in}} the ethical parable [...] "" [...] ("Creed") in De <b>Dageraad,</b> and in 1861 he published [...] "" [...] ("The Prayer of the Ignorant") about his deconversion, which made him famous and loved amongst the Dageradianen.|$|R

50|$|In the Netherlands, freethought {{has existed}} in {{organized}} form since {{the establishment of}} De <b>Dageraad</b> (now known as De Vrije Gedachte) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, Multatuli, Adriaan Gerhard and Domela Nieuwenhuis.|$|R
25|$|De <b>Dageraad</b> earned notability {{through its}} broadcasts, {{creating}} opposition especially from Catholic organisations, who vainly {{tried to have}} the association banned. However, in 1932 the confessionalist majority in parliament adopted a blasphemy law which, although primarily aimed against Communists, also seriously limited the activities of freethinkers. The following year, civil servants were barred from membership of De <b>Dageraad,</b> and the association's writing were banned from public buildings. Hoving's fierce criticism of Nazi Germany, that was still an ally of the Dutch government at the time, and Leo Polak's criticism of religion, led to more censorship by the government, and in 1936, the VRO's broadcasting rights were completely revoked. Between 1933 and 1936, {{about a quarter of}} the VRO's episodes had been partially censored, another quarter wholly cancelled.|$|R
2500|$|Catholic {{groups and}} the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB) became {{increasingly}} hostile towards De <b>Dageraad.</b> After a 16 October 1936 article in Volk en Vaderland entitled [...] "Blasphemers", in which the NSB paper demanded the VRO broadcasts to be outlawed, several dozens of NSB members (the WA) violently disrupted a grand meeting of freethinkers in Utrecht on 26 October. Although denying any connection to the NSB's actions, confessionalist parliamentarians soon urged the government to ban the VRO's broadcasts, to which Interior Minister de Wilde agreed on 16 November, entering in effect from 1 January 1937. De <b>Dageraad's</b> magazine De Vrijdenker continued to oppose and warn against the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, including publishing {{a long list of}} murdered German Jews.|$|R
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to innovate, the {{association}} briefly {{changed its name to}} Het Vrije Onderzoek ("The Free Inquiry", 1873–1876), and jointly published a Manifesto with De Humaniteit in 1875 calling on 'all those free from faith in the Netherlands' to join forces for separation of church and state; poor relief by the government instead of the churches; and compulsory primary education. The two barely surviving associations reconciled. In 1878, De Humaniteit (5 members) merged with De <b>Dageraad</b> (11 members), after which it made a remarkable recovery. De <b>Dageraad</b> publication continued with a now firmly atheistic materialist tone. Furthermore, the association's structure was democratised, it actively sought publicity, and the now politically and philosophically extremely diverse board of directors welcomed social anarchist Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis to its ranks. By 1882, membership had grown to 357.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{attempts}} at establishing a plantation {{was made by the}} sons of Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels in 1816. They established a plantation named Oranje <b>Dageraad</b> in Simbo. The Governor-General himself tried to buy 300 slaves from Kumasi, which were to regain their freedom by cultivating farmland. Both projects failed.|$|R
25|$|Several {{times in}} 1868 {{and in the}} period 1870–1879, the {{publication}} was interrupted. In these years, freethought publications fragmented to distinct regional magazines; The Hague's De Toekomst ("The Future") was considered the semi-official paper of De <b>Dageraad</b> in 1870–1872. After the association survived a subsistence crisis, De <b>Dageraad</b> continued in October 1879 with the subtitle Maandschrift tot bespreking van maatschappelijke en zedelijke vraagstukken ("Monthly review for discussion on societal and moral issues"). In 1906, it was renamed De Vrije Gedachte ("The Free Thought"), in 1920 the national paper was absorbed into De Vrijdenker ("The Freethinker", 1913–1940) of the branch of Amsterdam, which then became the national edition. Because the distribution of De Vrijdenker was considered too dangerous under Nazi rule due to its firm pre-war antifascist attitude, it was immediately terminated when Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands in May 1940.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the period}} 1903–1933, De <b>Dageraad's</b> {{membership}} grew from 613 to 2700, with 40 regional branches. At first, there existed {{a lot of}} mistrust amongst freethinkers regarding the [...] parliamentary democracy, seeing the adoption of universal suffrage in 1917/1919 had significantly strengthened the position of confessionalist political parties. Furthermore, the Communists and Social Democrats, that included several self-declared freethinkers, appeared unwilling to attack religion in the House of Representatives, {{because they did not}} want to exclude themselves from forming a ruling coalition with the Roman-Catholic State Party. To oppose the now more Christian politics, some freethinkers partook in several small anti-clerical and early Fascist protest parties, that initially looked up to Mussolini as 'the former socialist and religion-fighter'. In 1920, the main board of De <b>Dageraad</b> refused to found a political party that was officially linked to the association, to prevent infighting within its ranks.|$|R
25|$|Vrijdenkersvereniging De Vrije Gedachte (DVG) (English: Freethinkers {{association}} The Free Thought), is a Dutch atheist–humanist {{association of}} freethinkers. It {{was founded in}} 1856 and known by the name De <b>Dageraad</b> ("The Dawn") before assuming its present name in 1957. De Vrije Gedachte strives to use reason, natural science and logic to liberate humanity from prejudices, clerical paternalism, dogmas and false truths.|$|R
50|$|When the British {{arrived in}} Gibraltar, a {{squadron}} of five Dutch frigates (Melampus, Frederica, <b>Dageraad,</b> Diana, and Amstel) and the corvette Eendragt, led by Vice-Admiral Theodorus Frederik van Capellen, offered to join the expedition. Exmouth decided to assign them to cover the main force from Algerian flanking batteries, as there was insufficient space in the mole for the Dutch frigates.|$|R
50|$|Jan Renier Snieders (22 November 1812 in Bladel - 9 April 1888 in Turnhout), {{a brother}} of August Snieders, was a Flemish writer. He studied {{medicine}} in Leuven, and in 1838 he settled {{as a physician}} in Turnhout, where he did much to promote literature and for which reason he founded the society De <b>Dageraad.</b> In 1912, the Hofstraat in Turnhout was renamed to Renier Sniedersstraat.|$|R
50|$|Poels tells a {{lot about}} his {{personal}} life in his song texts. For example, on the 2001 album Vandaag ("Today") he sings about his newborn son. On the 2003 album <b>Dageraad</b> ("Dawn"), he sings about his real divorce and additional feelings. The texts of the newest Rowwen Hèze album Rodus & Lucius are about how Jack Poels continued his private life after his divorce.|$|R
25|$|In 1921, the bylaws of De <b>Dageraad</b> (article 2) stated for {{the first}} time that freethinkers, 'from the {{perspective}} of reason', placed themselves 'on an atheistic standpoint'. The Interior Minister Heemskerk (Anti-Revolutionary Party) refused to grant royal permission to this bylaws amendment in 1924, because atheism would go against morality and the public order, and lead to anarchy. After fierce debates in the House of Representatives, the Christian confessionalist majority rallied in support of the minister. De Vrijdenker freethought magazine mocked that Christianity had no monopoly on morality, and De <b>Dageraad</b> called for people to leave the church via the Comité Kerkafscheiding ("Committee for Apostasy"), and offered to help those who wished to terminate their membership (to which 3250 people responded in 1925). Eventually, the association decided that royal permission was important after all, and appointed special professor in philosophy of law, Leo Polak, to rewrite the bylaws. The emphasis on fighting religious dogmas and unquestionable authority was maintained, but the word 'atheistic' omitted; these bylaws were accepted by the government in 1927.|$|R
2500|$|After the war, De <b>Dageraad</b> was {{reinstated}} {{and recovered}} quickly, {{helped by the}} fact it had taken an outspoken antifascist position before the war. Several local branches and magazines were founded, the main board convened again on 17 June 1945. During a conference on 27–28 October 1945, about 1150 members were present, and 9 branches represented. The new magazine De Vrijdenker, that counted well-known freethinkers such as Anton Constandse and Piet Spigt amongst its editorial staff, soon achieved over 2300 subscribers (1 June 1946), a year later 2645. De <b>Dageraad</b> sought cooperation with the newly founded Humanistisch Verbond (HV, [...] "Humanist League") and Humanitas (Latin for [...] "Humanity"). From 1957 onwards, the association continued under the name: De Vrije Gedachte (Vereniging tot bevordering van zelfstandig denken) ("The Free Thought (Association {{for the promotion of}} independent thought)"), with its magazine renamed to Bevrijdend denken ("Liberating thinking"). Despite considerable competition between De Vrije Gedachte, that held on to combatting church and religion, and the HV, that was primarily concerned with giving the unchurched an equal place in society, most DVG members opined cooperation was necessary, leading the board to advocate for dual memberships; however, a merger with the HV was rejected.|$|R
