500|$|Originally {{dating from}} 1667, Queensberry House {{is an example}} of a seventeenth century Edinburgh townhouse and {{contrasts}} with the modern architecture of the rest of the parliamentary complex. From c.1800, Queensberry House has been used as a hospital, army barracks, a refuge and a <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospital.</b> [...] In 1996, the <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospital</b> closed and the building was incorporated into the Scottish and Newcastle brewery, who owned the surrounding site. The building has been extensively refurbished, and returned to its original height of three storeys to provide facilities for the Presiding Officer, Deputy Presiding Officers, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Parliament and various parliamentary support staff. Internally and externally the building has been strengthened with reinforced steel and concrete. The original timber flooring has been replaced throughout with a mixture of carpet, vinyl, oak and Caithness stone. [...] Queensberry House also contains the Donald Dewar Room, dedicated to the founding First Minister of Scotland who died in October 2000.

40|$|Purpose: The {{quality of}} nursing care in <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{has been of}} concern. Nurses need to provide {{evidence-based}} nursing using best available research findings {{in order to maximize}} the quality of care. Research utilization is a major part of evidence-based nursing practice. Empowerment is an important factor that may influence the context of nursing practice. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the barriers to research utilization in nursing practice and its relationship to empowerment perceived by registered nurses (RNs) in <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Methods: A descriptive, correlational design was used. A total of 147 RNs from six <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in K province of Korea participated. The BARRIERS scale and the Conditions of Work Empowerment Questionnaire-II were administered to identify perceived barriers to the use of research findings and the level of perceived empowerment respectively. Results: Participants rated that research reports being written in English constituted the greatest barrier to the use of research findings. The score was the highest for the Communication domain, suggesting the greatest barrier, and the lowest for the Adopter domain. Subscales of the Conditions of Work Empowerment Questionnaire-II were significant predictors of the Adopter, Organization, and Communication domains of the BARRIERS scale. Conclusions: This study found that RNs in <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> perceived that interpreting and understanding research reports in English was the greatest barrier to the use of research findings. Administrators and nurse managers of <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> need to provide RNs with opportunities to participate in research-related activities and to empower RNs in order to facilitate research utilization...|$|R

The remaining four hospitals, which included the three geriatric institutions, also exhibited mortalities regarded as highly suggestive of Poisson distributions, although in one of the <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> the mortality distribution tended to be somewhat erratic in this respect...|$|R

25|$|A {{hospital}} is {{a health care}} institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of {{hospital is}} the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, {{with large numbers of}} beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's <b>hospitals,</b> seniors' (<b>geriatric)</b> <b>hospitals,</b> and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of horse riding {{exercise}} using a horse riding simulator (HRS) and a ball on static and dynamic balance of elderly people. [Methods] Thirty-two elderly people hospitalized in <b>geriatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> were randomly assigned to the HRS exercise group or the ball exercise groups, and they performed exercise for eight weeks. [Results] The length of postural sway during quite standing with and without eyes closed significantly decreased in both groups after the exercises and there was no significant difference between both groups in the Romberg test. In the functional reach test (FRT), there were significant increases in distance in both groups after the exercises, and the distance of the HRS exercise group was significantly greater than that of the ball exercise group. In the Timed Up & Go test (TUG) and Timed 10 -meter walk test (10 MWT), the time significantly decreased in both groups, and there was a more significant decrease in the HRS exercise group than in the ball exercise group.
