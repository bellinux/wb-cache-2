40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{design and}} product qualities {{are most effective}} {{in the growth of}} the precast industry. Zeolite concrete is one of the factors, which will contribute m improving the quality of many precast structural elements such as walls, beams, etc. This thesis is in two parts. The first part presents a study of fresh concrete properties, which are water content, slump, strength and cost of product. Tests were undertaken in four groups of concrete adopted. The first group (B) was of a standard mix proportion of 30 MPa. The second group (F) had partial replacement of cement with fly ash. The third group (S) had partial replacement of sand with granulated blast-furnace slag in a concrete mix that had the highest strength obtained from group (F). The fourth group (Z) had partial replacement of coarse aggregate (blue metal) with zeolite in a concrete mix that had the highest strength obtained from groups (F) and (S) to evaluate the effective of adding zeolite in fly-ash-slag concrete. Zeolite in concrete is seen to improve the freshness (workability) and hardness (strength) properties of the fly-ash-slag concrete. The second part of the thesis considers a particular connection. Connections are most important for precast structural elements. This thesis presents a study of strength and deformation behaviour of floor-wall connections in precast reinforced concrete walls in a plant building. Three half-scale walls and floors moulds were designed, built and tested in the structural laboratory to evaluate the deflection, strain and stress behaviour of steel connections, <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts,</b> walls and floor edge beams. The design of the walls was based on the structural analysis of precast concrete walls of a one storey plant typical of a commercial building. The load analysis and design of the concrete walls, steel reinforcement, steel connection and <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts,</b> their configuration and manufacturing were according to Australian standard recommendations. The three tests undertaken had different types of concrete strength. The first two walls had different types of reinforcing steel and different steel connections. The third wall, adopted after the first and second walls were tested and evaluated, allowed reasonable evaluation of the deformation behaviour. The load-deflection and strain curves of wall, floor, connection and <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts</b> were compared between the laboratory tests and the computer analysis using Strand 6 program. Also the rotation of the floor slab when failure occurred was evaluated to determine its effect on the behavior of the connection and the wall. The connections and walls demonstrated satisfactory moment resistance and shear capacities. The test results confirmed that this connection and <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts</b> would give satisfactory load capacity and ductility performance, and that they can safely carry the applicable loads [...] The connection can be safely applied to precast reinforced concrete elements in a commercial building. The crack behaviour for the three walls was studied, and conclusions were made, based on the test results and the analysis of computer results. Recommendations for future work are also given...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we will analyze the {{possibility}} of a nontrivial central extension of the Poisson algebra of the diffeomorphism generators, which respect certain boundary conditions on the black hole bifurcation. The origin of a possible central extension in the algebra is due to the existence of boundary terms in the in the canonical generators. The existence of such boundary terms depend on the exact boundary conditions one takes. We will check two possible boundary conditions i. e. <b>fixed</b> <b>bolt</b> metric and <b>fixed</b> surface gravity. In the case of fixed metric the the action acquires a boundary term associated to the bifurcation but this is canceled in the Legendre transformation and so absent in the canonical generator and so in this case {{the possibility of a}} nontrivial central extension is ruled out. In the case of fixed surface gravity the boundary term in the action is absent but present in the Hamiltonian. Also in this case we will see that there is no nontrivial central extension, also if there exist a boundary term in the generator.

For instance, she had resisted hang-dogging (hanging {{on the rope}} at any point during the climb), holding with the philosophy that it was cheating, but after experimenting with it during her ascent of Vandals, she found it a useful way to learn challenging climbs. During the mid-1980s, there was great tension in the climbing community between traditionalists and new sport climbers.

Hill has argued that [...] "the purpose of climbing is to adapt yourself to the rock. You work on yourself to overcome the obstacle of the rock...

30|$|The test beams {{were divided}} into eleven groups and each group {{contained}} three identical specimens. Group number 1 is the control group in which the beams were cast using ordinary formwork. The beams in this group were reinforced with 2 ϕ 12  mm {{high tensile strength steel}} bars at the tension side and 2 ϕ 12  mm high tensile strength steel bars at the compression side as well as shear reinforcement (stirrups) of Ø 8  mm at 200  mm spacing. The beams incorporating reinforced mortar forms were grouped according to the mesh type, number of steel mesh layers, type of core material, and shear connection method. For all the beams incorporating precast reinforced mortar forms, the core of material was reinforced with two high tensile strength steel bars of 12  mm diameter in the tension side only. Neither reinforcing bars at the compression side nor stirrups were used in these groups. Two types of steel mesh were used to reinforce the U-shaped forms namely; welded wire mesh and X 8 expanded steel mesh. Single or double layers of the steel mesh were used as shown in Table  1. In the design of the test specimen it was assured that the total percentage of steel reinforcement (reinforcing bars and steel mesh) did not exceed the maximum percentage allowed by the design code. This is an important issue that should be observed by the designers at the practical application stage. Shear connection between the reinforced mortar form and the core for groups 5 and 10 was provided by <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts</b> through the sides and bottom of the forms while {{for the rest of the}} groups bonding agent was applied on the inner surface of the forms before casting the core.|$|R

50|$|Most {{motorcycles}} of {{this period}} tensioned the primary chain by drawing or rotating the gearbox backwards on a hinge with threaded rods, this was known as pre-unit construction. The first A7 had a <b>fixed</b> gearbox, <b>bolted</b> {{to the back of}} the crankcase, and an internal tensioner for the duplex primary chain.

However, in 1954 a re-design reverted to the older system. The electrics (as was universal for larger British motorcycles of the period) consisted of two independent systems, the very reliable and self-contained Lucas magneto, with a dynamo generator to charge the battery and provide lights.

In the case that a data-based approach is chosen for damage detection, environmental fluctuations could be erroneously regarded as an abnormal condition of the structure and could mask the presence of damage. One of the objectives of the current work is to examine a statistical pattern recognition approach for novelty detection under different temperature conditions.

2500|$|Bohr's {{response}} was to illustrate Einstein's idea more clearly using the diagram in Figure C. (Figure C shows a fixed screen S1 that is bolted down. Then try to imagine one that can slide up or down along a rod instead of a <b>fixed</b> <b>bolt.)</b> Bohr observes that extremely precise knowledge of any (potential) vertical motion of the screen is an essential presupposition in Einstein's argument. In fact, if its velocity in the direction X before {{the passage of the}} particle is not known with a precision substantially greater than that induced by the recoil (that is, if it were already moving vertically with an unknown and greater velocity than that which it derives {{as a consequence of the}} contact with the particle), then the determination of its motion after the passage of the particle would not give the information we seek. However, Bohr continues, an extremely precise determination of the velocity of the screen, when one applies the principle of indeterminacy, implies an inevitable imprecision of its position in the directionX. [...] Before the process even begins, the screen would therefore occupy an indeterminate position at least to a certain extent (defined by the formalism). Now consider, for example, the point d in figure A, where the interference is destructive. It is obvious that any displacement of the first screen would make the lengths of the two paths, a–b–d and a–c–d, different from those indicated in the figure. If the difference between the two paths varies by half a wavelength, at point d there will be constructive rather than destructive interference. [...] The ideal experiment must average over all the possible positions of the screen S1, and, for every position, there corresponds, for a certain fixed point F, a different type of interference, from the perfectly destructive to the perfectly constructive. The effect of this averaging is that the pattern of interference on the screen F will be uniformly grey. Once more, our attempt to evidence the corpuscular aspects in S2 has destroyed the possibility of interference in F, which depends crucially on the wave aspects.|$|R
