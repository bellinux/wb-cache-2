5|$|When a USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB <b>device</b> enumeration process <b>is</b> started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB <b>device's</b> information <b>is</b> read by the host and the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> supported by the host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the <b>device</b> <b>are</b> loaded and the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|R

50|$|The first {{mechanical}} dishwashing <b>device</b> <b>was</b> {{registered in}} 1850 in the United States by Joel Houghton for a hand-powered wood <b>device.</b> This <b>device</b> <b>was</b> {{made of wood}} and was cranked by hand while water sprayed onto the dishes. This <b>device</b> <b>was</b> both slow and unreliable. Another patent was granted to L.A. Alexanderin 1865 that {{was similar to the}} first but featured a hand-cranked rack system.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test <b>devices</b> <b>were</b> initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E
5|$|Blissymbols {{were first}} used in Canada in 1971 to provide {{communication}} to those {{not able to}} use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, communication <b>devices</b> <b>were</b> being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E

Such plot <b>devices</b> <b>were</b> used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of Windows Mobile <b>devices</b> <b>were</b> able to be managed and synced from a remote {{computer}} using ActiveSync; a data synchronization technology and protocol developed by Microsoft, originally released in 1996.

5|$|Rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development continued, including projects funded by the European Community.
