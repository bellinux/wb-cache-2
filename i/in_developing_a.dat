5|$|In {{addition}} to her work at Hull House, Smith was involved in public education. Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to teach at the University of Chicago {{as the head of}} the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910. She not only trained teachers for Dewey but assisted him <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> revised curriculum for the music education program.

5|$|Starting in 1964, {{a series}} of {{in-depth}} discussions took place between the governments of France and Great Britain on prospective collaborative military aviation programs; these involved talks between Handel Davies, the co-chairman of an Anglo-French committee, and his French counterpart, Ingénieur-General Lecamus, negotiating the launch of two new military combat aircraft. According to these negotiations, the French would take the lead role <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> new light ground-attack/trainer, while the British was to assume the leadership of a multirole fighter project. This multirole aircraft was to be equipped with a variable geometry wing and was intended to perform the strike, reconnaissance, and interceptor roles.|$|E
5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish labor movement, {{which emerged}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century from temperance, {{religious}} movements and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, working-class character. From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-burghers and the labor movement concerning voting rights for the common people.|$|E

5|$|The German {{influence}} {{brought into}} Norway by neo-classicism abated when Norway gained full independence in 1905. A {{new generation of}} Norwegian architects educated in Sweden took the lead <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> distinctly national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the Norwegian Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, there also emerged a distinctly Norwegian collegium of architects that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon.|$|E
5|$|The title marked Codemasters' debut <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> mobile game internally. The goal of {{the project}} was to create a core, rally racing {{experience}} for mobile devices. The development team chose to use Colin McRae Rally 2.0 as the foundation, taking its tracks, driving model, and pacenotes for the new title. Original vehicle models were reused however aspects of the game's graphics were enhanced to provide the higher visual quality expected by modern standards. Numerous sound assets were replaced with samples from other Codemasters driving games.|$|E

5|$|Being Naughty Dog's first PlayStation 3 game, {{the project}} {{required}} {{the company to}} familiarize themselves with the new hardware, and resulted in several development mistakes. The switch from developing for the PlayStation 2 to the PlayStation 3 prompted the staff to implement changes to their development technology. Naughty Dog switched to the industry standard language C++ in order to participate in technology sharing among Sony's first-party developers—the company had previously used their own proprietary programming language GOAL, a Lisp-based language. In rewriting their game code, they decided to create new programming tools as well. This switch, however, delayed the team's progress <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> prototype, as the new tools proved to be unreliable and too difficult to use. Ten months into full production, the team decided to recreate the game's pipeline, the chain of processing elements designed to progress data through a system. In retrospect, Naughty Dog's Co-President Evan Wells considered this the greatest improvement to the project. Additionally, the animation blending system was rewritten several times to obtain the desired character animations.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, {{resulting in an}} almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget. However, in 2005, Malawi was the recipient of over US$575million in aid. The Malawian government faces challenges <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> market economy, improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing HIV/AIDS problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 {{under the leadership of}} President Mutharika and Financial Minister Gondwe. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase. The overall cost to the economy (and healthcare system) is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Silk {{cultivation}} {{spread to}} Japan around 300 CE, and, by 522 CE, the Byzantines managed to obtain silkworm eggs {{and were able}} to begin silkworm cultivation. The Arabs also began to manufacture silk during this same time. As a result of the spread of sericulture, Chinese silk exports became less important, although they still maintained dominance over the luxury silk market. The Crusades brought silk production to Western Europe, in particular to many Italian states, which saw an economic boom exporting silk to the rest of Europe. Changes in manufacturing techniques also began to take place during the Middle Ages, with devices such as the spinning wheel first appearing. During the 16th century France joined Italy <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> successful silk trade, though the efforts of most other nations to develop a silk industry of their own were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Supporters among Ravalomanana's {{high-level}} Tiko staff {{established a}} group to promote his campaign, which he named Tiako Iarivo ("I Love Antananarivo"). The candidate spent over 700 million Malagasy francs on the campaign, drawn from the proceeds of his business and private donations. His campaign staff widely distributed promotional posters featuring the candidate's face, name and slogan, and handed out free Tiko yogurts and boxes of milk to the public. Ravalomanana's campaign posters often featured the Tiko logo and images of the candidate riding a bicycle laden with milk canisters to play on his image as a simple and poor farmer who, through intelligence, determination and responsible management, succeeded <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> thriving business and would apply these same skills to develop the capital city. The Ravalomanana campaign received support {{on the basis of}} his evident success as a manager, his leadership in the Christian community and his non-alignment with Ratsiraka's AREMA party, as well as his relative youthfulness and physical attractiveness to female voters. The campaign opened on 2 November 1999, and by 8 November Ravalomanana held a led in the polls. In the 14 November municipal elections, Ravalomanana was elected mayor of Antananarivo with 45 per cent of the votes.|$|E
5|$|There were various {{attempts}} to create royal naval {{forces in the}} fifteenth century. James IV put the enterprise on a new footing, founding a harbour at Newhaven and a dockyard at the Pools of Airth. He acquired a total of 38 ships including the Great Michael, at that time, the largest ship in Europe. Scottish ships had some success against privateers, accompanied the king on his expeditions in the islands and intervened in conflicts Scandinavia and the Baltic, but were sold after the Flodden campaign. From 1516 Scottish naval efforts would rely on privateering captains and hired merchantmen. James V did not share his father's interest <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> navy and shipbuilding fell behind the Low Countries. Despite truces between England and Scotland there were periodic outbreaks of a guerre de course. James V built a new harbour at Burntisland in 1542. The chief use of naval power in his reign were a series of expeditions to the Isles and France. After the Union of Crowns in 1603 conflict between Scotland and England ended, but Scotland found itself involved in England's foreign policy, opening up Scottish shipping to attack. In 1626 a squadron of three ships were bought and equipped. There were also several marque fleets of privateers. In 1627, the Royal Scots Navy and accompanying contingents of burgh privateers participated in the major expedition to Biscay. The Scots also returned to West Indies and in 1629 {{took part in the}} capture of Quebec.|$|E
