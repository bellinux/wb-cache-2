5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF <b>hypovolemia.</b>|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial leaks and spinal leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are spinal. Cranial leaks occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF <b>hypovolemia</b> as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in which the body naturally runs out of blood, though it is akin to a real condition called <b>hypovolemia)</b> and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause <b>hypovolemia</b> (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
25|$|An {{expansion}} on CABC {{that accounts}} for the significantly increased risk of hypothermia by a patient due to <b>hypovolemia</b> and the body's subsequent cold weather-like reaction.|$|E
25|$|Blood transfusions {{are given}} {{as needed to}} correct anemia and {{hypotension}} secondary to <b>hypovolemia.</b> Infusion of platelet concentrates is recommended for correction of hemorrhage associated with platelet-type vWD.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypovolemia</b> is {{a massive}} {{decrease}} in blood volume, and death by excessive loss of blood {{is referred to as}} exsanguination. Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10–15% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison, blood donation typically takes 8–10% of the donor's blood volume). The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called hemostasis and {{is an important part of}} both first aid and surgery.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{sorbitol}} added to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, used {{in the treatment of}} hyperkalemia) can cause complications in the GI tract, including bleeding, perforated colonic ulcers, ischemic colitis and colonic necrosis, particularly in patients with uremia. Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include immunosuppression, <b>hypovolemia,</b> postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used carefully in the management of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{dose range}} for {{induction}} of anesthesia using thiopental is from 3 to 6mg/kg; however, {{there are many}} factors that can alter this. Premedication with sedatives such as benzodiazepines or clonidine will reduce requirements, as do specific disease states and other patient factors. Among patient factors are: age, sex, and lean body mass. Specific disease conditions that can alter the dose requirements of thiopentone {{and for that matter}} any other intravenous anaesthetic are: <b>hypovolemia,</b> burns, azotemia, hepatic failure, hypoproteinemia, etc.|$|E
25|$|Massive PE causing hemodynamic {{instability}} (shock and/or low blood pressure, {{defined as}} a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or a pressure drop of 40 mmHg for >15 min if not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, <b>hypovolemia</b> or sepsis) is an indication for thrombolysis, the enzymatic destruction of the clot with medication. In this situation, {{it is the best}} available treatment in those without contraindications and is supported by clinical guidelines. It is also recommended in those in cardiac arrest with a known PE.|$|E
25|$|Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and {{hemorrhage}} in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal symptoms quickly {{progress to}} severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Hemorrhage causes bloody feces (melena) and vomiting blood (hematemesis). The low blood volume (<b>hypovolemia)</b> caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss {{can lead to}} organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and GI tract and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (polydipsia), low urine production (oliguria), and bloody urine (hematuria).|$|E
25|$|Healthcare and pre-hospital-care {{providers}} (EMTs or paramedics) {{often use}} the fingernail beds as a cursory indicator of distal tissue perfusion {{of individuals who}} may be dehydrated or in shock. However, this test is not considered reliable in adults. This {{is known as the}} CRT or blanch test. The fingernail bed is briefly depressed to turn the nail-bed white. When the pressure is released, the normal pink colour should be restored within a second or two. Delayed return to pink color can be an indicator of certain shock states such as <b>hypovolemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Large colon impactions {{typically}} {{occur at}} the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon, two areas where the lumen of the intestine narrows. Large colon impactions are most frequently seen in horses that have recently had a sudden decrease in exercise, such as after a musculoskeletal injury. They are also associated {{in the practice of}} twice daily feeding of grain meals, which causes a short-lived but significant secretion of fluid into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a 15% decrease in plasma volume (<b>hypovolemia</b> of the circulatory system) and the subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Aldosterone secretion activates absorption of fluid from the colon, decreasing the water content of the ingesta and increasing risk of impaction. Amitraz has also been associated with large colon impaction, due to alterations in motility and retention of intestinal contents, which causes further absorption of water and dehydration of ingesta. Other possible factors include poor dental care, course roughage, dehydration, and limited exercise.|$|E
25|$|Volvulus of {{the large}} colon usually occurs where the {{mesentery}} attaches to the body wall, but may also occur at the diaphragmatic or sternal flexures, with rotations up to 720 degrees reported. It is most commonly seen in postpartum mares, usually presents with severe signs of colic that are refractory to analgesic administration, and horses often lie in dorsal recumbency. Abdominal distention is common due to strangulation and rapid engorgement of the intestine with gas, which then can lead to dyspnea as the growing bowel pushes against the diaphragm and prevents normal ventilation. Additionally, compression can place pressure on the caudal vena cava, leading to pooling of blood and <b>hypovolemia.</b> However, horses {{may not have a}} high heart rate, presumably due to increased vagal tone. Rectal palpation will demonstrate a severely gas distended colon, and the examiner {{may not be able to}} push beyond the brim of the pelvis due to the obstruction. The colon may be irreversibly damaged in as little as 3–4 hours from the initial time of the volvulus, so immediate surgical correction is required. The surgeon works to correct the volvulus and then removes any damaged colon. 95% of the colon may be resected, but often the volvulus damages more than this amount, requiring euthanasia. Plasma lactate levels can help predict survival rates, with an increased survival seen in horses with a lactate below 6.0mmol/L. Prognosis is usually poor, with a survival rate of approximately 36% of horses with a 360 degree volvulus, and 74% of those with a 270 degree volvulus, and a reoccurrence rate of 5–50%. Complications post-surgery include hypoproteinemia, endotoxic shock, laminitis, and DIC.|$|E
500|$|Esophageal varices {{often do}} not have {{symptoms}} until they rupture. A ruptured varix is considered a medical emergency, because varices can bleed a lot. A bleeding varix may cause a person to vomit blood, or suffer shock. To deal with a ruptured varix, a band may be placed around the bleeding blood vessel, or {{a small amount of}} a clotting agent may be injected near the bleed. A surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound. IV fluids and blood products [...] may be given in order to prevent <b>hypovolemia</b> from excess blood loss.|$|E
500|$|The {{administration}} of fluid therapy in individuals with pulmonary contusion is controversial. Excessive fluid in the circulatory system (hypervolemia) can worsen hypoxia {{because it can}} cause fluid leakage from injured capillaries (pulmonary edema), which are more permeable than normal. However, low blood volume (<b>hypovolemia)</b> resulting from insufficient fluid has an even worse impact, potentially causing hypovolemic shock; {{for people who have}} lost large amounts of blood, fluid resuscitation is necessary. [...] A lot of the evidence supporting the idea that fluids should be withheld from people with pulmonary contusion came from animal studies, not clinical trials with humans; human studies have had conflicting findings on whether fluid resuscitation worsens the condition. [...] Current recommendations suggest giving enough fluid to ensure sufficient blood flow but not giving any more fluid than necessary. [...] For people who do require large amounts of intravenous fluid, a catheter may be placed in the pulmonary artery to measure the pressure within it. [...] Measuring pulmonary artery pressure allows the clinician to give enough fluids to prevent shock without exacerbating edema. [...] Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, can be used when fluid overload does occur, {{as long as there is}} not a significant risk of shock. [...] Furosemide, a diuretic used in the treatment of pulmonary contusion, also relaxes the smooth muscle in the veins of the lungs, thereby decreasing pulmonary venous resistance and reducing the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries.|$|E

2500|$|Sea {{water is}} {{hypertonic}} relative to blood, so water diffuses from blood {{into the water}} in the alveoli, and the electrolytes diffuse into the blood, leading to <b>hypovolemia,</b> [...] haemoconcentration and hypernatremia. The laboratory blood tests may show these shifts, which may be diagnostically useful. In animal experiments the thicker blood requires more work from the heart leading to cardiac arrest in 8 to 10 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Males with classic CAH {{generally}} have {{no signs of}} CAH at birth. [...] Some may present with hyperpigmentation, due to co-secretion with melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and possible penile enlargement. [...] Age of diagnosis of males with CAH varies and depends on the severity of aldosterone deficiency. [...] Boys with salt-wasting disease present early with symptoms of hyponatremia and <b>hypovolemia.</b> [...] Boys with non-salt-wasting disease present later with signs of virilization.|$|E
2500|$|As part of {{the initial}} injury there is an {{extensive}} inflammatory response due to pancreatic cells synthesizing and secreting inflammatory mediators: primarily TNF-alpha and IL-1. [...] A hallmark of acute pancreatitis is {{a manifestation of the}} inflammatory response, namely the recruitment of neutrophils to the pancreas. [...] The inflammatory response leads to the secondary manifestations of pancreatitis: <b>hypovolemia</b> from capillary permeability, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulations, renal failure, cardiovascular failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.|$|E
2500|$|Storage of {{red blood}} cells, {{lymphocytes}} and other formed elements. In horses, roughly 30% {{of the red}} blood cells are stored there. The red blood cells can be released when needed. In humans, up to a cup (240 ml) of red blood cells can {{be held in the}} spleen and released in cases of <b>hypovolemia.</b> [...] It can store platelets {{in case of an emergency}} and also clears old platelets from the circulation. Up to a quarter of lymphocytes can be stored in the spleen at any one time.|$|E
2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) or indomethacin {{can be used to}} create mild <b>hypovolemia</b> which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the common}} ostrich is in a {{dehydrated}} state plasma osmolality, [...] Na+, K+, and Cl- ions all increase, however, K+ ions returned to controlled concentration. The common ostrich also experiences {{an increase in}} haematocrit, resulting in a hypovolemic state. Two antidiuretic hormones, Arginine vasotocin (AVT) and angiotensin (AII) are increased in blood plasma {{as a response to}} [...] and <b>hypovolemia.</b> AVT triggers antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which targets the nephrons of the kidney. ADH causes a reabsorption of water from the lumen of the nephron to the extracellular fluid osmotically. These extracellular fluids then drain into blood vessels, causing a rehydrating effect. This drainage prevents loss of water by both lowering volume and increasing concentration of the urine. Angiotensin, on the other hand, causes vasoconstriction on the systemic arterioles, and acts as a dipsogen for ostriches. Both of these antidiuretic hormones work together to maintain water levels in the body that would normally be lost due to the osmotic stress of the arid environment.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally {{there can}} be an {{obstruction}} by large numbers of roundworms. This is most commonly seen in young horses {{as a result of}} a very heavy infestation of Parascaris equorum that can subsequently cause a blockage and rupture of the small intestine. Rarely, dead worms will be seen in reflux. Deworming heavily infected horses may cause a severe immune reaction to the dead worms, which can damage the intestinal wall and cause a fatal peritonitis. Veterinarians often treat horses with suspected heavy worm burdens with corticosteroids to reduce the inflammatory response to the dead worms. [...] Blockages of the small intestine, particularly the ileum, can occur with Parascaris equorum and may well require colic surgery to remove them manually. Large roundworm infestations are often the result of a poor deworming program. Horses develop immunity to parascarids between 6 months age and one year and so this condition is rare in adult horses. Prognosis is fair unless the foal experiences <b>hypovolemia</b> and septic shock, with a survival rate of 33%.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{directed}} towards (1) correcting hypotension, <b>hypovolemia,</b> electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic acidosis; (2) improving vascular integrity, and (3) providing an immediate source of glucocorticoids. Rapid correction of <b>hypovolemia</b> {{is the first}} priority.|$|E
50|$|ECF volume {{contraction}} or <b>hypovolemia</b> {{is usually}} the type of volume contraction of primary concern in emergency, since ECF is approximately half the volume of ICF and {{is the first to}} be affected in e.g. bleeding.

50|$|Appropriate ADH release can be {{a result}} of <b>hypovolemia,</b> a {{so-called}} osmotic trigger of ADH release. This may be true <b>hypovolemia,</b> as a result of dehydration with fluid losses replaced by free water (seen sometimes in Marathon runners as well as in acutely ill patients). It can also be perceived <b>hypovolemia,</b> as in the conditions of congestive heart failure (CHF) and cirrhosis in which the kidneys perceive a lack of intravascular volume. The hyponatremia caused by appropriate ADH release (from the kidneys' perspective) in both CHF and cirrhosis {{have been shown to be}} an independent poor prognostic indicator of mortality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypovolemia</b> is a {{state of}} {{decreased}} blood volume; more specifically, decrease in volume of blood plasma.
