5000|$|The {{presence}} of water plays {{a crucial role}} in the mechanical behavior of natural fibers. Hydrated, biopolymers generally have enhanced <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness.</b> Water plays the role of a plasticizer, a small molecule easing passage of polymer chains and in doing so increasing <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness.</b> When using natural fibers in applications outside of their native use, the original level of hydration must be taken into account. For example when hydrated, the Young’s Modulus of collagen decreases from 3.26 to 0.6 GPa and becomes both more ductile and tougher. Additionally the density of collagen decreases from 1.34 to 1.18 g/cm^3.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Effect of {{artificial}} ageing temperature on the mechanical properties of Al- 6 Si- 0. 5 Mg alloy containing 0. 5 – 4 wt % Cu was studied. The solution treated alloys containing different amounts of Cu were aged isochronally for 1 hour at temperatures up to 300 oC.

During artificial ageing, the yield and ultimate tensile strengths were found to increase with ageing temperature; the maximum being attained at peak aged condition. <b>Ductility</b> <b>and</b> impact <b>toughness</b> of the alloys, {{on the other hand}} decreased with ageing temperature reaching the minimum at the highest hardness.

50|$|Usually {{the initial}} {{workpiece}} that is hot worked was originally cast. The microstructure of cast items does not optimize the engineering properties, from a microstructure standpoint. Hot working improves the engineering {{properties of the}} workpiece because it replaces the microstructure with one that has fine spherical shaped grains. These grains increase the strength, <b>ductility,</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness</b> of the material.|$|E
5000|$|These steels lie, {{in terms}} of {{performance}} and cost, between carbon steel and low alloy steel. Yield strength is between [...] without heat treatment. Weldability is good, and can even be improved by reducing carbon content while maintaining strength. Fatigue life and wear resistance are superior to similar heat-treated steels. The disadvantages are that <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness</b> are {{not as good as}} quenched and tempered (Q&T) steels. They must also be heated hot enough for all of the alloys to be in solution; after forming, the material must be quickly cooled to 540 to 600 C.|$|E
50|$|Methods {{have been}} devised to modify the yield strength, <b>ductility,</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness</b> of both {{crystalline}} and amorphous materials. These strengthening mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit {{a variety of different}} applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from interstitial incorporation of carbon into the iron lattice. Brass, a binary alloy of copper and zinc, has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening. Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce dislocations into materials, increasing their yield strengths.|$|E

50|$|An alloy is {{a mixture}} of two or more {{elements}} in which the main component is a metal. Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for practical use. Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics. The aim of making alloys is generally to make them less brittle, harder, resistant to corrosion, or have a more desirable color and luster. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steel) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels, with increasing carbon levels reducing <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness.</b> The addition of silicon will produce cast irons, while the addition of chromium, nickel and molybdenum to carbon steels (more than 10%) results in stainless steels.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} metal alloys is a {{significant}} part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steels) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness.</b> Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron-carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, slit rolling was {{introduced}} to Hadeed's Rolling Mills, increasing the daily production record by more than 21%. In 1987, a scrap car shredder plant was commissioned. With a capacity of 50 tonnes per hour, it shreds cars into pieces small enough to be charged into the electric arc furnaces. In 1988, Hadeed introduced a new technology (Bar Quenching) to its rolling mills in Jubail for the manufacture of concrete reinforcing bars. This process involves high pressure surface quenching followed by self-tempering. As the bar emerges from the last rolling stand, the surface temperature is rapidly reduced by high pressure water jets. This action causes change in the microstructure of the steel, making it harder and stronger. Subsequently the heat retained in the core dissipates out and heats the surface to around 620 °C causing another change in the microstructure, which improves the <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness</b> of the bar. This process can meet increasing demands from structural engineers for higher yield strength combined with good ductility and weldability in reinforcing steel to reduce construction costs.|$|E

40|$|Ultrafine grained (1 μm) steels {{have been}} the subject of {{extensive}} research work during the past years. These steels generally offer interesting perspectives looking for improved mechanical properties. UFG Powder Metallurgy hot work tool steels (HWTS) can be fabricated by high energy mechanical milling (MM) followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). However, similarly to most UFG and Nano-Crystalline (NC) metals, reduced <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness</b> result from the early plastic instabilities in these steels. Industrialization of UFG PM Tool Steels requires the application of specific metallurgical tailoring to produce tools with sound mechanical properties or in a more optimistic way, to break the Strength-Toughness “trade-off” in these materials. Among the possible ways proposed to restore <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness</b> without losing the high strength, “Harmonic microstructure” design seems to be a very promising endeavor in this regard. Harmonic microstructure materials consist of a tunable volume fraction of evenly spaced “isolated” coarse-grained particles (CG) surrounded by a 3 D interconnected network of UFG particles. CGs provide <b>ductility</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness,</b> while high strength is guaranteed by the interconnected network of UFGs. This peculiar design offers an extra work hardening due to the generation of geometrically necessary dislocations at the interfaces of UFGs and confined CGs that are essentially present to accommodate the strain gradient imposed by the inhomogeneous (bimodal grained) microstructure. The first part of this work is devoted to the development of PM tool steels with harmonic microstructure. Due to the difficulties of processing hard tool steel particles according to the methods reported in the literature, an economical, simple alternative approach is also proposed.
