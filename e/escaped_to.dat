A fourth destroyer, Split, was captured while under construction in the Kotor shipyard, but the Italians were not able to complete her before they sued for peace in September 1943. She was completed by the Yugoslav Navy after the war. Ten Maritime Air Force aircraft <b>escaped</b> <b>to</b> Greece, with nine eventually making it to Egypt, where they formed a squadron under Royal Air Force command.|$|E

Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king has been called 'decisive'. The king was trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he <b>escaped</b> <b>to</b> Bishop's Lynn, sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.|$|E

50|$|An equivalent, {{possibly}} more intuitive definition when X and Y are metric spaces is as follows: we say an infinite {{sequence of points}} {pi} in a topological space X <b>escapes</b> <b>to</b> infinity if, for every compact set S ⊂ X only finitely many points pi are in S. Then a continuous map f : X → Y is proper {{if and only if}} for every sequence of points {pi} that <b>escapes</b> <b>to</b> infinity in X, {f(pi)} <b>escapes</b> <b>to</b> infinity in Y.|$|R
5|$|Following the First Seminole War and {{a treaty}} with Spain, Florida became a U.S. {{territory}} in 1821.

5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then <b>escaped</b> <b>to</b> Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal States for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|After his death, {{a legend}} arose {{that he had}} not died, that his funeral was staged, and that he had <b>escaped</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii, married a native woman, and fathered several {{children}} with her. Andrew Forest Muir, writing in 1956 in the Filson Club History Quarterly, debunked this legend. He documented that the first Deshas in Hawaii did not arrive until nearly two decades after Isaac Desha's death. At the time of Baker's murder, the progenitor of the Hawaiian Desha family had been four years old. That progenitor was John R. Langherne Desha, a grandson of Governor Joseph Desha and nephew of Isaac Desha. In Honolulu, he helped establish Queen's Hospital and worked there until his death.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had <b>escaped</b> <b>to</b> St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had never heard of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E
