A chimeric gene coding for T-URF 13 fused to the mitochondrial targeting peptide from the Neurospora crassa ATP synthase subunit 9 precursor was constructed. Expression of this gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae yielded a polypeptide that was translocated into the membrane fraction of mitochondria and processed to give a protein {{the same size as}} maize T-URF 13. Methomyl, HmT toxin and Pm toxin inhibited growth of yeast cells expressing the gene fusion on medium containing glycerol as sole carbon source and stimulated respiration with NADH as substrate by isolated mitochondria from these cells. These effects were not observed in yeast cells expressing T-URF 13 without a targeting peptide. The results show that T-URF 13 is sufficient to confer sensitivity to methomyl and the <b>fungal</b> <b>toxins</b> in a heterologous eukaryotic system, and suggest that mitochondrial localization of T-URF 13 is critical for these functions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Enzymatic {{inactivation}} of <b>fungal</b> <b>toxins</b> is {{an attractive}} strategy for the decontamination of agricultural commodities and {{for the protection of}} crops from phytotoxic effects of fungal metabolites. This review summarizes research on the biological detoxi®cation of <b>fungal</b> <b>toxins</b> by microorganisms and plants and its practical applications. Some mycotoxins are detoxi®ed during ensiling and other fermentation processes (a¯atoxins, alternariol, mycophenolic acid, patulin, PR toxin) while others are transformed into toxic products or survive fermentation unchanged. Plants can detoxify fomannoxin, fusaric acid, HC-toxin, ochratoxin A and oxalate but the degradation of deoxynivalenol has yet to be proven. Micro¯ora of the digestive tract of vertebrates and invertebrates exhibit detoxi®cation activities towards a¯atoxins, ochratoxin A, oxalate and trichothecenes. Some toxin-producing fungi are able to degrade or transform their own products under suitable conditions. Pure cultures of bacteria and fungi which detoxify mycotoxins have been isolated from complex microbial populations by screening and enrichment culture techniques. Genes responsible for some of the detoxi®cation activities have been cloned and expressed in heterologous hosts. The detoxi®cation of a¯atoxins, cercosporin, fumonisins, fusaric acid, ochratoxin A, oxalic acid, patulin, trichothecenes and zearalenone by pure cultures is reviewed. Finally, current application of these results in food and feed production and plant breeding i...|$|R
