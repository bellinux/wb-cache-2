This study was undertaken as a result of our previous findings that monitoring streams in Hawaii for traditional <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> (<b>faecal</b> coliform, Escherichia coli, enterococci) was not useful in determining when streams are contaminated with sewage, because environmental (soil) sources rather than sewage accounted for the high concentrations of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> in streams. Two perennial streams, sewage and soil samples were monitored for traditional <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> (<b>faecal</b> coliform, E. coli, enterococci) and FRNA coliphages. The results showed that sewage treatment processes and disinfection drastically reduced the concentrations of traditional <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> but FRNA coliphages were still present in significant concentrations in the treated sewage effluents. These results indicate that monitoring sewage effluents and environmental waters for only traditional <b>faecal</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> may not be adequately protective of human health effects.

40|$|Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium is an {{important}} enteropathogen that causes human morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is essential to study the interaction between Salmonella and the gut bacteria to elucidate the elements that influence {{the ability of the}} pathogen to overcome the colonisation barrier mediated by the gut microbiota and why Salmonella can persist in ‘healthy’ individuals in a carrier state after infection. In this study the effect of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> on the growth and survival of S. Typhimurium was investigated. Initially, experiments involved co-cultures of the pathogen and single strains of intestinal bacteria obtained from culture collections; results showed that when E. coli reached its maximum concentration density, the growth of S. Typhimurium was halted. S. Typhimurium was then inoculated with multi-strain gut bacteria from culture collections and also with faecal samples in batch cultures mimicking the conditions of the human colon. A significant reduction of S. Typhimurium concentration was observed in mixed cultures with faecal samples from different human donors; however, bacteria obtained from culture collection had no effect on S. Typhimurium. Close proximity with <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> was required as the pathogen was not affected when it was separated from the <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> by a 0. 45 µm pore size membrane. S.

Methods: Hand swabs from commuters (n = 308) at train stations in 4 cities were tested for the presence of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Results: The prevalence of hand contamination with <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> was again higher in cities in the north compared to the south (5 % in London, 4 % in Birmingham, 10 % in Liverpool and 19 % in Newcastle).

40|$|Dung-pats {{excreted}} {{directly on}} pasture from grazing animals can contribute a significant burden of faecal microbes to agricultural land. The {{aim of this}} study was to use a combined field and modelling approach to determine the importance of Escherichia coli growth in dung-pats when predicting <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> accumulation on grazed grassland. To do this an empirical model was developed to predict the dynamics of an E. coli reservoir within 1 ha plots each grazed by four beef steers for six months. Published first-order die-off coefficients were used within the model to describe the expected decline of E. coli in dung-pats. Modelled estimates using first-order kinetics led to an underestimation of the observed E. coli land reservoir, when using site specific die-off coefficients. A simultaneous experiment determined the die-off profiles of E. coli within fresh faeces of beef cattle under field-relevant conditions and suggested that <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> may experience growth and re-growth in the period post-defecation when exposed to a complex interaction of environmental drivers such as variable temperature, UV radiation and moisture levels. This growth phase in dung-pats is not accounted for in models based on first-order die-off coefficients. When the model was amended to incorporate the growth of E. coli, equivalent to that observed in the field study, the prediction of the E. coli reservoir was improved with respect to the observed data and produced a previously unquantified step-change improvement in model predictions of the accumulation of these <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> on grasslands.

40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} biosolid and soil type on the {{movement}} of faecal coliforms through the vadose zone was investigated following the application of animal manure to soil. Two types of biosolid, solid and liquid manure, were applied to two soil types at {{a wide range of}} initial water contents. Bacteria present in the soil solution were collected using calibrated ceramic-porous-cup samplers. Estimated bacterial migration velocities in the soil profile were consistent with the hypo-thesis that bacteria move mostly through soil macropores, as the rate of transport was faster than the average pore-water velocity. Macropore transport was more likely to occur in wet soils, but it was not necessarily restricted to soils with high initial soil water content. A larger soil clay content, lower total soil porosity, and lower saturated hydraulic conductivity resulted in a greater likelihood that suspended bacteria would be funnelled through pores of larger diameter and faster pore water velocity, increasing the potential vertical transport length of bacteria through the vadose zone. Total porosity was not a significant factor in enhancing deep transport of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The potential of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> to be transported to depth in soil was correlated with the water content of the manure. We conclude that application of animal manure to soil can readily lead to groundwater contamination with <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> especially under moist soil conditions, and that macropores are important in the transport...|$|R

This project investigated factors influencing the relative abundance of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) in intertidal estuarine sediments. The effects of physical, biogeochemical and biological sediment characteristics, environmental variables and native microbial communities were explored through field campaigns on the Ythan and Eden estuaries, Scotland. The contributory role of sediments to adverse water quality was investigated by combining FIO abundance and measurements of sediment stability. The importance of strain and sediment characteristics in the adhesion of E. coli to suspended sediments was also examined using laboratory experiments. E. coli concentrations up to 5. 9 log₁₀ CFU 100 g dry wt⁻¹ were observed, confirming that intertidal sediments are an important reservoir of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The variability of E. coli abundance in estuarine sediments was successfully explained with multiple stepwise linear regression (Adjusted R² up to 87. 4) using easily-obtainable measurements of sediment characteristics and environmental variables, with variability most heavily influenced by salinity and particle size gradients. Native microbial community population metrics and community constituent composition correlated with environmental gradients, but did not influence FIO abundance. The amount of E. coli adhering to suspended sediments ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 74 log₁₀ CFU ml⁻¹, and was dependant on strain characteristics and sediment type rather than zeta potential, with higher cell-particle adhesion at 2 and 3. 5 PSU than 0 and 5 PSU.

The aim of the present study was to identify the main sources of the faecal pollution of the Seine estuary in order to help define priorities for management and sanitation efforts. Budgets of faecal coliform (FC) inputs to the estuary were established for various hydrological conditions. Main sources of FC were the outfalls of the treated effluents of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located along the estuary, the <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> brought in through the tributaries of the Seine estuary, and the <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> transported by the Seine river flow at the estuary entrance at Poses dam. In order to quantify these inputs, FC were enumerated during sampling campaigns conducted for various hydrological conditions in the Seine at the entrance of the estuary, in the tributaries close to their confluence with the estuary, and in the effluents of some WWTPs located along the estuary. The importance of the flux of FC transported by the Seine river flow at the estuary entrance at Poses dam decreased from 92 % of the total FC input when the flow rate was high (717 m 3 s 21) to 5 % when flow rate was low (143 m 3 s 21). The release of the domestic waste{{waters of the}} large city of Paris located 120 km upstream from the entrance of the estuary was mainly responsible for this microbiological pollution. At low flow rates, the tributaries represent the most important source of FC (64 – 76 % for flow rates of the Seine at Poses at approximately 150 m 3 s 21), mainly from the Robec and Eure rivers.

However, there are many other factors, such as the morphology of the beach, its orientation relative to waves and the proximity of spills, that can affect the survival of these bacteria and therefore directly influence the water quality in the coastal zone. In this article, 270 beaches between the provinces of Valencia and Granada (Spain) were analysed. It was observed that the local factors that further affect the concentration of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> in coastal water are the presence of meadows of Posidonia oceanica, the orientation of the beach with respect to the direction of the most common incident waves and the agricultural discharges in the sea.

40|$|Despite large {{investments}} {{made for the}} management of theBrussels’ sewer systems, the river Zenne still receives high loads of pollutants, especially considering the small size of thisreceiving water. An interuniversity, multidisciplinary research project‘Good Ecological Statusof theriver Zenne (GESZ) ’was therefore launched to evaluate the effects of the wastewatermanagement plans in the river basin on the ecological functioning of the river. Hereto, differentwater quantity and quality processes were considered: the hydrology in the river basin, thehydraulics in the river and in the sewers, erosion and sediment transport and faecal bacteriatransport and decay. To this purpose, existing models are being used (the SWAT for thehydrology and the erosion, the SWMM for the hydraulics) and new simulators have beendeveloped for the sediment transport and for the <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> For the integration of thesemodels and to allow a flexible selection of the different models, it was decided to opt for theOpenMI platform. This paper discusses the early results of this integrated modelling of the riverZenne using OpenMI, considering the hydrologic model, the hydraulic model, the sedimenttransport model and a model describing the <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> dynamics. Results are presented for Escherichia coli(E. coli), taken as an indicator bacteria. The results indicate that the interactionsbetween the sediments and the bacteria should be taken into account by the modelling. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|In 2000, the European Union (EU) {{launched}} the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{calling for a}} good ecological status for water bodies by 2015 through integrated river basin management. Despite huge investments, the river Zenne (Belgium) still acquires high loads of pollutants. A multidisciplinary research project was therefore launched to evaluate the effects of river basin wastewater management plans on the river's ecological functioning. Different water quantity and quality processes were considered, and different models were used for each process. For the integration of these models – in view of a holistic analysis – we opted for the Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI). This paper discusses early results of integrated <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> modelling considering five models. The integrated model is shown to reproduce concentrations of E. coli (used as indicator <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria)</b> with ‘Very Good’, and ‘Satisfactory’ accuracy for dry weather, and long-term simulations respectively. For both cases, {{it is found that}} the E. coli concentrations in the river are well above EU level for bathing water, with occasional Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) from the Brussels' sewer systems making the ecological status even worse. We also found OpenMI-based integration to be very useful. However, the calculation time overhead for such OpenMI integrated models remains significant.

40|$|The use of {{polyclonal}} antibodies in differentiating between {{samples of}} faecal microflora derived from ten healthy volunteers was assessed. The distribution of FITC-labelled antibodies (of the IgA, IgG and IgM isotype) over 144 morphologically distinct subsets of <b>faecal</b> <b>bacteria</b> ('morphotypes') was quantified {{by means of}} digital morphometry and quantitative immunofluorescence. Furthermore, a new dataprocessing algorithm was developed which makes objective quantitation of the antibody distributions over the faecal morphotypes possible. The {{results of this study}} imply that the antibody binding capacity of faecal morphotypes is a unique characteristic of faecal microflora. ...|$|R
