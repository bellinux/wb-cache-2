50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> is {{classified}} as pregnancy category C. The efficacy and safety profile of <b>finafloxacin</b> ear drops are unknown in children younger than the age of 1 years old. There are no limitations against using <b>finafloxacin</b> ear drops in the elderly.|$|E
50|$|The {{spectrum}} of adverse effects caused by <b>finafloxacin</b> vary by {{the method of}} administration. People that have administered <b>finafloxacin</b> into their ears {{in the form of}} drops have experienced ear itching and nausea (<1% for both). People that have administered <b>finafloxacin</b> by mouth or intravenously (IV) have experienced gastrointestinal side effects (including diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea), fatigue, headaches, musculoskeletal problems, and injection site reactions (if IV). Respiratory disorders, including rhinitis and nasopharyngitis, have also been {{associated with the use of}} <b>finafloxacin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> has {{demonstrated}} bactericidal activity against {{a range of}} bacterial pathogens, especially at acidic pH, with a post-antibiotic effect. Due to its activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, <b>finafloxacin</b> is classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> {{has good}} oral bioavailability, meaning that a {{substantial}} potion of a dose taken by mouth reaches a person's systemic circulation. Some people have experienced unintentional, quantifiable absorption of <b>finafloxacin</b> after administering the drug via the ear.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its high}} {{bactericidal}} activity in acidic environments, some {{have speculated that}} <b>finafloxacin</b> {{may be useful in}} the treatment of urinary tract infections in the future. Finafloxacin's manufacturer, MerLion, has invested money in studying the use of <b>finafloxacin</b> for this indication.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} notable {{differences}} between the chemistry of <b>finafloxacin</b> and related fluoroquinolones. For example, the 8-cyano-substituent is not found in ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin has an 8-methoxy-substituent instead. The oxygen atom in the ring structure of <b>finafloxacin</b> makes the molecule more hydrophilic than ciprofloxacin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> is used {{to treat}} acute otitis externa caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In the {{clinical}} trial {{that lead to the}} drug's approval, <b>finafloxacin</b> shortened the time to cessation of ear pain from an average of 6.8 days in patients taking a placebo to 3.5 days.|$|E
50|$|People {{that are}} {{allergic}} to other quinolones may be allergic to <b>finafloxacin</b> as well, and use {{may result in}} an allergic reaction in that population. Adverse effects consistent with an allergic reaction to <b>finafloxacin</b> may include swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> is {{the first}} FDA {{approved}} medication in the United Status that was first developed by a Singaporean drug company. <b>Finafloxacin</b> was officially approved by the FDA on December 17, 2014. The company, MerLion Pharmaceuticals, partnered with the North American company Alcon to produce the drug commerically in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> {{cannot be}} {{purchased}} over-the-counter, {{and is available}} by prescription only.|$|E
50|$|The {{elimination}} half-life of <b>finafloxacin</b> {{is approximately}} 10 hours in humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> is a {{fluoroquinolone}} class antibiotic of the 8-cyano subclass (referring to the CN substituent at the 8th position). Like other fluoroquinolones, its antibiotic {{activity is}} derived from its pharmacological mechanism of action as a type II topoisomerase poison, preventing bacteria from replicating and performing other vital, cellular functions. However, unlike other fluoroquinolones, <b>finafloxacin</b> is highly active under acidic (pH 5.0-6.0) conditions, where certain bacteria (like Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that is known to infect the human stomach, despite the harsh acidity) thrive. Other acidic conditions found on the human body include the vagina, urinary tract, and skin, though <b>finafloxacin</b> is currently not used to treat infections in these areas either.|$|E

50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> is commercially {{available}} as a 0.3% otic suspension for topical administration in the United States. The suspension should be warmed gently in the hands for 1-2 minutes before administration to prevent dizziness, and shaken before use. It is necessary to remain still for 1 minute, with the affected ear facing up while lying on one's side, after administration to allow <b>finafloxacin</b> to penetrate the ear canal and reach the site of infection.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the local}} effect of {{administering}} <b>finafloxacin</b> into the ears, {{it is unlikely that}} it will affect or be affected by other medications that are administered into the systemic circulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> (Xtoro) is a {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotic. In the United States, it {{is approved}} by the Food and Drug Administration to treat acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear) caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chemical}} structure of <b>finafloxacin</b> {{has been described}} as a [...] "fluorinated quinolone derivative with 8-cyano-substituent and 7-pyrrolo-oxazinyl moiety." [...] Its low isoelectric point (pH 6.7) is lower than the isoelectric point of another fluoroquinolone class antibiotic called ciprofloxacin (pH 7.4), which accounts for finafloxacin's superior activity at low pH (5.0-6.0).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{the past}} decade, the {{indiscriminate}} use of fluoroquinolones in the prophylaxis {{and treatment of}} urinary tract infections (UTIs) {{has led to an}} increase of antibiotic resistance patterns. <b>Finafloxacin</b> is a new generation fluoroquinolone with interesting preclinical characteristics and pH-related efficacy. Areas covered: This review summarizes finafloxacin's safety profile and prospectively evaluates its specific use in the treatment of UTIs. This article was based on a Medline English literature search. Expert opinion: In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that <b>finafloxacin</b> expresses its full antibacterial activity in acidic environments and is able to exert significant bactericidal effects in difficult-to-treat infections. <b>Finafloxacin</b> has a broad antibacterial spectrum and efficient pharmacokinetic absorption. Moreover, it undergoes extensive tissue distribution, resulting in good antibacterial activity for daily dosages from 400 to 800 mg. This novel compound has also been successfully tested on biofilm-related Escherichia <b>Finafloxacin</b> has demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile in humans when administered orally or intravenously and is thus an interesting compound for the treatment of UTIs. However, further prospective randomized clinical trials will be necessary to confirm these preliminary results before definitive conclusions can be made...|$|E
40|$|<b>Finafloxacin</b> {{is a new}} {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotic {{with the}} unique property of increasing antibacterial activity at pH values lower than neutral. Whereas its antibacterial activity at neutral pH matches that of other quinolones in clinical use, {{it is expected to}} surpass this activity in tissues and body fluids acidified by the infection or inflammation processes. Pharmacokinetic parameters of oral single and multiple doses of up to 800 mg of <b>finafloxacin</b> and safety/tolerability observations were assessed in a phase I study including 95 healthy volunteers. <b>Finafloxacin</b> is well absorbed after oral administration, generating maximum concentrations (Cmaxs) in plasma at least comparable to those of other fluoroquinolones, with a half-life of around 10 h. About one-third of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Renal elimination appears to be a saturable process leading to slight increases of the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity and dose normalized (AUC,norm) at dosages of 400 mg and above. Safety and tolerability data characterize <b>finafloxacin</b> as a drug with a favorable safety profile. In particular, adverse reactions regarded as class-typical of fluoro-quinolones, such as, e. g., electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, neurotoxic effects, or hypoglycemia, were not observed in the study population. Fluoroquinolones in clinical use constitute a class of antibi-otics that are both effective and, in general, rather well toler...|$|E
40|$|Abstract (200 words max) Lipoglycopeptide, ketolide and {{quinolone}} antibiotics {{are currently}} in clinical development, with specific advantages over available molecules within their respective classes.
