Forensic Science Laboratory, Mizoram started functioning initially {{with only one}} division i.e. chemistry, Mizoram FSL now have 7(seven) divisions viz. Chemistry, Questioned Document, Ballistics & Toolmarks, <b>Fingerprint,</b> <b>Photography,</b> DNA/Serology and Toxicology, and headed by Director rank Forensic Scientist. The Laboratory was upgraded to a full-fledged Directorate in March, 2015 which is in par with the guidelines of National Human Rights Commission.|$|E

5000|$|Black bag {{operations}} (or {{black bag}} jobs) are covert or clandestine entries into structures {{to obtain information}} for human intelligence operations. This usually entails breaking and entering into denied areas. Some of the tactics, techniques and procedures associated with black bag operations are: lock picking, safe cracking, key impressions, <b>fingerprinting,</b> <b>photography,</b> electronic surveillance (including audio and video surveillance), mail manipulation (flaps and seals), forgery, {{and a host of}} other related skills. The term [...] "black bag" [...] refers to the little black bag in which burglars carry their tools. [...] "The CIA remains responsible for conducting these highly classified operations overseas, while the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) performs the exact same function inside the U.S. and its territories." ...|$|R

The analysis of crime reports became more systematic. He purchased the land on Havelock Road, Colombo, on which the Police Headquarters and the 'Police Park' playing fields are located.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} fingerprint identification as a mode {{of state}} surveillance. Drawing on but critiquing the work of Simon Cole, it argues that the technique yielded a greater, more pervasive form of state surveillance by giving rise to new practices of data collection. This paper also highlights the photograph’s role in fingerprint identification to argue for an essential transformation in law enforcement and surveillance practices announced by the intersection of <b>fingerprinting</b> and <b>photography</b> {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century. In contrast to traditional forms of visual surveillance, the collaboration of <b>fingerprint</b> identification and <b>photography</b> extended the surveillance gaze of the state in a manner often attributed to the rise of CCTV, enabling the state to bring all bodies – criminal and non-criminal alike – under surveillance. However, the unique capabilities afforded to the state through the intersection of <b>fingerprint</b> identification and <b>photography</b> remained largely theoretical until the advent of digital technologies in the 1960 s and 1970 s. At the start of the twenty-first century, advanced visual technologies and new media technologies reflect a restructuring of law enforcement and surveillance practices based on the aggregate collection of identification data. This paper argues that the continued photographing of fingerprints in contemporary law enforcement and state init iatives constitute heightened state surveillance and, as such, demands seriou...|$|R

To avoid reassignment to a strike breaking detail, he resigned from the agency and remained in Silver City, where he uses his knowledge of <b>fingerprinting,</b> ballistics, <b>photography,</b> chemistry and scientific analysis to aid Marshal Stone in his investigations. Owen, a former medical student, was forced {{to take over the}} family mortuary business after the accidental deaths of her parents. Her medical skills make her a valuable ally and friend to Stone and Finch.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityProblems which {{confront the}} police {{in the last few}} decades have given rise to a {{complete}} change in the methods developed for dealing with them. The press, as an instrument of police administration, should stand in the front rank, along with the use of two-way radio, teletype, firearms identification, <b>fingerprints,</b> and <b>photography,</b> among others. The development of a comprehensive police-press program, therefore, is the problem and task of this thesis. Most police departments do not have a press program. In those police departments that do have some kind of a police-press relation, there is little organization, information and knowledge from which beneficial results can emanate. Written police-press releases and constructive newspaper portrayal of police and crime news will give the public information as a basis for cooperation with the police. The benefits that can be reaped from sound police-press relations depend largely on the ingenuity and skill of the police administrator in adapting police-press techniques to his own peculiar environment. To elucidate the police and crime news problem, this study attempts to show that historical, traditional and contemporary practices of the press in their depiction of police and crime news through various techniques may tend to stimulate and develop interest in criminal activity which hamper law enforcement and crime prevention.
