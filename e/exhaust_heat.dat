5|$|HSA {{formed an}} {{agreement}} with the German Focke-Wulf aircraft company to collaborate on a joint study that looked into the issue of equipping the P.1150 with two additional lift engines. However, in October 1961, West Germany elected to entirely withdraw from participation in the programme. This was a blow that was directly felt not only by HSA and the development team, but by the British Air Ministry, who had been also seeking to collaborate with its West German counterparts on the matter of VTOL aircraft. Meanwhile, further studies served to confirmed fears that the P.1150 would be too small to meet customer specifications, and thus Camm initiated work on an enlarged derivative design. In conjunction with HSA's redesign, Bristol worked to enlarge the original PCB engine and raised the <b>exhaust</b> <b>heat</b> to increase thrust to 146.8kN (30,000lbf). It could have theoretically reach speeds of up to Mach1.7–2.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>heat</b> is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E

40|$|AbstractExhaust {{efficiency}} in tunnel fires with mechanical means was discussed. <b>Heat</b> <b>exhaust</b> efficiency and smoke exhaust efficiency were defined and studied under two different exhaust modes (longitudinal exhaust and transverse exhaust) respectively. Exhaust efficiency depends on smoke generation rate, <b>exhaust</b> rate, <b>heat</b> loss through walls of tunnel, configuration of extraction installations and so on. Under smoke extraction, smoke exhaust efficiency equals 1 if a quasi-steady vented stage without upstream outflow forms, otherwise smoke exhaust efficiency {{is less than}} 1. <b>Heat</b> <b>exhaust</b> efficiency is always less than 1 since part of the heat released by the fire is lost through the solid boundaries of tunnel by radiative and convective heat transfer between the smoke and ceiling lining. Based on experimental data obtained {{from a series of}} fire tests in a model tunnel, <b>heat</b> <b>exhaust</b> efficiency was estimated and influencing factors were discussed. In tunnel fires with transverse mechanical <b>exhaust</b> system, <b>heat</b> <b>exhaust</b> efficiency varies from 20 % to 50 %. <b>Heat</b> <b>exhaust</b> {{efficiency in}}creases along with the reduction of the number of exhaust inlets turned on while extracting and decreases along with the increase of the area of exhaust inlet.

While saving water, the efficiency of the cycle is reduced (resulting in more carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity).|$|E
