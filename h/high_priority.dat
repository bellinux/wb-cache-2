5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a <b>high</b> <b>priority.</b> Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded.|$|E
5|$|KMFDM re-{{released}} {{all of its}} old {{singles and}} hard-to-find tracks from before the 1999 breakup {{in a series of}} three double albums called Extra—Vol. 1, Vol. 2, and Vol. 3—in mid-2008. KMFDM Records released Skold vs. KMFDM in early 2009, which was a collaboration that Skold and Konietzko conducted over the Internet while on separate continents from June to October 2008. A follow-up is planned, but is not a <b>high</b> <b>priority.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To {{prioritize}} a daily task list, one either {{records the}} tasks {{in the order}} of <b>highest</b> <b>priority,</b> or assigns them a number after they are listed ("1" [...] for <b>highest</b> <b>priority,</b> [...] "2" [...] for second <b>highest</b> <b>priority,</b> etc.) which indicates in which order to execute the tasks. The latter method is generally faster, allowing the tasks to be recorded more quickly.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} avoid delays, {{software}} developers try to develop software incrementally by implementing requirements of <b>highest</b> <b>priority.</b> <b>Highest</b> <b>priority</b> requirements are such that they are preferred most by all the stakeholders, and stakeholders will get maximum benefits {{with the implementation of}} a <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> subset of set of thousands of requirements. Effective prioritization of requirements will depend on the quality of stakeholders involved and effectiveness in creating win-win situation among them. Thus, for the education sector, to take advantages of various software’s, the software should be of high quality delivered, well in time implementing <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> requirements.|$|R
5|$|Malaysia's {{foreign policy}} is officially based on the {{principle}} of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system. The government attaches a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL {{is still}} in the process of {{rebuilding}} from the events of 2006. It remains under-strength and is yet to reform its training and discipline standards. Tensions within the F-FDTL also continue to threaten the stability of the force. However, the East Timorese government places a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little progress has been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans.|$|E
5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive <b>high</b> <b>priority,</b> and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E
5000|$|Interrupt nesting. Some {{microcontrollers}} allow <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> interrupts {{to interrupt}} lower priority ones.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a <b>high</b> <b>priority.</b> A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E

5|$|Former {{prisoners of}} war were given a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> for {{repatriation}} back to Australia and discharge. Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most {{of whom had been}} held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all were on their way home by mid-September.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the Pondicherry shark {{was caught}} {{and used for}} meat. Fewer than 20 {{specimens}} have been deposited in museum collections, {{most of which were}} collected prior to 1900. This shark's rarity originally led to fears that it may be possibly extinct. However, in 2016, the Pondicherry shark was rediscovered in the Sri Lankan Menik and Kumbukkam rivers. Two photographs of this species exist; one taken from above by a group of nature enthusiasists, as well as one taken from the side by a freshwater fish survey. Given that artisanal and commercial fishing activity across its range is heavy, unregulated, and intensifying, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Pondicherry shark as Critically Endangered and placed a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> on locating any surviving populations.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Cotswold Canals Partnership was established, drawing {{together}} people {{representing the}} Proprietors, the Cotswold Canals Trust, councils at district and county level, {{and a number}} of other interested parties. This provided a suitable structure to drive the restoration forwards. In 2002, the waterway was identified as being of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> in the Association of Inland Navigation Authorities report entitled Vision for Strategic Enhancement of Britain's Inland Navigation Network, and was one of several new projects highlighted at British Waterways' Unlocked and Unlimited conference held in March. The estimated cost of the project to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal was £82 million.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Morehead {{recommended}} a plan of expanded internal improvements, including improvements along the state's rivers. The legislature responded by creating a state board of internal improvements, and named Morehead the ex-officio president of the board. In this role, he authorized many surveys of Kentucky's rivers and formulated several plans for improvements, {{but most of them}} were blocked by the Panic of 1837. One improvement that did proceed was construction of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, which was completed in 1835. Though education was not a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> for Governor Morehead, the Kentucky Common School Society and the Kentucky Association of Professional Teachers were formed during his term.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur and Kenney did prevail on Washington {{to provide}} more troop carrier aircraft. In July, SWPA was given a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> for {{transport}} aircraft, with six additional squadrons earmarked {{to bring it up}} to two groups. They were scheduled to arrive in November and December, but their movement was expedited, and the first new squadron, the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron, reached Port Moresby on 14 October. Part of the 33rd Troop Carrier Squadron was held up in the South Pacific Area, which also had urgent needs. In the meantime, ten DC-3s were converted into C-49s and C-50s at the Sacramento Air Depot and flown out to Australia, where they were allocated to the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron in September. Ten C-60 Lodestars were also despatched, which joined the 22nd Troop Carrier Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a <b>high</b> <b>priority.</b> Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E
