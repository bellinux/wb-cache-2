40|$|Based on a {{literature}} survey and {{the identification of}} all available collection material, a checklist and distribution maps for the caddisflies occurring in Flanders were prepared. Of the 126 species that have been recorded, 16 arc now extinct in Flanders, {{while the majority of}} the remaining species is rare and their populations are often vulnerable due to isolation. Caddisflies only occurred at high oxygen levels and relatively low conductivities and three species assemblages could be recognized. A first group of species lived in stagnant waters and those species tolerated slightly lower oxygen concentrations than species characteristic for running waters. In streams of the Campine region, which are characterized by a low pH and a low conductivity, a second group of species was found. The last group of species mainly occurred in the loamy region, where pH and conductivity are higher. Running waters in other ecoregions mainly contained ubiquist species and did not possess a characteristic species assemblage. Despite the fact that the <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> in Flanders slightly increased during the last few decades, the <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> of most waters is still too low for caddisflies.

30|$|The {{significance}} of bioaccumulation {{for assessing the}} chemical status of bodies of water is increasingly acknowledged as exemplified by setting new EQSbiota in the amended WFD EQS directive. Implementing the monitoring for compliance checking with these new EQSbiota {{is one of the}} challenges for the EU member states in the near future. As previously stated by Fuerhacker [64], the EQS directive is valuable for approaching a good chemical status of bodies of water even though new chemicals are not adequately considered. We further suggest that for bioaccumulative and non-metabolisable substances, EQSbiota are more relevant to chemical water quality than EQSwater since internal chemical concentrations are more related to a chemical's uptake and toxicity. Additionally, biota monitoring results can be related to <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> as demonstrated by Van Ael et al. [65]. The authors showed that for most investigated chemicals, <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> being assessed by fish community structure was lower when chemical concentrations in fish were elevated.

40|$|Harbours, {{which are}} often characterised by {{anthropogenic}} stress in combination with intensive international ship traffic, {{tend to be very}} susceptible to aquatic invasions. Since alien macrocrustaceans are known to be very successful across many European waters, a study was made on their distribution and impact in the four Belgian coastal harbours (Nieuwpoort, Ostend, Blankenberge and Zeebrugge). Biological and physical–chemical data were gathered at 43 sampling sites distributed along a salinity gradient in the four harbours. One-fourth of all crustacean species recorded were alien and represented on average 30 % of the total macrocrustacean abundance and 65 % of the total macrocrustacean biomass. The large share of alien crustaceans in the total macrocrustacean biomass was mainly due to several large alien crab species. Most alien species were found in the oligohaline zone, whereas the number of indigenous species slightly increased with increasing salinity. The low number of indigenous species present at low salinities was probably not only caused by salinity, but also by the lower water quality in this salinity range. Based on the site-specific biocontamination index (SBCI), which was used to assess the <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality,</b> the harbour of Nieuwpoort and Ostend scored best and were classified as good, indicating the limited abundance and the low number of alien macrocrustaceans.

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, the {{development}} and use of ecological models to predict {{the presence or absence of}} macroinvertebrates as water quality indicators for decision support in river management has gained a lot of interest. However, these models rarely integrate hydromorphological, physicochemical, and biological components in the submodels. We developed a generic framework for decision support in water management that can be applied to any river basin based on an integrated modelling approach. This approach integrates a mechanistic hydraulic and physicochemical water quality model with aquatic ecological models. Two types of ecological models were developed, habitat suitability models to predict the occurrence of macroinvertebrates and ecological assessment models to predict a biotic index score. Our main purpose was to assess the effectiveness of different wastewater treatment/disposal strategies considering receiving water’s ecological aspects and to determine water quality requirements. This paper presents the testing and validation of this integrated framework on a case study of a mountain river (River Cuenca) in the Andes of Ecuador. Three wastewater management scenarios were tested. The different scenarios indicated that the foreseen investments in sanitation infrastructure will lead to modest improvements of the <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality.</b> This improvement (i. e. increase of the biotic index) was only identified in 6 of the 21 monitoring stations considered in the River Cuenca and its tributaries. Therefore, it is necessary to control the impact of the industrial wastewaters discharges and the diffuse pollution at the upper catchment of the tributaries to achieve a good ecological status. With these results, we proved that integrated models, like the one presented here, have an added value for decision support in water management by coupling <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> to a set of hydraulic and chemical water quality measures based on a water quality model.

40|$|The {{development}} of practical tools for providing accurate ecological assessment of rivers and species conditions {{is necessary to}} preserve habitats and species, stop degradation and restore water quality. An understanding of the causal mechanisms and processes that affect the <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and shape macroinvertebrate communities at a local scale {{has important implications for}} conservation management and river restoration. This study used the integration of wastewater treatment, river water quality and ecological assessment models to study the effect of upgrading a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and their ecological effects for the receiving river. The WWTP and the water quality and quantity of the Drava river in Croatia were modelled in the software WEST. For the ecological modeling, the approach followed was to build habitat suitability and ecological assessment models based on classification trees. This technique allows predicting the biological water quality in terms of the occurrence of macroinvertebrates and the river status according to <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> indices. The ecological models developed were satisfactory, and showed a good predictive performance and good discrimination capacity. Using the integrated ecological model for the Drava river, three scenarios were run and evaluated. The scenario assessment showed that it is necessary an integrated approach for the water management of the Drava river, which considers an upgrading of the WWTP with Nitrogen and Phosphorous removal and the treatment of other diffuse pollution and point sources (including the overflow of the WWTP). Additionally, if an increase in the minimum instream flow after the dams is considered, a higher dilution capacity and a higher self-cleaning capability could be obtained. The results proved that integrated models like the one presented here have an added value for decision support in water management.

40|$|The {{ecological}} protection {{required under}} the South African National Water Act requires assessment criteria that {{are effective in}} the assessment of the ecological impact of pollutants. Advances in fundamental ecotoxicology in the past decade or two may be useful in this regard: establishing the lethal body burden of various classes of compounds, rapid estimation of bio concentration factors and modelling of the uptake/excretion processes in aquatic organisms. Using the example of the effect of cadmium on Daphnia magna, the impact of temporally variable toxicant concentrations on the population growth is demonstrated. The population no-effect levels for exponentially and normally distributed cadmium concentrations may differ by an order of magnitude. There are still some crucial information gaps. For example, while the toxicology of pollutants to individual species is becoming increasingly clearer, the ecotoxicology of pollutants is still somewhat nebulous.

In addition, a microbiological analysis was performed to estimate the degree of fecal contamination.

Our results showed that the average values for dissolved oxygen (4. 2 mg DO. L- 1) and nutrients (0. 9 mg oPO(4) (3 -). L- 1 and 12. 8 mg TAN. L- 1) exceeded international standards. Moreover, high turbidity levels revealed that land erosion is a severe problem in the region. Along the rivers, a significant increase in oxygen consumption and in nutrient concentrations was observed, indicating organic pollution originating from different diffuse and point sources of pollution. The lack of proper sanitation also led to exceedingly high abundances of fecal coliforms in the surface water (> 320 MPN. mL(- 1)).

40|$|Extract] To {{introduce}} {{this volume}} on the Classification of Estuarine and Nearshore Coastal Ecosystems, we describe the diverse approaches that scientists and managers have taken to classify estuaries and nearshore coasts. Classification of estuaries and coasts is motivated by different perspectives (e. g., landform geomorphology, evolutionary origins, and formative processes), purposes (e. g., understanding structure, variability and dynamics, functions and values, and interaction with adjoining fluvial and coastal ecosystems), and applications (e. g., categorizing, mapping, and management) over diverse temporal and spatial scales. As experienced {{throughout the history of}} most sciences, classification of diverse objects is a foundational step in the progress and application of a discipline, and particularly so in applied sciences. Appreciating how different class of estuaries and coasts evolve and function is a prerequisite to identifying the approaches and tools needed to management issues and drivers and to identify and predict change and assess impacts. However, as useful as these disciplinary classifications are, interdisciplinary classifications remain elusive, especially those linking the geomorphic form and physical structure and dynamics with <b>ecological</b> and <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> or broader ecosystem functions, goods and services...|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21 century, the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural resources remains a matter of concern. Within this framework, the aim of this research was to study the effects of logging activities on <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> indicators in a tropical forest. The study was undertaken at both local (species/habitat) and landscape (watershed) scales. The study took place on Borneo Island, in East Kalimantan province (Indonesia), in a state-owned timber concession, on an area of 85 km 2. In order to study the impact of logging activities at landscape scale, five satellites images (1991, 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2001) were examined. The <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> was evaluate by a biological and a habitat assessment, which were performed at each stream reach. The biological assessment constituted in collected benthic macroinvertebrates. This protocol was conducted at 23 sampling sites on headwater streams in order to compare the impacts of logging in logged area versus unlogged area. Logged area were grouped by the time interval after logging. We examined several groups: recently logged (during logging and until 6 months after logging), 1 to 3 years after logging and, 4 to 5 years after logging and relogged for a second time. Two field seasons occurred in June-August 2000 and April-May 2001. During this eight months time interval, most of the timber concession was relogged for a second time, {{as a result of the}} decentralisation process at government level. The research took four years and the following main results have been obtained. Logging activities at landscape scale were quantified by the total length of logging roads. This underlined the intensification of the logging activities from one satellite image to the other over the time (from 1991 to 2001). Vegetation classification and vegetation index (NDVI) could not be used to assessing the impact of logging activities on forest quality because of the homogeneous forest cover in the study site (no visible patches). Benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were considered an ideal tool to assess the <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> in the study site. Macroinvertebrates richness was high with 115 taxa mainly identified at family and sub-family level (genera for Ephemeroptera), but abundance was low (mean density of 770 individuals per square meter, ranging from 86 to 2130). Multivariate analysis highlighted that the size of the streams and the impact of logging activities played an important role in ordinating the samples. A co-inertia analysis demonstrated that benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were found to be strongly related to each others. The main results indicated that macroinvertebrate density, richness, diversity, composition and functional feeding organisation responded to logging activities. During and six months after logging, macroinvertebrate density was higher and diversity indices were lower compared to the reference samples (unlogged situation). One to three years after logging were found to be the most disturbed situation, indicated, among other things, by an even lower diversity indices. Environmental variables responded to logging activities by: an increase in canopy opening, water temperature, amount in fine sediment and flow velocity and by a decrease in Fine Particulate Organic Matter (FPOM). The stream ecosystems seemed to recover 4 to 5 years after logging in absence of ongoing activities, density and diversity seemed similar but benthic macroinvertebrate composition is different compared to reference unlogged situation. Among the 115 taxa identified during the study, several were indicator taxa, meaning that they characterised the impact of logging activities at a given time. Indicator taxa were grouped in five categories: "open canopy" taxa (Platybaetis, Lepidoptera, Hydropsychinae); "sensitive" taxa (e. g. Caenodes, Limonidae, Potamanthus, Perlidae, Philopotamidae); "pulse" taxa (e. g. Psephenidae, Jubabaetis, Platybaetis, Megaloptera, Glossossomatidae); "recovery" taxa (e. g. Labiobaetis, Helicopsychidae, Platystictidae) and "adaptive" taxa (Diplectroninae, Simuliidae, Isca). A Tropical Stream Concept was proposed to take into account the paucity of shredders collected in the headwater catchment streams. The higher decomposition rate and terrestrial shredders provides the Fine Particulate Organic Matter as direct input from the washing out of the catchment during rainy events. In summary, macroinvertebrates can be considered excellent indicators, which were successfully used in this tropical environment for both objectives: they assessed biodiversity as an element of forest sustainability and they assessed disturbances due to logging activities, with the advantage to be indicative of recent and past events. Further research is proposed to test the identified indicator taxa to other regions in Borneo, to valid them and to prepare a simplified key to be used by local institutions as a tool for monitoring <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|E
40|$|A large {{collection}} of interpolation techniques {{is available for}} application in environmental research. To help environmental scientists in choosing an appropriate technique a disposition is made, based on 1) applicability in space, time and space-time, 2) quantification of accuracy of interpolated values, 3) incorporation of ancillary information, and 4) incorporation of process knowledge. The described methods include inverse distance weighting, nearest neighbour methods, geostatistical interpolation methods, Kalman filter methods, Bayesian Maximum Entropy methods, etc. The applicability of methods in aggregation (upscaling) and disaggregation (downscaling) is discussed. Software for interpolation is described. The application of interpolation techniques is illustrated in two case studies: temporal interpolation of indicators for <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality,</b> and spatio-temporal interpolation and aggregation of pesticide concentrations in Dutch surface waters. A valuable next step will be to construct a decision tree or decision support system, that guides the environmental scientist to easy-to-use software implementations that are appropriate to solve their interpolation problem.

40|$|Macroinvertebrates {{have been}} {{collected}} in Flanders since 1989 by the Flemish Environment Agency to assess <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality.</b> During the present study, the collected waterbugs were identified to species level. In total, more than 90 000 waterbugs were identified, belonging to 45 species. Two of these are recent additions to Flemish fauna: Sigara iactans {{was found to be}} a common species in 1989, the first year of monitoring, which is earlier than the first records reported so far, whereas Cymatia rogenhoferi remains a very rare species. Five different communities could be recognized: (1) species occurring in alkaline waters with a high pH, (2) species occurring in colder waters that can tolerate slightly brackish and nutrient rich water, (3) species from running waters, (4) species from acidic waters and (5) ubiquist species that occurred in all types of water. Owing to the general improvement of chemical water quality during the last decade, most species increased, however, three pollution tolerant species declined significantly: Callicorixa praeusta, Corixa punctata and Sigara striata...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{recreation}} and <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> are major contributors to human well-being in coastal regions. They can also interact, creating opportunities for ecosystem based management, <b>ecological</b> restoration, and <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> improvement that can positively affect {{people and the}} environment. Yet the effect of environmental quality on human behavior is often poorly quantified, but commonly assumed in coastal ecosystem service studies. To clarify this effect we investigate a <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> dataset for evidence that environmental condition partially explains variation in recreational visitation, our indicator of human behavior. In Puget Sound, WA, we investigate variation in visitation in both visitation rate and fixed effects (FE) models. The visitation rate model relates the differences in annual recreational visitation among parks to environmental conditions, park characteristics, travel cost, and recreational demand. In our FE model we control for all time-invariant unobserved variables and compare monthly variation at the park level to determine how <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> affects visitation during the summer season. The results of our first model illustrate how visitation relates to various amenities and costs. In the FE analysis, monthly visitation was negatively related to <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> while controlling for monthly visitation trends. This indicates people are responding to changes in <b>water</b> <b>quality,</b> and an improvement would yield {{an increase in the}} value of recreation. Together, these results could help in prioritizing <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> improvements, could assist the creation of new parks or the modification of existing recreational infrastructure, and provide quantitative estimates for the expecte...|$|R
40|$|Epilithic diatom {{communities}} offer {{a holistic}} and integrated approach for assessing <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> as they remain {{in one place}} {{for a number of}} months and reflect an <b>ecological</b> memory of <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> over a period of time. The objective {{of this study is to}} use diatom assemblages to distinguish between particular land types and associated <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> impacts that are linked to these land-use patterns. <b>Water</b> <b>quality</b> and diatom community data were collected from sites in the Crocodile and Magalies Rivers (Gauteng and North West Province, South Africa) associated with agricultural, urban and natural (reference) adjacent land use respectively. The data collected were subjected to multivariate statistical techniques to analyse spatial and temporal patterns in <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> (principal component analysis) and diatom community struc-tures (non-metric multidimensional scaling) to elucidate hypothesised differences in community structure per land-use type. Five diatom response indices (Generic Diatom Index, Specific Pollution Sensitivity Index, Biological Diatom Index, Eutrophication/Pollution Index and Percentage Pollution Tolerant Valves) incorporated in the OMNIDIA software were implemented to assess the integrity of diatom communities per land-use type. Principle component ordination of <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> describes 56. 6 % of the variation in data observed, and indicates the separation of reference sites from test sites for low and high flow conditions combined. It was, however, not possible to distinguish between the agricultural and urban land-use sites using PCA based on <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> data.

Optimal environmental flows management strategies {{make sense to}} the water shortage and pollution problems. In this paper, using Baiyangdian Lake as a case study, we first divided the whole lake into thirteen sub-areas by GIS, and analyzed the features of each sub area. The numerical eutrophication model based on WASP 7, integrating hydrodynamics with <b>water</b> <b>quality,</b> was established to simulate <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> processes in Baiyangdian Lake. Internal dissolved oxygen cycle, nutrient cycle, phosphorus cycle and phytoplankton growth were considered in the model. Monitoring data in Baiyangdian Lake were used for model parameters calibration and model validation. Using the model above, we analyzed <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> variation in the scenarios of different non-point source loads and different artificial water releasing into the lakes, which revealed the relationships between <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> improvement and artificial water allocation. The results showed that return water such as industrial wastewater and domestic sewage with large organic load would worsen the eutrophication of Baiyangdian Lake, and reducing pollutant loads or transferring water into lake could improve <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> to certain degree. Detailed spatial distribution of <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> could supply key information for <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> demand and water allocation further. According to the simulated results, the <b>ecological</b> <b>water</b> demand were 3. 87 × 108 m 3 /a, 3. 70 × 108 m 3 /a, 3. 23 × 108 m 3 /a, respectively.
