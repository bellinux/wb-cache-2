40|$|Two {{trials were}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the productive response in Bovans white hens housed in cages and Isa Brown hens reared in floor fed with sorghum + soybean meal supplemented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cell Walls (CW) growth promoters or zinc bacitracin in the diets. In the first one, 216 Bovans hens, 45 weeks old, reared in pens, were allocated in a completely randomized design in three treatments with 6 replicates of 12 hens each one. In the second one, 600 Isa Brown hens, 43 weeks old, were used and allocated in floor with straw litter and three treatments with 4 replicates of 50 hens each one. For both trials, the following treatments were used: 1. - Diet without growth promoter, 2. -As 1 + Zinc bacitracin (30 ppm), 3. - As 1 + CW (500 ppm). Water and feed were given ad libitum. Feed intake records, egg production, egg weight, egg mass per bird per day, <b>dirty</b> <b>egg</b> and feed conversion ratio, were taken during 14 weeks.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of different dietary vitamin combinations on the egg quality and vitamin concentrations in the eggs of commercial laying hens. A total of 1, 800 25 -week-old Lohman pink-shell hens {{were randomly assigned to}} four dietary vitamin treatments as follows: NRC(1994) level, NRC (1994) level with Hy. D® (25 -hydroxy-cholecalciferol), Local level (current average industry level in China) and OVN® level (optimum vitamin nutrition level), with 10 replicates per treatment and 45 layers per replicate. Hens were housed in commercial laying cages with three birds per cage and given ad libitum access to feed. Results showed the hens that received the fortified vitamin levels in the OVN® treatment had a significantly (p< 0. 05) lower number of cracked (. 47 %) and dirty eggs (. 27 %), and increased egg deposition of vitamin B 12, folic acid, vitamin A, vitamin D, 25 -OH-D 3, vitamin E, vitamin B 1, biotin and pantothenate (p< 0. 05). Treatments had no significant effect on egg-shape index, egg specific gravity, Haugh units and eggshell thickness. Hens fed the NRC-Hy. D® combination also experienced a significant decrease in cracked and dirty eggs (. 70 % and. 44 %, respectively) and an increased deposition of 25 -OH-D 3 in comparison with the NRC treatment. Results of the present study suggest that that the Local treatment was able to improve egg quality parameters of laying hens, but resulted in more cracked and dirty eggs. OVN® reduced the number of cracked eggs and dirty eggs, and improved the deposition of several vitamins in eggs. With the addition of Hy.

40|$|Objective This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of enrichment resources (a perch, dustbath, and nest) layout in furnished laying-hen cages (FC) on exterior quality of eggs. Methods One hundred and sixty-eight (168) Hy-Line Brown laying hens at 16 weeks of age were randomly distributed to four treatments: small furnished cages (SFC), medium furnished cages type I (MFC-I), medium furnished cages type II (MFC-II), and medium furnished cages type III (MFC-III). Each treatment had 4 replicates or cages with 6 hens for SFC (24 birds for each SFC) and 12 hen/cage for MFC-I, -II, and -III (48 birds for each MFC-I, -II and -III). Following a 2 -week acclimation, data collection started at 18 weeks of age and continued till 52 weeks of age. Dirtiness of egg surface or cracked shell as indicators of the exterior egg quality were recorded each week. Results The {{results showed that the}} proportion of cracked or <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> was significantly affected by the FC type (p< 0. 01) in that the highest proportion of cracked or <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> was found in MFC-I and the lowest proportion of <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> in SFC. The results of this showed that furnished cage types affected both <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> and cracked eggs (p< 0. 01).

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{aimed at}} adapting the Dutch manual nest model, whose format is well {{accepted by the}} parental broiler lines, to a new model aiming the mechanical egg collection. Adaptation consisted on replacing wood shaving by stuffed wood sheet and the placement of a conveyor belt for egg collection. This adaptation was evaluated in two experiments in the same shed with breeders from 25 to 35 weeks of age. In both experiments, there were 69 available modules, each one with 24 nests (manual nest) for collection of eggs from 7, 690 hens and one adapted module with 24 nests (mechanical nest) for mechanical collection of eggs from 110 hens. In experiment 1, weekly percentages of produced eggs and floor eggs were compared and in experiment 2, besides those variables, percentages of cracked <b>eggs</b> and <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nest were observed. Also in experiment 2, aiming to reduce floor eggs observed in experiment 1, wood shavings were added on the stuffed wood sheet, from lodging to the 26 th week.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to design a new {{mechanical}} nesting system based on scientific works on the behavior of laying hens, and to compare its performance with that of a hand-operated Dutch nest. The equipment was assessed in two poultry houses; in the first one, the eggs were collected manually, whereas in the second one, the newly designed mechanical nest was used for the collection. A total of 7, 800 hens and 800 males were housed in each poultry house, and the percentages of <b>eggs</b> produced, nest <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs,</b> floor eggs, and cracked and discarded eggs were determined between weeks 25 and 52. The percentage of eggs with microcracks, infertility, embryo mortality, bacterial contamination, fungal contamination, chicks with stunting syndrome and hatching from both types of nest was assessed in the hatchery on a fortnightly basis. The mechanical nest designed herein proved to be a good alternative to the hand-operated Dutch nest, but it still has to be improved in order to have the same performance, especially with regard to reduction in the incidence of floor eggs...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 20 yr, {{different}} methods for detecting defects in eggs were developed. Until now, no satisfying technique existed to sort and quantify dirt on eggshells. The work presented here {{focuses on the}} design of an off-line computer vision system to differentiate and quantify the presence of different dirt stains on brown eggs: dark (feces), white (uric acid), blood, and yolk stains. A system that provides uniform light exposure around the egg was designed. In this uniform light, pictures of <b>dirty</b> and clean <b>eggs</b> were taken, stored, and analyzed. The classification was based on a few standard logical operators, allowing for a quick implementation in an on-line set-up. In an experiment, 100 clean and 100 <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> were used to validate the classification algorithm. The designed vision system showed an accuracy of 99 % for the detection of dirt stains. Two percent of the clean eggs had a light-colored eggshell and were subsequently mistaken for showing large white stains. The accuracy of differentiation of the different kinds of dirt stains was 91 %. Of the eggs with dark stains, 10. 81 % were mistaken for having bloodstains, and 33. 33 % of eggs with bloodstains were mistaken for having dark stains.

40|$|Watery {{and sticky}} {{droppings}} in layers {{have been a}} problem in the egg industry for years. The major loss to the egg industry is through an increased percentage of <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> due to watery and sticky droppings. The problems with wet droppings in layers are multifaceted, viz., nutritional, bacterial, viral, protozoan, strain of bird, mycotoxins, contaminants in the water and leakage in water troughs (Jordan and Pattison 1998; Singh 1981). Thus, DIAREX VET powder was used to improve the economic loss to the egg industry due to wet droppings in commercial growers and layers. Farms with a history of wet droppings in flocks of 5500 growers and 5200 layers were randomly distributed into treatment and control groups. The problem was identified as nonspecific wet droppings based on history, postmortem examination (both ailing and dead birds), feed analysis and the laboratory examination of the samples. DIAREX VET powder was administered at a dose of 500 gm/ton of feed/day for 5 - 7 consecutive days and stopped as soon as the consistency of the feces became normal.

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} effect of UV {{irradiation}} on the bacterial load of shell eggs and of a roller conveyor belt. Methods and Results: The natural bacterial load on the eggshell of clean eggs was significantly reduced by a standard UV treatment of 4. 7 s; from 4. 47 to 3. 57 log CFU per eggshell. For very <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> no significant reduction was observed. Eggs inoculated with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (4. 74 and 4. 64 log CFU per eggshell respectively) passed the conveyor belt and were exposed to UV for 4. 7 and 18. 8 s. The reduction of both inoculated bacteria on the eggshell was comparable and significant for both exposure times (3 and 4 log CFU per eggshell). Escherichia coli was reduced but still detectable on the conveyor rollers. The internal bacterial contamination of eggs filled up with diluent containing E. coli or S. aureus was not influenced by UV irradiation. Conclusions: There is a significant lethal effect of UV irradiation on the bacterial contamination of clean eggshells and recent shell contamination, contamination of rollers can be controlled and the internal contamination of eggs is not reduced.

The {{resulting}} fertility and hatchability {{were compared with}} that obtained from natural mating in colony cages or on slat-litter floors with a male to female ratio of 1 : 10. Data were also obtained on production efficiency factors and labor required for artificial insemination. Fertility from the pullets artificially inseminated every seven days with 0. 05 ml. semen (94 %) was {{not as high as}} that obtained with natural mating on slat-litter floors (98 %) but was equal to that obtained in the colony cages (94 %) with natural mating. Increasing the insemination frequency to once every six days or increasing the volume of semen inseminated to 0. 07 ml. or 0. 09 ml. did not significantly improve fertility in the artificially inseminated pullets.

This study was conducted to compare indices of production and welfare in birds housed in 2 different caging systems. Shaver White hens were housed from 21 to 61 wk in either conventional battery cages (n = 500; 10 cages; 5 hens/cage; floor space = 561. 9 cm(2) /hen) or enriched cages (n = 480; 2 cages; 24 hens/cage; floor space = 642. 6 cm(2) /hen) and were replicated 10 times. Enriched cages provided hens with a curtained nesting area, scratch pad, and perches. Production parameters and egg quality measures were recorded throughout the experiment. Plumage condition was evaluated at 37 and 61 wk. Bone quality traits and immunological response parameters were measured at 61 wk, and 59 and 61 wk, respectively. Hen-day egg production, feed consumption, egg weight, and percentage of cumulative mortality of laying hens were not affected by the cage designs. Specific gravity and the percentage of cracked and soft-shelled eggs were also similar between the 2 housing systems. The incidence of <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> was, however, significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) in enriched cages than in conventional cages. Feather scores were similar between birds except for the wing region, which was higher (P < 0. 05) for hens housed in conventional cages. Bone quality measures tended to be higher for hens housed in enriched cages compared with hens in conventional cages. However, the increase was significant only for bone mineral density. Immunological response parameters did not reveal statistically significant differences. Overall, laying performance, exterior egg quality measures, plumage condition, and immunological response parameters appear to be similar for hens housed in the 2 cage systems tested.

Consumer demand is oriented towards healthy foods controlled not only under a safety point of view, but also under a welfare assessment of the animals’ living conditions. Among the different alternative systems deep litter and organic production {{in recent years have}} been improved in Italy. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether different housing systems (barn B and organic O) for laying hens may influence productive performance, fear responses and egg quality characteristics. A total of 4, 745 birds were housed in the B system and 2, 016 in the O system, both of which were commercial facilities. In each system the same strain (Hy-Line Brown) was housed and layer performance, external and internal egg characteristics, mortality and feed consumption were recorded weekly. Animal reactivity was recorded monthly with the approaching test. Moreover, the Tonic Immobility test was conducted at 70 weeks of age; feather and foot pad conditions were also investigated at the same time. The peak of laying was reached in both housing systems at 25 weeks of age and was higher in organic hens (94. 5 %) than in barn hens (93. 0 %). Feed conversion rate during the overall laying period was 2. 36 vs 2. 20, respectively, in O and B housing systems. There was a significant difference concerning the eggs classified as very dirty, dirty and cracked between the two systems. The <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs</b> were higher in O system probably due to laying eggs in a free range area, while the higher number of cracked eggs in B system may be due to a significantly less shell thickness in this system. Egg weight increased with layer age in both housing systems. Animals reared in O system showed less fearfulness than in B emphasised by the approaching and Tonic Immobility test results. Feather scoring did not evidence any severe plumage damage; statistical analysis showed some significant differences in comb and back areas between O and B systems. The hens reared on litter showed more aggressive pecking than the organic hens probably due to difference both in light intensity and in density...|$|R

Objectives included: 1) conduct a survey on current industry egg washing practices along with a microbial survey; 2) assess the efficacy of chlorine, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC), peracetic acid alone or in combination with ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) (3. 5 %) in combination with UV light as post-wash sanitizers against aerobic plate counts (APC) and Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) inoculation; 3) conduct a consumer acceptability test to evaluate the influence of chlorine, QAC, and H 2 O 2 and UV light using a 9 -point hedonic test; and 4) investigate the effectiveness of H 2 O 2 and UV light applied to eggs prior to washing on APC and the number of <b>dirty</b> <b>eggs.</b> Results from the egg processing survey indicated that chlorine was the most frequently used sanitizer (81. 7 %) in the United States and most egg processors are operating in-line type facilities. Moreover, most facilities are not performing any egg treatment prior to washing, and very little in-plant microbiological monitoring was being conducted. The microbial survey indicated that 15 out of 18 visits had significantly less APC in post wash versus prewash eggs, and 11 out of 18 had significantly less APC in the final sanitizer than in the post wash stage. However, mean APC ranges after sanitization were 1. 0 to 3. 0 log_ 10 cfu/egg. In laboratory trials evaluating the effectiveness of various egg sanitization treatments, the combination of H_(2) O_(2) and UV light had the lowest eggshell APC (1. 30, 1. 05, and 1. 10 log_ 10 cfu/egg) at d 0, 7, and 14, respectively, of storage among all treatments. No differences in overall consumer acceptability were determined among the treatments. However, chlorine-treated eggs received a higher score for texture compared to the other treatments. The combination of H_(2) O_(2) and UV light prior to egg washing resulted in higher percentage of Grade A eggs and lower APC (2. 1 log_ 10 cfu/egg).

50|$|The Australian pelican begins {{breeding}} at two {{or three}} years of age. The breeding season varies, occurring in winter in tropical areas (north of 26°S) and spring in parts of southern Australia. Breeding may occur any time after rainfall in inland areas. The nest is a shallow depression in earth or sand, sometimes with some grass lining. Grassy platforms are constructed at Lake Alexandrina in South Australia. Rarely, slightly more elaborate nests have also been observed on top of Muehlenbeckia florulenta bushes. Nesting is communal, with colonies located on islands (such as the North Peron Island) or sheltered areas in the vicinity of lakes or the sea. Breeding Australian pelicans will lay one to four (typically two) chalky-white eggs measuring 93 x 57 mm, which often appear scratched and <b>dirty.</b> The <b>eggs</b> are incubated for 32 to 35 days. The chicks are naked when they hatch, though quickly grow grey down feathers. After they hatch, the larger one will be fed more, and the smaller one will eventually die of starvation or siblicide. For the first two weeks the chicks will be fed regurgitated liquid, but for the remaining two months they will be fed fish and some invertebrates. Feeding pods are formed within colonies when the chicks are around 25 days. The young pelicans fledge at around three months of age.|$|R

40|$|This study {{intended}} {{to compare the}} productive performance of three different layer raising systems; conventional cage (CC), barn (BR) and aviary (AV). The AV is welfare bestowed housing that allows free locomotion for birds within the BR. The BR allows bird’s free locomotion inside BR but without multilevel structures. Both pullets and cockerels were housed together in both AV and BR, but only pullets in CC. Seventeen weeks old Lohmann Brown Lite (n = 800) pullets were housed in AV during this study. The same age layer pullets were simultaneously assigned to either at CC or BR to compare egg production performance with AV. The duration of experiment was 40 weeks (from 21 st to 60 th week). There were no remarkable differences in egg production, hen day egg production (HDEP) and average egg weight among three rearing systems. First 20 weeks (phase- 1) average HDEP (%) of AV, CC, and BR were 85. 9, 88. 8, 87. 1 and average egg weights (g) were 57. 5, 59. 9, and 56. 9 respectively. Those of the remaining 20 weeks (phase- 2) were 87. 1, 87. 9, 85. 5 and 64. 2, 63. 0 62. 1, respectively. Daily feed intakes (122 g, 110 g, 125 g); feed conversion ratio (2. 4, 2. 1, 2. 5) and daily egg mass (53. 9 g, 54. 4 g, 52. 8 g) data from AV, CC, and BR were not influenced significantly by the respective raising systems.

Case: In an intensive farming of poultry (Gallus gallus), it was observed mortality rate exceeding 20 %, hoarseness and difficulty breathing in males of approximately two weeks of age. The batch was treated with Terramycin ® (oxytetracyclinehydrochloride) in the first week and Trissulfin® (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and bromhexine hydrochloride) in the second week. Birds were sent for analysis at the Laboratório Central de Diagnóstico de Patologias Aviárias (LCDPA) of the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM). Necropsy was performed in three affected birds and pulmonary aspergillosis was suspected due to local pulmonary and disseminated injuries in the coelomic cavity, associated to the clinical signs. In birds assessed by necropsy examination, it was common the visualization of nodules in the internal cavity and lungs, caseous masses in the air sacs, little pigmentation on the feet and beaks and fragile bones. Portions of lung and granulomas were sent for isolation and identification of fungi in the Laboratório de Pesquisas Micológicas (LAPEMI) -UFSM and histopathological analysis in the Laboratório de Patologia Veterinária (LPV) -UFSM, where the standard protocols for each exam were used. The result of mycological examination showed Aspergillus fumigatus as the agent. The histopathological lesions observed in the lung were consistent with aspergillosis, characterized by multifocal granulomas associated with intra-lesional dichotomously branched fungal hyphae, morphologically compatible with Aspergillus sp. Discussion: The occurrence of aspergillosis depends on the dose of inhaled conidia of the fungus and the susceptibility of the host, which occurs in birds in the first weeks of age, making it more resistant to infection in adults. The history of signs consisting of respiratory distress associated with stressful situations or the recent lack of response to antibiotics may provide support to the clinical diagnosis of aspergillosis. The isolation and identification of the fungus comprises the best method to confirm the disease agent. Histopathology provides an important contribution to the morphological diagnosis of the lesion and the fungus. The treatment of aspergillosis in poultry production is difficult and uneconomical, so that all attention is focused on prevention and control in poultry houses and hatcheries. Eggs for incubation must be cleaned and disinfected, <b>dirty</b> and cracked <b>eggs</b> should not be incubated. Care should be strict with hygiene in the hatchery. Once detected the source, it should be eliminated, and the implementation of antifungal agents according to the location of contamination and the substrate. The major difficulty for the prevention and control of aspergillosis is because these fungi can be present at all stages of poultry production...|$|R
