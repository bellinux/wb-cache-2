40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 14) This {{study examined}} the effect that hydrophobic treatment <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>headlamp</b> lenses has on light output when headlamps are exposed to contaminants under naturalistic driving conditions. The hypothesis, a priori, was that the water-repelling nature of a glass surface after hydrophobic treatment would aid in minimizing the adhesion, or promote the removal, of contaminants on the lens, thereby leaving light output less affected. Additional variables of interest included the presence of precipitation, {{the side of the}} vehicle the headlamp was on, and whether the headlamp was illuminated during the exposure. The study examined vehicles with glass lenses installed as intended by the vehicle manufacturer. The vehicles were driven on a 155 -km route under conditions of active precipitation or no precipitation, and with or without the headlamps on. Subsequent to each drive, measurements of light output were made at eight key test points in the headlamp beam pattern. The headlamps were then cleaned and measured again. In this way, each headlamp served as its own control. The results indicate that hydrophobic treatment <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>headlamp</b> lenses did not affect light output. However, the presence of precipitation did result in decreased light output below the horizontal cutoff of the beam pattern and increased light output above the horizontal cutoff. This result was especially evident above the horizontal cutoff when the headlamps had been illuminated. The side of the vehicle the headlamp was on did not affect light output...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International Peripheral {{visibility}} is {{an important}} aspect of driving but one that is not understood as robustly as on-axis visibility. The present paper summarizes results from a series of field studies investigating the effect <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> illumination and <b>of</b> oncoming <b>headlamp</b> glare on the speed and accuracy of response to small targets located in the visual periphery. These experiments used headlamp sets providing differing amounts of illumination on targets of varying reflectance, located throughout the field of view.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the quantitative {{influence of a}} variety of factors on the performance <b>of</b> low-beam <b>headlamps.</b> The factors included were vertical aim, horizontal aim, mounting height, lateral separation, lens dirt, lamp voltage, number of functioning lamps, vehicle type, beam pattern and light source. The following aspects <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of road delineation, visibility of vehicle reflex reflectors, visibility of rettoreflective traffic signs, visibility of targets near the road expansion point, glare directed towards oncoming drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, glare directed towards rearview mirrors of preceding vehicles, and foreground illumination. A sales-weighted average US beam pattern, with lamps mounted at sales-weighted average locations, formed the basis for most of the analyses. The results indicate that, from among the factors studied, vertical aim is overwhelmingly {{the most important factor in}} influencing the performance <b>of</b> low-beam <b>headlamps.</b> The second most important factor is the number of functioning lamps. The main implication of this study is that major improvements in current (fixed as opposed to adaptive) low-beam headlighting could be achieved primarily by better control of vertical aim and by use <b>of</b> longer-life <b>headlamps...</b>|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine whether the recent changes in the {{sharpness}} of the vertical gradient in U. S. low beams have changed the importance <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> leveling and cleaning systems. The study consisted of three parts. In the first part, we collected new data on dynamic distributions of pitch angles for a passenger car, a minivan, and an SUV in actual traffic. In the second part, we applied the new dynamic pitch data (combined with recent static pitch data) to representative low-beam patterns to estimate the changes in the benefits of leveling systems. These estimates were made for a comprehensive combination of static and dynamic sources of misaim; additional analyses would be necessary to determine the relative benefits of leveling systems that address selected sources of misaim. Three sets of photometric data were used in the analysis: market-weighted 1997 and 2004 tungsten-halogen beam patterns, and a representative 2004 HID beam pattern. In the third part, we applied a previously derived model for the effects of dirt on the three beam patterns to estimate the changes in the benefits of cleaning systems. In both sets of analyses, the effects on both visibility and glare were considered. The results indicate that (1) the importance <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> leveling systems for U.

The studies of detection distance of LED, Halogen and HID headlamp have been conducted, but no study has shown the detection distance of pedestrian target with various colors (Black, White, Blue). Method: The experiment of detection distance was conducted with 30 people, which divide into 2 groups as 15 men and 15 women. Automatic transferable target on the rail was manufactured in order to reduce the error of study's result, and ANOVA also conducted to analyze the main effect with sign color, sex and headlamp classified by detection distance.

40|$|Headlamps with high-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{sources have}} been available on vehicles sold in the U. S. for a little over ten years. Although estimates of the proportion <b>of</b> HID <b>headlamps</b> in the vehicle fleet can be made based on sales data, there are uncertainties in those estimates {{because of lack of}} comprehensive compilation of data, unknown retention rates in the fleet, and complex regional differences in sales. Furthermore, number of vehicles sold and/or registered is not necessarily predictive of vehicles in use because of possible differences in overall driving rates or, most importantly, in nighttime driving rates. This study was therefore designed to obtain direct measurements of the proportion of vehicles with HID headlamps in nighttime traffic. Eight sites (two in each of four metropolitan areas) were selected, and traffic at those sites was video recorded between the hours of 7 : 00 p. m. and 10 : 00 p. m. The observations were made in late February and early March 2008, when those evening hours were dark and virtually all vehicles had their headlamps on. Video recording was done with diffraction gratings mounted on the cameras so that the type of headlamps—HID or tungsten-halogen (TH) —could be easily discriminated by the spectrally dispersed headlamp images. Investigators later scored the videos, counting the numbers of vehicles (except for motorcycles) in terms <b>of</b> <b>headlamp</b> type (HID or TH), and number <b>of</b> <b>headlamps</b> on (both, one, or none).
