40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common preventable disorders among hospital <b>inpatients.</b> Advancing age is a major risk factor for VTE. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare prevention practices and clinical outcomes in older (age 65 and older) versus younger (ages 18 to 64) hospitalized patients at risk for or diagnosed with VTE. Medical charts of 210 older and 450 younger <b>inpatients</b> undergoing diagnostic tests to rule out VTE were reviewed at an academic medical center. Acute VTE was diagnosed in 17. 1 % of older and 22. 7 % of younger <b>inpatients.</b> Pharmacological prophylaxis was used in 70 % of eligible older and 57 % of eligible younger <b>inpatients.</b> Nearly one quarter of eligible older <b>inpatients</b> did not receive any VTE prevention measures. The 3 -month mortality was higher in older <b>inpatients</b> (13. 9 %) compared with younger <b>inpatients</b> (9. 8 %) with VTE, despite the lower rate of VTE in older <b>inpatients.</b> Prevention measures for VTE were underused in both older and younger <b>inpatients.</b> Copyright © SLACK Incorporated...|$|R

40|$|A slip-and-fall {{assessment}} score sheet {{is filled}} {{out by a}} nurse for all <b>inpatients</b> to recognize which of them {{are more likely to}} fall, and assist them. Although the sheet is used daily in a mixed medical ward (Departments of Internal Medicine, Otorhinolaryngology, and General Medicine) in Nara Medical University Hospital, the sheet was originally established based on slip-and-fall cases that had arisen in a department of neurosurgery or orthopedic surgery. So we wondered, whether the sheet would also work effectively in a mixed medical ward that manages a greater variety of medical treatments and disease situations. Therefore, in this study, we gathered the slip-and-fall incident reports (77 persons) and clarified the characteristics and actual condition of the <b>inpatients</b> who had fallen. And we compared the scores obtained by the <b>inpatients</b> who had fallen (78 persons) and the <b>inpatients</b> who had not fallen (178 persons) for each item, and found the items that showed {{a significant difference in the}} averaged scores between these groups of <b>inpatients.</b> Following the results, we calculated odds ratios by multiple logistic regression using only the items with the significant differences, and improved the scoring system to suit the mixed medical ward. The actual condition survey established the fact that the <b>inpatients</b> have often fallen in their own room during the night. <b>Inpatients</b> with a previous history of falling, aged <b>inpatients,</b> and <b>inpatients</b> with physical pain were especially likely to fall, because the scores obtained by the <b>inpatients</b> who had fallen were significantly higher than those of the <b>inpatients</b> who had not fallen in the items that related to falling history, age, and pain. The proposed scoring system could make the difference in the scores obtained by <b>inpatients</b> who have fallen and those who have not broader, making it possible to detect the <b>inpatients</b> who might fall with higher accuracy in a mixed medical ward...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the tendency and suicidal behavior rates of Chinese adult <b>inpatients</b> with different types of mental disorders from 2010 to 2015. The aim was to provide some interesting clues for further studies. Methods: Adult patients with mental disorders who were hospitalized in Beijing Anding hospital from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015 were included. Chi-square tests were {{used to compare the}} difference among <b>inpatients</b> with mental disorders by gender and year. Frequency, trend and suicidal behavior rates of <b>inpatients</b> with mental disorders were graphed. Results: A total of 17, 244 psychiatric adult <b>inpatients</b> were included in our study. About 53. 2 % of the <b>inpatients</b> had mood disorders, followed by schizophrenia, which accounted for 34. 6 %. The proportion of female <b>inpatients</b> with mental disorders was larger than that of males (52. 6 % to 47. 4 %). Of the total, 3296 psychiatric <b>inpatients</b> were recognized as having suicidal behaviors. The rate of suicidal behavior among all <b>inpatients</b> was 19. 1 %, and it varied over the years. The suicidal behavior rate of female <b>inpatients</b> with mood disorders was much higher than that of the corresponding male <b>inpatients.</b> Conclusions: The presence of suicidal behavior varied among people with different types of mental disorders.

The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the burden of potentially infectious tuberculosis and the proportion of drug resistance among hospital <b>inpatients</b> throughout the province of KZN. Methods: <b>Inpatients</b> with current cough, capable of producing sputum were selected from 19 public hospitals in KZN. After informed consent, demographic and clinical data, and sputum samples were collected. Samples were processed for fluorescent microscopy, liquid culture and first and second-line anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing. Results: There were a total of 2, 964 <b>inpatients</b> where sampling was done. About 1, 585 <b>inpatients</b> (53 %) had a current cough and sufficient microbiological and clinical data for inclusion. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from 543 <b>inpatients</b> (34 % of those tested and 18 % of all <b>inpatients).</b> Eighty-four (15 %) <b>inpatients</b> with TB were found to be MDR-TB infected and 16 (3 %) had XDR-TB. There was no association between the prevalence of MDR-TB and proximity to CoSH.

40|$|Background: Urinary tract {{infection}} or UTI {{is one of}} the most common infectious diseases in outpatients and <b>inpatients.</b> E. coli is the most prevalent organism in UTI.

Materials and methods: This descriptive- sectional study was carried out on 174 outpatients and 284 <b>inpatients</b> in 2011 - 12. For each person we filled a questionnaire including demographic information. In laboratory, samples cultured on EMB, MacConkey and blood Agar(Liofilcom co), and incubated in 37 oC for 24 hours. After detection of gram of each bacteria, specialized and biochemical tests were performed. The results were compared with standard tables for identification of bacteria. Statistical analysis in SPSS 18 was done and P≥ 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Of 458 studied samples, just 38 % were <b>inpatients.</b> 70. 1 % of 174 <b>inpatients</b> were women. Clinical symptoms like urgency(23. 6 %) and fever (43. 6 %) observed in <b>inpatients</b> that were more than outpatients.

40|$|Background: Healthcare {{practitioners}} {{should provide}} patients with information regarding their clinical conditions. Patients should also {{feel free to}} seek clarity on information provided. However, not all patients seek this clarity. Objectives: To explore the reasons <b>inpatients</b> gave for not seeking clarity on information that was received but not understood. Methods: This was a qualitative arm of a larger study, titled ‘Are <b>inpatients</b> aware of the admission reasons and management plans of their clinical conditions? A survey at a tertiary hospital in South Africa’, conducted in 2010. Of the 264 <b>inpatients</b> {{who participated in the}} larger study, we extracted the unstructured responses from those participants (n = 152) who had indicated in the questionnaire that there was information they had not understood during their encounter with healthcare practitioners, but that they had nonetheless not sought clarity. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Themes that emerged were that <b>inpatients</b> did not ask for clarity as they perceived healthcare practitioners to be ‘too busy’, aloof, non-communicators and sometimes uncertain about patients’ conditions. Some <b>inpatients</b> had unquestioning trust in healthcare practitioners,whilst others had experiences of bad treatment. <b>Inpatients</b> had poor self-esteem, incapacitating clinical conditions, fear of bad news and prior knowledge of their clinical conditions. Some <b>inpatients</b> stated that they had no reason for not seeking clarity.

The research aims to analyze drug utilization patterns for <b>inpatients</b> with psychotic disorder that are coded as F 20 -F 29 according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 th revision (schizophrenia spectrum disorders). Subjects and methods: Prospective research was conducted at the Psychiatric Hospital Idrija. The medical records of the <b>inpatients</b> admitted over a 12 -month period were collected from the beginning to the end of their hospitalization. Results: A total of 311 <b>inpatients</b> with 446 hospitalizations were included, producing a total of 3954 medication prescriptions.
