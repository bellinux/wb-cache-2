40|$|<b>Foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> is a {{controlled}} low density ranging from 400 kg/m 3 to 1800 kg/m 3, and hence {{suitable for the}} construction of buildings and infrastructures. The uniqueness of <b>foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> is does not use aggregates in order to retain low density. <b>Foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> contains only cement, sand, water and foam agent. Therefore, the consumption of cement is higher in producing a good quality and strength of <b>foamed</b> <b>concrete.</b> Without the present of aggregates, the compressive strength of <b>foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> can only achieve as high as 15 MPa. Therefore, this study aims to introduce the pelletized coconut fibre aggregate to reduce the consumption of cement but able to enhance the compressive strength.
