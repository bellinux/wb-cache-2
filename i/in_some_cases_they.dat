5|$|Total German and British {{losses at}} Bennington were {{recorded}} at 207 dead and 700 captured; American losses included 30 Americans dead and 40 wounded. The battle was at times particularly brutal when Loyalists met Patriots, as <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> {{came from the}} same communities. The prisoners, who were first kept in Bennington, were eventually marched to Boston.|$|E
5|$|After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, {{and ground}} crew {{over to the}} Soviet Union on 14 May, where he was imprisoned in {{accordance}} with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to await the transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and some American guards {{turned a blind eye to}} escapes. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> assisted by providing food and maps.|$|E
5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest {{a great deal}} of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases.</b> <b>They</b> feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the modern artillery period, the late 19th century, many armies had three main types of artillery, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>case</b> <b>they</b> were sub-branches within the artillery branch in others they were separate branches or corps.

5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>they</b> may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
50|$|In summary, bang-bang {{controls}} are actually optimal controls <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> although <b>they</b> are also often implemented because of simplicity or convenience.|$|R

50|$|Manually {{retractable}} bollards (lowered by a key mechanism) {{are found}} useful <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> since <b>they</b> {{do not require}} retrofitting into existing landscapes, or any electrical hookups or hydraulic systems.|$|R
5|$|In April 1941, the German Army invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. The LSSAH and Das Reich were {{attached}} to separate army Panzer corps. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the Das Reich, led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, Belgrade, where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered. SS police units immediately began taking hostages and carrying out reprisals, a practice that became common. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>they</b> were joined by the Wehrmacht. Similar to Poland, the war policies of the Nazis in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation and racist mass murder. Serbia became the second country (after Estonia) declared Judenfrei (free of Jews).|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>they</b> may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|With {{the support}} of Adolf von Neuenahr and the Count Solms, Gebhard secured some of the {{northern}} and eastern portions of the Electorate, where he held a geographical advantage in his proximity to the rebellious Dutch provinces. In the south, however, Ferdinand's troops hunted the soldiers Gebhard had left in possession of such Oberstift villages as Ahrweiler and Linz; Gebhard's troops were forced out of their strongholds, hunted through the countryside, and eventually captured. By the fall of 1583, most of the Oberstift had fallen to Ferdinand's army and many of Gebhard's erstwhile supporters—including his own brother—had returned home. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>they</b> honored parole agreements made after their capture. A strong supporter, Johann Casimir of Simmern, brother of the powerful Louis VI, Elector Palatine, returned to the Palatine when his brother died. Other supporters were frustrated by Gebhard's chronic inability to pay his troops, or intimidated by threats of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. By late October 1583, most of the Oberstift had fallen, although he still held the Godesburg, located near the villages of Godesberg and Friesdorf, the formidable fortress at Bonn, and the fortified village of Poppelsdorf.|$|E

25|$|Most of the inhumation graves had {{the head}} facing westward, though <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> instead faced south. Most {{of the grave}} cuts were roughly {{rectangular}} with rounded corners, but some were less regular in form.|$|E
25|$|They can be {{as small}} as 1-5mm in diameter, but can also grow or spread into large masses in the genital or anal area. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> look like small stalks.

25|$|Hwachas {{were mostly}} {{used in a}} {{defensive}} manner; however, some Western and East Asian historians have concluded that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> were used offensively in sea-to-land attacks and in naval warfare as well, particularly in the Battle of Noryang Point, during the Imjin wars in 1598.|$|E
25|$|Although {{courts have}} {{indicated}} unwillingness to uphold absolute occupational prohibitions that impose unnecessary hardship and {{have nothing to}} do with the offense, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> have found that banning a defendant from a particular occupation (e.g. financial executive) is acceptable since all employment is not foreclosed by such a condition.|$|E
25|$|All of the Vaishnava Upanishads either {{directly}} reference and {{quote from the}} ancient Principal Upanishads or incorporate some ideas found in them; most cited texts include the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chandogya Upanishad, Katha Upanishad, Isha Upanishad, Mundaka Upanishad, Taittiriya Upanishad and others. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>they</b> cite fragments from the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of the Rigveda and the Yajurveda.|$|E
50|$|Engraved {{figures on}} <b>some</b> walls are <b>in</b> plain sight, totally {{untouched}} by calcite deposits; whereas such deposits can appear mere {{inches away from}} the engravings <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases.</b> When <b>they</b> do exist these wall deposits grow very quickly. The Horse cave is typical of such behaviour.|$|R
50|$|Kåldolmar are Swedish cabbage rolls {{filled with}} minced pork and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> rice. <b>They</b> are usually eaten with boiled or mashed potatoes, gravy, and {{lingonberry}} jam.

25|$|Like other {{heterogeneous}} catalysts, MOFs {{may allow}} for easier post-reaction separation and recyclability than homogeneous catalysts. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>they</b> also give a highly enhanced catalyst stability. Additionally, they typically offer substrate-size selectivity. Nevertheless, while clearly important for reactions in living systems, selectivity {{on the basis}} of substrate size is of limited value in abiotic catalysis, as reasonably pure feedstocks are generally available.|$|E
25|$|In {{states such}} as Alabama and Mississippi, Klan members forged alliances with governors' administrations. In Birmingham and elsewhere, the KKK groups bombed the houses of civil rights activists. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> used {{physical}} violence, intimidation and assassination directly against individuals. Continuing disfranchisement of blacks across the South meant that most could not serve on juries, which were all-white and demonstrably biased verdicts and sentences.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{communities}} in South Asia that are descended from African slaves, traders or soldiers. These communities are the Siddi, Sheedi, Makrani and Sri Lanka Kaffirs. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>they</b> became very prominent, such as Jamal-ud-Din Yaqut, Hoshu Sheedi or the rulers of Janjira State. The Mauritian creole people are the descendants of African slaves similar to those in the Americas.|$|E
