5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process. In other words, {{the behavior of the}} process <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given {{the current state of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will look like <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Suzuha appears before Rintarō, having {{arrived in}} a time machine from the future. She tells Rintarō {{that the only way}} to prevent World War III <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> to prevent Kurisu's death at the hands of her father, Dr. Nakabachi, who stole her time travel theory to publish it under his own name. However, this {{operation}} ends in a disaster as Rintarō ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake. After this failure, Rintarō receives a message from his future self, telling him that the way to save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a time machine is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of 1.048596%, which he dubs the 'Steins Gate'. Returning to the past again, Rintarō puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisu's life, prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory, and fool his past self, setting him on his journey through time. Returning to the Steins Gate world line, safe from the threat of a third world war, Rintarō and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance (or by fate) in the streets of Akihabara.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of Joe 90, the Cold War—significant {{at the time}} of the series' TV debut, owing to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968—has ended, and a world government has been established. WIN is the successor organisation to MI6, the CIA and the KGB, all of which have been merged in the formation of the global network. Although the pilot sees Joe hijacking a Russian jet fighter to expose the secrets of its construction to the West, the storyline is ultimately revealed to be a speculative fiction posited by Weston as an example of the espionage that Joe would have to perform if he were to join WIN. The plot twist, in particular the revelation that Russia and the West are allies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>is</b> praised by academic Nicholas J. Cull for its [...] "progressiveness of spirit", and for exemplifying Anderson's [...] " [...] an end to the Cold War as a given in his work".

[...] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is [...] "starting to close the loop on the end of [...] season.

[...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her.

2500|$|Here we use {{a simple}} land carbon balance model to analyse the {{conditions}} required for a land sink-to-source transition, and address the question; could the land carbon cycle lead to a runaway climate feedback?

This model is used to show that (a) a carbon sink-to-source transition is inevitable beyond some finite critical CO2 concentration provided a few simple conditions are satisfied, (b) {{the value of the}} critical CO2 concentration is poorly known due to uncertainties in land carbon cycle parameters and especially in the climate sensitivity to CO2, and (c) that a true runaway land carbon-climate feedback (or linear instability) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> unlikely given that the land masses are currently acting as a carbon sink.|$|E

2500|$|Evolution {{is imposed}} on species or groups. It is not planned or striven for in some Lamarckist way.

Thus, the capability to evolve is a group adaptation, which has been discredited by, among others, George C. Williams, John Maynard Smith and Richard Dawkins.

2500|$|In Azali belief, the Promised One {{could not}} appear until the {{realization}} of the laws of the Bayán and the maturation of the Bayán in 2000 years. However, there are problems with this belief and inconsistencies in Azali belief. [...] The Azalis believe that the Báb gave permission for Subh-i-Azal to complete the Arabic Bayán with the permission of He whom God shall make manifest, thus pointing to He whom God shall make manifest appearing in Subh-i-Azal's own lifetime. Also, the Nuqtatu'l-Kaf, an Azali text, states that the laws of the Bayán may be abrogated a few years after the Báb's death, and that He whom God shall make manifest may appear within Subh-i-Azal's lifetime. The Azali view that the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest can only occur thousands of years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> also problematic, since in some of their texts they state that Subh-i-Azal is He whom God shall make manifest.|$|E

The current version of TeX is 3.14159265; it was last updated 2014-01-12. The design was frozen after version 3.0, and no new feature or fundamental change will be added, so all newer versions will contain only bug fixes.
