60|$|My Lords, I will {{venture to}} say, {{if ever there}} was an accuser that {{appeared}} well and with weight before any court, it was this man. He does not shrink from his charge; he offered to meet the person he charged face to face, and to make good his charge by his own evidence, and further evidence that he should produce. Your Lordships have also seen the conduct of Mr. Hastings on the first day; you have seen his acquiescence under it; you have seen the suspicion he endeavored to raise. Now, before I proceed to what Mr. Hastings thought of it, I must remark upon this accusation, that it is a specific accusation, coming from a person knowing the very transaction, and <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> in it,--that it was an accusation in writing, that it was an accusation with a signature, that it was an accusation with a person to make it good, that it was made before a competent authority, and made before an authority bound to inquire into such accusation. When he comes to produce his evidence, he tells you, first, the sums of money given, the species in which they were given, the very bags in which they were put, the exchange that was made by reducing them to the standard money of the country; he names all the persons through whose hands the whole transaction went, eight in number, besides himself, Munny Begum, and Gourdas, being eleven, all referred to in this transaction. I do believe that {{since the beginning of the}} world there never was an accusation which was more deserving of inquiry, because there never was an accusation which put a false accuser in a worse situation, and that put an honest defendant in a better; for there was every means of collation, every means of comparison, every means of cross-examining, every means of control. There was every way of sifting evidence, in which evidence could be sifted. Eleven witnesses to the transaction are referred to; all the particulars of the payment, every circumstance that could give the person accused the advantage of showing the falsehood of the accusation, were specified. General accusations may be treated as calumnies; but particular accusations, like these, afford the defendant, if innocent, every possible means for making his defence: therefore the very making no defence at all would prove, beyond all doubt, a consciousness of guilt.|$|E

In this sense, we suggest that egalitarianism of opportunity, more than aversion to intertemporal fluctuations, is crucial for motivating the optimality of empirically observed low degrees of income mobility as compared to perfect mobility processes (complete reversal) ...|$|E

Eight EU countries participated in the study, involving both senior citizens and experts (researchers, decision makers and practitioners who deal with all aspects of seniors' mobility).

These were followed by quantitative surveys with 3, 309 senior citizens and 490 experts that had the scope to measure the distribution of charted problems in the population. Finally, five workshops were carried out in order to discuss results and to formulate assumptions why promising measures are not implemented, as it appears. Barriers <b>to</b> mobility <b>are</b> by both experts and senior citizens attributed to traffic and infrastructure characteristics, to legal issues, to vehicle design problems, to inter-personal and inter-generational frictions, to lacking lobby power, but also to individual health problems. In order to improve mobility it is suggested by both senior citizens and experts to enforce vehicle speeds. Both groups also agree that public transport vehicles should be brought into an appropriate standard (low floor vehicles, kneeling busses).

Less information is available concerning the relative contribution to the blood ammonia by other organs, such as muscle, liver, brain and kid-ney, which are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> with am-monia metabolism (1). The renal release of am-monia into the systemic circulation was first demonstrated by the observations of Nash and Benedict in 1921 (2). Although the magnitude of this ammonia release and its effect on the arterial ammonia concentration have not been determined, factors affecting the quantity of ammonia excreted into urine have engendered considerable investiga-tion. Current evidence indicates that changes in urine pH are important determinants of urinary ammonia excretion, lesser amounts of ammonia appearing in alkaline than in acid urines (3 - 8). Studies in unilaterally nephrectomized dogs sug-gest that total renal ammonia production may re-main unchanged following acute alterations in urine pH (9). Of particular interest in this re-gard have been the observations of significant in-creases in arterial ammonia concentrations of cir-rhotic patients given Diamox (acetazolamide) (10 - 12), an agent which is known to increase urine pH.

All 10 National Health Service school health services in the Wessex region and 16 teacher training colleges responded to questions about their provision of such education for teachers. The results demonstrated that asthma care in the 11 schools was generally disorganized, with the responsibility for keeping and administering inhalers falling on the school secretary in seven of the schools. All but two of the 11 headteachers and 89 % of the class teachers were concerned about asthma, primarily in managing emergencies. Levels of knowledge were low, particularly regarding exercise, and education about asthma was almost non-existent. The great majority of class teachers (86 %) wanted more information about asthma and most (67 %) looked to the school health services to provide this. None of the school health services in Wessex and only one teacher training college had any planned education about asthma for teachers. Clearly, schools need to receive more information about asthma, both to enable them to cope more ably with their asthmatic pupils and to allay the anxieties of teachers.

Study design: A cross sectional study carried out at the Aga Khan University Hospital paediatric accidents and emergencies department. Methods: Quantitative data was collected using a structured questionnaire administered by the lead investigator and assistant to caregivers accompanying febrile children aged below five years who presented at the paediatric casualty. The primary outcomes were the knowledge, perceptions and home management practices of fever amongst caregivers and the secondary outcomes were the socio-demographic characteristics of caregivers that influence knowledge, perceptions and home management of fever. Data were analysed and summarised as proportions for categorical data and means/ranges for continuous data.

40|$|Abstract: We used 39 -year {{datasets}} {{from the}} Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and the Audubon Christmas Bird Count (CBC) to determine continental and regional population trends of 146 species of waterbirds that regularly occur in seven bird conservation regions {{in which more}} than 10 % of the land area <b>is</b> devoted <b>to</b> row crops. Thirty-nine of the species show long-term continental declines on one or a combination of the surveys; 52 species show large increases. For many of these species, CBC analyses are available for the first time. Current wetlands acreage is a fraction of what occurred 300 years ago as Europeans spread throughout the continent; however, our results show a partial recovery of waterbird populations, especially over the past 20 years. Probable contributors to this partial recovery include: 1) Banning of organochlorine pesticides and the population recovery of fish-eating birds, 2) Success of wetland and farmland conservation programs in restoring waterbird habitat, and 3) Provision of excess food to waterbirds, especially corn and rice. Although there are more increasing species than decreasing, there are nonetheless a significant number of declining species and additional species with inadequate trend information that <b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of conservation <b>concern.</b> We discuss possible causes of declines and reasons for conservation concern for these species...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is investigated as {{a sustainable}} depurative strategy {{of olive oil}} mill wastewater (OOMW). The effect of thermal pretreatment on the anaerobic biodegradation of aromatic compounds present in (OMWW) was investigated. The anaerobic degradation of phenolic compounds, well <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the main <b>concern</b> related to this kind of effluents, was monitored in batch anaerobic tests at a laboratory scale on samples pretreated at mild (80 ± 1 [*]°C), intermediate (90 ± 1 [*]°C) and high temperature (120 ± 1 [*]°C). The obtained results showed an increase of 34 % in specific methane production (SMP) for OMWW treated at the lowest temperature and a decrease of 18 % for treatment at the highest temperature. These results <b>were</b> related <b>to</b> the different decomposition pathways of the lignocellulosic compounds obtained in the tested conditions. The decomposition pathway was determined by measuring the concentrations of volatile organic acids, phenols, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) versus time. Cyclohexane carboxylic acid (CHCA) production was identified in all the tests with a maximum concentration of around 200  µmol L(- 1) in accordance with the phenols degradation, suggesting that anaerobic digestion of aromatic compounds follows the benzoyl-CoA pathway. Accurate monitoring of this compound was proposed as the key element to control the process evolution. The total phenols (TP) and total COD removals were, with SMP, the highest (TP 62. 7 %-COD 63. 2 %) at 80 [*]°C and lowest (TP 44. 9 %-COD 32. 2 %) at 120 [*]°C. In all cases, thermal pretreatment <b>was</b> able <b>to</b> enhance the TP removal ability (up to 42 % increase) ...|$|R
