5|$|Many {{different}} {{energy sources}} {{can be used}} for welding, including a <b>gas</b> <b>flame,</b> an electric arc, a laser, an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound. While often an industrial process, welding may be performed in many different environments, including in open air, under water, and in outer space. Welding is a hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns, electric shock, vision damage, inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes, and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} length associated with sound power is αL, {{the position of}} the gauze. The characteristic speed must be the convection speed u at the heat source. For detailed study of the whistle, see Matveev. Since the first mode resonance is about half-wave, the sound field emitted from the tube is from two in-phase monopole-like sources, one at either end. A <b>gas</b> <b>flame</b> inside a tube can drive resonance; it was called a singing flame. There is a reverse Rijke Tube when hot air passes through a cold grid.|$|E
25|$|Flaming {{is done to}} {{loops and}} straight-wires in {{microbiology}} labs. Leaving the loop in the flame of a Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in 70% or higher ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a Bunsen burner flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a <b>gas</b> <b>flame.</b>|$|E

25|$|Phosgene {{may also}} be {{produced}} during testing for leaks of older-style refrigerant gases. Chloromethanes (R12, R22 and others) were formerly leak-tested in situ by employing a small gas torch (propane, butane or propylene gas) with a sniffer tube and a copper reaction plate in the flame nozzle of the torch. If any refrigerant gas was leaking from a pipe or joint, the gas would be sucked into the flame through the sniffer tube and would cause a colour change of the <b>gas</b> <b>flame</b> to a bright greenish blue. In the process, phosgene gas would be created due to the thermal reaction. No valid statistics are available, but anecdotal reports suggest that numerous refrigeration technicians suffered the effects of phosgene poisoning due to their ignorance of the toxicity of phosgene, produced during such leak testing. Electronic sensing of refrigerant gases phased out the use of flame testing for leaks in the 1980s. Similarly, phosgene poisoning is a possibility for people fighting fires {{that occur in the}} vicinity of refrigerant leaks from air-conditioning systems or refrigeration equipment, smoking in the vicinity of a freon refrigerant leak, or fighting fires using halon or halotron.|$|E

Once again a competition was run, with A. S. Fall and E. E. Milston as the joint winners.

[...] The Forecourt replaced a reflecting pool that had previously stood in front of the Shrine. [...] These enlargements were dedicated by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 February 1954.

40|$|Abstract. The {{experiment}} on <b>gas</b> jet <b>flame</b> extinguishing with water mist in open space {{was conducted in}} this paper. On the basis of experimental result, {{the process of the}} flame extinguishment can be classified into two categories: 1) when fuel flow rate is small, the <b>gas</b> jet <b>flame</b> can be suppressed and extinguished quickly; 2) When fuel flow is large, the flame lifts from the attached position at the burner exit after suppressed by the water mist. FLUENT is used to simulate the interaction of water mist with <b>gas</b> jet <b>flame.</b> The Eddy-dissipation model (EDM) is used for combustion of flame. the water mist is simulated by Discrete Phase Model (DPM).

He traced its inspiration to 1900, when, experimenting with a spark-gap transmitter, he briefly thought that the flickering of a nearby <b>gas</b> <b>flame</b> might be in response to electromagnetic pulses. With further tests he soon determined that the cause of the flame fluctuations actually was due to air pressure changes produced by the loud sound of the spark. Still, he was intrigued by the idea that, properly configured, {{it might be possible to}} use a flame or something similar to detect radio signals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{peak of the}} {{blackbody}} {{spectrum is}} in the deep infrared, at about 10 micrometre wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal is heated to [...] "red hot" [...] or [...] "white hot". Blue-white thermal emission is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a <b>gas</b> <b>flame</b> or a welder's torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).|$|E

40|$|A novel {{diagnostic}} technique, {{which makes}} use of laser light scattered by soot particles, was used {{in an effort to}} identify the flame sheets within a natural <b>gas</b> diffusion <b>flame.</b> Soot particles, inherently created and consumed in the flame, were used as the scattering medium, which obviated the need for externally supplied seed material. Since no foreign material was added to the flame, the current technique can be considered truly nonintrusive. The soot distribution within a large buoyant natural <b>gas</b> diffusion <b>flame</b> is argued to be a reasonable marker of the flame sheets. Measurements made in 47. 4 - 190 kW natural <b>gas</b> <b>flames</b> stabilized on a 0. 5 m diameter burner show that the flame sheets are highly wrinkled and convoluted surfaces.

2500|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of Restoration theatres in England: Restoration commercial theatres and Restoration court theatres. Commercial theatres tended to be more [...] "conservative in their lighting, for economic reasons" [...] and therefore used [...] "candle-burning chandeliers" [...] primarily. Court theatres could afford to [...] "use most of the Continental innovations" [...] in their productions [...] (Penzel 16). Theatres such as the Drury Lane Theatre and the Covent Garden Theatre were lit by a large central chandelier and had a varying number of smaller stage chandeliers and candle sconces around the walls of the theatres. Two main court theatres, built between 1660 and 1665, were the Cockpit Theatre and the Hall Theatre. Chandeliers and sconces seemed to be the primary lighting sources here but other developments were being made, especially at the Hall. By the 1670s, the Hall Theatre started using footlights, and between 1670 and 1689 they used candles or lamps. It can be noted {{that by the end of}} the 17th century, [...] "French and English stages were fairly similar". There is not much written on theatrical lighting in England at the end of the 17th century and from the little information historians do have, not much changed by the middle of the 18th century. Gas lighting hit the English stage in the early 1800s beginning with the Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres. [...] In the 1820s, a new type of artificial illumination was developed. [...] In this type of illumination, a <b>gas</b> <b>flame</b> is used to heat a cylinder of quicklime (calcium oxide). [...] Upon reaching a certain temperature, the quicklime would begin to incandesce. [...] This illumination could then be directed by reflectors and lenses. It took some time from the development of this new Limelight before it found its way into theatrical use, which started around 1837. [...] Limelight became popular in the 1860s and beyond, until it was displaced by electrical lighting. [...] Lighting advances made in English Theatres during this timeframe paved the way for the many lighting advances in the modern theatrical world.|$|E

Addition of SO₂ to natural <b>gas</b> <b>flames</b> doped with ammonia (NH₃) produced a significant increase in conversion of NH₃ to NO at high air preheat conditions.
