After the Storm barely made the top 100 on the album chart, and by the late nineties CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of <b>input,</b> <b>turning</b> the album into a CSNY project, Looking Forward, released on Young's label Reprise Records. With writing credits mostly limited to band members, the disc was better received than the previous three albums, and the ensuing CSNY2K tour in 2000 and the CSNY Tour of America of 2002 were major money-makers.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} and {{implementation}} of an effective neural network model for turning process identification {{as well as a}} neural network controller to track a desired vibration level of the turning machine is as an example of using the neural network for manufacturing process control. Multi – Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network architecture with Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm has been utilized to train the turning process identifier. Two different strategies have been used for training turning process identifier, and for training the controller model, where there is no mathematical model till now could relate the vibration level to the <b>input</b> <b>turning</b> process parameters “feed, speed, and depth of cut”. The vibration signal obtained by the experimental work has been used to train a neural network for identification and control of the turning process. The developed Neuro – controller has been checked by applying different reference vibration signals where it is found that the controller has good ability to track the reference within maximum settling time that does not exceed (4 sec for 95 % of the signal); maximum overshot not exceed (30 %) of the reference signal used for checking...|$|E
30|$|Both {{principles}} {{can be made}} precise, proved, and computationally {{supported in}} numerous different ways. We will give examples of that in this article. However, intuitively the reasoning is very simple: When the input is made more synchronous, it becomes more effective at eliciting a firing response in the target, but more of it is wasted because it arrives between {{the time when the}} firing threshold is reached in the target and the time when the <b>input</b> <b>turns</b> off.|$|R

[...] In water purification plants, there is usually a high energy, rapid mix unit process (detention time in seconds) where the coagulant chemicals are added followed by flocculation basins (detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes) where low energy <b>inputs</b> <b>turn</b> large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc.

For our study, we chose a switchable P 5 Glove Controller, {{which can be used}} to provide both 2 DOF and 6 DOF input control. Our results suggest that for both tasks the overall performance and accuracy can be improved when the input device with more degrees of freedom (DOF) is used for manipulation of the visualized medical data. 3 D <b>input</b> <b>turned</b> out to be more beneficial for the positioning task than for the selection task.

40|$|Predicting {{the end of}} user <b>input</b> <b>turns</b> in a {{multimodal}} {{system can}} be complex. User interactions vary across a spectrum from single, unimodal inputs to multimodal combinations delivered either simultaneously or sequentially. Early multimodal systems used a fixed duration temporal threshold to determine how long {{to wait for the}} next input before processing and integration. Several recent studies have proposed using dynamic or adaptive temporal thresholds to predict turn segmentation and thus achieve faster system response times. We introduce an approach that requires no temporal threshold. First we contrast current multimodal command interfaces to a new class of cumulative-observant multimodal systems that we introduce. Within that new system class we show how our technique of edge-splitting combined with our strategy for under-specified, no-wait, visual feedback resolves parsing problems that underlie turn segmentation errors. Test results show a 46. 2 % significant reduction in multimodal recognition errors, compared to not using these techniques...|$|R

50|$|A {{unit step}} function, {{also called the}} Heaviside step function, is a signal that has a {{magnitude}} of zero before zero and a magnitude of one after zero. The symbol for a unit step is u(t). If a step is used as the input to a system, the output is called the step response. The step response shows how a system responds to a sudden <b>input,</b> similar to <b>turning</b> on a switch. The period before the output stabilizes is called the transient part of a signal.

50|$|Key to the system's {{mechanical}} operation {{was some sort}} of system to transmit forces from the input to the output. This was typically a ball bearing positioned between the input shaft and output disk and pressed against both.

40|$|A long-standing {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex control {{the influx of}} sensory information {{at the level of}} primary sensory representations areas. Yet {{little is known about the}} cellular mechanisms governing selective attention to behavior-ally relevant objects in space. Neurons in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus are notably involved in this process, and they are directly targeted by retinal and cortical afferents. To study long-term and short-term effects of the visual cortex (VC) on subcortical visual neurons we established an in vitro model of the developing cortico-tectal projection. To this end, cortical explants expressing Green Fluorescent Protein were allowed to form connections with non-labeled dissociated tectal neurons. The presence of VC ex-plants led to an enhancement of tectal activity by 2 mechanisms. First, glutamatergic input was increased. Second, intrinsic GA-BAergic inhibition was suppressed. The latter effect was shown to be acute and mediated through postsynaptic metabotropic gluta-mate receptor activation, G-protein acitivity, and endocannabinoid receptor activation. The VC-induced disinhibition was readily reversed by application of an mGluR antagonist. However, high-frequency activation of the glutamatergic cortico-tectal <b>input</b> <b>turned</b> the labile disinhibition into a persistent suppression of inhibition...|$|R
40|$|During {{melanoma}} cell extravasation {{through the}} vascular endothelium, melanoma cells interact with endothelial cells through secretion of cytokines and by adhesion between proteins displayed on opposing cell surfaces. How these tumor cell associated signals together regulate {{the dynamics of}} intracellular signaling pathways within endothelial cells leading to endothelial cell-cell junction disruption is not well understood. Here, we used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to examine the individual and combined effects of activation of the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) - 1, interleukin (IL) - 8, and IL- 1 b signaling pathways on the integrity of vascular junctions. Our simulations predict a multifaceted interplay of signaling resulting from individual activation of VCAM- 1, IL- 8 and IL- 1 b pathways that is neither synergistic nor additive compared to all <b>inputs</b> <b>turned</b> on simultaneously. Furthermore, we show that the levels of phosphorylated proteins associated with actinomyosin contractility and junction disassembly peak prior to those related to actin remodeling.

40|$|Using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, {{this paper}} {{examines}} the cyclical {{properties of the}} Italian labour market. Its main contribution is the empirical analysis of three different labour inputs - regular employees, regular self-employed and underground workers. Results from VAR models support the widespread view that the shadow employment functions as an improper tool for increasing {{the flexibility of the}} labour market. While the contemporaneous correlation between shadow labour and output is significant, as time passes their association looses momentum. The opposite is found for regular employees, which show significant positive correlations only with lagged output gaps. Somewhat puzzling, self- employment seems to be the less sensitive to the course of business cycles. The skewness of input distributions suggests that hiring employees is easier than firing them, while this can not be said for the other two labour gaps. Disaggregate data tell different stories. For instance, in the manufacturing sector the hidden employment is not correlated with the output, while in the trade sector the acyclical <b>input</b> <b>turns</b> out to be the recorded employees. In the transport industry, where no labour input follow the cycle, regular employees are more fired than hired. Underground economy; VAR models; Labour Flexibility, Business Cycle. ...|$|R

30|$|New {{intermediate}} inputs {{play a central}} role in many trade and growth models.

Despite the prominence of these models, we have surprisingly little evidence to date on the relevance of the underlying microeconomic mechanisms (Goldberg et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to test the {{possible}} catalysing role of in-house R&D in fostering the complementarity of innovative inputs on a sample of 3045 manufacturing firms drawn from the third Italian Community Innovation Survey (1998 - 2000). The interactions between four different sources of innovation internal and external R&D, embodied and disembodied technological acquisitions - have been simultaneously explored through the two (direct and indirect) testing frameworks for complementarity. Results from both the approaches show that the innovative process is a phenomenon combining within itself both complementarity and substitutability relationships, depending both on the typology of the targeted innovation output and on the particular combination of innovative inputs we focus on. In particular, it is in-house R&D that seems to create the precondition allowing firms to enjoy complementarity effects. Indeed, the possibility of exploiting synergies between different innovative <b>inputs</b> <b>turns</b> out to be subordinated to having undertaken a minimum amount of internal R&D.
