50|$|During {{his years}} as WJAG's first announcer, Stefan is {{credited}} with developing much of WJAG's programming, including a noontime show. Stefan, who announced WJAG’s noon news report, opened his daily broadcast with a trademark greeting: “Hello friends. Hello everybody! You are listening to WJAG, the Norfolk Daily News station, and we’re located at Norfolk, IN Nebraska. On {{the air with the}} regular noon-day program -- the lunch-hour session of WJAG’s radio family.” One of WJAG’s first announcers, Art Breyer, who worked sans pay at the Norfolk station “for the fun of it,” labeled Stefan the “backbone” of WJAG. Breyer said Stefan’s “personality enabled him to become intimately acquainted with the listeners.” In typical charismatic fashion, the local newscaster personalized a livestock quote on one of his noon reports. “Sam Kent,” Stefan declared, “I’ve <b>got</b> good <b>news</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> today. Understand the price of hogs is 6½ cents today, and that’s going to make everything all right.” Stefan’s radio persona, says Breyer, “endeared himself to the public.” But Stefan had more than an appealing personality to draw listeners, he dispensed information. WJAG’s first announcer not only peppered his noon broadcasts with local affairs but also news from the Norfolk Daily News’ Associated Press (AP) newspaper wire.|$|R
