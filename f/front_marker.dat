40|$|Addressing the {{dynamics}} of multiphase fronts is crucial for successful practices of many engineering applications that involve both gas and liquid constituents. Numerical simulations of such flows need to resolve the location and {{the shape of the}} front, where interfacial conditions are satisfied as part of the solution. In this work, immersed boundary method on adaptively refined Cartesian grid is utilized to capture {{the dynamics}} of the multiphase <b>front.</b> <b>Marker</b> based interface representation is extended to handle the complex solid geometries that exist in the flow field. The entire computational algorithm is applied to simulate steady state and time dependent liquid plug problem and assessed against existing theoretical analyses.

Distinct interfacial characteristics and fluid physics associated with different flow regimes are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn a motile {{eukaryotic}} cell, front protrusion {{and tail}} retraction are superimposed on each other. To single out mechanisms {{that result in}} front to tail or in tail to front transition, we separated the two processes in time using cells that oscillate between a full front and a full tail state. State transitions were visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy using as a <b>front</b> <b>marker</b> PIP 3 (phosphatidylinositol [3, 4, 5] tris-phosphate), and as a tail marker the tumor-suppressor PTEN (phosphatase tensin homolog) that degrades PIP 3. Negative fluctuations in the PTEN layer of the membrane gated a local increase in PIP 3. In a subset of areas lacking PTEN (PTEN holes), PIP 3 was amplified until a propagated wave was initiated. Wave propagation implies that a PIP 3 signal is transmitted by a self-sustained process, such that the temporal and spatial profiles of the signal are maintained during passage of the wave across the entire expanse of the cell membrane. Actin clusters were remodeled into a ring along {{the perimeter of the}} expanding PIP 3 wave. The reverse transition of PIP 3 to PTEN was linked to the previous site of wave initiation: where PIP 3 decayed first, the entry of PTEN was primed...|$|E
40|$|Local {{heat release}} rate {{represents}} {{one of the most interesting}} experimental observables in the study of unsteady reacting flows. The direct measure of burning or {{heat release rate}} as a field variable is not possible. Numerous experimental investigations have relied on inferring this type of information as well as flame front topology from indirect measures which are presumed to be correlated. A recent study has brought into question many of the commonly used flame <b>front</b> <b>marker</b> and burning rate diagnostics. This same study found that the concentration of formyl radical offers the best possibility for measuring flame burning rate. However, primarily due to low concentrations, the fluorescence signal level from formyl is too weak to employ this diagnostic for single-pulse measurements of turbulent reacting flows. In this paper the authors describe and demonstrate a new fluorescence-based reaction front imaging diagnostic suitable for single-shot applications. The measurement is based on taking the pixel-by-pixel product of OH and CH{sub 2 }O planar laser-induced fluorescence images to yield an image closely related to a reaction rate. The spectroscopic and collisional processes affecting the measured signals are discussed and the foundation of the diagnostic, as based on laminar and unsteady flame calculations, is presented. The authors report the results of applying this diagnostic to the study of a laminar premixed flame subject to an interaction with an isolated line-vortex pair...|$|E

40|$|An {{instrument}} {{has been}} designed, built, and tested for performing laser diagnostic measurements of droplet combustion in low-gravity-flight aircraft. Nonintrusive measurements {{are of particular}} importance for droplet combustion (the simplest example of non-premixed combustion) and transport in microgravity environments, where physical contact would introduce an unacceptable level of perturbations. The resolution of these diagnostics can also isolate transport to length scales {{much smaller than the}} droplet diameter. These techniques can be configured to instantaneously map an entire flow field in two and three dimensions, providing either qualitative or quantitative information on the distribution of a desired scalar or vector quantity. Detailing the gas-phase flow field and position of the flame front can be achieved using planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH or another flame <b>front</b> <b>marker.</b> An alternative approach is to obtain LIF from a diagnostic seed included in the liquid phase fuel; it would be consumed at the flame front. The main advantage to this approach is that it is easier to choose the wavelength of the molecular absorption which coincides with convenient laser wavelengths rather than finding lasers which can be configured to access OH. Our present method uses a nitrogen-pumped dye laser tuned to a sodium absorption and addition of small concentrations of NaCl to the fuel. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a laser-based technique which has recently had its practicality greatly enhanced by the development of high-resolution CCD cameras and the increase in speed and capacity of computer systems. With this technique, a seeded flow is illuminated with a double-pulsed laser sheet to generate a double exposure image on a film or CCD camera. Computer analysis of the image is used to determine the particle velocity vectors and, thus, the gas velocity within the plane of the laser sheet. Our current experiment uses PIV for measuring relative droplet gas-phase velocities in a parabolic flight environment. The results show successful application of PLIF relative to luminosity and radical emission near 308 nm. PIV results are less successful due to gas thermal expansion deflecting the seed particles away from the measurement volume. PIV is applicable for measurements in the absence of combustion...|$|E

Arsenal won 1-0, however, despite the scoreline, The Gunners had rarely been threatened by the Baggies, and after 14 minutes, Oliver Giroud netted his 22nd goal of the season. The France striker grabbed the only goal of the game, rising in <b>front</b> of <b>marker</b> Craig Dawson to convert Santi Cazorla's corner. The France international has brilliant knack of losing his marker when the ball is played from the wings, and on this occasion, he beat Dawson to score his 15th Premier League goal. However, Giroud's early opening goal provided one of the few rousing moments during a sedate match. Ben Foster was given little chance with that effort and perhaps should not have been given any with a Cazorla shot moments later. But the England World Cup hopeful was on his toes to push away the Spaniard's effort as it headed for the bottom corner. Arsenal went close once more, after the break, when Lukas Podolski mis-hit a half-volley from 10 yards that bounced off the post and into the arms of Foster. West Brom's best effort in the game came from Graham Dorrans, but his 25-yard shot was patted down by Wojciech Szczęsny. The win sits Arsenal in 4th, on 76 points, behind rivals Chelsea (who sit in 3rd) by 3 points.
