40|$|Australia is the driest {{inhabited}} continent in {{the world}} and persisting droughts have triggered a move toward sensible and sustainable water consumption. Understanding how and where water is consumed in households enables streamlined development of demand management programs and efficient engineering of water infrastructure. <b>End</b> <b>use</b> water consumption analysis is required to gain necessary empirical data of how and where water is consumed. Several <b>end</b> <b>use</b> water consumption studies have been conducted within Australia and around the world with varying results produced. This pilot study paper provides preliminary data from the Gold Coast Watersaver <b>End</b> <b>Use</b> Project which is currently underway. Specifically, the paper includes water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> category volumetric and percentage break downs for 18 single and 32 dual reticulated homes on the Gold Coast (i. e. 50 in total). Moreover, a comparitive analysis between each of the individual households water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> levels is discussed along with other national studies previously completed. The paper finishes with an overview of the greater 200 home <b>end</b> <b>use</b> study conducted on the Gold Coast and its key deliverables and research outcomes.

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to disaggregate water flow data {{collected}} from high resolution smart water meters into different water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> categories. The data was obtained from a sample of 252 residential dwellings located within South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. An integrated approach was used, combining high resolution water meters, remote data transfer loggers, household water appliance audits and a selfreported household water use diary. Disaggregating water flow traces into a registry of <b>end</b> <b>use</b> events (e. g. shower, clothes washer, etc.) is predominately a complex pattern matching problem, which requires a comparison between presented patterns and those contained with a large registry of categorised <b>end</b> <b>use</b> events. Water flow data collected directly from water meters includes both single (e. g. shower event occurring alone) and combined events (i. e. an event which comprises of several overlapped single events). To identify these former mentioned single events, a hybrid combination of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) provided the most feasible and accurate approach available. Additional <b>end</b> <b>use</b> event physical context algorithms have been developed to aid accurate <b>end</b> <b>use</b> event categorisation. This paper firstly presents a thorough discussion on the single water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> event analysis process developed and its internal validation with a testing set. This is followed by the application of the developed approach on three independent households to examine its degree of accuracy in disaggregating two weeks of residential flow data into a repository of residential water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> events. Future stages of algorithm development and testing is discussed in the final section. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is now {{substantial}} literature {{describing the}} importance of <b>end</b> <b>use</b> water saving. From the management perspective, {{it is reasonable to}} investigate how consumers use water and their water use behaviours. The TPB behaviour intervention theory with extended parameters for water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> was computerized by applying the water flowing concept and SEM (Structural Equation Model). This TPB mathematical expression model (dynamic behaviour change model) integrated with ANNs (Artificial Neutral Networks) is also been proposed to investigate the behaviour intervention. The significance of findings about behaviour intervention modelling in water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> areas and its applications are discussed...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to transporting gas via pipelines {{for use in}} power generation, other <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via gas to liquids (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including Fischer–Tropsch (F–T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and STG+. F–T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas. STG+ can produce drop-in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single-loop process. In 2011, Royal Dutch Shell's 140,000 barrel (16 dam³) per day F–T plant went into operation in Qatar.|$|E

500|$|Germanium [...] "metal" [...] (isolated germanium) {{is used as}} a {{semiconductor}} in transistors {{and various}} other electronic devices. Historically, the first decade of semiconductor electronics was based entirely on germanium. Today, the amount of germanium produced for semiconductor electronics is one fiftieth the amount of ultra-high purity silicon produced for the same. Presently, the major <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> are fibre-optic systems, infrared optics, solar cell applications, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Germanium compounds are also used for polymerization catalysts and have most recently found use in the production of nanowires.

We found that the distance between targets during training is of little influence if the <b>end</b> <b>use</b> targets are close to each other, but that training at far distance can lead to a better accuracy for far distance <b>end</b> <b>use</b> (p <. 01). Additionally, an interaction effect is observed between training and testing color (p <. 001) : while training with monochrome targets leads to good performance only when the test context involves monochrome targets as well, a classifier trained on colored targets can be efficient for both colored and monochrome targets. In a nutshell, in the context of SSVEP-based BCI, training using distant targets of different colors seems to lead to the best and more robust performance in all <b>end</b> <b>use</b> contexts...|$|R
