40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{hierarchical}} control design of an electro-hydraulic actuator, {{which is used}} to improve the roll stability of vehicles. The purpose of the control system is to generate a reference torque, which is required by the vehicle dynamic control. The control-oriented model of the actuator is formulated in two subsystems. The high-level <b>hydromotor</b> is described in a linear form, while the low-level spool valve is a polynomial system. These subsystems require different control strategies. At the high level, a linear parameter-varying control is used to guarantee performance specifications. At the low level, a control Lyapunov-function-based algorithm, which creates discrete control input values of the valve, is proposed. The interaction between the two subsystems is guaranteed by the spool displacement, which is control input at the high level and must be tracked at the low-level control. The spool displacement has physical constraints, which must also be incorporated into the control design. The robust design of the high-level control incorporates the imprecision of the low-level control as an uncertainty of the system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} a way of {{interpretation}} the results of numerical simulations solved for the mechanism of lifting platform. Subject of analysis is the atypical design solution of lifting mechanism with one degree of freedom, which members are connected by revolute joints and linear sliding guidance. The mechanism movement is provided by linear <b>hydromotors.</b> Computational simulations are carried out by FEM, where linear coupling equations are used for modeling of revolute joints and linear sliding guidance is modeled by structural contact of rail and slider. The way of modeling and parameters setting of structural contact significantly affects the stability of numerical solutions and the obtained results. The authors assume that {{the interpretation of the}} observed behavior and results of the numerical simulations allow to deduce the mechanism operability and gives a clue for setting the gap of real bounds...|$|R

30|$|In {{a typical}} household, showers consume the most water (29  % {{of an average}} family’s monthly water consumption, (Public Utilities Board 2016)). Encouraging further flow rate {{reduction}} in shower mixers usually leads {{to a loss of}} comfort. Emerging water-efficient showerheads utilize technology that can maintain or increase comfort levels even at low flow rates (e.g. air intake, pulsating flow, and automatic reduction of flow strength based on proximity to user). Some showerheads make use of <b>hydromotors</b> with LED lights that change colour according to the shower duration. Finally, there are also devices which can be installed to showerheads to provide real time feedback on water and energy usage to consumers. The Amphiro ([URL] device is one example of such a device that is also integrated with an online portal that displays usage trends. While home energy management solutions are already widely available in the market, home water management solutions are still uncommon. The current solutions are able to provide the total water consumption data to the home owners with the help of smart water metering, at intervals as short as 10  s. Technologies are also available to give more intricate information on water uses at homes. Flow-trace analysis software such as Trace Wizard disaggregates residential water use into its component end uses, providing a detailed breakdown of the residential water usage to home dwellers (Wong et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the static {{calculations}} in designing a high-performance fixed fluid power drive with a single positive-displacement hydraulic motor. Designing is aimed at using a drive that is under development and yet unavailable to find and record the minimum of calculations and maximum of existing hydraulic units that enable clear and unambiguous performance, taking into consideration an available assortment of hydraulic units of hydraulic drives, {{to have the best}} efficiency. The specified power (power, moment) and kinematics (linear velocity or angular velocity of rotation) parameters of the output element of hydraulic motor determine the main output parameters of the hydraulic drive and the useful power of the hydraulic drive under development. The value of the overall efficiency of the hydraulic drive enables us to judge the efficiency of high-performance fixed fluid power drive. The energy analysis of a diagram of the high-performance fixed fluid power drive shows that its high efficiency is achieved when the flow rate of fluid flowing into each cylinder and the magnitude of the feed pump unit (pump) are as nearly as possible. The paper considers the ways of determining the geometric parameters of working <b>hydromotors</b> (effective working area or working volume), which allow a selection of the pumping unit parameters. It discusses the ways to improve hydraulic drive efficiency. Using the principle of holding constant conductivity allows us to specify the values of the pressure losses in the hydraulic units used in noncatalog modes. In case of no exact matching between the parameters of existing hydraulic power modes and a proposed characteristics of the pump unit, the nearest to the expected characteristics is taken as a working version. All of the steps allow us to create the high-performance fixed fluid power drive capable of operating at the required power and kinematic parameters with high efficiency. </p...|$|R
