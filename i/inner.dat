5|$|All of Neptune's <b>inner</b> moons {{are dark}} objects: their {{geometric}} albedo ranges from 7 to 10%. Their spectra {{indicate that they}} are made from water ice contaminated by some very dark material, probably complex organic compounds. In this respect, the <b>inner</b> Neptunian moons {{are similar to the}} <b>inner</b> Uranian moons.|$|E
5|$|At 162km, Puck is {{the largest}} of the <b>inner</b> moons of Uranus and the only one imaged by Voyager 2 in any detail. Puck and Mab are the two {{outermost}} <b>inner</b> satellites of Uranus. All <b>inner</b> moons are dark objects; their geometrical albedo is less than 10%. They are composed of water ice contaminated with a dark material—probably radiation-processed organics.|$|E

5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The <b>inner</b> membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the <b>inner</b> membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the <b>inner</b> membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the <b>inner</b> membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the <b>inner</b> membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the <b>inner</b> membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E

5|$|On 6 October 1884, {{the final}} section of the <b>Inner</b> Circle was opened, along with Cannon Street station. Initially, the station was served by trains of both {{companies}} {{as part of the}} circular <b>Inner</b> Circle service, but various operational patterns have been used during the station's life. The <b>Inner</b> Circle service achieved a separate identity as the Circle line in 1949, although its trains were still provided by the District or Metropolitan lines.|$|E
5|$|Order Paleonemertea. Comprises 100 marine species. Their body wall has outer {{circular}} and <b>inner</b> length-wise muscles. In addition, Carinoma tremaphoros has circular and <b>inner</b> length-wise {{muscles in}} the epidermis; the extra muscle layers seem to be needed for burrowing by peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{between the}} incus and the <b>inner</b> ear, the stapes transmits sound {{vibrations}} from the incus {{to the oval}} window, a membrane-covered opening to the <b>inner</b> ear. The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{divided the}} {{interior}} of the old Roman fort into two fortified enclosures, referred to as the <b>inner</b> and outer baileys. The <b>inner</b> bailey of the castle was, in effect, a castle within a castle, consisting of a walled fortification with a tower at each corner, surrounded by a moat and with a keep of unusual design at its eastern extremity, adjoining the old Roman curtain wall. The present stone fortifications of the <b>inner</b> bailey date mainly from the 13th and 14th centuries. They replaced the original wood and earth fortifications of the Norman <b>inner</b> bailey, which occupied a much larger area of the Roman fort's interior. Traces of the Norman bailey's ditch and earthen rampart, which stretched right across {{the interior of}} the fort, can still be seen today. The <b>inner</b> bailey protected the castle's most important domestic buildings, while the outer bailey was used for buildings of lesser importance such as a granary for the manor of Pevensey.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt {{may also be}} divided into the <b>inner</b> and outer belts, with the <b>inner</b> belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5AU), and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide the <b>inner</b> and outer belts at the 2:1 resonance gap (3.3 AU), whereas others suggest <b>inner,</b> middle, and outer belts; also see diagram).|$|E
5|$|The <b>inner</b> Solar System also {{contains}} near-Earth asteroids, {{many of which}} cross the orbits of the <b>inner</b> planets. Some of them are potentially hazardous objects.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inner</b> {{mitochondrial}} membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand {{the surface area}} of the <b>inner</b> {{mitochondrial membrane}}, enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, {{the area of the}} <b>inner</b> membrane is about five times as large as the outer membrane. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the <b>inner</b> membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E

5|$|Type II (excision) is the {{complete}} or partial {{removal of the}} <b>inner</b> labia, with or without removal of the clitoral glans and outer labia. Type IIa is removal of the <b>inner</b> labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral glans and <b>inner</b> labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral glans, <b>inner</b> and outer labia. Excision in French can refer to any form of FGM.|$|E
5|$|Within the <b>inner</b> wall {{there are}} two mosques, a palace or Sheikh's house, four large houses, several {{clustered}} houses, and four large pillar tombs comprising the urban core. The <b>inner</b> wall also encloses four other houses and three other mosques. Between the <b>inner</b> and outer walls few stone structures have been identified {{with the exception of}} two mosques. Immediately beyond the outer wall there is one mosque and several other unidentified structures.|$|E
5|$|A replica wooden bridge {{runs from}} the outer defences over the water to an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked to the <b>inner</b> defences by another replica bridge, {{protected}} with two drawbridges. The ravelin formed a physical barrier to incoming artillery fire aimed {{at the entrance to}} the <b>inner</b> defences and could also have directed fire against enemy forces that breached the outer defensive line.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Uranus {{is known}} to have 13 <b>inner</b> moons. Their orbits lie inside that of Miranda. All <b>inner</b> moons are intimately {{connected}} to the rings of Uranus, which probably resulted from the fragmentation of one or several small <b>inner</b> moons. The two innermost moons (Cordelia and Ophelia) are as shepherds of Uranus's ε ring, whereas the small moon Mab is a source of Uranus's outermost μ ring. There may be two additional small (2–7km in radius) undiscovered shepherd moons located about 100km exterior to Uranus' α and β rings.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati's outer inauspicious, fearful form {{reveals the}} dangers of {{considering}} sensory pleasures as fulfilment-giving. The winnowing basket, used to separate the husk from the grain, symbolizes the need to separate the outer illusory form from the <b>inner</b> reality. Her ugly form teaches the devotee {{to go beyond the}} outer deceptive appearances and seek the <b>inner</b> truths of life.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the <b>inner</b> plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The <b>inner</b> diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The <b>inner</b> tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{published}} many {{articles in}} <b>Inner</b> Light magazine, {{a number of}} which were collected together and published in books. In 1930, the first such collection was published as Mystical Meditations upon the Collects, in which Fortune emphasised her Christian commitments. In 1931 a number of her <b>Inner</b> Light articles on Spiritualism appeared as Spiritualism in the Light of Occult Science. In this book Fortune expressed reservations about Spiritualism. She drew a distinction between normal Spiritualist mediums and 'cosmic mediums' such as herself who contacted the Ascended Masters, also arguing that {{the spirits of the}} dead should not be contacted without good reason, a view that generated controversy among the occult milieu. In 1934, she assembled a number of her <b>Inner</b> Light articles on Glastonbury as Avalon of the Heart, while further <b>Inner</b> Light articles were assembled as Practical Occultism in Daily Life, a book aimed at a general reader.|$|E

5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the <b>inner</b> ear. The movement of liquids within the <b>inner</b> ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
