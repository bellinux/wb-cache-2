Lois arrives to pick Peter {{up from the}} bowling alley, but discovers Quagmire spying on her from {{the ceiling of the}} ladies' toilet. Quagmire is beaten up then arrested, but released shortly after by Joe. On his return, Lois, Bonnie and Loretta reveal that they're petitioning the city of Quahog to have Quagmire removed from their neighborhood. As Peter and the other guys are defending Quagmire, Ernie the Giant Chicken attacks Peter and starts a fight that causes huge casualties inside and outside of Quahog. After the fight, Peter returns to the neighborhood to return to the conversation and tells the women that, [...] "Quagmire's a good guy, he's just a little mixed up, that's all!" [...] Eventually, the women agree to let Quagmire stay in the neighborhood so long as he manages to control his perverse behavior. Quagmire's taught self-control through operant conditioning by Peter and his friends, and is eventually allowed out in public. Soon, however, he is distracted by women playing in a fountain in the shopping mall and panics, running into a CCTV camera operation room monitoring women's changing rooms.
