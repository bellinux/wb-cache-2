25|$|China's {{economic}} {{growth has been}} compared with other developing countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and India. GDP growth in China outstrips all other developing countries, with only India after 1990 coming close to China's experience. Scholars believe that high rates of investments, especially increases in capital invested per worker, have contributed to China's superior economic performance. China's relatively <b>free</b> <b>economy,</b> with less government intervention and regulation, is cited by scholars as {{an important factor in}} China's superior performance compared to other developing countries.|$|E
25|$|A <b>free</b> <b>economy</b> will be {{put into}} force, with {{regulations}} and licenses cut to a minimum, and the bureaucracy cut to the bone. Taxes will be cut, and capital investment welcome. Worker-participation in factories will be encouraged. The Histadrut {{will be limited to}} being a union only, and will have to sell off its holdings. Only free enterprise that brings in foreign investment, and that encourages domestic capitalism and incentive, will allow Israel to escape its position as a beggar basket-case.|$|E
25|$|The {{delay of}} {{hostilities}} {{for ten years}} allowed the <b>free</b> <b>economy</b> of the northern states to continue to industrialize. The southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability to industrialize heavily. By 1860, the northern states had added many more miles of railroad, steel production, modern factories, and population to the advantages already possessed in 1850. The North was better able to supply, equip, and man its armed forces, which would prove decisive in the later stages of the war.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{whether the}} financial crisis has affected citizens’ confidence in the <b>free</b> market <b>economy</b> and whether it has triggered citizens’ demand for a <b>free</b> market <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulations. Using panel data, the paper confirms that citizens’ confidence levels in the <b>free</b> market <b>economy</b> have decreased {{in most of the}} largest economies and demand for a <b>free</b> market <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulation has increased {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. After analysing the determinants for citizens’ confidence in the <b>free</b> market <b>economy</b> and demand for a <b>free</b> market <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulation before and after {{the financial crisis}}, the author concludes that citizens’ net confidence loss in the <b>free</b> market <b>economy</b> seems to have been driven by rising unemployment rates, and citizens’ demand for stronger state regulation seems to have been driven by the real economic downturn in GDP growth...|$|R

25|$|Companies such as Intel {{invested}} in Ireland {{during the late}} 1980s, later followed by Microsoft and Google. Ireland is ranked as the ninth most economically <b>free</b> <b>economy</b> in the world, according to the Index of Economic Freedom. In terms of GDP per capita, Ireland {{is one of the}} wealthiest countries in the OECD and EU. However, the country ranks below the OECD average in terms of GNP per capita. GDP is significantly greater than GNP due to the large number of multinational corporations based in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|There {{was greater}} unity to {{classical}} liberalism ideology than {{there had been}} with Whiggery. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. They believed that required a <b>free</b> <b>economy</b> with minimal government interference. Writers such as John Bright and Richard Cobden opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment {{to the development of}} a class of yeoman farmers. Some elements of Whiggery opposed this new thinking and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature of classical liberalism. These elements became associated with conservatism.|$|E
25|$|Peace, order, {{and good}} {{government}} are the stated {{goals of the}} Canadian government. Canada also {{has a tradition of}} liberalism. Individual rights have risen to the forefront of political and legal importance for most Canadians, as demonstrated through support for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a relatively <b>free</b> <b>economy,</b> and social liberal attitudes toward homosexuality, women's rights, and other egalitarian movements. However, there is also a sense of collective responsibility in Canadian political culture, as is demonstrated in general support for universal health care, gun control, foreign aid, and other social programs.|$|E

25|$|Finland {{retained}} a democratic constitution and <b>free</b> <b>economy</b> during the Cold War era. Treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included obligations and restraints on Finland, {{as well as}} territorial concessions. Both treaties have been abrogated by Finland since the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, while leaving the borders untouched. Even though being a neighbor to the Soviet Union sometimes resulted in overcautious concern in foreign policy ("Finlandization"), Finland developed closer co-operation with the other Nordic countries and declared itself neutral in superpower politics.|$|E

He contributed in Land Revenue Tax and excise duty policies to stabilise the economy. He {{played an important}} role in land reform and the state economic development. According to him, the caste system divided labourors and impeded economic progress. He emphasised a <b>free</b> <b>economy</b> with a stable Rupee which India has adopted recently. He advocated birth control to develop the Indian economy, and this has been adopted by Indian government as national policy for family planning. He emphasised equal rights for women for economic development. He laid the foundation of industrial relations after Indian independence.|$|E
500|$|Human Rights Watch also criticised the Azerbaijani {{government}} and the Baku City Authority for carrying out forced evictions against local residents, {{in order to allow}} for the demolition of flats to make way for construction in the neighbourhood where the Baku Crystal Hall was built. The Public Association for Assistance to <b>Free</b> <b>Economy,</b> a transparency and economic rights campaign group, had described the evictions as a [...] "violation of human rights", and as having [...] "no legal authority". However, in a statement to the BBC, Eurovision said that on a recent visit to Baku they had observed [...] "that the construction of the concert hall [...] media reports refer to was already well under way on a clean construction site and thus there are no demolitions needed". The EBU cited the [...] "apolitical" [...] nature of the contest and the Azerbaijani government's claim that the construction was not tied to the Eurovision Song Contest.|$|E

500|$|Atlas Shrugged, {{published}} in 1957, was considered Rand's magnum opus. Rand described {{the theme of}} the novel as [...] "the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest". It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent <b>free</b> <b>economy.</b> The novel's hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes the strike as [...] "stopping the motor of the world" [...] by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of romance, mystery, and science fiction, and it contains an extended exposition of Objectivism {{in the form of a}} lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.|$|E

Petroleum accounts for 43% of GDP, 87% of export revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait also export plant fertilizers. [...] The per capita GDP is $40,700. As part of a diversification plan the Kuwaiti government has invested its revenues and maintains a sizable sovereign wealth fund. [...] These investment currently {{account for more than}} half of Kuwait's GDP. 60% of Kuwait's work force are non-Kuwaitis.|$|E

2500|$|Negative {{interest}} rates have been proposed in the past, notably in the late 19th century by Silvio Gesell. A negative interest rate can be described (as by Gesell) as a [...] "tax on holding money"; he proposed it as the Freigeld (free money) component of his Freiwirtschaft (<b>free</b> <b>economy)</b> system. To prevent people from holding cash (and thus earning 0%), Gesell suggested issuing money for a limited duration, after which it must be exchanged for new bills; attempts to hold money thus result in it expiring and becoming worthless. Along similar lines, John Maynard Keynes approvingly cited {{the idea of a}} carrying tax on money, (1936, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money) but dismissed it due to administrative difficulties. More recently, a carry tax on currency was proposed by a Federal Reserve employee (Marvin Goodfriend) in 1999, to be implemented via magnetic strips on bills, deducting the carry tax upon deposit, the tax being based on how long the bill had been held.|$|E
