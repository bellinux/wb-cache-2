25|$|Often it is {{possible}} to chemically remove the products of corrosion. For example, phosphoric acid in the form of naval jelly is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces to remove rust. Corrosion removal {{should not be confused with}} <b>electropolishing,</b> which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface. For example, phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper, not the products of copper corrosion.|$|E

50|$|To achieve <b>electropolishing</b> of a rough surface, the {{protruding}} {{parts of a}} surface profile must dissolve faster than the recesses.

Anodic dissolution under <b>electropolishing</b> conditions deburrs metal objects due to increased current density on corners and burrs.Most importantly, successful <b>electropolishing</b> should operate under diffusion limited constant current plateau, achieved by following current dependence on voltage (polarisation curve), under constant temperature and stirring conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour of <b>electropolished</b> and {{anodised aluminium}} was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Freshly <b>electropolished</b> aluminium behaves as a pure capacitor exhibiting Warburg impedance at low frequencies. Storage of the <b>electropolished</b> aluminium, {{even in an}} air-tight bottle, results in the reconstruction of a uniform compact barrier layer. The impedance response of a stored <b>electropolished</b> aluminium as well as anodised aluminium after oxide removal, done by chemical etching, exhibits only a capacitive loop in the complex plane. The effect of the oxide layer thickness on the impedance data was investigated for layers formed during anodising at a cell potential of 15 or 23 V. Impedance measurements carried out {{over a wide range}} of frequencies gave useful information on the efficiency of the thinning of the barrier layer at the bottom of porous aluminium oxide layers. The rate of thinning of the barrier layer was estimated for samples anodised at different voltage. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This work characterises the ultrastructural {{composition}} of the interfacial tissue adjacent to <b>electropolished,</b> commercially pure titanium implants with and without subsequent anodisation, and it investigates whether a smooth <b>electropolished</b> surface can support bone formation {{in a manner similar}} to surfaces with a considerably thicker surface oxide layer. Screw-shaped implants were <b>electropolished</b> to remove all topographical remnants of the machining process, resulting in a thin spontaneously formed surface oxide layer and a smooth surface. Half of the implants were subsequently anodically oxidised to develop a thickened surface oxide layer and increased surface roughness. Despite substantial differences in the surface physicochemical properties, the microarchitecture and the {{composition of}} the newly formed bone were similar for both implant surfaces after 12 weeks of healing in rabbit tibia. A close spatial relationship was observed between osteocyte canaliculi and both implant surfaces. On the ultrastructural level, the merely <b>electropolished</b> surface showed the various stages of bone formation, for example, matrix deposition and mineralisation, entrapment of osteoblasts within the mineralised matrix, and their morphological transformation into osteocytes. The results demonstrate that titanium implants with a mirror-like surface and a thin, spontaneously formed oxide layer are able to support bone formation and remodelling...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{benefits}} of <b>electropolishing</b> for stainless steel is that it removes iron from the surface and enhances the chromium/nickel content for the most superior form of passivation for stainless steel. <b>Electropolishing</b> also provides a clean and smooth surface that is easier to sterilise, while improving the surface finish by levelling micro-peaks and valleys. This methodology is able to polish areas that are inaccessible by other polishing methods.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electropolishing</b> {{has many}} {{applications}} in the metal finishing industry because of its simplicity {{and its ability to}} be used on irregularly-shaped objects, such as electropolished stainless steel drums of washing machines, stainless steel surgical devices, and copper semiconductors. <b>Electropolishing</b> is also commonly used to prepare thin metal samples for transmission electron microscopy because the process does not cause the mechanical deformation of surface layers observed with mechanical polishing. Ultra high vacuum (UHV) components are typically electropolished {{in order to have a}} smoother surface for improved vacuum pressures, out-gassing rates, and pumping speed.|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{states at}} {{chemically}} treated SiC surfaces {{have been studied}} by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Charge accumulation on the surface is deduced through a voltage shift observed in the spectra. More charge is observed on <b>electropolished</b> surfaces as compared to untreated (as-received) surfaces. This difference is interpreted {{in terms of the}} <b>electropolished</b> SiC surfaces being more insulating than as-received ones, such that on the former the transport of charge is limited and surface charges cannot come into equilibrium with the bulk semiconductor. Observations of tunneling spectra on SiC prepared by various amounts of hydrogen etching are used to support this interpretation...|$|R

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{performance of}} sandblasted (SB) and smooth fine-drawn (FD) medical-use nitinol wires was {{compared with the}} performance of wires with black oxide (BO) formed in air during their manufacture. Potentiodynamic and ASTM F 746 potentiostatic tests in a 0. 9 % NaCl solution were conducted on wires in their as-received, chemically etched, aged in boiling water, and <b>electropolished</b> states. As-received wires with various surface finishes revealed breakdown potentials in the range from - 100 mV to + 500 mV; similar passive current density, 10 (- 6) A/cm(2); and a wide hysteresis on the reverse scan, demonstrating strong susceptibility to localized corrosion. Chemically etched wires with original black oxide displayed consistent corrosion performance and surpassed, in corrosion resistance, <b>electropolished</b> wires that showed significantly lower breakdown (400 - 700 mV) and localized corrosion potentials (similar to - 50 to + 113 mV). Sandblasted and fine-drawn wires exhibited rather inconsistent corrosion behavior. In potentiodynamic tests these wires could perform with equal probability either on the level of pretreated BO wires or rather similar to as-received wires. Both SB and FD wires revealed low breakdown potentials in the PS regime. SEM analysis performed before tests indicated that sandblasting was not efficient for the complete removal of the original scaling, and fine drawing aggravated the situation, resulting in a persistent scaling that contributed to the inferior corrosion performance. Inclusions (oxides, carbides, and oxidized carbides) inherited from the bulk and retained on <b>electropolished</b> surfaces are the cause of their inferior performance compared to chemically etched surfaces. In <b>electropolished</b> wires corrosion was initiated around inclusions. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. status: publishe...|$|R
