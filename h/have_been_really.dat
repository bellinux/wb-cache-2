The better alternative of breaking through south-east {{out into the open}} valley where their advantages in mobility and airpower could come into play and then head northeast towards the actual objectives seems not to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> considered by the higher headquarters.|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
500|$|Groening also {{expressed}} a {{wish to make}} Simpstasia, a parody of Fantasia; it was never produced, partly {{because it would have}} been too difficult to write a feature-length script. Before his death, Phil Hartman had said he had wished to make a live action Troy McClure film, and several of the show's staff had expressed a desire to help create it. Matt Groening later told Empire that the idea never [...] "got further than enthusiasm", but [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> fun".|$|E

500|$|After Hartman's {{murder in}} 1998, rather than replace {{him with a}} new voice actor, the {{production}} staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other recurring character, Lionel Hutz, from the show. McClure last appeared in the season ten episode [...] "Bart the Mother", which was dedicated to Hartman. Before his death, Hartman had often {{expressed an interest in}} starring in a live-action film about McClure, which would be penned by some of the show's writers. He noted that he was [...] "looking forward to his live-action movie, publicizing [...] Betty Ford appearances." [...] Matt Groening later told Empire that the idea never [...] "got further than enthusiasm", but [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> fun".|$|E
500|$|Megadeth toured {{heavily in}} support of Youthanasia. They started the tour in November 1994, with live {{performances}} in South America. The tour continued in 1995, {{with a number of}} opening acts such as Korn, Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: [...] "So far, the audiences <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> good {{and it seems to me}} that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been". The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters Of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners.|$|E
500|$|Cake {{incorporates}} {{a wide range}} of genres into its music, including country music, Mariachi, new wave, college rock, jazz, funk, Iranian folk music, Brazilian music and hip hop. McCrea himself cites Hank Williams, Tom Zé, the Golden Gate Quartet and Sly and the Family Stone as particular influences. The band is most often noted for three things: the prominence of DiFiore's trumpet lines, McCrea's ironic, sarcastic lyrics, and his [...] "droll, deadpan...monotone" [...] vocals. DiFiore's trumpet work originated with McCrea's desire for a second melodic instrument to go with a song he had written; [...] "A lead guitar playing those lines would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> hokey. I like it when it's a contrapuntal thing, where the guitar is doing one melody, the vocal is doing another melody, and the trumpet plays this third melody. If the music can be transparent enough, you can hear all three at the same time".|$|E

500|$|While Vitalogy {{had shifted}} away from the earlier albums' {{accessible}} compositions and polished production, No Code represented a deliberate break from Tens stadium sound, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rock songs. It stood out {{with its emphasis on}} subtle harmony ("Off He Goes"), Eastern influences ("Who You Are"), and spoken word ("I'm Open"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs [...] "Who You Are" [...] and [...] "In My Tree". Irons stated, [...] "To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> supportive of me doing it, and we've worked some things into a few songs." [...] Vedder said, [...] "We realized that we had an opportunity to experiment." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, The Monthly Film Bulletin described {{the film as}} a [...] "bizarre and grisly Italian effort" [...] that [...] "drags in everything from drug addiction to perpetual youth, crypts to skeletons, but has only a few moments which can claim to be genuinely macabre." [...] The review praised the special effects involving a transition between a young to aged woman and back again, and concluded that [...] "if only story, treatment and performance... had been comparable, the film might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> high in its class." [...] Variety described the film as an [...] "attempt at a horror film which doesn't quite come off {{with only a few}} moments in succeeding in being chilling." [...] The review concluded that the film was [...] "strictly for devotees of the genre" [...] In Italy, La Stampa noted the surprise that the film avoided being banned by Italian censors and that when the film takes on thriller motives, it achieves some effective moments.|$|E
500|$|Watchmen {{was first}} {{mentioned}} publicly in the 1985 Amazing Heroes Preview. When Moore and Gibbons {{turned in the}} first issue of their series to DC, Gibbons recalled, [...] "What really clinched it [...] was [...] Howard Chaykin, who doesn't give praise lightly, and who came up and said, 'Dave what you've done on Watchmen is fuckin' A.. Speaking in 1986, Moore said, [...] "DC backed us all the way [...] and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> supportive about even the most graphic excesses". To promote the series, DC Comics released a limited-edition badge ("button") display card set, featuring characters and images from the series. Ten thousand sets of the four badges, including a replica of the blood-stained smiley face badge worn by the Comedian in the story, were released and sold. Mayfair Games introduced a Watchmen module for its DC Heroes Role-playing Game series that was released before the series concluded. The module, which was endorsed by Moore, adds details to the series' backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966.|$|E

500|$|The band were {{initially}} enthusiastic about performing the suite. An early performance was taped for the San Francisco based television station KQED, featuring just the band, on 28 April 1970. Two major performances {{were at the}} Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music on 27 June and the [...] "Blackhills Garden Party" [...] in Hyde Park, London on 18 July. On both occasions the band were accompanied by the John Alldis Choir and the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble. Later, the band took a full brass section and choir on tour just {{for the purpose of}} performing this piece. However, this caused the tour to lose money, and the band found problems with the hired musicians, which changed from gig to gig as they simply took who was available, which, combined with lack of rehearsal and problems miking up the whole ensemble, made a full live performance more problematic. Reflecting on this, Gilmour said [...] "some of the brass players <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> hopeless". According to Mason, the band arrived at one gig in Aachen, Germany, only to discover they had left the sheet music behind, forcing tour manager Tony Howard to go back to London and get it.|$|E
500|$|Slezak {{stated that}} [...] "Mercedes' musical moments in Season 3 <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> strong" [...] and that [...] "Don't Wanna Lose You" [...] was [...] "no exception"; {{he gave it}} a [...] "B+" [...] grade. Lynch gave an [...] and wrote, [...] "It's been a treat to hear her develop the softer side of her voice." [...] Chaney said that [...] "the number was fine, just not {{particularly}} interesting" [...] {{and gave it a}} [...] "C", but Futterman declared that Mercedes [...] "brings a richness and power and commendable Spanish pronunciation to Gloria Estefan's song". Lynch called the [...] "Bamboleo" [...] / [...] "Hero" [...] mash-up [...] "another Samcedes winner" [...] and gave it a [...] "B", and Chaney said it was a [...] "fun choice" [...] that [...] "would have been a fun number" [...] without the [...] "constant" [...] focus on the hipster boots, and graded it [...] "C+". Sullivan agreed that the boots were better not seen, but that [...] "the song actually worked"; he also noted that [...] "Sam can sound {{a hell of a lot}} like" [...] Iglesias. Futterman also heard the resemblance between Sam and Iglesias, though she said [...] "the performance lacks the fire and sex appeal of the originals". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal described it as [...] "the corniest number in several seasons".|$|E
500|$|Mark Shiel {{explains}} the rising popularity of cult films {{as an attempt}} by cinephiles and scholars to escape the oppressive conformity and mainstream appeal of even independent film, {{as well as a}} lack of condescension in both critics and the films; Academic Donna de Ville says it is a chance to subvert the dominance of academics and cinephiles. [...] According to Xavier Mendik, [...] "academics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> interested in cult movies for quite a while now." [...] Mendik has sought to bring together academic interest and fandom through Cine-Excess, a film festival. I. Q. Hunter states that [...] "it's much easier to be a cultist now, but it is also rather more inconsequential." [...] Citing the mainstream availability of Cannibal Holocaust, Jeffrey Sconce rejects definitions of cult films based on controversy and excess, as they've now become meaningless. [...] Cult films have influenced such diverse industries as cosmetics, music videos, and fashion. [...] Cult films have shown up in less expected places; as a sign of his popularity, a bronze statue of Ed Wood has been proposed in his hometown, and L'Osservatore Romano, the official newspaper of the Holy See, has courted controversy for its endorsement of cult films and pop culture. [...] When cities attempt to renovate neighborhoods, fans have called attempts to demolish iconic settings from cult films [...] "cultural vandalism". [...] Cult films can also drive tourism, even when it is unwanted.|$|E
5000|$|On the content, Healy said: [...] "This {{recording}} process <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> fun, as we've {{had a lot}} {{of these}} songs for a while, and to record them in a completely different mindset with a completely different outlook <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> interesting. (...) There album isn't a haberdashery of past singles and old stuff, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> focused down into a collective piece of work. There's tracks on there that people would have heard live, and older tracks that we've reworked. This album is a soundtrack to our formative years, so it would be dishonest to not put songs on there that we wrote when we were 21, as we want people to connect to it {{in the same way that}} we do." ...|$|R

2500|$|Despite earlier {{comments}} by Carruthers that [...] "Reese never wavered in {{her commitment to}} Bianca" [...] and was not bisexual, Pratt admitted that they were considering on [...] "turning" [...] Reese bisexual. [...] "...if Tamara decided to stay, keeping her on the show as an angry lesbian — with no other lesbian characters on the canvas — {{would be kind of}} insane," [...] said Pratt. [...] "So we thought about making Reese bisexual — kind of an Anne Heche who bounces back and forth — and maybe make her an opportunistic black widow, a real bad girl. And Tamara would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> great at that. But, ultimately, we decided to stick with the message." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions.

But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> tough.

In response, Kool A.D. tweeted that {{he had left the}} band two months prior but had been keeping his departure under wraps. The breakup came after they had signed a record deal and were to release a [...] "proper album", followed by a tour. Dapwell told Spin, “We had a plan to break up around May.

2500|$|The 47 {{questions}} by the six scholars were grouped into three parts: (a) 27 specific questions on existing documents, mostly asking for background and additional {{information such as}} drafts of the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge, which was largely written by Eugenio Pacelli. (b) Fourteen questions dealt with themes of individual volumes, such as the question how Pius viewed {{the role of the}} Church during the war. (c) Six general questions, such as the absence of any anti-communist sentiments in the documents. The disagreement between members over additional documents locked up under the Holy See's 70 year rule resulted in a discontinuation of the Commission in 2001 on friendly terms. Unsatisfied with the findings, Michael Marrus, one of the three Jewish members of the Commission, said the commission [...] "ran up against a brick wall ....
