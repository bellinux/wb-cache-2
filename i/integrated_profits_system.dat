40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>integrated</b> <b>profit</b> offers a {{theoretical}} framework for a holistic analysis of contract goals between agricultural producers’ groups and agri-food sector. The theoretical background applied in this paper is the contract theory. The primary purpose being the identification of vertical coordination forms between producers’ organizations and agri-food sector. Consequently, the specific goal was to recognize price mechanisms in contracts and their analysis {{in the context of}} the <b>integrated</b> <b>profit</b> (only in the field of coordination). The research focused on contracts signed in 2014 between groups operating on poultry market and their first buyers. The survey (collection of primary data) was conducted in the period March-May 2015 through the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview. The main first buyer of producers’ groups were processing plants. Almost 50 % of groups used to sell their outputs through contracts. The fixed price was the most frequently used price formula in contractual relationship. Consequently, more risk were taken by first buyers. The second most popular price formula was the market price on delivery day which can be treated as an unduly burden for producers’ organizations, although it may also support production coordination through price signals...|$|R

But we also argue that, irrespective of that, network operators must look with increased interest at their wholesale revenue stream, i. e., at the possibility that, even if vertically <b>integrated,</b> <b>profits</b> can be reaped from providing access to (potentially rival) retail operators. Moreover, content providers will significantly increase their relevance in the future value chain. Therefore, we argue that revenue sharing mechanisms between content, infrastructure and service providers are likely to (re) emerge...|$|R

Vegetable production {{plays an important role}} in the rural economy of the Red River Delta, the economic centre of northern Vietnam. Field vegetables, however, are often grown in the cool season from October to January, in rotation with wet rice in the cool and the hot season from February to September. As this often causes seasonality of vegetable supply, we designed alternative cropping systems, with the aim to develop year-round supply for big cities such as Hanoi, to increase farmers’ income and to limit pest and disease incidence. Data on profit, labour requirement and costs of pesticide use of 42 vegetable crops grown in the Red River Delta were collected. From these data, five different permanent vegetable production systems were designed based on the following scenarios: (i) increase profit, (ii) reduce labour requirement, (iii) decrease the costs of pesticide use, (iv) maximize crop biodiversity, and (v) select crops with low perishable products, respectively. From May 2007 to May 2009, these systems were tested in the field and compared with the traditional system in which vegetable production in the cool season was rotated with wet rice cultivation in the cool and hot season. Profits of the high <b>profit</b> <b>system</b> and of the low labour requirement system was higher than that of the traditional system.
