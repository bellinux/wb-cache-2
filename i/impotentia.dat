In the case of [...] <b>impotentia</b> coeundi [...] was the possibility of marriage denied, in the case of [...] <b>impotentia</b> generandi [...] according to the Decree on the impotence of 1977. which was no progress for paraplegics, some of whom, despite being fertile, may be unable to achieve a satisfactory erection. The author states: [...] "”It is inhuman that the church to determine that a woman can not love a man who is unable to copulate due to a degree of injury, and that the couple should therefore live celebate and separate lives until the end of their days.

50|$|The Latin term <b>impotentia</b> coeundi {{describes}} simple {{inability to}} insert the penis into the vagina; {{it is now}} mostly replaced by more precise terms, such as erectile dysfunction (ED). The study of erectile dysfunction within medicine is covered by andrology, a sub-field within urology. Research indicates that erectile dysfunction is common, and {{it is suggested that}} approximately 40% of males suffer from erectile dysfunction or impotence, at least occasionally. The condition is also on occasion called phallic impotence. Its antonym or opposite condition is priapism.|$|E
40|$|The use of bulls in {{breeding}} herds {{is regarded}} as a practical, labour-efficient way of producing a calf crop. However, the risks of a poor crop due to unsatisfactory performance of bulls are significant. The causes of sub- or infertility of the bull are classified under the headings <b>Impotentia</b> generandi, referring to a lack of fertile semen, and <b>Impotentia</b> coeundi, or an inability to mate naturally due to physical causes or a lack of libido. Prior screening of bulls to reduce the risks is therefore prudent. Most of the causes of infertility can be detected in a systematic examination of the bull and a representative semen sample. The bull in which no causes of infertility are identified during such an examination is termed breeding sound, which is not a guarantee of fertility but implies a reduced risk of infertility...|$|E
40|$|A healthy 5 -year-old {{child was}} brought to the general {{practitioner}} with priapism that had been observed for a few days, without any other symptoms. Angiography revealed an arteriovenous fistula originating from the left A. dorsalis penis, which was successfully embolised. The diagnosis was ‘high flow’ priapism. A possible cause in the anamnesis was a fall from a swing two weeks before the embolisation. The doctor’s delay was caused by unfamiliarity with this rare disorder; due to the risk of impotence (<b>impotentia</b> coeundi), it is an emergency situation. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Induratio penis plastica (IPP) is a {{degenerative}} disease, {{which consists}} in a thickening of the albuginea tunica of cavernous corpora, {{especially on the}} dorsal aspect. In 25 % of the cases a calcified deposit is present. This disease can determine a bending of the penis, usually upward, pain during erection and <b>impotentia</b> coeundi. It is associated with Dupuytren's disease in 25 % of the cases. IPP is of unknown etiological origin. The more reliable etiological theories are the degenerative one (micro trauma and inflammation) and the autoimmune one. The assessment of IPP is based on story, physical examination, autophotography (which are necessary) and on imaging techniques such as ultrasound, color Doppler, CT, MRI and X-ray in mammography. Color Doppler has demonstrated {{to be the best}} technique because of its cost/benefit and cost/effectiveness ratio. RMI with gadolinium can determine plaques activity but it has a lower cost/benefit ratio. Color Doppler can determine the presence of an IPP plaque and its status, which is size, location, and degree of calcification. Some authors sustain that inflammation can be suggested by the presence of micro vascularization around the plaque. US can be very useful to detect plaque in a size not easily accessible by physical examination (on the dorsal aspect of the penis) and to demonstrate plaques in different evolution moment. Ultrasonography is the better technique to show directly albuginea tunica. Authors illustrate the methodology, which use intra-cavernous injection of prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) to induce erection and its semeiotic findings...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on Holstein bulls kept for service at artificial insemination centers in Hokkaido from 1958 - 1979. Analysis {{was made of the}} reasons for discharge of 312 bulls considered to be no longer serviceable. The following results were obtained : 1) It was revealed that the main reason for disposal was not sexual trouble or seminal vesiculitis but <b>impotentia</b> coeundi followed by undesirable factors, which were the reasons given for more than 60 % of the discharged bulls. It was shown that 10 - 15 % of the bulls used {{at the beginning of the}} year were slaughtered for some reason or other within that year. 2) The lowest age for semen collection was 10 months and the highest age was 12 years and 8 months. Analysis of the bulls entered for service under 24 months revealed that one half of the bulls were a full 17 months of age and that 90 % were entered before 20 months of age. 3) It was shown that approximately one half of the total number of bulls were used for service for 6 years, and those used for 8 years accounted for a quarter of the number. The longest period of service was 16 years. 4) The maximum number of years of survival was 16 years and 10 months. One half of the bulls used for service were discharged at 7 - 8 years while three quarters of them were discharged until 10 years old. 5) A comparison was made between the bulls employed for service during the period 1958 - 1965 and 1966 - 1979,and it was shown that the latter period group entered service later than the former period group. The reason for the delay remains unknown...|$|E
