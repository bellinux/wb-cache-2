5000|$|C.A. River Plate's kit {{is similar}} to that used by River Plate F.C., its predecessor, which {{dissolved}} in 1929. C.A. River Plate's away kit is sometimes a sky blue jersey, black shorts and socks. This kit was adopted by the Uruguay national football team in 1910 as a homage to the disbanded River Plate F.C.

Thus, the worldwide known [...] "celeste" [...] jersey was taken by the national team from the club away kit. Before 1910 Uruguay wore several jerseys including dark blue, <b>green,</b> <b>striped</b> <b>white</b> and sky blue, similar to that of Argentina among others.|$|E
