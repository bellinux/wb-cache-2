40|$|Three {{dimensional}} printing, or additive manufacturing, {{allows the}} production of customized scaffolds that can enhance craniofacial reconstruction and regeneration. It {{can be achieved by}} several techniques, including selective laser sintering, electron beam <b>melting,</b> <b>fused</b> deposition <b>melting,</b> <b>fused</b> filament fabrication, as well as extrusion and laser-assisted bioprinting of cells. 3 D-printed constructs can take the form of nonresorbable solid form prosthesis or porous degradable scaffolds that can be resorbed over time and replaced by native tissues. The later can be considered the more desirable outcome but it is also more challenging to achieve. 3 D-printed constructs have been used in a variety of oro-dental and craniofacial applications, including vertical bone augmentation, mandibular, and skull defect reconstruction, periodontal regeneration, and temporomandibular joint replacement.

Tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5%. Tesla also explained that apart from the P90D the Model S has its main battery conductor protected by a fuse rated for 1,300A and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a <b>fuse</b> <b>melts.</b> To reduce this uncertainty Tesla has for the P90D introduced Inconel battery contactors and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse, which monitors the current at the millisecond level, cuts the power with [...] "extreme precision and certainty" [...] and has a rating of 1,500A.|$|R

5000|$|In {{electrical}} distribution, a {{fuse cutout}} or cut-out fuse {{is a combination}} of a fuse and a switch, used in primary overhead feeder lines and taps to protect distribution transformers from current surges and overloads. An overcurrent caused by a fault in the transformer or customer circuit will cause the <b>fuse</b> to <b>melt,</b> disconnecting the transformer from the line.

5000|$|However, {{if there}} is a fault on the {{secondary}} grid, the network protector is not designed to open its contacts up. The secondary fault will continue to be fed from the primary side of the system. In some cases, networks are designed with cable limiters (like <b>fuses)</b> to <b>melt</b> and disconnect the secondary fault under the right conditions. In other cases, the utility lets cable 'burn clear', in which case the fault is allowed to remain fed until the cables fuse, then the fault is isolated.|$|R
5000|$|Distribution lines use two systems, either grounded-wye ("Y" [...] on {{electrical}} schematics) or delta (Greek letter [...] "Δ" [...] on electrical schematics). A delta system {{requires only}} a conductor {{for each of}} the three phases. A grounded-wye system requires a fourth conductor, the neutral, whose source is the center of the [...] "Y" [...] and is grounded. However, [...] "spur lines" [...] branching off the main line to provide power to side streets often carry only one or two phase wires, plus the neutral. A wide range of standard distribution voltages are used, from 2,400 V to 34,500 V. On poles near a service drop, there is a pole-mounted step-down transformer to provide the required mains voltage. In North America, service drops provide 240/120V split-phase power for residential and light commercial service, using cylindrical single-phase transformers. In Europe and most other countries, 230V three phase (230Y400) service drops are used. The transformer's primary is connected to the distribution line through protective devices called fuse cutouts. In the event of an overload, the <b>fuse</b> <b>melts</b> and the device pivots open to provide a visual indication of the problem. They can also be opened manually by linemen using a long insulated rod called a hot stick to disconnect the transformer from the line.|$|R

40|$|For {{high power}} IC chips, as device size inevitably decreases, the wire {{diameter}} unfortunately must decrease {{due to the}} need of finer pitch wires. <b>Fusing</b> or <b>melting</b> of wirebonds thus increasingly becomes one of the potential failure issues for such IC’s. Experiments were performed under transient loads on dummy packages having aluminum, gold, or copper wires of different dimensions. A finite element model was constructed that correlates very well with the observed maximum operating currents for such wirebonds under actual experimental test conditions. A qualitative observation of typical current profiles, as fusing conditions were approached, was that current would reach a maximum value {{very early in the}} pulse, and then fall gradually. One goal achieved through the modeling was to show that the current in the wire falls with time due to the heating of the wire material. Correspondingly, the wire reaches the melting temperature not at the peak current but rather at the end of pulse. Further, modeling shows that knowledge of external resistance and inductance of the experimental set up are highly significant in determining the details of a fusing event, but if known along with the temperaturedependent wire properties, the simulation can predict the correct voltage and current response of the part with 2 % error. On the other hand, lack of external circuit characteristics may lead to completely incorrect results. For instance, the assumption that current is constant until the wire heats to fusing temperature, or that current and temperature both rise monotonically to maximum values until the wire fuses, are almost certain to be wrong. The work has been carried out for single pulse events as well as pulse trains. Key words: Bond wire <b>fusing,</b> wire <b>melting,</b> <b>fusing</b> current I...|$|R

This treatability study was later extended to include all of Pit 1 and was performed to support a possible Interim Record of Decision or removal action for closure of {{one or more of the}} seepage pits and trenches beginning as early as FY 1997. This treatability study was carried out to establish the field-scale technical performance of ISV for (1) attaining the required depth, nominally 15 ft, to incorporate source contamination within and beneath the pits; (2) demonstrating field capability for the overlap of melt settings which will be necessary to achieve <b>fused,</b> <b>melted</b> segments of the source contamination; (3) demonstrating off-gas handling technology for accommodating and minimizing the volatilization of {sup 137 }Cs; (4) demonstrating adequate site characterization techniques to predict ISV melting kinetics, processing temperatures, and product durability; and (5) promoting public acceptance of ISV technology by demonstrating its safety, implementability, site impacts, and air emissions and by coordinating the treatability study within the regulatory closure process. In April 1996 an expulsion of an estimated 10 % of the 196 Mg (216 tons) melt body occurred resulting in significant damage to ISV equipment and, ultimately, led to an indefinite suspension of further ISV operations at Pit 1.

To make this easier for the employees at Ericsson Power Solutions a guideline has been developed. Questions the employees had regarding circuit protection have been answered.

50|$|Power systems contain {{protective}} devices to prevent {{injury or damage}} during failures. The quintessential protective device is the fuse. When the current through a fuse exceeds a certain threshold, the <b>fuse</b> element <b>melts,</b> producing an arc across the resulting gap that is then extinguished, interrupting the circuit. Given that fuses can be built as the weak point of a system, fuses are ideal for protecting circuitry from damage. Fuses however have two problems: First, after they have functioned, fuses must be replaced as they cannot be reset. This can prove inconvenient if the fuse is at a remote site or a spare fuse is not on hand. And second, fuses are typically inadequate as the sole safety device in most power systems as they allow current flows well in excess of that that would prove lethal to a human or animal.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{experimentally}} examine the importance of safety devices (pressure valve and <b>melting</b> <b>fuse)</b> on propane bottles for consumer use (5 – 6 kg propane). The bottles tested included construction types based on composite (PK 5, two different types), aluminum (PA 6), and steel (P 6). Bottles were tested with and without safety devices. The tests were made as a comparative study. Bottles were exposed to a pool fire with a {{rate of heat release}} of approximately 420 kW, resulting in a temperature of approximately 800 - 1000 °C and a heat flux of approximately 50 kW/m 2 towards bottom and leeward side of each bottle. The results suggest that propane bottles for consumer use (5 – 6 kg) should be equipped with safety devices (pressure valve or <b>melting</b> <b>fuse).</b> Also, recommendations concerning location as well as anchoring bottles should be considered. Proposals for future work include studies on the function of safety devices for bottles laying on its side or upside down, reaction forces during depressurization and the risk of bottle overturn.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the work in}} practically determining how frequently used aerosol- and propane containers are affected at fire exposure from flammable liquids. The tested aerosol- and propane containers were chosen due to common appearance in ordinary grocery- and hardware stores. The tested aerosol containers had a volume range between 15 - 400 ml and the propane containers were filled with 0. 35, 0. 45, 5 and 6 kg of propane. The exposing heat source was burning liquid of heptane which corresponds to fire properties of common available flammable liquids that are for sale in ordinary stores. The study shows that the aerosol containers which are exposed to flames from a flammable liquid explodes within some minutes and develops often fire clouds within {{the vicinity of the}} exploding object. Minor aerosol containers, 15 - 400 ml, normally divide it selves into a few pieces when they explode. When storing several of minor aerosol containers together, unexploded aerosol containers can be expected to act as missiles as adjacent containers explode as they are exposed to flames from flammable liquids. In enclosures, the explosion also results in a significant blast wave. Fire exposed propane containers, named PC 5 (5 kg) and PA 6 (6 kg), releases pressure in different ways. The PC 5 container is made of composite material that seems to be partly combusted at heat exposure with following leakage through the composite material, pressure release through the safety valve cannot be determined to be the only way of releasing pressure at heat exposure. The aluminum container (PA 6) is designed both with a safety valve and a <b>melting</b> <b>fuse.</b> At one of the trials the safety valve opened briefly with a following release of the <b>melting</b> <b>fuse.</b> The opening of the <b>melting</b> <b>fuse</b> resulted in an outflow and pressure release of propane that initially developed a jet flame of 7 – 10 meters length.
