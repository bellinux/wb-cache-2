25|$|Travis {{was born}} as Dickson Cornelius Savage on 6 April 1884 in Opotiki, New Zealand. He {{was one of}} nine children, being the fifth in the brood. His father, James Savage, {{a former member of}} the New Zealand Armed Constabulary, had {{migrated}} to New Zealand from Ireland and was employed as a farmer. His mother, Frances (née O'Keefe), had originally come from Sydney, Australia. As a child Dickson Savage attended schools at Opotiki and Otara but only completed the first four years of his education before his family took him out of education to work on the farm. He acquired various farming skills, but showed a particular talent for <b>horse</b> <b>breaking</b> for which he earned a degree of local fame.|$|E

2500|$|A {{large number}} of horses were needed for a roundup. Each cowboy would require three to four fresh horses {{in the course of}} a day's work. Horses {{themselves}} were also rounded up. It was common practice in the west for young foals to be born of tame mares, but allowed to grow up [...] "wild" [...] in a semi-feral state on the open range. There were also [...] "wild" [...] herds, often known as Mustangs. Both types were rounded up, and the mature animals tamed, a process called <b>horse</b> <b>breaking,</b> or [...] "bronco-busting," [...] (var. [...] "bronc busting") usually performed by cowboys who specialized in training horses. In some cases, extremely brutal methods were used to tame horses, and such animals tended to never be completely reliable. However, other cowboys became aware of the need to treat animals in a more humane fashion and modified their horse training methods, often re-learning techniques used by the vaqueros, particularly those of the Californio tradition. Horses trained in a gentler fashion were more reliable and useful for a wider variety of tasks.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} summer of 1169, Gerald took taifa and city of Badajoz {{after a long}} siege, but the {{garrison}} took refuge in the citadel, the alcazaba, the siege of which continued. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region {{at the expense of}} both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve his nominal vassal. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of León, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his <b>horse,</b> <b>breaking</b> his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Gerald was captured by the Leonese majordomo, Fernán Ruiz de Castro, called el Castellano ("the Castilian"). He was an important person at court, who for a while held the highest military post in the capital (tenente turris Legionis, [...] "possessing the tower of León"). He was the king's brother-in-law, being married to Stephanie the Unfortunate, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VII by his second mistress, Urraca Fernández, and thus a half-sister of Ferdinand II. After the mêlée the Leonese had control of the town and the alcazaba, which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Ferdinand succeeded in gaining the valley of the upper Limia and the regions of Toroño (around Tuy), Capraria (around Verín), and Lobarzana (around Chaves) from Afonso in exchange for his release. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom. Ferdinand retained Cáceres, but Trujillo, Montánchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfragüe he gave to Fernán Ruiz.|$|E

50|$|In {{thoroughbred}} horse racing, a false start {{occurs when a}} <b>horse</b> <b>breaks</b> through the starting gates before they open. There is usually no penalty; the horse is simply reloaded into the gate. In some events, a <b>horse</b> who <b>breaks</b> through the starting gates is disqualified. A notable example was the 2006 Preakness Stakes when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro broke through the gate early; he was reloaded and the race was started properly. The 1993 Grand National was void because the recall flag to signal a false start was not unfurled, so that most jockeys continued to race.|$|R

50|$|Bronc riding, either bareback bronc or saddle bronc competition, is a rodeo {{event that}} {{involves}} a rodeo participant riding {{on a horse}} (sometimes called a bronc or bronco), that attempts to throw or buck off the rider. Originally based on the necessary <b>horse</b> <b>breaking</b> skills of a working cowboy, the event is now a highly stylized competition that utilizes horses that often are specially bred for strength, agility, and bucking ability. It is recognized by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and the International Professional Rodeo Association (IPRA). Two organizations that strongly promote the event in the United States are the World's Toughest Rodeo (WTR) and the Championship Roughstock Challenge (CRC).|$|E
5000|$|The effects {{two races}} on firm ground meant that Cyllene's {{connections}} abandoned {{plans to run}} him {{for a third time}} at the meeting (in the Hardwicke Stakes) and the colt was given an extended rest. In autumn there was much anticipation of a meeting between Cyllene and the Triple Crown winner Flying Fox, with Charles Day Rose being reported as saying that he [...] "looked forward to beating" [...] the outstanding three-year-old in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket. When Cyllene returned to serious training however, it was decided that the risk of the <b>horse</b> <b>breaking</b> down was too great and he was retired to stud without racing again.|$|E
5000|$|Timing is critical. From a standstill, a rider {{will put}} his horse into a gallop {{from the box}} shortly after the calf leaves the chute, so that the horse saves {{valuable}} seconds by being at near-full speed the moment the barrier releases. However, if the rider mistimes his cue to the horse and the <b>horse</b> <b>breaks</b> the barrier before it releases, a 10-second penalty {{will be added to}} his time.
