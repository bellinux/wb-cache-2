It explores <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> how <b>Jewish</b> theology {{should and}} does cohere with central features of both process theology and Robert S. Hartman’s formal axiology.

50|$|A very {{positive}} aspect of Joseph Rabinowitz approach to sharing {{his faith in}} Yeshua with his Jewish people {{was the way he}} sought to contextualize his message and expression of faith. The use of the languages of the Jews, Hebrew and Yiddish were invaluable, plus <b>his</b> deep <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jewish</b> belief and liturgy also aided both his instruction and worship. He was an eloquent speaker that made his preaching accessible and he made a very direct appeal to his listeners to put their trust in Yeshua for full salvation, that was to be found in him alone who was both Messiah and Lord. To facilitate the work Rabinowitz ran a printing press and this enabled him to produce his own literature, such as a suitable Passover Haggadah for their use.|$|R
50|$|Abarbanel's Jewish {{predecessors}} in {{the realm}} of philosophy did not receive the same tolerance at his hands as the Christians did. Men like Albalag, Palquera, Gersonides, Narboni, and others, were denounced by Abarbanel as infidels and misleading guides for assuming a comparatively liberal standpoint in religio-philosophical questions. Abarbanel was essentially an opponent of philosophy, despite his authority on the subject, because <b>his</b> entire <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Jewish</b> religion was based on God’s revelation in Jewish history. There is a common misconception that Abarbanel agreed with Maimonidean views; while sometimes their ideas matched up, most of Abarbanel’s thoughts strongly disagreed with those of Maimonides.|$|R

Wamba was a political realist, however, and <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the vital <b>Jewish</b> place in the economic structure of the provinces allowed him to reach a reconciliation with them. In 680, Wamba was dethroned {{as a result of}} a conspiracy headed by Erwig, one of the nobles, with the assistance of the Metropolitan of Toledo. Besides persecuting the partisans of Wamba, Erwig made new laws against the Jews, subjecting the converts to minute regulations assuring their religious faith. These laws, although severe, were less so than those of Receswinth.|$|R
