50|$|Caplan {{syndrome}} occurs only {{in patients}} with both RA and pneumoconiosis related to mining <b>dust</b> (<b>coal,</b> asbestos, silica). The condition occurs in miners (especially those working in anthracite coal-mines), asbestosis, silicosis and other pneumoconioses. There is probably also a genetic predisposition, and smoking {{is thought to be}} an aggravating factor.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} IPF is unknown but certain {{environmental}} factors and exposures {{have been shown}} to increase the risk of getting IPF. Cigarette smoking is the best recognized and most accepted risk factor for IPF, and increases the risk of IPF by about twofold. Other environmental and occupation exposures such as exposure to metal dust, wood <b>dust,</b> <b>coal</b> dust, silica, stone dust, biologic dusts coming from hay dust or mold spores or other agricultural products, and occupations related to farming/livestock have also been shown to increase the risk for IPF. There is some evidence that viral infections may be associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrotic lung diseases.|$|E
50|$|Coal dust {{is not as}} fibrogenic as in silica <b>dust.</b> <b>Coal</b> {{dust that}} enters the lungs can neither be {{destroyed}} nor removed by the body. The particles are engulfed by resident alveolar or interstitial macrophages and remain in the lungs, residing in the connective tissue or pulmonary lymph nodes. Coal dust provides a sufficient stimulus for the macrophage to release various products, including enzymes, cytokines, oxygen radicals, and fibroblast growth factors, which are important in the inflammation and fibrosis of CWP. Aggregations of carbon-laden macrophages can be visualized under a microscope as granular, black areas. In serious cases, the lung may grossly appear black. These aggregations can cause inflammation and fibrosis, {{as well as the}} formation of nodular lesions within the lungs. The centers of dense lesions may become necrotic due to ischemia, leading to large cavities within the lung.|$|E
50|$|Ignited {{methane gas}} {{is a common}} source of explosions in coal mines, which in turn can {{initiate}} more extensive <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosions. For this reason, rock dusts such as limestone dust are spread throughout coal mines to diminish the chances of <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosions {{as well as to}} limit the extent of potential explosions, in a process known as rock <b>dusting.</b> <b>Coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosions can also begin independently of methane gas explosions. Frictional heat and sparks generated by mining equipment can ignite both methane gas and <b>coal</b> <b>dust.</b> For this reason, water is often used to cool rock-cutting sites.|$|R
50|$|Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, {{or black}} lung disease, {{is caused by}} inhaling <b>coal</b> <b>dust,</b> {{typically}} <b>dust</b> produced in <b>coal</b> mining. Government agencies in the United States have set exposure limit guidelines for <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> inhalation.|$|R
30|$|Proper rock <b>dusting</b> in {{underground}} <b>coal</b> mines {{can effectively}} eliminate the two conditions for <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> {{to participate in}} explosion. The inert rock dust can function as isolator, physical heat sink and chemical energy absorber. The heavier rock dust applied over the lighter <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> can serve as an isolator to prevent the <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> underneath from becoming easily airborne. The isolator {{is most likely to}} function only when the explosion front is propagate at a relatively low velocity. Without suspending the deposited <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> into the mine air, it is very unlikely for the lower explosive limit of <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> to be reached.|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{a second}} station, Walsall B, began soon after nationalisation. The station was officially opened on 30 September 1949. Comprising six cooling towers and six chimneys, with a total output of 191MW, (one {{of the largest and}} high output power plants, when it was first {{operational}} in 1949) the station burned 'slack' coal, which consisted of fragments of coal and coal <b>dust.</b> <b>Coal</b> was delivered by road, rail and canal. Water from the canal was used for cooling. The station closed in October 1982 after 33 years in use, and the stub of railway serving it west of Ryecroft Junction, was closed at the same time. The power station was closed as it was no longer deemed to be efficient, when much newer coal power stations built later in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s with six or eight cooling towers can generate up to ten times more electricity as technology improves with bigger generators becoming more apparent on less coal consumption i.e. 2000MW+ than Birchills could.|$|E
50|$|Coal ash {{contains}} many toxic substances that can negatively impact the human body. Employees working in {{coal-fired power plants}} or near coal ash waste sites are at major risk of inhaling coal ash <b>dust.</b> <b>Coal</b> ash dust is generally known as particulate matter (particle pollution) and the dust particles can harm the lungs when inhaled. Workers increase their risk of harmful side effects when they inhale the smallest coal ash dust particles. The smaller the coal ash dust particle, the deeper the particle will be inhaled into the lungs. As a result, the toxic particles can inflame the lungs causing severe damage to the body. Furthermore, coal ash dust can enter the body through the nose causing damage to the brain directly. However, regardless of particle entry, the toxicity from coal ash can cause harm to major body parts such as the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach and intestines. Thus, individuals working near coal ash surface impoundments or landfills {{are at increased risk}} for many serious health problems.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOn the {{background}} of topic dust control and reduction in mining a theoretical model of dust origination during processes of mechanical rock cutting was developed. This theoretical model was validated by practical investigation on experimental cutting test equipment. The result of numerous tests by the shearing blade and bottom blade of the plow on the anthracite coal shows a clear relation between the anthracite coal dust appearance and the cutting parameters e. g. rake angle, cutting depth and so on.

Tests of explosion severity and flammability limit were conducted by using the Siwek 20 L vessel and influences of ignition energy, <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> calorific value, <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> concentration and inertant composition were taken into account. The increase of inerting results with ignition energy is followed by an approximate stabilization when ignition energy exceeds 5 kJ.

40|$|Coal {{reservoirs}} in the Qinshui Basin {{are characterized}} by high thermal evolution degree, low permeability, low reservoir pressure, lower gas saturation and strong heterogeneity, so its coalbed methane (CBM) development is quite difficult. In this paper, the development practice of high-rank CBM horizontal wells in the Fanzhuang‚ÄìZhengzhuang Block was analyzed in terms of geological and engineering factors to clarify the productivity influencing factors, suitable geological conditions and potential tapping countermeasures of multi-lateral horizontal wells. It is shown that {{the reasons for the}} low development efficiency of multi-lateral horizontal wells are divided into three types. The first one is geological factor, such as encountering low CBM content areas or faults. The second is engineering factor, such as drilling fluid plugging, drilling collapse, drainage collapse and <b>dust</b> <b>coal</b> blockage. The third is the combination of both factors. It is concluded that encountering low CBM content areas and faults, collapse and blockage are the main reasons for the low production of multi-lateral horizontal wells in the Zhengzhuang‚ÄìFanzhuang Block, with the CBM content higher than 20 ¬†m 3 /t, the ratio of critical desorption pressure and reservoir pressure higher than 0. 7 and vitrinite reflectance (Ro) higher than 3. 8. The prerequisite for an open-hole horizontal well in this area to produce CBM at a high rate is that the well lies in the tensile stress zone. Finally, the countermeasures to tap the potential of some inefficient wells were put forward. First, the inefficient wells which are blocked with <b>dust</b> <b>coal</b> or collapsed in the later stage should be stimulated based on classifications. And second, it is necessary to explore new types of horizontal wells so as to deal with borehole collapse and continue the operation in the later stage by using tree-like roof horizontal wells, single-lateral horizontal wells with casing or screen completion and fish-bone horizontal wells...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{negative}} effects from activity on coal yard location is air pollutant by coal <b>dust.</b> <b>Coal</b> dust that inhaled can caused the worker have lung function disorder risk. There are two prominent of lung function disorder that is restriction and obstruction. But there are also mixed disorder that compounding between restriction and obstruction. The purpose {{of this research was}} to analyze the correlation between total and inhaled coal dust amount and individual characteristic with lung function disorder of coal yard workers at PLTU X Jepara. This research was an observational study with cross sectional approach. The subjects of this study were all of workers in coal yard location by 40 persons as respondents. The result of this research showed that lung function disorder that happened in to the workers was restriction lung function disorder, which was from 35 respondents there were 25, 7 % were normal, 71, 4 % with light restriction and 2, 9 % with average restriction. Result from spyrometer tests showed that there was no obstruction and mixed lung function disorder for workers. The result of total dust amount in 5 locations using High Volume Sampler showed was dust amount is bigger than Threshold Limit Value. Based on Rank-spearman statistical tests, it was obtained the value of total dust amount (p-value = 0. 001), and from the Pearson correlation test of inhaled dust amount (p-value = 0. 000), smoking habit (p-value = 0. 000), age (p-value = 0. 533), nutrient status (p-value = 0. 101) and exercise habit (p-value = 0. 894). The conclusion of this study, there was a significant correlation between total dust amounts, inhaled dust amount and smoking habit with lung function disorder, whereas there was no correlation between age, nutrient status and exercise habit with lung function disorder...|$|E
40|$|The {{machine-mounted}} continuous {{respirable dust}} monitor (MMCRDM) is a fixed-location area sampling device developed for possible {{use at the}} working face of an underground coal mine. This device, based on proprietary technology known as the tapered element oscillating microbalance, has evolved {{over the past eight}} years through a cooperative effort of the former Bureau of Mines, MSHA, and the Rupprecht & Patashnick Company in Albany, NY. The capability to measure respirable coal mine dust levels on a continuous basis, rather than depending solely on periodic samples obtained from the traditional coal mine dust samplers, has been a goal in the mining industry for nearly two decades. Recently, an extensive series of laboratory and underground tests was conducted by NIOSH with the cooperation of MSHA and coal operators to test the performance of the MMCRDM In preliminary laboratory testing, the MMCRDM seemed to work well. However, in every underground test, when compared to reference samplers placed close to the inlet, the MMCRDM failed to meet the 25 % accuracy criterion specified in the contract under which it was developed. Two reasons explain this failure: First, in most tests the bias (the relative discrepancy between the average MMCRDM concentration and the average reference sampler concentration) was too great. Second, the variability of the samplers used for reference comparison was too large. Finally, the underground testing of the MMCRDMs showed that they are quite unreliable at this stage of development. In the majority of mine tests, no more than 10 shifts of data were taken before the MMCRDM failed to function properly. Major breakdowns, requiring the return of the MMCRDM to the factory for repairs, occurred on average every 28 days. To be considered mine-worthy, MMCRDM reliability must be substantially improved.

40|$|In This Chapter [Methane {{ignition}} as initiation {{source for}} much larger secondary <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosions Rock dusting requirements to prevent <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosions Dangers of hybrid mixtures of methane and coal dust] Although methane explosions are dangerous, those that involve <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> {{are even more}} so. If exploding methane disperses and ignites the <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> that has accumulated on the mine ribs and floor, the burning <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> immeasurably increases {{the strength of the}} explosion. Such methane-dust explosions are prevented by inerting the <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> in a way that prevents the exploding methane from igniting it. This chapter discusses the dust hazard and how it is pre-vented in U. S. coal mines. METHANE IGNITION AS INITIATION SOURCE FOR MUCH LARGER SECONDARY <b>COAL</b> <b>DUST</b> EXPLOSIONS The typical scenario for coal mine explosions starts with the ignition of a flammable methane-air atmosphere near the face. The turbulent winds from the primary methane explosion then disperse the <b>coal</b> <b>dust.</b> If there is insufficient rock dust (usually limestone), a secondary <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosion then propagates throughout large sections of the mine. These scenarios have been studied extensively at the Bruceton Experimental Mine (BEM) and the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM) of the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory. The minimum quantity of methane required to initiate a <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosion was studied in 1930 in the BEM [Rice et al. 1933; Nagy 1981] and then later in the LLEM, whose cross-sectional area (130 ft 2) is over twice that of the BEM [Sapko et al. 1987 a]. Studies conducted in the BEM closely simulated conditions that existed in operating mines in the early 20 th century. The later tests in the 20 -ft-wide entries of the LLEM simulated the geometries of modern mines with advanced roof support technology. The data from the BEM tests show that 13 ft 3 was the minimum quantity of methane at the face that, when ignited, would disperse and ignite <b>coal</b> <b>dust.</b> In the BEM, this amount of methane was mixed with air to form a total flammable volume of about 140 ft 3 of a 9 % methane-in-air mix-ture. In the wider entries of the LLEM, about 37 ft 3 of methane was required to disperse pure <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> and start a self-sustained <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosion. This amount of methane was mixed wit...|$|R
