5|$|The Antemoro figure {{among the}} more recent {{settlers}} {{on the island of}} Madagascar. They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (sombili), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities, but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.|$|E

25|$|According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews {{were killed}} in the overall operations, and 50 {{fortified}} towns and 985 villages were razed to the ground, with many more Jews dying of famine and disease. The Jewish communities of Judea were devastated to an extent which some scholars <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> genocide. Schäfer, suggested that Dio likely exaggerated his numbers. On the other hand, Cotton considered Dio's figures highly plausible, in light of accurate Roman census declarations. In addition, many Judean war captives were sold into slavery.|$|E
25|$|Many {{objects in}} fiction {{follow the example}} of false antecedents or false consequents. For example, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is based on an {{imaginary}} book. In the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's characters name the Red Book of Westmarch as the source material for The Lord of the Rings, which they <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> translation. But the Red Book of Westmarch is a fictional document that chronicles events in an imaginary world. One might imagine a different translation, by another author.|$|E
25|$|The authors say the {{previous}} Fourth Turning in the US {{began with the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929 and climaxed {{with the end of}} World War II. The G.I. Generation (which they call a Hero archetype, born 1901 to 1924) came of age during this era. They say their confidence, optimism, and collective outlook epitomized the mood of that era. The authors assert the Millennial Generation (which they also <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Hero archetype, born 1981 to 2004) show many similar traits to those of the G.I. youth, which they describe as including: rising civic engagement, improving behavior, and collective confidence.|$|E

25|$|Kurowski's {{works were}} {{published}} in Germany since 1958, but remained inaccessible to English-speaking audiences. J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, whom Smelser and Davies <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> leading publisher of war-romancing literature, released Kurowski's two popular works, Panzer Aces and Infantry Aces, in the U.S. in 1992 and 1994. In their analysis of the series, which also included Panzer Aces II and Panzer Aces III, Smelser and Davies write:Kurowski gives the readers an almost heroic version of the German soldier, guiltless of any war crimes, actually incapable of such behavior. (...) Sacrifice and humility are his hallmarks. Their actions win them medals, badges and promotions, yet they remain indifferent to these awards. The cover art evokes heroism, determination and might of the German soldier and his weapons.|$|E
25|$|The Bar Kokhba revolt {{resulted}} in the extensive depopulation of Judean communities, {{more so than the}} First Jewish–Roman War of 70 CE. According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews perished in the war and many more died of hunger and disease. In addition, many Judean war captives were sold into slavery. The Jewish communities of Judea were devastated to an extent which some scholars <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> genocide. Roman casualties were also considered heavy - XXII Deiotariana was disbanded after serious losses. In addition, some historians argue that Legio IX Hispana's disbandment in the mid-2nd century could also have been a result of this war. In an attempt to erase any memory of Judea or Ancient Israel, Emperor Hadrian wiped the name off the map and replaced it with Syria Palaestina.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, the French scholar Joseph de Guignes {{became the}} first to propose {{a link between the}} Huns and the Xiongnu people, who were {{northern}} neighbours of China in the 3rd century BC. Since Guignes' time, considerable scholarly effort has been devoted to investigating such a connection. However, there is no scholarly consensus on a direct connection between the dominant element of the Xiongnu and that of the Huns. Priscus, a 5th-century Roman diplomat and Greek historian, mentions that the Huns had a language of their own; little of it has survived and its relationships have mainly been considered the Turkic or Mongolic languages. Numerous other ethnic groups were included under Attila the Hun's rule, including very many speakers of Gothic, which some modern scholars <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lingua franca of the Empire. Their main military technique was mounted archery.|$|E

25|$|Russia and India {{have decided}} not to renew the 1971 Indo-Soviet Peace and Friendship Treaty and have sought to follow what both <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> more pragmatic, less ideological relationship. Russian President Yeltsin's visit to India in January 1993 helped cement this new relationship. Ties have grown {{stronger}} with President Vladimir Putin's 2004 visit. The pace of high-level visits has since increased, as has discussion of major defence purchases. Russia, is working {{for the development of the}} Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, that will be capable of producing 1000 MW of electricity. Gazprom, is working for the development of oil and natural gas, in the Bay of Bengal. India and Russia, have collaborated extensively, on space technology. Other areas of collaboration include software, ayurveda, etc. India and Russia, have set a determination in increasing trade to $10 billion. Cooperation between clothing manufacturers of the two countries continues to strengthen. India and Russia signed an agreement on joint efforts to increase investment and trade volumes in the textile industry in both countries. In signing the document included representatives of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs of Textile and Light Industry Council and apparel exports of India (AEPC). A co-operation agreement provides, inter alia, exchange of technology and know-how in textile production. For this purpose, a special Commission on Affairs textile (Textile Communication Committee). Counter-terrorism techniques are also in place between Russia and India. In 2007 President Vladimir Putin was guest of honour at Republic Day celebration on 26 January 2007. 2008, has been declared by both countries as the Russia-India Friendship Year. Bollywood films are quite popular in Russia. The Indian public sector oil company ONGC bought Imperial Energy Corporation in 2008. In December 2008, during President Medvedev's visit, to New Delhi, India and Russia, signed a nuclear energy co-operation agreement. In March, 2010, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed an additional 19 pacts with India which included civilian nuclear energy, space and military co-operation and the final sale of Admiral Gorshkov (Aircraft Carrier) along with MiG-29K fighter jets.|$|E

500|$|Hershiser retired {{the side}} in {{order in the}} fourth, fifth and sixth innings.

In order to contest Hershiser with a left-handed batter, with runners on first and second and one out, he substituted rookie Francisco Meléndez (batting [...]190) for Robby Thompson (batting [...]266), which resulted in an inning-ending double play. That day, USA Today claimed Dodgers' manager Tommy Lasorda had determined his postseason pitching rotation with Hershiser slated for game one of the NLCS, but Lasorda denied having any plan {{in place for a}} playoff appearance that had not yet been clinched.
