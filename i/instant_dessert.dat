By the 1970s, Bird's had doubled the market for <b>instant</b> <b>desserts.</b> After a lull in popularity during the 1980s, a revival campaign, featuring Wallace & Gromit, was run in 1999.

50|$|Pre-gelatinized starch is used {{to thicken}} <b>instant</b> <b>desserts,</b> {{allowing}} the food to thicken {{with the addition of}} cold water or milk. Similarly, cheese sauce granules (such as in Macaroni and Cheese or lasagna) or gravy granules may be thickened with boiling water without the product going lumpy. Commercial pizza toppings containing modified starch will thicken when heated in the oven, keeping them on top of the pizza, and then become runny when cooled.|$|R

50|$|Knighton is {{situated}} {{close to the}} Staffordshire/Shropshire border in undulating agricultural land featuring a not inconsiderable number of endemic hardwood trees. Another feature is the Shropshire Union Canal, which passes through the hamlet {{at the point of}} a cutting and substantial embankment. Adjacent to the canal is the Knighton Reservoir, the function of which is to replenish its waters. Although fundamentally agricultural there is a food processing and packaging plant belonging to the food manufacturer Knighton Foods Ltd which processes and packs a wide range of products including Hot Beverages, <b>Instant</b> <b>Desserts,</b> Custards and Whips, Bakery Ingredients, Instant Milks, Coffee Creamers and Fat Powders. The factory maintains a social club, the facilities of which are available to the wider community for social events. The club's football pitch is home ground to the amateur Sunday football team Woodseaves FC, from the nearby village of Woodseaves, who play in the Stafford and District Sunday League.|$|R

40|$|The {{extraction}} {{and processing}} of starch from agricultural commodities {{is one of}} the most important agro-industries world wide. By the early 1990 s, global production of starch probably exceeded 38 million metric tons (mmt) per year for a market value of at least $ 11 billion. In Asia, starch production was about 16 mmt and demand for starch by food and non-food industries was growing by 5 - 10 percent per year. Starch is very versatile and has a wide variety of uses. Almost all major industries have found some uses for starch. In food industries, starch is used to impart “functional” properties to processed foods such as thickening, binding, filling, and taste. Starch is used in canned soups, <b>instant</b> <b>desserts,</b> ice creams, processed meats, sauces, and bakery products. Starch can also be converted into sugar. It is used to manufacture sweeteners and syrups and to feed enzymes for the manufacture of MSG, a popular taste enhancer. Uses of starch in non-food industries are just as numerous. Major users include the textile, paper, plywood, and adhesive industries. Starch is also used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. Starch is not a uniform commodity, however.

40|$|AbstractConsistent {{evidence}} {{exist on}} the harmful health effects of industrial trans fatty acids (TFA). In order to have accurate data on TFA intake and implement adequate measures to reduce their intake, each country should have updated estimates of TFA content in the diet. The objective {{of the present study}} was to provide data on the TFA content in food commercialized in the Portuguese market. The results on the TFA content of 268 samples acquired between October and December 2013 are reported. Samples were categorized as margarines and shortenings (n =  16), spreadable chocolate fats (n =  6), fried potatoes and chips (n =  25), industrial bakery (n =  4), breakfast cereals (n =  3), pastry products (n =  120), seasonings (n =  5), instant soups (n =  5), <b>instant</b> <b>desserts</b> (n =  6), chocolate snacks (n =  4), microwave popcorn (n =  4), cookies, biscuits and wafers (n =  53), and fast-food (n =  13), with butter (n =  4) included for comparison purposes. TFA were quantified by gas chromatography. Total TFA content in the fat ranged from 0. 06 % to 30. 2 % (average 1. 9 %), with the highest average values in the “biscuits, wafers and cookies” group (3. 4 % TFA), followed by the pastry group (2. 0 %). Fifty samples (19 %) had TFA superior to 2 % in the fat. These findings highlight there is still much need for improvement in terms of the TFA content in Portuguese foods, particularly in traditional pastry...|$|R

40|$|Waxy and high-amylose cornstarches were {{mechanically}} modified, and {{the effects}} of planetary ball-milling treatment on the multi-scale structures and pasting properties of these cornstarches were investigated. The ball-milling could hardly change the structures and properties of high-amylose cornstarch but result in distinct changes to that of waxy cornstarch. With the thicker semi-crystalline lamellae, larger crystalline amylopectin lamellae, thinner amorphous amylopectin lamellae and more structural rigidity amylose amorphous background region, high-amylose cornstarch showed high resistance to the mechanical disruption during the planetary ball-milling treatment. Consistent with the structural changes, the paste properties of high-amylose starch has negligible changes, but the treated waxy cornstarch showed a reduced pasting temperature and paste viscosity, increased pasting stability and a reduced tendency to retrogradation. The results suggest that planetary ball-milling could be a potential physical method to obtain starch products with relatively low viscosity at high concentration and enhanced pasting stability. Industrial relevance Ball-milling is an eco-friendly and cost-effective physical technique which regulates the structure and therefore the physicochemical properties of polymers. Starch is a natural polysaccharide and has been widely used in foods and non-food products. As starch structure {{plays a key role in}} determining its properties, it is highly important to ensure a desirable structure and thus properties to be achieved for specific applications. The present study reveals that planetary ball-milling is an attractive technique to alter the multi-scale structures of starch (in particular waxy starch) and therefore its paste properties. In particular, the treatment displayed a reduced pasting temperature and paste viscosity, an enhanced paste stability at different temperatures and a smaller tendency to retrogradation, which makes starch suitable for a wide range of products such as confections, <b>instant</b> <b>desserts</b> and canned and bottled foods. This enables planetary ball-milling to be a potential physical technique to produce starch products with desired paste behaviors and to expand the industrial applications of starch...|$|R
40|$|Aspartame is a non-nutritive {{sweetener}} {{that is used}} predominantly in various ‘diet’ and ‘low-calorie’ products, such as beverages, <b>instant</b> breakfasts, <b>desserts,</b> breath mints, sugar-free chewing gum, vitamins, and pharmaceuticals, consumed by {{millions of people who}} are attempting weight loss, young adults and diabetic persons. On a weight basis, the metabolism of aspartame generates approximately 50 % phenylalanine, 40 % aspartic acid and 10 % methanol. The detailed mechanisms of the effects of aspartame on the electrophysiological response are still unclear; therefore, {{this study was designed to}} clarify whether longer-term aspartame consumption has any effect on the electrophysiological response in Wistar albino rats. The oral administration of aspartame in a safe dose of 40  mg/kg bodyweight/day (as recommended by EFSA, 2012) was tested in Wistar albino rats for a longer period (90 days). Electrophysiological responses, including heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern, were assessed in a folate-deficient animal model along with control animals using BIOPAC and EEG equipment (model RMS EEG– 24 brain new-plus: RMS – Recorder and Medicare systems). In this study, the folate-deficient animal model was used to mimic human methanol metabolism in rats. After 90 days of aspartame treatment, a significant alteration was observable in the time domain [Mean RR (ms) SDNN (ms) RMSSD (ms) PNN 50 (%) ] and the frequency domain [LF, HF, and LF/HF ratio] with significantly impaired frequency and amplitude of the fronto-parietal and occipital EEG waves at p ≤  0. 05. The results of this study clearly indicate that the oral consumption of aspartame reduced HRV, with sympathetic dominance and loss of vagal tone, and altered sympathovagal activity along with impairment of learning and memory, showing an additional effect on health within this study duration. The aspartame metabolites methanol and formaldehyde may be the causative factors behind the change observed...|$|R
