40|$|Abstract. The term cold-drawing of tubes {{refers to}} forming {{when the final}} {{material}} (a tube) is formed in a pipe bell and its vertical cross-section is smaller, the tube wall is thinner or thicker and its length is greater.

In this study, experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of cross section reduction on the microstructure and mechanical properties of variable thickness aluminium <b>tubes</b> <b>drawn</b> using two different position controlled mandrel techniques. Various tubes with three different outer diameters were subjected to cold drawing at room temperature from 11 percent to 41 percent cross section reduction. The local mechanical properties were determined from tensile tests carried out on specimens cut from different positions in the tubes parallel to their axes. The distributions of the Vickers hardness over the surfaces at 0 deg and 90 deg to the drawing direction were examined. It was found that the microhardness, yield strength, and ultimate tensile of the deformed samples increase and the corresponding elongation decreases with the increase of cross section reduction. Also, the anisotropy in microstructure and mechanical properties is more significant with increasing of cross section reduction. The evolution of mechanical properties of <b>drawn</b> <b>tubes</b> versus cross section reduction depends on the mandrel shapes and initial tube outer diameter.

40|$|Tubular {{products}} have very important applications in various areas {{especially in the}} transportation industries. For instance, {{in the structure of}} cars there are various tubular products like roof headers, engine cradles, roof rails and frame rails with complex geometries which most of them need multiple steps like tube <b>drawing,</b> <b>tube</b> bending and hydroforming for their production. Based on the recent studies by this group, it was proven that in most of the structural tubular parts in the cars it was not necessary to have constant thickness along the axial direction of tube and it will be considered as overdesign and the overall weight of structures can be reduced considerably by using variable thickness tubes. In this paper, the variable thickness tube drawing and its applications in the tube bending and hydroforming applications were studied. The results showed that this process can have important role in reduction of defective parts in the production of complex tubes by the tube hydroforming method. However especial considerations should be taken into account in the design of thickness distribution along axial direction of these kinds of tubes to avoid problems in the drawing step and as well in the bending and hydroforming steps. 9 (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

In the latter subfamily they created two tribes, Eolachesillini and Graphocaeciliini, and dealt with the systematics of the latter. In the Graphocaeciliini they recognised eight genera, including six new genera, and 29 species in total. Subsequently, García Aldrete (2006) erected the genus Waoraniella from the Ecuadorian Amazonia, and established for it the tribe Waoraniellini, in the Eolachesillinae; García Aldrete & Mockford (2011 b) described a second species of that genus, from the Reserva Florestal Ducke, near Manaus, Brazil, and indicated that a third species is known {{to occur in the}} Peruvian Amazonia, near Iquitos; finally, García Aldrete & Mockford (2011 a) described the genus Amazolachesilla, in the Graphocaeciliini, from the Brazilian state of Amazonas.

We would like to understand morphometric variation in the field collected H. anatolicum in Iran also validat­ing some morphologic quantitative and qualitative characters. Methods: A total 247 field-collected tick specimens from different geographical regions in west of Iran includes Khuzestan and Lorestan Provinces were studied.

The degree of airway narrowing which occurs with ASM shortening is a function both of the mechanical properties of the airway wall {{as well as the}} angle of orientation of ASM. If ASM is oriented very obliquely, ASM shortening would in part be transduced to a change in airway length rather than airway narrowing. Previous reports have suggested that the angle of ASM orientation may be as high as 30 $ sp circ. $ To measure ASM orientation we have developed a technique based on en-face dissection. The lungs from 4 cats and one human were fixed with 10 % buffered formalin at 25 cmH$ sb 2 $O for 48 hrs. The airway generations 4 to 17 were dissected out from the left lower lobes. Each airway generation was individually embedded in paraffin from which 5 $ mu$m thick serial sections were cut parallel to the airway long axis ("en-face") and stained with haematoxylin-phloxine-saffron. Each block yielded 3 - 5 sections in which the orientation of ASM nuclei relative to the airway long axis ($ theta$) was measured as an index of ASM orientation. $ theta$ was measured clockwise and counterclockwise to the short axis by using a digitizing tablet and a light microscope (X 250) equipped with a <b>drawing</b> <b>tube</b> attachment.

40|$|Metal working fluids (MWF) are {{basically}} two types, metal removal (chip making) and metal forming (chip-less). MWF {{are used in}} all aspects of production fabrication of refrigeration systems. Metal removal applications typically include turning followed by finish lapping of crankshafts and piston connecting rods, also milling and finish grinding of screw compressor vanes. Metal forming applications include deep drawing of compressor housings, wire <b>drawing,</b> <b>tube</b> forming and stamping of electric motor laminations. MWF are not always completely removed before final assembly. The MWF residuals may get mixed into the refrigerant and compressor lubricant affecting system life and efficiency. Â To date, very little compatibility testing of residual MWF in refrigeration lubes and refrigerants has been investigated. Â Unlike most lube oils, MWF are typically water-based and traditionally make very high usage of extreme pressure (EP) additives. EP additives help remove metal during the cutting process and actually increase wear. Â EP containing MWF mayÂ interfere with compressor lube oil performance. EP are additives are known to be somewhat acidic and corrosive. Â Due environmental persistence concerns, the EPA will restrict the use of chlorinated alkanes as EP additives. Chlorinated alkanes will be being phased out {{over the next few years}} and replacements are needed. It has been proven that preformed emulsions are capable of replacing traditional EP additives in MWF. Preformed emulsions allow non-traditional base â€œoilsâ€ to be used in MWF. These non-traditional base oils are generally very high in viscosity and viscosity index. Some of these base stocks exhibit very high film strengths under high pressures encountered in metal removal operations. These high VI and high film strength synthetic base stocks can replace corrosive EP additives without loss of machining or drawing (stamping) performance. Residual films remaining after machining are non-reactive and oil like, providing corrosion protection of in process metal parts prior to assembly. Â Additionally, high viscosity synthetic base stocks provide low pour points, lower volatility and less vapor interaction within a refrigeration system. Better compatibility with mostly non-polar water insoluble refrigeration lubricants are a benefit. In the future, new refrigerants are likely to be more reactive to reduce environmental persistence.

This was attributed to extensive personal and environmental hygiene programs along with teaching the workers about chloracne, its cause and its prevention. These programs may have been the greatest factor in preventing the development of chloracne in this group of workers. Monitoring of the plant environment showed relatively high concentrations of the couple-compound (TCAB + TCAOB). Comedogenicity assays showed a linear dose-response relationship over time for TCAB, TCAOB and the couple-compound. An antagonistic action was found for the TCAB/TCAOB of the couple-compound; such action may provide some protection to workers in this type of setting. It is speculated that the observed antagonistic action {{may be due to the}} difference in binding affinities of TCAB/TCAOB for receptor sites. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{variable}} thickness <b>tube</b> <b>drawing</b> {{is a new}} modification in the <b>tube</b> <b>drawing</b> methods {{which enables}} production of axially variable thickness tubes faster and easier in comparison with other similar methods like radial forging or indentation forging. The production {{of this type of}} tubes can be used in optimum design of mechanical parts which do not necessarily need constant thickness along the axis of tube and this method can strikingly reduce the overall weight of parts and mechanical assemblies like cars. In this paper, the variable thickness <b>tube</b> <b>drawing</b> were parameterized in a MATLAB code and optimized with the Ls-Opt software as an optimization engine and Ls-Dyna as a FE solver. The final objective of this optimization study is to determine the minimum thickness which can be produced in one step by this method with various tube dimensions (tube thickness and outer diameter). For verification of results, some experiments were performed in the <b>tube</b> <b>drawing</b> machine which was fabricated by this research group and acceptable correspondence was observed between numerical and experimental results.
