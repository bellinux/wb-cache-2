The Wei forces had been wary of Lu Xun all this while so they immediately retreated back into the city when they saw Lu Xun's army approaching. Lu Xun organised his men {{in an orderly manner}} and instructed them to pretend to prepare for an attack on Xiangyang. By then, Zhuge Jin and the fleet <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>up,</b> so Lu Xun and his forces progressively retreated to the vessels and left. The Wei forces in Xiangyang did not dare to make any move.|$|E

He still faced the challenge of Ferrara's crew and the other Argiulo loyalists in the North End. Both sides reportedly drew up lists of people they intended to kill, and began doing so. At one point the brother of one intended target was killed on the street while changing a flat tire. Many Patriarca operatives report {{that they were in}} constant fear for their lives during this period; one told Globe reporter Stephen Kurkjian in 2014 that after learning his name was on one of the lists and that two men <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>up</b> at his sister's home looking for him, he moved to the far north of New England and began living under an assumed name.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{issued an}} {{emergency}} order against Range Resources, {{stating that the}} company's drilling activities in Parker County, Texas had contaminated at least two residential drinking water wells. The company denied the allegations, and said the presence of methane {{was a result of}} naturally occurring migration, and <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>up</b> in nearby water wells long before Range drilled its gas wells. However, after a January 2011 Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) hearing, TRRC staff concluded that, based on chemical composition, the gas in the water wells came from the shallow Strawn Formation, rather than the deeper Barnett Shale, in which the Range wells were completed. They also concluded that pressure tests by Range showed mechanical integrity of the casing. EPA and the two homeowners were invited to present evidence at the TRRC hearing, but did not. In March 2012, the EPA dropped its order against Range.|$|E
500|$|The Treasury began {{removing}} silver certificates from circulation, {{replacing them}} with Federal Reserve Notes. This helped free up silver {{that did not have}} to be held as backing for the certificates, which the Treasury redeemed with silver bullion instead of dollar coins after March 1964, when it stopped paying out silver dollars. It had almost depleted a stock that had been at just under 273 million in 1954. [...] There had been a run on the Treasury for them; [...] citizens could obtain up to 50,000 in a day, and payment in silver certificates was not required. In much-photographed scenes at the Treasury Building in Washington, citizens <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>up</b> with wheelbarrows, armed guards, and even armored cars to haul away the silver. The remaining silver dollars held in the Treasury (2,970,928 as of May 20, 1965) had high numismatic value; Congress in 1970 authorized their sale at a premium to collectors.|$|E
500|$|Captain Future was {{followed}} by Astonishing Stories and Super Science Stories, two new titles from Popular Publications, a well-established pulp publisher. [...] Both magazines were bimonthly, Astonishings first issue dated February 1940, and Super Science Stories appearing the following month; and both were edited by nineteen-year-old Frederik Pohl—he <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>up</b> at Popular's offices looking for editorial work {{just as they were}} considering starting a new magazine, and left as the editor of both new titles. Pohl had a very limited budget, but his contacts with other budding sf writers such as Cyril Kornbluth and James Blish meant he was able to find surprisingly good material. [...] Popular paid promptly, which was more than could be said for some of the other publishers, and so despite the low rates Pohl soon began to see submissions that had been rejected by Campbell at Astounding but not sent anywhere else. [...] As a result, he occasionally printed material by some of the Astounding regulars, including [...] "Genus Homo", a collaboration between L. Sprague de Camp and P.

Frehley would return the favor by playing solos on Peter Criss's Cat #1 album on TNT Records, released in 1994. In contrast to the somewhat adversarial relationship Frehley had with Kiss (particularly Gene Simmons) throughout the 1980s, he and Criss had maintained good ties during the decade.

2500|$|In {{the account}} {{published}} in Thomas West Smith's book in 1897, Lt. Dagwell {{noted that the}} fight at Fairfax prevented Stuart from crossing the Potomac on June 27, contributing to his delay in rejoining the Army of Northern Virginia before the Battle of Gettysburg. Historian Eric Wittenberg has stated: [...] "The brave, desperate and hopeless charge of the 11th New York Cavalry at Fairfax Court House hindered Stuart for half a day." [...] Because the Confederates were defeated at Gettysburg, they sought to explain the defeat {{based on their own}} failures and weaknesses. Stuart received more criticism for his delay in rejoining {{the main body of the}} Confederate army than most other Confederate commanders for their failures. The criticism came not just from civilians but from his army colleagues. On the other hand, modern historians Wittenberg and Petruzzi, after examining Stuart's ride and how Robert E. Lee fought the Battle of Gettysburg, and admitting that any analysis based on Stuart's cavalry rejoining the Army of Northern Virginia earlier in the campaign was speculative, concluded that the Confederates would have lost the battle whether Stuart <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>up</b> earlier or not.|$|E
