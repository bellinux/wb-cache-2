In addition, it offers techniques to encourage tree development and simplify maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of agroforestry for industrialised countries can be furthered by {{an understanding of}} the history and present functioning of traditional systems. In temperate Europe, fruit trees were traditionally grown on agricultural land undersown with crops or managed grass-land (Streuobst). The historical evolution of this agroforestry system has been driven by the interaction of technical progress, market development and intervention by public authorities. Streuobst reached its peak in the 1930 s, but has since been in continuous decline due to the {{development of}} intensively managed <b>dwarf-tree</b> <b>orchards.</b> However, even today, it still occupies approximately one million hectares in 11 European countries and has a strong impact on the European fruit market. The profitability of streuobst is relatively poor due to its low labour productivity, but it has advantageous ecological and socio-cultural features, particularly in terms of biological diversity and landscape aesthetics. Accordingly, it finds strong acceptance among the general public, such that subsidised eradication programs have been abandoned and, in a number of countries, streuobst is now supported by non-governmental organisations and by state conservation policies. Modern agroforestry in temperate, industrialised countries should be oriented towards the creation of similar ecological and socio-cultural benefits in order to receive public support as a land-use system...|$|R
40|$|T he {{application}} of pesticides hasbeen of concern for many years,particularly in relation to methods of reducing drift and improving deposition. Many growers still use older airblast sprayers with hollow cone or air-shear nozzles which provide {{a large amount of}} air to penetrate traditional large fruit tree canopies. During recent years many growers have removed traditional tree plantings and replaced them with dwarf and semi-dwarf trees, but still use the older sprayers; the result is over-spraying of the target row and drift. Spray drift from air-blast sprayers is an important and costly problem facing fruit growers (Landers, 2002). Drift results in damage to susceptible off target crops, environmental contamination to watercourses and an unintentionally reduced rate of application to the target crop, thus reducing pesticide effectiveness, (Landers 1999). Pesticide drift also affects neighboring properties, often leading to public outcry and conflict. Sprayer Design and Drift There are many interrelated factors affecting drift and deposition (see Table 1). Droplet size, air volume, speed and direction are the main factors from the Reducing spray drift and improving deposition are increasing concerns for fruit growers. Drift results in damage to susceptible off target crops, environ-mental contamination to watercourses and an unintentionally reduced rate of application to the target crop, thus reducing pesticide effectiveness. Pesticide drift also affects neighboring properties, often leading to public outcry and conflict. For many <b>dwarf-tree</b> apple <b>orchards</b> we have found that reducing fan speed by 25 percent provides a simple, inexpensive method of reducing drift...|$|R
