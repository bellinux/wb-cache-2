5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
25|$|For a robot to {{associate}} behaviors with a place (localization) requires it to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is {{and to be}} able to navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based triangulation. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus' HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created CAD floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots' PatrolBot and autonomous wheelchair, both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own laser-based maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as corridors. Their control system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.|$|E

On occasion, just two minutes of new footage would be recorded at each session. On the subject of the remote-control steering, he stated, [...] "I remember standing out of shot and having to 'drive' [...] down the road while it was out of view.

500|$|In Amsterdam, {{three days}} of filming took place. Woodley and Elgort were filmed on a canal-side public bench.

500|$|Developmental {{psychologist}} Jean Piaget conducted {{experiments that}} collected behavioral tests on infants. Piaget studied object permanence by observing infants' reactions when a favorite object or toy was presented {{and then was}} covered with a blanket or removed from sight. Object permanence is considered {{to be one of the}} earliest methods for evaluating working memory. [...] An infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy. Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused. Piaget interpreted these behavioral signs as evidence of a belief that the object had [...] ceased to exist. Reactions of most infants that had already started developing object permanence were of frustration because they knew it existed, but didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was. However, the reaction of infants that had not yet started developing object permanence was more oblivious. If an infant searched for the object, it was assumed that they believed it continued to exist.|$|E

500|$|Dennis Feldman had {{the idea}} for Species in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, Real Men. Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable odds against an {{extraterrestrial}} craft ever locating and visiting Earth, given that stellar distances are great, and faster-than-light travel is unlikely, Feldman started {{to think that it}} was [...] "unsophisticated for any alien culture to come here in what 'd describe as a big tin can." [...] Thus in turn he considered that the possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information. Then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men. Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined wetware. The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions [...] "giving out directions" [...] such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space.

As he prepares to kill Mickey, Violet calls the landline from Johnnie's cell phone and quickly convinces Caesar to pretend that he's on the phone with Gino, who's calling from a hospital to explain that he and Johnnie were in a car accident. Mickey is convinced and leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar where she has hidden the money, and he goes next-door to find it. Violet escapes and makes a phone call to Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. In the meantime, Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats her to the ground. Just as he is about to kill her, Violet arrives and pulls a gun on Caesar, telling him that Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can. Caesar tells Violet that he knows she will not shoot him, to which she replies, [...] "Caesar, you don't know shit", before killing him.|$|E
500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] is an uptempo gospel {{song with}} {{elements}} of pop music. The song was also noted for exploring elements of Contemporary Christian {{as well as}} electronic dance music. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse felt that the song contained a [...] "zippy", reggae-dance beat. Its instrumentation includes percussion instruments, synths and horn stabs along with African beats. According to sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., [...] "Say Yes" [...] is written in the key of D major using common time. It contains a moderately fast tempo with a metronome of 120 beats per minute and the singers' vocal elements range from the low note of A3 to the high note of F5. The song samples a popular Nigerian gospel tune originally titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Chris Payne and Colin Stutz of Billboard magazine {{described it as a}} modern dance and contemporary electronic dance reworking of that song. Stutz also found elements of an [...] "upbeat swing" [...] of West African gospel.

Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E
