5|$|For the {{production}} of the show, Gaga enlisted choreographer Richard Jackson and together with him and the Haus of Gaga, they came up with ideas regarding how the show should be constructed and what music should be performed. They also {{had to find a way}} to co-mingle all the <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> to make a single, coherent show. For the choreography, which encompassed all the stages present, Jackson had to employ a different approach, so that the audience could see the performance from every angle.|$|E
5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had <b>different</b> <b>ideas.</b> Nichols was seen as too closely identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E
5|$|Zieliński {{left the}} company, and Kiciński headed the project. Although the game's {{development}} continued, the demo was abandoned. According to CD Projekt, the development team had <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> {{for the game}} and lacked overall direction; as a result, it was returned {{to the drawing board}} in 2003. The team, unfamiliar with video-game development, spent nearly two years organising production. They received assistance from BioWare, who helped promote the game at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo by offering CD Projekt space in their booth next to Jade Empire. BioWare also licensed their Aurora game engine to the company.|$|E

5|$|The first {{studies and}} propositions {{to clean up}} the river date back to 1859, and during the {{following}} years, many different commissions of engineers were assigned to examine possible solutions. Dozens of <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> were submitted, many of which were completely unfeasible. Several of them proposed diverting large amounts of cleaner water from other rivers upstream to dilute the Senne, while greatly improving the drainage system in the city. Other proposals involved diverting the main course of the Senne completely to the Lesser Senne, which would then be enlarged and thus more useful for boat traffic and mills. Others considered any sort of sanitization impossible, and proposed covering the Senne without greatly changing its course. Among these was a proposal to double the size of the underground drainage tunnels, creating space for a subterranean railroad tunnel. The idea was ahead of its time, but would be implemented a century later with the North–South connection.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

50|$|The {{background}} {{space is}} not treated naturalistically but establishes divisions between the different, symbolic groups of figures. Each spatial zone {{refers to a}} <b>different</b> <b>idea</b> being communicated such as temptation, judgment, death, and suffering. The landscape is treated symbolically. The rocky area represents the hermit's asceticism while the fertile area earthly pleasures.|$|R
25|$|The joining {{together}} of these <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> supported {{the notion of}} the ekayāna, the one vehicle: absolute oneness, all-pervading Buddha-wisdom and original enlightenment as a holistic whole. This synthesis was a reflection of the unity which was attained in China with the united Song dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Molecular phylogeneticists have {{proposed}} a family tree that {{is very different from}} the one with which paleontologists are familiar.

25|$|The type {{of coins}} issued changed under the coinage reform of Diocletian, the heavily debased antoninianus (double denarius) was {{replaced}} {{with a variety of}} new denominations, and a new range of imagery was introduced that attempted to convey <b>different</b> <b>ideas.</b> The new government set up by Diocletian was a tetrarchy, or rule by four, with each emperor receiving a separate territory to rule.|$|E

25|$|The most {{vulnerable}} nations – the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) – pushed for deep uniform cuts by developed nations, {{with the goal}} of having emissions reduced to the greatest possible extent. Countries that had supported differentiation of targets had <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> as to how it should be calculated, and many different indicators were proposed. Two examples include differentiation of targets based on gross domestic product (GDP), and differentiation based on energy intensity (energy use per unit of economic output).|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the Super Bowl hype {{was more}} focused onto Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones and head coach Jimmy Johnson. Although the two rebuilt {{the team with}} young talent that {{eventually}} won the previous year's Super Bowl, both men had huge egos that conflicted with each other. Both had <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> on the future personnel plans for the Cowboys, and both wanted equal credit for the team's recent success (eventually, Johnson would leave the team after the season).|$|E
25|$|Though these {{ten commandments}} are often {{accepted}} {{to be what}} knights would use, they would not necessarily be what a knight actually followed in the medieval era. This code was created by Leon Gautier in 1883, long after the knight had ceased to exist in its traditional form. Chivalry in a historical sense {{was more of a}} subjective term, these laws would likely be seen as good code for a clergyman, however others would hold <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> on what chivalry truly was.|$|E

He obeyed the idea as a marionette obeys the strings, and started forthwith down the deck aft in quest of the mate.|$|R
25|$|But {{playing in}} a stadium built almost 100 years ago was not ideal, lacking in service capacity, security, and architecture, the {{terraces}} having poles obscuring the view for the audience. Propositions for a modernisation of {{either of the two}} Ullevi stadiums, or construction of a new stadium were revealed in April 2002. Four different plans were presented; construction of movable seating on the short ends of Ullevi, two <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> for renovation and expansion of Gamla Ullevi, or to demolish Gamla Ullevi and construct a new arena on that site.|$|E
25|$|Male {{pregnancy}} is the incubation {{of one or}} more embryos or fetuses by male members of some species. In nearly all heterogamous animal species, offspring are ordinarily carried by the female until birth, but in fish of the Syngnathidae family (pipefish, seahorses and the leafy seadragon), males perform this function. There are <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> concerning whether a human male could become pregnant, and, by some definitions of gender identity, humans that identify as men have become pregnant. Male humans incubating fetuses are also a recurring theme in speculative fiction.|$|E
25|$|Bill Leeb left Skinny Puppy in 1986 {{to pursue}} his own musical project, Front Line Assembly, {{alongside}} musicians Rhys Fulber and Michael Balch. Leeb gave his reasons for leaving the group stating that his bandmates expressed <b>different</b> <b>ideas</b> from his own {{and that he had}} been interested in singing. In addition to Front Line Assembly, Leeb would head projects such as Noise Unit and the internationally successful Delerium. Leeb's replacement would be quiet Alberta native Dwayne Goettel. Classically trained as a pianist/keyboardist, Goettel had been in a duo named Water with vocalist Sandy Weir and had previously worked with the synthpop band Psyche, among others.|$|E
