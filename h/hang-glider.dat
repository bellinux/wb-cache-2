25|$|Unlike other multi-sport games, {{which often}} has each event as a {{separate}} component, Xtreme Sports utilizes multi-event tracks, where players might snowboard {{down the side of}} a mountain and then get on an ATV that will take them to a cliff which they will sail off of on a <b>hang-glider.</b> There are 12 different tracks, each having a different order in which the various events take place, some incorporating each of the different sports. These tracks are situated in environments that seek to emulate real life locations, such as Mount Kilimanjaro, Maui, Scotland, Stryn and the Himalayas.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Manser and {{his friend}} Jacques Christinet tried to enter Peninsular Malaysia from Singapore to fly a {{motorised}} <b>hang-glider</b> during the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. However, he was recognised at the border and denied entry into Malaysia. They then decided to swim across the Straits of Johor into Malaysia but later abandoned the plan, because it involved a lengthy 25-kilometer swim and a passage through a swamp across the straits. They planned an alternate route, opting to row a boat from an island in Indonesia into Sarawak, but Bruno Manser Foundation (BMF) in Switzerland received a warning from Malaysian embassy, warning of the consequences for such an act.|$|E

500|$|Lake James {{has been}} {{the site of a}} plane crash and a rare hang gliding fatality. [...] In 1971 a Piper Tri-Pacer crashed into Lake James, killing the pilot. [...] The plane was flying at low {{altitude}} when a wing hit the water about [...] from the shore. The wing was torn off, and the plane plunged into water about [...] deep. [...] Another fatality happened in 1972, when a <b>hang-glider</b> was killed. The kite was being pulled by a boat when the flyer lost control, causing the kite (and flyer) to plummet about [...] before striking the surface of the lake. [...] The lake has also been the site of accidents involving thin ice. An example transpired in January 1985 when four snowmobiles broke through thin ice, and three people drowned.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw, in {{his review}} for The Guardian, wrote, [...] "Perhaps it will even come {{to be seen as}} this director's flawed masterpiece: enthralling but {{structurally}} fractured—the second half is much clearer and more sure-footed than the first—and at times frustratingly reticent, unwilling to attempt any insight into Che's interior world". In his less favorable review for Esquire, Stephen Garrett criticized the film for failing to show Guevara's negative aspects, [...] "the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring". Richard Corliss had problems with Del Toro's portrayal of Guevara: [...] "Del Toro—whose acting style often starts over the top and soars from there, like a <b>hang-glider</b> leaping from a skyscraper roof—is muted, yielding few emotional revelations, seemingly sedated here ... Che is defined less by his rigorous fighting skills and seductive intellect than by his asthma". In his review for Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir praised Soderbergh for making [...] "something that people will be eager to see and eager to talk about all over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing. I'd be surprised if Che doesn't win the Palme d'Or ... but be that as it may, nobody who saw it here will ever forget it".|$|E
500|$|A bite from a {{radioactive}} spider triggers {{mutations in}} Peter Parker's body, granting him superpowers. In the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man {{has the ability}} to cling to walls, superhuman strength, a sixth sense ("spider-sense") that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as superhuman speed and agility. [...] The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level. Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics. With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters. This mechanism ejects an advanced adhesive, releasing web-fluid in a variety of configurations, including a single rope-like strand to swing from, a net to snare or bind enemies, and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent. He can also weave the web material into simple forms like a shield, a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier, a club, or a <b>hang-glider</b> wing. Other equipment include a light beacon that can either be used as a flashlight or project a [...] "Spider-Signal" [...] design, a specially modified camera that can take pictures automatically, and spider-tracers, which are spider-shaped adhesive homing beacons keyed to his own spider-sense.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{types of}} gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986 Steve McKinney led an {{expedition}} to Mount Everest, during which {{he became the first}} person to fly a <b>hang-glider</b> off the mountain. Frenchman Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp. In 2011, two Nepalese made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down [...] in 45 minutes. On 5 May 2013, the beverage company Red Bull sponsored Valery Rozov, who successfully BASE jumped off of the mountain while wearing a wingsuit, setting a record for world's highest BASE jump in the process.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1904 the Aéro-Club de France {{announced}} {{a series of}} prizes for achievements in powered flight, but little practical work was done: Ferdinand Ferber, an army officer who in 1898 had experimented with a <b>hang-glider</b> based on that of Otto Lilienthal continued his work without any notable success, Archdeacon commissioned {{the construction of a}} glider based on the Wright design but smaller and lacking the provision for roll control which made a number of brief flights at Berck-sur-Mer in April 1904, piloted by Ferber and Gabriel Voisin (the longest of around , compared to the [...] achieved by the Wrights in 1902) : another glider based on the Wright design was constructed by Robert Esnault-Pelterie, who rejected wing-warping as unsafe and instead fitted a pair of mid-gap control surfaces in front of the wings, intended to be used in a differential manner in place of wing-warping and in conjunction to act as elevators (as what are known today as elevons): this is the first recorded use of ailerons, the concept for which had been patented over a generation earlier by M. P. W. Boulton of the United Kingdom in 1868. [...] This was not successful and Esnault-Pelterie was later to use its failure to support the position that the Wright Brothers claims were unfounded. However his design was not an exact copy of the Wrights' glider, particularly in having a greatly increased wing camber. Ferber's copy was likewise unsuccessful: it was crudely constructed, without ribs to maintain the wing camber, but is notable for his later addition of a fixed rear-mounted stabilising tail surface, the first instance of this feature in a full-size aircraft. [...] Archdeacon abandoned the 1904 glider after the first attempts and [...] commissioned a second glider, which was constructed by Gabriel Voisin in 1905; this broke up in mid air when towed into the air behind a car, fortunately carrying sandbags in place of a pilot. [...] Voisin then constructed another glider, mounted on floats and introducing the box kite-like stabilising tail which was to be a characteristic of his later aircraft: this was successfully towed into the air behind a motor-boat on 8 June 1905, and Voisin's glider and a second similar aircraft built for Louis Blériot were tested on 18 July, the flight of Blériots aircraft ending in a crash in which Voisin, the pilot, was nearly drowned. [...] Voisin and Blériot then constructed a powered tandem wing biplane, which was subjected to a number of modifications without any success.|$|E

50|$|The Italian <b>hang-glider</b> pilot Angelo d'Arrigo {{extended}} this technique. D'Arrigo {{noted that}} the flight of a non-motorised <b>hang-glider</b> {{is very similar to}} the flight patterns of migratory birds: Both use updrafts of hot air (thermal currents) to gain altitude that then permits soaring flight over distance. He used this fact to enable the re-introduction into the wild of threatened species of raptors.|$|E
