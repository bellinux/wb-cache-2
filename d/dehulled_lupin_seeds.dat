40|$|With the {{objective}} of promoting the cultivation, usage, and consumption of lupin, in the present study, the chemical and fibre composition of dehulled seeds of seven cultivars of different lupin species (Lupinus angustifolius, Lupinus albus and Lupinus luteus) was determined in comparison to pea (Pisum sativum) and soya bean (Glycine max). The mean protein content of lupin was significantly higher compared to pea (P< 0. 001) and similar to soya bean, whereas the proportion of calculated carbohydrates was lowest for lupin (P< 0. 001). The content of total dietary fibre and of calculated soluble fibre was higher for lupin compared to pea (P 0. 003) and soya bean (P 0. 013). In contrast to the existing literature, the soluble fibre content of lupin contributed about 75 % of the total dietary fibre. In conclusion, <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> {{can be considered as}} a valuable source of plant protein and dietary fibre, while simultaneously being low in carbohydrates. Therefore, lupin should be exploited more efficiently within human and also animal nutrition. In further studies, the impact of dehulling lupin seeds and of using different methodologies in fibre analyses on the results of chemical composition should be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Two {{hundred fifty}} six broiler chickens, 22 -days-old, {{allocated}} to four {{groups of four}} replicate pens with 16 birds each, and six adult ileostomized roosters were used. Four diets containing maize starch and 550 g/kg whole or 458 g/kg <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> (Lupinus luteus L. cv. Amulet) as the only protein source were offered to birds with or without alpha-galactosidase supplementation. The apparent ileal digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen of the diets was determined. In chickens digesta was collected from {{the lower part of}} the ileum immediately after slaughter, while in roosters digesta was collected via a T cannula placed in the terminal ileum during three 12 h periods in a change-over design. Dehulling of lupins significantly increased apparent ileal digestibility of dry matter of the diet by 10 % in roosters (P < 0. 01) and 14 % in broilers (P < 0. 001), while alpha-galactosidase supplementation increased DM digestibility by 3 % only in roosters (P < 0. 05). Dehulling of lupins increased the apparent ileal digestibility of N only in roosters (P < 0. 01). There was no difference between roosters and broiler chickens with regard to the DM digestibility, but the apparent digestibility of N was lower in roosters, than in broilers. The viscosity of ileal digesta was measured only in chickens. It was generally low and was highest (2. 92 mPas. s) in broilers fed the whole lupin diet without alpha-galactosidase.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to verify the suitability of two Polish varieties of <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> (the low-protein SONET variety and the high-protein JUNO variety) as protein components to replace 50 % of soya extract meal in feeding mixtures designed for the feeding of young broilers. The results of {{this experiment}} demonstrate that suitable treatment of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> (<b>dehulling)</b> may significantly increase its nutritional value. Dehulling provides a product (core) in which the level of nitrogen-containing substances is by 27 % higher than that in the original seed, providing an important protein component to be added in feeding mixtures for chickens. The experiment has also shown that production performance depends on the particular Lupinus variety used. Chickens fed on the JUNO variety seed (Group E 1) reached a live weight of 2. 332 kg on Day 40, which is comparable with the control group of chickens (2. 337 kg; Group C).

Therefore the potential of using lupins as a nutraceutical food supplement and additive in Asian Foods is tremendous. Our own investigation has shown that <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> flour can improve the colour, water absorption, protein level and eating qualities of noodles, and in instant noodles we also see a reduction in fat content.

Pigs were blocked based on weaning weight. The diets were (i) a wheat-based control diet containing 240. g/kg of milk products (whey and skim milk powder), and (ii) 8 diets containing whole or <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupins</b> (cv.

In the last decade, reports assessing the benefits of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> proteins have proliferated and, nowadays, the pharmaceutical industry is interested in lupin proteins for human health. Modern genomics and proteomics have hugely contributed to describing the diversity of lupin storage genes and, above all, proteins. Most of these studies have been centered on few edible lupin species. However, Lupinus genus comprises hundreds of species spread throughout the Old and New Worlds, and these resources have been scarcely explored and exploited. We present here a detailed review of the literature on the potential of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> proteins as nutraceuticals, and the use of -omic tools to analyze seed storage polypeptides in main edible lupins and their diversity at the Lupinus inter- and intra-species level. In this sense, proteomics, more than any other, has been a key approach. Proteomics has shown that <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> protein diversity, where post-translational modifications yield a large number of peptide variants with a potential concern in bioactivity, goes far beyond gene diversity.

In the first experiment, Leghorn chicks fed diets containing up to 70 % whole lupins showed a depression in the performance. Progressive decreases in DMR (up to 30. 2 %), AME (up to 6. 5 %), and APD (up to 6. 5 %) and an increase in the relative gizzard weight (18. 8 %) were observed with increasing concentration of lupins (23. 1, 46. 9, and 70 %) in the diet. Enzyme supplementation of diets containing lupins significantly improved the performance of the chicks. DMR and AME were improved by 4. 2 and 3. 1, respectively, and gizzard size was reduced (7. 1 %) by addition of the enzymes. In the second experiment, addition of 11. 2 and 22. 4 % of lupin hulls to a <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> diet resulted in a dramatic depression in chick performance, with values ranging from 6. 3 % for feed consumption to 60. 5 % for fed to gain ratio, and an increase in the relative organ weight (up to 29. 9 %) and length (35. 6 %). These effects were partially counteracted by the action of enzymes. In the third experiment, increasing concentration of whole lupins (15, 35, and 45 %) in broiler chicken diets caused a depression in the performance of birds fed 35 and 45 % whole lupins as compared to those fed the wheat-soy diet. In contrast, 15 % lupins improved weight gains compared to that obtained with the nonlupin diets. The lower content of lupins in the diet also had no or little effect on other performance values compared to the control group, whereas 35 and 45 % dietary lupins tended to have negative effects. Likewise, increasing lupin content in the diet produced an enlargement in the relative size of several sections of the gastrointestinal tract. Enzyme supplementation of lupin diets improved weight gain (5. 5 %) and feed consumption (3. 8 %) with the values being similar to those obtained with the wheat-soy diet. Moreover, the enzymes also reduced the relative size of digestive organs from 5. 3 % for pancreas to 22. 2 % for crop.

Ethanol extract was also used to produce a rich oligosaccharide fraction. In the first experiment, the dehulling treatment and the addition of enzyme to the diet improved (P < 0. 05) weight gain (24 and 15 %), feed-to-gain ratio (13 and 9 %), dry matter retention (32 and 8 %), apparent protein digestibility (6 and 3 %) and ileal digestibilities of raffinose (19 and 119 %), stachyose (85 and 204 %), and total oligosaccharides (68 and 178 %), respectively. In addition, enzyme treatment improved (P < 0. 05) excreta digestibility values for NSP (from - 1. 7 to 5. 5 %), R (from 64. 6 to 92. 6 %), S (from 48. 8 to 82. 4 %), and O (from 55. 8 to 83. 5 %). In the second experiment, extraction of the ethanol soluble components from <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> decreased (P < 0. 0001) weight gain (51 %), and increased (P < 0. 0001) feed consumption (34 %), feed-to-gain ratio (32 %), relative gizzard weight (14 %), and the relative ceca length (20 %). The addition of the isolated fraction of oligosacharides to the corn-extracted lupin diet (7. 5 and 15 %) yielded performance values similar to those obtained with the unextracted <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin.</b> The addition of enzymes to the diets significantly improved the weight gain (11 %) and feed to gain ratio (6 %), and decreased relative gizzard weight (12 %) and relative ceca length (7 %). Ileal digestibilities of R, S, and O were considerably lower than corresponding excreta digestibilities. The excreta digestibility of NSP and excreta and ileal digestibilities of R, S, and O were lower (P < 0. 05) in chicks fed the lupin diet containing the high concentration of extract compared with those fed the same diet containing the lower concentration of extract. Enzymes, when added to the diets, increased (P < 0. 05) the digestibilities of R, S, and O with the relative effects being much greater for ileal than excreta samples. In the third experiment, the ethanol extract (7. 5 and 15 %) added to a corn-soybean diet improved weight gain, feed consumption, and feed-to-gain ratio by 19, 13, and 6 %, respectively. Ileal digestibilities of R, S, and O were low (< 45 %), especially in chicks fed the diets containing the high amount of added oligosaccharide fraction. There was no effect of enzyme addition on the performance parameters. However, supplemental dietary enzymes improved (P < 0. 05) ileal and excreta digestibilities of oligosaccharides from 15. 6 and 68. 6 % to 52. 3 and 84. 8 %, respectively. In summary, dehulling greatly improved the nutritional value of lupin, while removal of the ethanol soluble materials, including raffinose and stachyose considerably decreased its value. The oligosaccharide fraction does not seem to have an antinutritive effect and the addition of enzymes increased the digestibilities of NSP, raffinose, and stachyose but did not significantly improve chick performance.

40|$|There is an {{ever-increasing}} demand for <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> protein in human nutrition. However, their usage {{as a food}} ingredient can be limited by their influence on the immune system. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse, by means of flow cytometry, the potential of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> globulins to induce the respiratory burst in human neutrophils. The results proved the potential of lupin globulins to induce the increased ROS production in human neutrophils. The increased ROS production by the cells treated with lupin globulins and, at the same time, stimulated with the PMA may suggest a synergistic effect of the globulins and the PMA...|$|R
40|$|A {{selective}} {{procedure for}} {{the extraction of}} α-galactosides has been employed in two sweet <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> (Lupinus angustifolius var. Troll and var. Emir) {{in order to reduce}} flatulence-causing factors. Different nutritional parameters (proteins, fat, ash, dietary fibre, starch, sucrose, vitamins B 1, B 2, E and C) and antinutritional factors (α-galactosides, trypsin inhibitor activity and inositol phosphates) were studied in raw and processed seeds. The α-galactoside content in both varieties was reduced by 87 - 100 %. The extracted <b>lupins</b> <b>seeds</b> presented a high retention in protein and fat (109 - 136 % and 95 - 104 %, respectively). Sucrose and soluble dietary fibre, however, decreased significantly as a result of processing and retentions ranged between 5 and 29 %. The vitamin B 1, B 2, and E contents decreased during selective extraction, the retentions being in the ranges 25 - 47 %, 38 - 40 %, and 48 - 54 %, respectively, for var. Troll and Emir. However extracted <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> still contained important amounts of vitamins and insoluble dietary fibre, compounds with nutritional importance. Raw and processed lupins did not contain starch. TIA and vitamin C were not detected, and total inositol phosphates were modified slightly after extraction. In conclusion, the <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> obtained by the extraction of α-galactosides can be an adequate proteic ingredient to be incorporated in functional foods. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|High {{inclusion}} {{levels of}} <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus angustifolius) in salmonid diets significantly decrease growth rates. This {{may be caused}} by the high concentrations of non-starch polysaccharides including oligosaccharide (OS) in lupin. The antinutritive effects of OS have not yet been fully investigated in fish. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of enzyme supplementation of dehulled lupin-based diets on the fish performance. There were two control diets: a fish meal-based diet with no plant protein (FM) and a diet that contained 50 % <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> (L). Four experimental diets based on diet L and containing four different exogenous enzyme supplements were used: diet L(E) (Energex™); diet L(B) (Bio-Feed™ Pro); diet L(α) (Alpha galactosidase™); and diet L(Mix), which contained all the enzymes. Fish were randomly stocked into tanks in duplicate groups of 38 fish, 16. 58 ± 0. 169 (SE) g, and were fed twice a day for 6 weeks. The supplemented enzymes did not improve weight gain in fish fed lupin-based diets. However, mixed enzyme significantly improved Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER). Apparent digestibility of DM, CP and GE significantly improved in fish-fed L(E) diet. None of the supplemented enzymes affected digestive tract indices or carcass composition. Surprisingly, weight gain was significantly higher in fish-fed L(α), L(E) and L(Mix) diets as compared with FM diet. Feed intake was significantly higher in fish-fed L, L(α) and L(E) diets compared with the FM diet. It is concluded that storing of lupin kernel under a suitable condition may have partially hidden the positive effects of exogenous enzymes through activating the endogenous enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Mature {{white lupin}} (Lupinus albus L., Fabaceae) seeds {{have been used}} as food for over 3000 years around the Mediterranean and for as much as 6, 000 years in the Andean highlands. However, no {{information}} is available about use of immature green <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> as human food similar to that of vegetable soybean (Edamame) and green peas. We studied yield and protein content of green immature seeds of ten white lupin cultivars grown at two locations in Virginia over 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07 crop seasons. Location effects were, generally, non-significant whereas cultivar effects were significant for pod yield and number of pods per hectare and non-significant for number of seeds per pod, shelling percent, and protein content whereas location effects were significant only for protein content. The mean values for pod yield (kg. ha - 1), number of pods per hectare, number seeds per pod, shelling percent, and protein content of green immature white <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> were 18098, 3402899, 4, 32, and 33, respectively.

40|$|Broad beans (Vicia faba) and <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> (Lupinus albus) are legumes rich in a {{wide range}} of compounds, which may {{represent}} a useful dietary approach for modulating the human gut microbiome. In this work, after in vitro digestion, legume samples were used as carbon sources in anaerobic batch cultures to evaluate their impact on the intestinal microbiota composition and on their metabolic products. The fermentations were monitored by a decrease in pH, generation of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactate and the changes in the dynamic bacterial populations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The total SCFA at the end of fermentation was 81. 52 mM for <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> and 78. 41 mM for broad beans accompanied by a decrease of the pH for both legumes. The microbial groups that increased significantly (P < 0. 05) were Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus–Enterococcus, Atopobium, Bacteroides–Pretovella, Clostridium coccoides–Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia intestinalis. This impact on the intestinal microbiota suggests that <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> and broad beans may be used in the development of novel functional foods, which can be included in dietary strategies for human health promotion...|$|R
40|$|It is {{currently}} {{assumed that the}} assimilation of sulfur into reduced forms occurs predominantly in the leaves of plants. However, developing seeds have a strong requirement for sulfur amino acids for storage protein synthesis. We have assessed the capacity of developing <b>seeds</b> of narrow-leaf <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus angustifolius) for sulfur assimilation. Cotyledons of developing <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> were able to transfer the sulfur atom from 35 S-labeled sulfate into seed proteins in vitro, demonstrating {{the ability of the}} developing cotyledons to perform all the steps of sulfur reduction and sulfur amino acid biosynthesis. Oxidized sulfur constituted approximately 30 % of the sulfur in mature <b>seeds</b> of <b>lupins</b> grown in the field and almost all of the sulfur detected in phloem exuded from developing pods. The activities of three enzymes of the sulfur amino acid biosynthetic pathway were found in developing cotyledons in quantities theoretically sufficient to account for all of the sulfur amino acids that accumulate in the protein of mature <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds.</b> We conclude that sulfur assimilation by developing cotyledons is likely to be an important source of sulfur amino acids for the synthesis of storage proteins during <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> maturation...|$|R
40|$|The 11 S storage {{globulin}} {{of white}} <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> binds to a {{metal affinity chromatography}} matrix. Two unusual stretches of contiguous histidine residues, reminiscent of the multiple histidines forming metal binding motifs, at the C-terminal end of 11 S globulin acidic chains were hypothesized as candidate elements responsible for the binding capacity. To prove this, the protein was incubated with a <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> endopeptidase previously shown to cleave at twin arginine motifs, recurrent in the sequence region of interest. Upon incubation with this enzyme, the loss of metal binding capacity paralleled that of the anti-his-tag reactive polypeptides. The recovered small proteolytic fragment was analyzed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing and found to correspond to the 24 -mer region cleaved off at twin arginine residues and containing the natural his-tag-like region. Similarly, when <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> were germinated for a few days, the his-tag containing 11 S globulin chain was converted to a form devoid of such region, suggesting that this mechanism {{is a part of}} the natural degradatory process of the protein. The hypothesis that the ordered and controlled dismantling of storage proteins may generate peptide fragments with potential functional roles in plant ontogenesis is presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Phomopsis leptostromiformis, and its teleomorph Diaporthe toxica, is a lupin {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} stem blight in young lupins and, as a saprophyte, has been detected on dead lupine material. Under favourable conditions, the fungus produces phomopsins (PHOs), {{a family of}} macrocyclic hexapeptide mycotoxins capable of binding tubulin through the tripeptide side chain. The toxic effects appear largely confined to the liver. In particular, the ingestion of PHO contaminated lupin stubble {{has been linked to}} lupinosis, a debilitating disease of sheep (the most sensitive animal) characterised by disorientation, blindness, lethargy, and eventually death. The chemical structures of PHO A, B and D have been identified. Analytical methods to determine PHOs are mainly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or chromatographic separations, in combination with ultraviolet and mass spectrometric detection. The data about the PHOs occurrence are limited to Australia, restricted to <b>lupin</b> <b>seed.</b> Only one survey has been carried out on <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> and flours from the Swiss market. Not many strategies have been developed to limit <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> contamination. Efforts devoted to control lupinosis in Australia focused on the development of cultivars resistant to Phomopsis infection. There are few examples in literature of decontamination or detoxification of PHOs; moreover, they {{have been shown to be}} resistant to extensive processing, including cooking. Australia and New Zealand are the only countries that included PHOs in their mycotoxin regulations, with a limit of 5 μg/kg in <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> and derived products. Phomopsins are poorly studied mycotoxins and risk assessment on PHOs has not been done at the European level. The collection of all available scientific data was requested by EFSA in a specific project and partners involved considered it of general interest preparing this review to highlight the limited available information, which indicate that the assessment of potential risk related to PHOs is currently not feasible...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{traditional}} Ethiopian lupin processing method on the chemical composition of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> samples was studied. Two sampling districts, namely Mecha and Sekela, representing the mid- and high-altitude areas of north-western Ethiopia, respectively, were randomly selected. Different types of traditionally processed and marketed <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> samples (raw, roasted, and fi nished) were collected in six replications from each district. Raw samples are unprocessed, and roasted samples are roasted using fi rewood. Finished samples are those ready for human consumption as snack. Thousand seed weight for raw and roasted samples within a study district was similar (P > 0. 05), but it was lower (P 0. 05). The crude protein and crude fat contents of fi nished samples within a study district were higher (P < 0. 01) than those of raw and roasted samples, respectively. Roasting {{had no effect on}} the crude protein content of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> samples. The crude ash content of raw and roasted lupin samples within a study district was higher (P < 0. 01) than that of fi nished lupin samples of the respective study districts. The content of quinolizidine alkaloids of fi nished lupin samples was lower than that of raw and roasted samples. There was also an interaction effect between location and lupin sample type. The traditional processing method of <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> in Ethiopia has a positive contribution improving the crude protein and crude fat content, and lowering the alkaloid content of the fi nished product.

Effect on muscle fatty acid composition was also evaluated. All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isoenergetic and to contain approximately 45 % crude protein and 5. 5 kcal energy g/diet. Diets were formulated to include whole <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> meal at 0, 10, 15, and 20 %. Triplicate groups of fish weighing 65. 9 ± 15. 1 g on average were fed twice a day until apparent satiation during 12 wk. Growth, feed intake, hepatosomatic index, hepatic histology, proximate composition of whole body, and muscular fatty acid profile were determined. Growth and feed utilization were similar in all treatments and whole-body composition did not vary among treatments. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n- 6 and n- 3 series remained constant in muscle {{as the amount of}} lupin in diets increased. Furthermore, the ADCs were similar among all diets. These results suggest that inclusion of whole <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> meal up to 20 % in extruded diets for rainbow trout do not have any negative effect on growth, feed performance, or flesh quality. © Copyright by the World Aquaculture Society 201...|$|R
40|$|Replacement {{of marine}} {{proteins}} and oils in feeds for carnivorous fishes such as salmonids {{has been identified}} as a key research area. Alternative proteins and oils from vegetable and terrestrial-animal sources can effectively replace marine products, although often growth is the only criteria used to assess their potential. On few occasions has the health of the animal been considered. This research aimed to evaluate what effect alternative protein and oil sources had on growth, immune function and disease resistance when fed to Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., parr. Locally available proteins from vegetable and terrestrial-animal sources were initially 'screened' by feeding to salmon to determine any deleterious effects on blood chemistry or immune function. While no significant differences (P> 0. 05) were observed, data suggested certain proteins stimulate immunoglobulin production compared to fish meal-fed controls. In a short term experiment, four of these proteins (corn gluten, <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin,</b> feather meal and poultry meal) were fed to salmon that had been acclimating on a fish meal-based control feed, although the change in protein source did not significantly affect feed consumption or immune function. Growth of salmon fed <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin,</b> a mixture of <b>dehulled</b> <b>lupin</b> and feather meal, or fish meal were not significantly different in a longer term study, although salmon fed feather meal were found to have significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) growth compared to those fed fish meal. Further, no significant differences were recorded in immune function or resistance to Vibrio anguillarum infection. Lysine is usually the first limiting amino acid when alternative protein sources are used in salmon feeds, although the immune response of salmon fed a range of lysine concentrations below or above known requirement was not significantly altered. Three feeds containing canola oil, a mixture of canola and fish oil, or a mixture of canola oil and a marine microheterotroph (Thraustochytrid) meal, did not affect salmon blood chemistry or immune function. Salmon fed the combination of canola and fish oils however had significantly lower (P < 0. 05) cumulative mortality after V. anguillarum challenge compared to the remaining feeds. Finally, sunflower oil was used to gradually replace fish oil to alter the dietary omega- 3 : omega- 6 (n- 3 /n- 6) ratio. Although growth and immune function did not differ between feeds, significant differences in cumulative mortality were recorded after challenge with V. anguillarum but they were not correlated to dietary n- 3 /n- 6 ratio. Experiments generally demonstrated alternative protein and oil sources could be used in Atlantic salmon feeds without affecting growth, blood chemistry or immune function. Disease resistance however was shown to be altered when dietary oil or n- 3 /n- 6 ratio was changed, although exact mechanisms for these differences are unclear, and warrant further study...|$|R
