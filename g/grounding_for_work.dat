The system of 'reformation' through a programme lasting years was dropped and instead the sentencing regime more closely mirrored that for the broader prison population.

40|$|During {{the process}} of {{marketing}} planning, global brands must decide to what extent they adapt {{to the culture of}} the location in which they are expanding. This paper investigates the means with which a global brand such as Starbucks deals with the various cultural, sociological, and anthropological factors in the 72 countries where it currently operates. The brand's communication is closely analysed along with the dimensions of the national cultures of two countries: France and the Czech Republic. This is also achieved by employing the sociological concept of Oldenburg's third place, through which the role of cafés in different cultures is examined in order to contextualise the primary research component. A combination of methods is applied including document analysis, interviews, and a partial observational field research to expose the ways in which Starbucks' customers use the café in different countries. Correlations between the national dimensions {{and the use of the}} third place provided by Starbucks illuminate, for example, the difference between the relatively feminine French who socialise inside the café and the relatively masculine Czechs who often come to seek neutral <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> related activities.
