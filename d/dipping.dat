40|$|Defective interfering {{particles}} (<b>DIPs)</b> are virus-like {{particles that}} arise during virus growth, fail {{to grow in}} the absence of virus, and replicate at the expense of virus during co-infections. The inhibitory effects of <b>DIPs</b> on virus growth are well established, but little is known about how <b>DIPs</b> influence their own growth. Here vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and its <b>DIPs</b> were used to co-infect BHK cells, and the effect of <b>DIP</b> dose on virus and <b>DIP</b> production was measured using a yield-reduction assay. The resulting dose–response data were used to fit and evaluate mathematical models that employed different assumptions. Our analysis supports a multiple-hit process where <b>DIPs</b> inhibit or promote virus and <b>DIP</b> production, depending on dose. Specifically, three regimes of co-infection were apparent: (i) low <b>DIP</b> – where both virus and <b>DIPs</b> are amplified, (ii) medium <b>DIP</b> – where amplification of both virus and <b>DIPs</b> is inhibited, and (iii) high <b>DIP</b> – with limited recovery of virus production and further inhibition of <b>DIP</b> growth. In addition, serial-passage infections enabled us to estimate the frequency of de novo <b>DIP</b> generation during virus amplification. Our combined experiments and models provide a means to understand better how <b>DIPs</b> quantitatively impact the growth of viruses and the spread of their infections...|$|R

30|$|From Eq. (3), the {{magnitude}} of the P 2 force is linearly proportional to the <b>dip</b> angle regardless of the <b>dip</b> length. Figure  7 b and c shows the dynamic wheel forces (P 2 forces are from their low-pass filtering) and axle box accelerations. It can be seen that their magnitudes are related to the <b>dip</b> angles regardless of the <b>dip</b> length, but their frequencies are not related to either <b>dip</b> angles or <b>dip</b> lengths. Therefore, the relationship between the accelerations on a locomotive component and the <b>dip</b> angles of <b>dipped</b> rail defects is important for monitoring the development of those defects.|$|R

Functions of <b>Dip</b> 2 a in embryonic development and adult are not known. To investigate <b>Dip</b> 2 a gene expression and function in embryo and adult, a <b>Dip</b> 2 a-LacZ mouse model was generated by insertion of β-Gal cDNA after <b>Dip</b> 2 a promoter using CRISPR/Cas 9 technology. <b>Dip</b> 2 a-LacZ mouse was designed to be a lacZ reporter mouse as well as a <b>Dip</b> 2 a knockout mouse. Heterozygous mice were used to study endogenous <b>Dip</b> 2 a expression and homozygotes to study <b>DIP</b> 2 A-associated structure and function. LacZ staining indicated that <b>Dip</b> 2 a is broadly expressed in neuronal, reproductive and vascular tissues, as well as in heart, kidney, liver and lung. Results demonstrate that <b>Dip</b> 2 a is expressed in ectoderm-derived tissues in developing embryos. Adult tissues showed rich staining in neurons, mesenchymal, endothelial, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes by cell types. The expression pattern highly overlaps with FSTL 1 and supports previous report that <b>DIP</b> 2 A to be potential receptor of FSTL 1 and its protective roles of cardiomyocytes.

5|$|Uplift {{caused by}} a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70mya to the early Paleocene. This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying basins between them {{gradually}} subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land {{in the area to}} form the up to 5° <b>dipping</b> Bryce Canyon Anticline. All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An angular unconformity therefore exists along the anticline's crest. The park also sits on the western gently <b>dipping</b> flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed {{as a result of the}} Laramide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract— Voltage <b>dips</b> {{constitute}} to {{a noticeable}} part of power quality (PQ) problems but causing major financial losses to industrial and commercial customers. This work involves comparative studies {{to choose the}} most appropriate location of monitoring <b>dips</b> for regulation. In this paper, a Dutch MV network is used and <b>dip</b> monitoring locations are considered at different points of connections (POC) where customers are connected. To estimate the number of <b>dips</b> per year, simulations are performed on the network using PowerFactory. The voltage <b>dip</b> profiles at the selected monitoring point are analyzed for phase and line voltage <b>dips.</b> The effects of distributed generation (DG) on the voltage <b>dips</b> are also observed and the transfer of voltage <b>dips</b> from MV to LV network is briefly discussed. To analyze {{the effects of the}} expected <b>dips</b> on industrial equipment, severity curves are applied onto the standard <b>dip</b> tables...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{the right and left}} piriform fossae {{generate}} two deep <b>dips</b> on speech spectra and that acoustic interaction exists in generating the dips: if only one piriform fossa is modified, both the <b>dips</b> change in frequency and amplitude. In the present study, using a simple geometrical model and measured vocal tract shapes, the acoustic interaction was examined by the finite-difference time-domain method. As a result, one of the two <b>dips</b> was lower in frequency than the two independent <b>dips</b> that appeared when either of the piriform fossae was occluded, and the other <b>dip</b> was higher in frequency than the two <b>dips.</b> At the lower <b>dip</b> frequency, the piriform fossae resonated almost in opposite phase, while at the higher <b>dip</b> frequency, they resonated almost in phase. These facts indicate that the piriform fossae and {{the lower part of the}} pharynx can be modeled as a coupled two-oscillator system whose two normal vibration modes generate the two spectral <b>dips.</b> When the piriform fossae were identical, only the higher <b>dip</b> appeared. This is because the lower mode is not acoustically coupled to the main vocal tract enough to generate an absorption <b>dip...</b>|$|R
