5|$|On 2 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 {{landed at}} Kuwait International Airport four {{hours after the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 G-AWND, was destroyed, and all {{passengers}} and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|No {{military}} operations {{were conducted by}} NATO during the Cold War. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{also became}} {{involved}} in Operation Granby following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time, and deployed that year in December. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station {{for the families of}} service personnel serving during the Gulf War. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited one of these groups in February 1991.|$|E
50|$|The Armenian {{population}} {{reached its}} peak of 12,000. But after the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasions,</b> the numbers <b>of</b> the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500 {{as they left the}} country.|$|R
50|$|Abu Ghaith first gained {{attention}} {{during the}} 1990-1991 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and occupation <b>of</b> Kuwait. His sermons denouncing the occupation and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gained him {{some degree of}} popularity amongst the Kuwaiti people. The Kuwaiti government subsequently removed him from the mosque and banned him from giving sermons, and he became {{a high school teacher}} of religion.|$|R
50|$|The Armenians in Kuwait {{are people}} of Armenian descent living in Kuwait. As of 2013, {{there has been}} a large {{population}} increase and now the Armenians number 6,000. Before the Gulf War, the Armenian population reached its peak of 12,000. But after the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasions,</b> the numbers <b>of</b> the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500 as they left the country.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing {{prepared}} to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{the fleet}} was {{regularly}} involved in crises; to deter an <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in 1962, in Tanganyika in 1964, and in Indonesia from 1964 to 1966. The Beira Patrol blocking oil supplies to Rhodesia began in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|The zoo {{suffered}} extensive damages {{during the}} 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion.</b> Nevertheless, most <b>of</b> the maintenance {{work has been}} finished, and the zoo reopened after the modification and renovation work was completed. Part of these renovations in early 1993 included the addition of new animals from other zoos. The zoo is around 180,000 m2 in area. It is divided into four major sections: ...|$|R
50|$|On 5 November 1981, Pope John Paul II {{appointed}} Micallef as {{the third}} Apostolic Vicar of Kuwait. He was consecrated by the Pope himself on {{the feast of the}} Epiphany 1982. On 15 January of the same year, he was officially installed as the Apostolic Vicar of Kuwait and Titular Bishop of Tinis in Proconsulari. Micallef remained in Kuwait City during the 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion,</b> one <b>of</b> the few Westerners to do so. Bishop Micallef retired on 14 July 2005 and was succeeded by Bishop Camillo Ballin. On 20 October, Bishop Micallef bid farewell to the Vicariate at a special ceremony in the Cathedral of the Holy Family in Kuwait City.|$|R
25|$|On November 4, 1990, the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery was {{deployed}} to defend Saudi Arabia from <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> as part <b>of</b> Operation Desert Shield in late December 1990. When {{the defense of}} Saudi Arabia mission {{gave way to the}} liberation of Kuwait, 4-27 FA provided extensive fire support for the 1st Armored Division. During the ensuing 96 hours of Operation Desert Storm, the battalion unleashed major bombardments with their 27 M270 MLRS launchers against Iraqi forces.|$|R
25|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia {{joined the}} anti-Iraq Coalition. King Fahd, fearing an attack from Iraq, invited American and Coalition {{soldiers}} to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi troops and aircraft {{took part in}} the subsequent military operations.|$|E
25|$|As of 1983 {{the branch}} {{was led by}} Faisal al-Sani. The Kuwaiti Ba'ath Party branch {{collapsed}} during Gulf War because of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. Saleh al-Mutlaq, {{the leader of the}} Iraqi National Dialogue Front, has been accused of trying to rebuild the party.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{year after}} the 37th TFW saw combat in Panama, in {{response}} to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the 415th TFS of the 37th TFW was deployed to King Khalid International Airport, Saudi Arabia on 19 August to provide air defense over the Saudi capital of Riyadh.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and {{occupation}} <b>of</b> Kuwait was unanimously condemned by all major world powers. Even countries traditionally {{considered to be}} close Iraqi allies, such as France and India, called for immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Several countries, including the USSR and China, placed arms embargoes on Iraq. NATO members were particularly critical of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and by late 1990, the United States had issued an ultimatum to Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait by 15 January 1991 or face war.|$|R
5000|$|Political themes {{have often}} {{served as an}} {{inspirational}} source for Janson, and {{he is one of}} the few Norwegian composers who have had a demonstration held against a performance of one of his works, Interlude for orchestra og accordeon, a work written as a salute to Arne Treholt, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage for the Soviet Union in a trial in 1985. In the more humorous-political genre, Valse Triste marks a milestone - and is viewed as a critical collage of early 70s Norwegian cultural debate. More recent works with a clear political trait includes 2003’s A Bagdad Blues (not for Blair, not for Bush) [...] which Janson wrote in protest against the Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the next}} 4 years (1986-1990) {{he was a}} {{lecturer}} in the Academy of Music in Kuwait. At {{this period of time}} he created compositions with Arabic influences. The most well known composition in Poland that emerged from this period of time was the symphonic fantasia [...] "Faces of the Desert". This composition was supposed {{to be used in the}} celebration of the 30th anniversary of Kuwait’s independence, but the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> precluded realization <b>of</b> the event. After the Persian Gulf War, the [...] "Faces of the Desert" [...] (which was visualized by photos of artist-photographer Jacek Wozniak [...] ) represented Kuwait on the Global Exhibition EXPO’92 in Seville, Spain.|$|R
25|$|One of Brandt's last public {{appearances}} was in flying to Baghdad, Iraq, to free Western hostages held by Saddam Hussein, following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in 1990. Brandt secured {{the release of}} a large number of them, and on 9 November 1990, his airplane landed with 174 freed hostages on board at the Frankfurt Airport.|$|E
25|$|Khuzestan is ethnically diverse, {{home to many}} {{different}} ethnic groups. This has a bearing on Khuzestan's electoral politics, with ethnic minority rights playing {{a significant role in}} the province's political culture. The province's geographical location bordering Iraq and its oil resources also make it a politically sensitive region, particularly given its history of foreign intervention, notably the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> 1980.|$|E
25|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in August 1990 {{had put the}} Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.|$|E
50|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and {{occupation}} <b>of</b> Kuwait {{at the start}} of August 1990, the United Nations imposed sanctions against Iraq, and asked that member nations contribute forces to help implement them. On 31 August, the Danish Parliament decided that a single ship, Olfert Fischer, would make up the Danish contribution. The corvette was to enforce the UN sanctions only; she was not to become involved in the developing Gulf War. She was accompanied and supported by a Norwegian supply ship. The Gulf War deployment, which ended in September 2001, was the first time a Danish warship had operated outside the European region. The deployment marked a change in Danish attitudes and actions towards international security and foreign policy.|$|R
5000|$|During the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Lebanon in 1982, the Israeli army seized {{some of his}} {{paintings}} {{from one of the}} exhibits of Beirut. Other paintings of his were also lost in Kuwait during the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ken Silverstein, one of Lake's primary critics, {{has claimed}} his past sources lacked {{credibility}} {{and have been}} used to manipulate the discourse on national security. Silverstein accused Lake’s reporting of supporting WMDs prior to the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iraq. Silverstein cited an article that Lake had written in 2006 during the war in Iraq. [...] In this article Lake reported that a Pentagon Special Investigator named David Gaubatz had been led to sealed storage facilities of chemical and biological weapons. [...] Gaubatz reported his findings but the military failed to follow-up. Eight years later The New York Times reported on these aging stockpiles of chemical weapons and how they were never destroyed and posed risks to the soldier’s involved with storing the hazardous materials. [...] Furthermore, Lake’s reporting on U.S. intelligence prior to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> was one <b>of</b> the first major pieces of journalism to highlight the CIA’s concerns with intelligence gathered by the Pentagon and Iraqi opposition figure, Ahmad Chalabi.|$|R
25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was {{the focus}} of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, leading to the flight of {{thousands}} of the province's residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling the Iraqi military's advance, and ultimately opening a window of opportunity for an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle East, {{faced by}} the 1958 {{collapse}} of the Baghdad Pact {{and the spread of}} Soviet influence, Macmillan acted decisively to restore the confidence of Persian Gulf allies, using the Royal Air Force and special forces to defeat a revolt backed by Saudi Arabia and Egypt against the Sultan of Oman, Said bin Taimur, in July 1957; deploying airborne battalions to defend Jordan against Syrian subversion in July 1958,; and deterring a threatened <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait by landing a brigade group in July 1960.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the autumn}} of 1980 and the summer of 1990, the number of {{aircraft}} in the IQAF went from 332 to over 1000. Before the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, the IQAF had expected 16 modern Dassault Mirage F.1EQs from France and were also {{in the middle of}} receiving a total of 240 new aircraft and helicopters from their Eastern European allies. When Iraq invaded Iran in late September 1980, the Soviets and the French stopped delivery of additional aircraft to Iraq but resumed deliveries a few months later.|$|E
50|$|Converted to {{provisional}} {{status and}} activated as an Air Expeditionary Wing during 2003 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iraq in March 2003. Inactivated after 90 days of duty due to Air-Force intensive active combat phase <b>of</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> having been completed.|$|R
2500|$|... {{retired in}} 2003 - Although not {{supplied}} by Egypt, Iraq {{was able to}} capture most of the Kuwaiti vehicles in the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> kuwait.

After the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> in 2003, the Iraqi army is not reported to be using them.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the 9th Engineers {{prepared}} {{to participate in}} the 2003 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iraq, by deploying select personnel with a large fleet of vehicles to Turkey, but that was cancelled because of Turkish refusal {{to participate in the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following the {{imposition}} and {{passing of the}} Resolution 660, Resolution 661, and the Resolution 665, Sharif sided with the United Nations on <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. A major international incident {{took place in the}} Middle East with Iraq invading the Kuwait which dismayed the world. Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq. The relationships continued to be strained as Pakistan seek to tighten its relations with Iran, and his foreign policy continued by Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf until the removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait, on August 2, 1990 an Iraqi Air Force Sukhoi Su-22 {{from the}} No.109 Squadron (based at as-Shoibiyah AB) fired a single Kh-25MP anti-radar variant against a Kuwaiti MIM-23B I-HAWK SAM site at Bubiyan Island that had earlier downed another Su-22 {{from the same}} unit and a MiG-23BN from the 49th Squadron. This forced a radar {{shutdown}} on the HAWK. The HAWK battery (which was operated by some American contractors) was later captured by Iraqi special forces and found out to be in automatic mode of operation, after the contractors fled.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 {{billion in}} support of Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq War. However, Saudi Arabia {{condemned}} the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in 1990 and asked the US to intervene. King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government {{and many of its}} citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments' support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.|$|E
50|$|Following the Ba'athist <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and {{occupation}} <b>of</b> Kuwait, during the Persian Gulf War, on August 2, 1990, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and {{senior members of}} his government fled to Saudi Arabia, where {{they set up a}} government-in-exile in Ta'if. The Kuwaiti government in exile was far more affluent than most other such governments, having full disposal of the very considerable Kuwaiti assets in western banks—of which it made use to conduct a massive propaganda campaign denouncing the Ba'athist Iraqi occupation and mobilizing public opinion in the western hemisphere in favor of war with Ba'athist Iraq. In March 1991, following the defeat of Ba'athist Iraq at the hands of coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War, the Sheikh and his government were able to return to Kuwait.|$|R
5000|$|The Kuwaiti Government-in-exile (الحكومة الكويتية في المنفى) was the government-in-exile of Kuwait {{following}} the Ba'athist <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and occupation <b>of</b> Kuwait, during the Gulf War.

50|$|The Hawke Government {{committed}} Australian {{naval forces}} to the 1991 Gulf War {{in support of the}} United States led coalition against the Saddam Hussein <b>Iraqi</b> regime's <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> neighbouring Kuwait. Following the end of the Cold War, the 1990s was a busy period for United Nations peacekeeping missions, and the Keating Government committed Australian forces to various theatres: at one point during 1993, Australia had some 3000 peacekeepers committed to the field, including a large number in Cambodia and Somalia. Foreign Minister Gareth Evans had taken {{a leading role in the}} organisation of a peace settlement for Cambodia in the aftermath of the genocidal regime of Pol Pot and Australia contributed the force commander. While the United Nations intervention in Cambodia was largely successful, the Somali intervention ended poorly. The following year, the Rwandan Genocide commenced in Central Africa, and, following the Somali experience, the international community was this time slow to intervene. The Keating Government despatched medical staff to aid in the belated UN Mission to that nation.|$|R
