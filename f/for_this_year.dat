Wills insisted that Bill Power’s departure from the club was purely because of health reasons and that Power’s £1million investment was in the form of shares but that the former investor considered it a loan and wanted it back.|$|E

25|$|The Maritime Festivals {{were founded}} by Gerard Richardson MBE and {{organised}} by the Whitehaven Festival Company, {{made up of}} a board of volunteers, who organised 17 major events between 1999 and 2015. The Company was closed in 2016. They organised the Queen's visit to Whitehaven in June 2008, followed by the Status Quo gig in August of that year. The company staged two events in August 2009. The first was the redesigned festival (known <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> as the Whitehaven Food Festival, although it did still feature tall ships) which offered the usual wide variety of attractions, both around the southern half of the harbour and at St. Nicholas' Church, on 8–9 August. The second event, the following week, was the Here and Now Gig (a music concert with 1980s pop icons). For the June 2010 festival, which was similar in format to 2009, the music performances (Status Quo, N-Dubz and Katherine Jenkins) were moved to the harbour area.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, {{at the age}} of 25, Neill {{enrolled}} in the University of Edinburgh. He began as an agriculture student, at his father's behest for a well-salaried career, but switched to English literature {{by the end of his}} first year. Neill was excluded from cultural events due to his lack of funds, but participated in sports, showed interest in the military, and wrote for The Student (the university magazine) and the Glasgow Herald. He became the student paper's editor during his last year, which opened Neill to a world of culture. He also felt more confident to pursue women. In his editorials, Neill criticized the tedium of lectures and the emphasis on tests instead of critical thinking. He began to develop his thoughts about the futility of forced education, and the axiom that all learning came from intrinsic interest. Neill graduated in 1912 and began to edit encyclopedias and similar reference books. He took a new job as art editor of the Piccadilly Magazine, but its operations were halted by the 1914 onset of World War I, in which he served as an officer in the army. He returned to Scotland, working as a headteacher at Gretna Green School, during the first year of the war. The diary he wrote <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> was published as a book, A Dominie's Log, in November 1915 by Herbert Jenkins, and received good reviews for its humour and narrative style.|$|E

500|$|About a {{month before}} the end of the season, Black pitched his final {{professional}} baseball game. During the height of the 1948 pennant race, on September 13 in Cleveland, Black suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while batting in the second inning during a home game against the St. Louis Browns. He had fouled off a pitch into the upper deck of the stadium, and then collapsed holding onto his neck. He was able to walk to the dugout under his own power, but had lost consciousness by the time an ambulance arrived. Black was taken to St. Vincent Charity Hospital and was conscious for a time, but lapsed into a coma. His doctor noted that he was likely to make a full recovery, though he was [...] "through with baseball <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> and possibly for good." [...] After a few days in critical condition, he had begun to recover and his condition was reported to have improved greatly.|$|E
500|$|The season {{shifts to}} the later 10 pm timeslot, {{allowing}} it {{to take on a}} darker, more mature tone than previous seasons.

[...] The timeslot gave the series the opportunity to present an increased level of violence and partial nudity, as well as take more risks and present edgier themes. Following the third-season finale, Tancharoen stated that the fourth season would explore the guilt Daisy Johnson has over Lincoln Campbell's death. Executive producer Jeffrey Bell noted the writers tried to continue the tradition of [...] "finding new combinations and new conflicts" [...] between different sets of characters, given [...] "a lot of procedurals [...] the same people doing the same thing for five years". Pairings that would be explored included Coulson and Mack, continuing from the end of season three, who have a mutual respect for one another due to their relationships with Johnson, and Leo Fitz and Holden Radcliffe, who work together. The Fitz-Simmons relationship was also explored more, examining the new challenges it presented for the two [...] "working together, loving each other and living together." ...|$|E
