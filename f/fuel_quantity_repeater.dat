Soot measurement was implemented by two-color pyrometry under quiescent type diesel engine conditions (1000 K and 21 % O 2 concentration). Different <b>fuel</b> <b>quantities,</b> which correspond to different injection widths from 0. 5 ms to 2 ms under constant injection pressure (1000 bar), {{were used to}} simulate different loads in engines.

Another difference occurs at the end of combustion due to the termination of fuel injection. Additionally, BTL flame has a lower soot temperature, especially under a larger <b>fuel</b> <b>quantity</b> (2 ms injection width). Meanwhile, average soot level is lower for BTL flame, especially under a lower <b>fuel</b> <b>quantity</b> (0. 5 ms injection width). BTL shows an overall low sooting behavior with low soot temperature compared to diesel, however, trade-off between soot level and soot temperature needs to be carefully selected when different loads are used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that dual-fuel engines at part load inevitably suffer from lower thermal {{efficiency}} and higher emission of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel. A quasi-two-zone com-bustionmodel hasbeendeveloped for studying the second-lawanalysis of adual-fuel (diesel-gas) engine operating under part load conditions. This quasi-two-zone combustion model is able to establish the development of combustion process with time and associated important operat-ing parameters, such as pressure, temperature, heat release rate, and species concentration. The present study is an attempt to investigate the combustion phenomenon from the second law point of view at part load and increasing pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>quantity</b> is considered to improve the above-mentionedproblems. By employingdifferent <b>quantities</b> of pilot <b>fuel,</b> it is found that increasing the pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>quantity</b> increases the work availability and reduces chemical availability of unburned fuels. Also, the results indicate that, compared to the baseline dual-fuel engine, increasing the pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>quantity</b> in about 12 per cent results in an increase of 23 per cent in availability destruc-tion and 29 per cent in the second law efficiency. This enhancement is due to a better combustion progress and increased indicated work when a high amount of pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>quantity</b> is employed...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This thesis {{presents}} the development, experimentation and validation of {{a reliable and}} robust system to monitor the injector pulse generated by an Engine Control Module (ECM) and send the corresponding <b>fueling</b> <b>quantity</b> to the real-time computer in a closed loop Hardware In the Loop (HIL) bench. The system can be easily calibrated for different engine platforms as well. The <b>fueling</b> <b>quantity</b> that is being injected by the injectors is a crucial variable to run closed loop HIL simulation {{to carry out the}} performance testing of engine, aftertreatment and other components of the vehicle. This research utilized Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfer capability offered by National Instruments (NI) Compact Reconfigurable Input-Output (cRIO) to achieve high speed data acquisition and delivery. The research was conducted in three stages. The first stage was to develop the HIL bench for the research. The second stage was to determine the performance of the system with different threshold methods and different sampling speeds necessary to satisfy the required accuracy of the <b>fueling</b> <b>quantity</b> being monitored. The third stage was to study the error and its variability involved in the injected <b>fueling</b> <b>quantity</b> from pulse to pulse, from injector to injector, between real injector stators and cheaper inductor load cells emulating the injectors, over different operating conditions with full factorial design of experimentation and mixed model Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA). Different thresholds were experimented to find out the best thresholds, the Start of Injection (SOI) threshold and the End of Injection (EOI) threshold that captured the injector “ontime” with best reliability and accuracy. Experimentation has been carried out at various data acquisition rates to find out the optimum speed of data sampling rate, trading off the accuracy of <b>fueling</b> <b>quantity.</b> The experimentation found out the expected error with a system with cheaper solution as well, so that, if a test application is not sensitive to error in <b>fueling</b> <b>quantity,</b> a cheaper solution with lower sampling rate and inductors as load cells can be used. The statistical analysis was carried out at highest available sampling rate on both injectors and inductors with the best threshold method found in previous studies. The result clearly shows the factors that affect the error and the variability in the standard deviations in error; it also shows the relation with the fixed and random factors. The real-time application developed for the HIL bench is capable of monitoring the injector waveform, using any fueling ontime table corresponding to the platform being tested, and delivering the <b>fueling</b> <b>quantity</b> in real-time.

Natural gas and hydrogen have been extensively tested in dual fuel mode in a compression ignition engine. Many studies conclude that the emissions, especially those oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are expected to form in the region around the pilot spray where high temperatures exist and the equivalence ratio is close to stoichiometric. The effect of changing the pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>quantity</b> has not been widely reported. This study investigates the effect of changing pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>quantity,</b> and type {{and the effect of}} this change on various combustion (ignition delay, in-cylinder pressure and rate of energy release) and emission (specific NOx and hydrocarbons) parameters. Dual fueling of natural gas and hydrogen exhibit an increased ignition delay compared to the ignition delay exhibited by the pilot fuel at similar operating conditions. For dual fueling cases, the ignition delay is reduced as the <b>quantity</b> of pilot <b>fuel</b> is increased. ?? 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
