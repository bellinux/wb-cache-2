500|$|Prisoners {{felt their}} {{complaints}} about conditions were being ignored. Remand prisoners were only allowed {{out of their}} cells for 18hours per week, and Category A prisoners were locked in their cells for 22hours a day, and rarely left their cells except for [...] "slopping out", a one-hour <b>exercise</b> <b>period</b> each day or a weekly shower. In March 1990, Dominic Noonan was transferred from Strangeways to HM Prison Hull. Noonan was the organiser of the Prisoners' League Association (PLA), an organisation formed in 1989 which campaigned for prisoners' rights. Its aims included initiating legal proceedings against prison staff for mistreatment of prisoners, and picketing outside prisons in which prisoners were mistreated. The PLA were active at Strangeways Prison, and Noonan's transfer demonstrates prison officers were aware of rising tensions inside the prison. On 26 March, Barry Morton {{was taken to the}} [...] "punishment block" [...] and strip-searched after being visited by his mother, as prison officers believed she had brought drugs into the prison for him. During a struggle he sustained a black eye and swollen nose, and the following day he was released back into the main prison along with another prisoner, Tony Bush. Later the same day, Bush and Morton climbed onto the roof of the prison and staged a twenty-hour rooftop protest. On 31 March there was a 30-minute sit-down protest in the chapel after a film was shown, which ended after a prison officer promised to listen to the prisoners' grievances. The same evening it is reported that a black prisoner was assaulted by prison officers in front of other prisoners, and injected with Largactil [...] a sedative used to control prisoners, known in prisons as the [...] "liquid cosh". Prisoners then decided to stage a further protest in the chapel the following day, 1 April.|$|E

40|$|Recently, a {{new method}} has been {{proposed}} to detect the onset of neuromuscular fatigue during an incremental cycling test by assessing the changes in spectral electromyographic (sEMG) frequencies within individual <b>exercise</b> <b>periods</b> of the test. The method consists on determining the highest power output that can be sustained without {{a significant decrease in}} spectral frequencies. This study evaluated the validity of the new approach by assessing the changes in spectral indicators both throughout the whole test and within individual <b>exercise</b> <b>periods</b> of the test. Fourteen cyclists performed incremental cycle ergometer rides to exhaustion with bipolar surface EMG signals recorded from the vastus lateralis. The mean and median frequencies (Fmean and Fmedian, respectively) of the sEMG power spectrum were calculated. The main findings were: (1) Examination of spectral indicators within individual <b>exercise</b> <b>periods</b> of the test showed that neither Fmean nor Fmedian decreased significantly during the last (most fatiguing) <b>exercise</b> <b>periods.</b> (2) Examination of the whole incremental test showed that the behaviour of Fmean and Fmedian with increasing power output was highly inconsistent and varied greatly among subjects. (3) Over the whole incremental test, half of the participants exhibited a positive relation between spectral indicators and workload, whereas the other half demonstrated the opposite behavior. Collectively, these findings indicate that spectral sEMG indexes do not provide a reliable measure of the fatigue state of the muscle during an incremental cycling test. Moreover, it is concluded that {{it is not possible to}} determine the onset of neuromuscular fatigue during an incremental cycling test by examining spectral indicators within individual <b>exercise</b> <b>periods</b> of the test...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: 1) to evaluate the method used for estimating the neuromuscular fatigue threshold from surface electromyographic amplitude (the PWCFT test) during a single incremental cycling workout using 1 -minute <b>exercise</b> <b>periods,</b> and 2) to investigate the possible associations between PWCFT and metabolic (onset of blood lactate accumulation [OBLA]) and ventilatory (ventilatory threshold [VT] and respiratory compensation point [RCP]) variables. Sixteen cyclists performed incremental cycle ergometer rides to exhaustion with bipolar surface sEMG signals recorded from the vastus lateralis. Subsequently, participants performed one constant-workload exercise test at 100 % of their PWCFT. During the incremental test, the power output at PWCFT was not correlated with that of OBLA (P> 0. 05), but it {{was positively correlated with}} those of VT and RCP (P 0. 05). The average duration of the constant-workload exercise was 8 - 9 minutes.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe an original approach to assessing individual workload during international rugby union competitions. The difference between positional groups and between the two halves was explored. Sixty-seven files from 30 French international rugby union players were assessed on a computerised player-tracking system (Amisco Pro®, Sport Universal Process, Nice, France) during five international games. Each player's action was split up into <b>exercise</b> and recovery <b>periods</b> according to his individual velocity threshold. Exercise-to-recovery (E:R) period ratios and acceleration were calculated. Results indicated that about 65 % of <b>exercise</b> <b>periods</b> lasted less than 4 s; half of the E:Rs were less than 1 : 4, and about one-third ranged between 1 and 1 : 4 and about 40 % of <b>exercise</b> <b>periods</b> were classified as medium intensity. Most acceleration values were less than 3 m·s 2 and started from standing or walking activity. Back row players showed the highest mean acceleration values over the game (P < 0. 05). No significant decrease in physical performance was seen between the first and second halves of the games except for back rows, who showed a significant decrease in mean acceleration (P < 0. 05). The analysis of results emphasised the specific activity of back rows and tended to suggest that the players' combinations of action and recovery times were optimal for preventing large decrease in the physical performance...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic rate remains {{elevated}} above resting {{levels for}} prolonged <b>periods</b> after <b>exercise</b> in both ectotherms and endotherms, {{a phenomenon that}} was termed excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) by Gaesser and Brooks (1984).

Thus, factors that influence recovery metabolic rate following even brief activity may have a large impact on the metabolic cost of activity. Brief activity prior to an exercise bout, commonly termed warm-up in endotherms, is known to influence recovery metabolic rate in mammals (Robergs et al., 1991; Gerbino et al., 1996), but its impact on recovery in ectotherms that typically move using burst locomotion and have extended recovery periods is unclear.
