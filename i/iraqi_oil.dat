In Pakistan, 300,000 people showed up in a rally in Lahore to show solidarity with Egypt while in Karachi a mob chanting anti-British slogans burned down the British High Commission. In Syria, the military government blew up the Kirkuk–Baniyas pipeline that allowed <b>Iraqi</b> <b>oil</b> to reach tankers in the Mediterranean to punish Iraq for supporting the invasion, and to cut Britain off from one of its main routes for taking delivery of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>oil.</b> King Saud of Saudi Arabia imposed a total oil embargo on Britain and France.|$|E

25|$|Some {{also argue}} that foreign {{contractors}} are doing work which could be done by unemployed Iraqis, which might be a factor fueling resentment of the occupation.

25|$|Pipelines from Kirkuk {{run through}} Turkey to Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea and {{were one of}} the two main routes for the export of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>oil</b> under the Oil-for-Food Programme {{following}} the Gulf War of 1991. This was in accordance with a United Nations mandate that at least 50% of the oil exports pass through Turkey. There were two parallel lines built in 1977 and 1987.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{sanctions}} {{placed upon}} Iraq when it invaded Kuwait were not lifted, blocking <b>Iraqi</b> <b>oil</b> exports. During the late 1990s, the UN considered relaxing the sanctions imposed {{because of the}} hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis. Studies dispute {{the number of people}} who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions. On 9 December 1996, Saddam's government accepted the Oil-for-Food Programme that the UN had first offered in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} {{also created}} the Development Fund for Iraq, which collected funds from oil sales. The fund was initially {{run by the}} United States and Britain to rebuild the country, and is overseen by a new advisory body composed of the United Nations and international financial institutions. In June 2004, the New York Times reported that American authorities spent $2.5 billion from <b>Iraqi</b> <b>oil</b> revenue despite agreements that the oil revenues should be set aside for use after the restoration of Iraq's sovereignty.|$|E

25|$|The British Empire was {{severely}} {{weakened by the}} war. In the Middle East, the war had made Britain conscious of its dependence on Arab oil. British firms controlled <b>Iraqi</b> <b>oil</b> and Britain ruled Kuwait, Bahrain and the Emirates. Shortly after VE Day, the Labour Party won the general election in Britain. Although Labour Party conferences had for years called {{for the establishment of}} a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour government now decided to maintain the 1939 White Paper policies.|$|E
25|$|After 1996, 13% of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>oil</b> {{sales were}} {{allocated}} for Iraqi Kurdistan and {{this led to}} a relative prosperity in the region. Saddam had established an oil smuggling route through territory controlled by the KDP, with the active involvement of senior Barzani family members. The taxation of this trade at the crossing point between Saddam’s territory and Kurdish controlled territory and then into Turkey, along with associated service revenue, meant that whoever controlled Dohuk and Zakho had the potential to earn several million dollars a week. Direct United States mediation led the two parties to a formal ceasefire in what was termed the Washington Agreement in September 1998. It is also argued that the Oil-for-Food Programme from 1997 onward had an important effect on cessation of hostilities.|$|E
25|$|The Kirkuk field still {{forms the}} basis for {{northern}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>oil</b> production. Kirkuk has over 10 billion barrels (1.6km³) of remaining proven oil reserves. The Jambur, Bai Hassan, and Khabbaz fields are the only other currently producing oil fields in northern Iraq. While Iraq's northern oil industry remained relatively unscathed during the Iran-Iraq War, an estimated 60% of the facilities in southern and central Iraq were damaged in the Gulf War. Post-1991 fighting between Kurdish and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq resulted in temporary sabotage of the Kirkuk field's facilities. In 1996, production capacity in northern and central Iraq was estimated at between 0.7 and 1 million barrels (110,000 to 160,000 m³) per day, down from around 1.2 million barrels (190,000 m³) per day before the Gulf War.|$|E

The ODAs next mission was to work with a CIA-recruited Sheikh and assist British forces in identifying targets around Basra.

In northern Iraq in early March, a small reconnaissance team from M Squadron mounted on Honda All-terrain vehicles inserted into Iraq from Jordan, its first mission was to conduct reconnaissance of an Iraqi air base at al-Sahara. The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a U.S. McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle that flew air cover for the team and the bravery of an RAF Chinook that extracted the team under the Fedayeen's 'noses'.|$|E
