6000|$|What {{are those}} inductions and deductions, and {{how have you}} got at this hypothesis? You have {{observed}} in the first place, that the window is open; but by a train of reasoning involving many inductions and deductions, you have probably arrived long before at the general law--and {{a very good one}} it is--that windows do not open of themselves; and you therefore conclude that something has opened the window. A second general law that you have arrived at in the same way is, that tea-pots and spoons do not go out of a window spontaneously, and you are satisfied that, as they are not now where you left them, they have been removed. In the third place, you look at the marks on the windowsill, and the shoe-marks outside, and you say that in all previous experience the former <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>mark</b> has never been produced by anything else but the hand of a human being; and the same experience shows that no other animal but man at present wears shoes with hob-nails in them such as would produce the marks in the gravel. I do not know, even if we could discover any of those [...] "missing links" [...] that are talked about, that they would help us to any other conclusion! At any rate the law which states our present experience is strong enough for my present purpose. You next reach the conclusion that, as these kind [89] of marks have not been left by any other animal than man, or are liable to be formed in any other way than a man's hand and shoe, the marks in question have been formed by a man in that way. You have, further, a general law, founded on observation and experience, and that, too, is, I am sorry to say, a very universal and unimpeachable one,--that some men are thieves; and you assume at once from all these premisses--and that is what constitutes your hypothesis--that the man who made the marks outside and on the window-sill, opened the window, got into the room, and stole your tea-pot and spoons. You have now arrived at a vera causa;--you have assumed a cause which, it is plain, is competent to produce all the phenomena you have observed. You can explain all these phenomena only by the hypothesis of a thief. But that is a hypothetical conclusion, of the justice of which you have no absolute proof at all; it is only rendered highly probable by a series of inductive and deductive reasonings.|$|E

40|$|Twenty {{years have}} passed since the pottery with the written {{character}} "□" was unearthed at the Sakushu-Kotoni-Gawa Site on the campus of Hokkaido University. At that time, as regards the broken piece of pottery excavated, the author has endeavored to investigate that character "□" made on pottery in the ninth century, as being identical with the letter "夷", called the Emishi (蝦夷) in ancient Japan. After that, with the increase of similar materials mainly unearthed in many sites of the north eastern provinces and the eastern districts, several opinions have been published by investigators of ancient Japanese history and archaeology. As opposed to the written character "□" as being the very same as the letter "夷" (Emishi 蝦夷), some hold a different view, stating that the character "□" is a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>mark,</b> or a simpler form for the letter "奉", that inhabitants made when offering to their Gods. On the other side, some scholars offer an opinion that the incised or written character "□" on roofing tiles of the ancient temple and palace is the simplified letter "夷" of the Ubai (優婆夷), namely the Upasika of Sanskrit term. As regard these varying, the author indicates some doubtful points and arrives at the conclusion that the written or incised "□" on potteries and roofing tiles is same letter "夷" (Emishi) as postulated in the original research. タイトルと抄録の「□」は、「三」に「人」を重ねた文字である特別寄...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{postulate}} {{that there}} exists a common stock of Russian personal names resulting from a partial blending of national anthroponymicons. The {{main part of the}} paper focuses {{on the history of the}} personal name Ruslan which has etymological ties with the widespread Turkic name Arslan having the pre-onomastic meaning ‘lion’. The authors study the variation of the name in Russian folklore and in the 15 th– 17 th centuries documents and historical sources. They also pay particular attention to the role of Pushkin’s poem Ruslan and Ludmila in the formation of the associative background of the studied name and to various onomastic derivatives, the latter include patronyms, surnames and the female name Ruslana. The author conclude that the name Ruslan became especially popular in Soviet and post-Soviet periods when it acquired a specific “semantic aura”, namely, in Caucasus where Ruslan became a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>mark</b> of Russian identity and, thus, contributed to the unification of the anthroponymic space. This conclusion was verified in the course of a survey done among 40 respondents representing different peoples of Caucasus. For most respondents the name has positive connotations and is associated with the Turkic name Arslan and the name of Pushkin’s character. However, some respondents consider it as a “non-Muslim”, Russian name and point out that it is often perceived as such outside Russia. The history of the name Ruslan and the ways of its transonymisation can be an interesting object for further research, especially due to the emergence of new communication technologies and onomastic discourses...|$|E
40|$|My visual {{practice}} {{is concerned with}} an articulation of the 'left-out-thing', remnant or blank, produced by and embedded within technologies of representation, which themselves echo the mechanisms through which an identity is formed. As automatic, 'empty apparatus', technological devices threaten as well as construct this self image. This thesis proposes a new theoretical interpretation for art practices that engage with this empty space, or 'shifter'; understood {{as a form of}} punctuation around which meaning revolves. Indexing an object both absent and 'has been', the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>mark</b> making that falls into this category can be identified - like an hysterical symptom - as the reproduction of an unrepresentable sign. It is through my practical work, which explores the link between the photograph, the body, and the written sentence, that my contribution to the field of fine art {{practice is}} primarily offered. The way in which an image is put together or a sentence is organised can be considered as an exemplary definition of subjectivity in operation. Yet, as Ann Banfield (1987) has argued, after the invention of the lens, novelistic writing began to index a 'world without a self'. My visual work, which frequently looks like writing, attempts to construct a similar 'grammatical' form: one in which the 'I' is absent. The aim of my work is to stage or record this empty place, understood as a disturbance, impediment or failure within speech; as the text's undertow; and equated with a photographic - or optical -'unconscious'. This failure, this fault in language, detected in the lapses, gaps and silences within a body of writing or in an image - a gap upon which such language systems are nevertheless hinged - is, I suggest, both the place where technology and the non-self are linked and, paradoxically, the site where the I is constituted.

40|$|The North American {{landscape}} changed tremendously {{following the}} arrival of European settlers. Before European arrival, New England’s landscape was primarily forested. As Europeans moved inland from the eastern seaboard, they cleared the forest for settlement and agricultural use. Eventually the Industrial Revolution made a different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>mark</b> on the landscape. Starting in the late 1790 s, the textile mill industry developed throughout the region. Mills were located along swift moving rivers, which later produced power when dams were created along them. Following the early 1900 s mill production decreased, leading to the abandonment of many mills and their adjacent dammed mill ponds. However, the environmental changes wrought by the mill ponds still exist in New England’s landscape. Large volumes of fine sediment have since built up {{in some of these}} former mill ponds and concerns about the sediment and water quality have become widespread. Today many former textile mill rivers throughout the U. S and Europe have been tested in an attempt to determine current contamination levels and to apply appropriate strategies if necessary to reduce pollutants to acceptable levels. Little is known about water and sediment quality of the former mill ponds in Scituate, Rhode Island. This research sought to address this problem by conducting trace metal testing of two mill ponds in the Scituate River Watershed: Peabody Pond and Jordon Pond. Results revealed that both ponds contain pollutants from present and past sources, but that contemporary land use practices may be the most harmful to water and sediment quality. Existing mill metal piping left on the landscape and present-day motorways and urban runoff contain large quantities of suspended solids such as copper, lead and zinc with lead showing the highest concentration levels of all metals tested. This research demonstrates that our past landscape activities, specifically New England’s historic textile production, still influences present environmental conditions, and that as human activities on the landscape change, so do threats to environmental quality...|$|E
