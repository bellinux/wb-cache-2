40|$|Introduction: Accurate {{dosimetry}} at {{the interface}} {{of two different}} density medium (e. g., air cavity {{in the head and}} neck cancers and lungs in thoracic region) is a major cause of concern in external beam radiation therapy. It has been observed that there is dose variation in and around air cavities, which occur as a result of the loss of both longitudinal and lateral electronic equilibrium. Heterogeneous structures with spatial differences in functionality and sensitivity for radiation pose challenge to radiation dosimetry. This study is an attempt to evaluate the dose perturbations produced at the interface of two medium for C 0 - 60 gamma radiation. Materials and Methods: Low density polyethene foam has been used to mimic air cavity. GAFCHROMIC EBT 2 dosimetry film was used for the measurement of dose at different locations. Simulation studies were performed using DOSRZnrc user code that comes with EGSnrc V 4 2. 4. 0. Cylindrical geometry is used for all the simulations. Results and Discussion: We observed significant variation in dose for smaller fields. There is a <b>dose</b> <b>build</b> down in the backward region and a <b>dose</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> in the forward direction.

Extrapolation of thermoluminescent dosimeters readings were employed to produce invivo results, within the first 0. 1 cm of tissue. A metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) system provided on line integral dosimetry. Radiochromic film was employed as an off-axis skin dose measurement. Neodymium Iron Boron rare earth lanthanide magnets were tested for their ability remove electron contamination from photon beams produced by a linear accelerator. Results show a reduced surface and <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>dose.</b> For a 20 cm x 20 cm field size at 100 cm source surface distance (SSD) using a 0. 6 cm perspex block tray, percentage surface dose is 18 % and 32 % with and without the magnetic field applied respectively at 6 MV. A helium/air replacement system has been developed which enhances the skin sparing properties of megavoltage photon beams by replacing 25 cm of air above the phantom with helium. By combining the magnetic and helium devices the percentage surface dose is 9 % of maximum. This is due to the elimination of low energy electron contamination normally generated in the air column. Monte Carlo simulations were performed in the <b>build</b> <b>up</b> region. Using experimental and Monte Carlo generated data as input, a model has been developed to predict central axis <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>dose</b> for 6 MV photons.

The dependence of energy absorption build-up factor on incident photon energy, penetration depth, electron density and effective atomic number has also been studied. The energy absorption build-up factors increases with the penetration depth and electron density of teeth. So that the degree of violation of Lambert-Beer (I = I 0 e -Î¼t) law is less for least penetration depth and electron density. The energy absorption build-up factors for different regions of teeth are not same hence the energy absorbed by the different regions of teeth is not uniform which depends on the composition of the medium. The relative dose of gamma in different regions of teeth is also estimated. Dosimetric implication of energy absorption build-up factor in teeth has also been discussed.

40|$|Radiation {{therapy with}} {{electron}} beams {{is a technique}} that continues {{to be used by}} many clinics. The characteristic depth dose with a <b>dose</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> and rapid <b>dose</b> drop off beyond the peak dose permits a lesion to be treated with a relatively uniform dose whilst sparing deeper normal tissue. There are three general methods employed to modulate electron beams; a) Intensity Modulated Electron Therapy b) Segmented-field Electron Conformal Therapy, c) Bolus Electron Conformal Therapy, which can be used to achieve one or a combination of three aims; 1) level an irregular surface and improve dose distributions (missing tissue compensator), 2) reduce the penetration of the electron beam in certain areas (shaping isodoses closer to the distal edge of the target volume), 3) increase the surface dose at energies below 10 MeV. The most commonly employed method in a general radiotherapy practice to modify an electron beam is the application of a tissue like material (bolus) to the skin surface, in the strictest sense this is not Bolus Electron Conformal Therapy (BolusECT) but rather an element of the method as the bolus applied usually lacks sophisticated contouring. The first two methods mentioned are both technically and resource challenging for a general radiotherapy clinic. Unfortunately the application of bolus does have some limitations; it is not usually sterile and the daily application in areas where there may be ulcerated, necrotic or haemorrhaging tissue can lead to an unhygienic situation. In addition there are times when it is difficult to mould or reproducibly position the bolus to the particular surface irregularities leading to suboptimal treatment delivery. Moving the bolus to the applicator level alleviates the contact and positional reproducibility difficulties however it does introduce new challenges in understanding how this will affect the electron beam dosimetry for the clinical treatment.

Electrons have been used in radiotherapy since the early 1950 s, first produced by betatrons and then by microtrons and linacs. Modern high energy linacs typically provide, in addition to two megavoltage photon energies, several electron beam energies in the range from 4 to 22 MeV. 8. 1. 1. General shape of the depth dose curve The general shape of the central axis depth dose curve for electron beams differs from that of photon beams (see Fig. 8. 1). Figure 8. 1 (a) shows depth doses for various electron beam energies and Fig. 8. 1 (b) shows depth doses for 6 and 15 MV X ray beams. Typically, the electron beam central axis depth dose curve exhibits a high surface dose (compared with megavoltage photon beams), and the <b>dose</b> then <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> to a maximum at a certain depth referred to as the electron beam depth of dose maximum z max.

40|$|For some decades {{radiation}} therapy {{has been proved}} successful in cancer treatment. It is the major task of clinical radiation treatment planning to realise {{on the one hand}} a high level dose of radiation in the cancer tissue in order to obtain maximum tumour control. On the other hand it is obvious that it is absolutely necessary to keep in the tissue outside the tumour, particularly in organs at risk, the unavoidable radiation as low as possible. No doubt, these two objectives of treatment planning high level dose in the tumour, low radiation outside the tumour have a basically contradictory nature. Therefore, {{it is no surprise that}} inverse mathematical models with dose distribution bounds tend to be infeasible in most cases. Thus, there is need for approximations compromising between overdosing the organs at risk and underdosing the target volume. Differing from the currently used time consuming iterative approach, which measures deviation from an ideal (non-achievable) treatment plan using recursively trial-and-error weights for the organs of interest, we go a new way trying to avoid a priori weight choices and consider the treatment planning problem as a multiple objective linear programming problem: with each organ of interest, target tissue as well as organs at risk, we associate an objective function measuring the maximal deviation from the prescribed <b>doses.</b> We <b>build</b> <b>up</b> a data base of relatively few efficient solutions representing and approximating the variety of Pareto solutions of the multiple objective linear programming problem.

TPS is always recommended {{to account for the}} effect of tissue, applicator and shielding material heterogeneities exist in applicators. However, most brachytherapy TPS software packages estimate the absorbed dose at a point, taking care of only the contributions of individual sources and the source distribution, neglecting the dose perturbations arising from the applicator design and construction. There are some degrees of uncertainties in dose rate estimations under realistic clinical conditions. In this regard, an attempt is made to explore the suitability of point kernels for brachytherapy dose rate calculations and develop new interactive brachytherapy package, named as BrachyTPS, to suit the clinical conditions. BrachyTPS is an interactive point kernel code package developed to perform independent dose rate calculations by taking into account the effect of these heterogeneities, using two regions <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>factors,</b> proposed by Kalos. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} validate the developed point kernel code package integrated with treatment planning computational systems against the Monte Carlo (MC) results. In the present work, three brachytherapy applicators commonly used in the treatment of uterine cervical carcinoma, namely (i) Board of Radiation Isotope and Technology (BRIT) low dose rate (LDR) applicator and (ii) Fletcher Green type LDR applicator (iii) Fletcher Williamson high dose rate (HDR) applicator, are studied to test the accuracy of the software. Dose rates computed using the developed code are compared with the relevant results of the MC simulations. Further, attempts are also made to study the dose rate distribution around the commercially available shielded vaginal applicator set (Nucletron). The percentage deviations of BrachyTPS computed dose rate values from the MC results are observed to be within plus/minus 5. 5 % for BRIT LDR applicator, found to vary from 2. 6 to 5. 1 % for Fletcher green type LDR applicator and are up to − 4. 7 % for Fletcher-Williamson HDR applicator. The isodose distribution plots also show good agreements with the results of previous literatures. The isodose distributions around the shielded vaginal cylinder computed using BrachyTPS code show better agreement (less than two per cent deviation) with MC results in the unshielded region compared to shielded region, where the deviations are observed up to five per cent.

Sc. in physics, College of Science, King Saud Univerisity, 2006 G - 1427 HAn extensive set of measured data was developed to verify the accuracy of a photon dose-calculation algorithm for the treatment planning system (Eclipse). Dose distributions from a linear accelerator were measured using an ion chamber in a water phantom and thermoluminescent dosimeters in a heterogeneous anthropomorphic phantom. Test cases included square fields, rectangular fields, fields having different source-to-surface distances, wedged fields, irregular fields, obliquely incident fields, asymmetrically collimated fields with wedges, multileafe collimator-shaped fields, and two heterogeneous density cases. The data set was used to validate the photon dose calculation algorithm in a radiation treatment planning system (Eclipse). Eclipse calculated photon doses to within the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 53 (TG- 53) criteria for 99 % of points in the buildup region, 93 % of points in the inner region, 90 % of points in the outer region, and 88 % of points in the penumbra. For the heterogeneous phantoms, calculations agreed with actual measurements to within ± 7 %. The monitor unit tests revealed that the 6 MV open square fields, rectangular fields, wedged fields, oblique incidence, SSD variation, mantle field, half beam block, and oblique incidence with wedge test cases did not meet the TG- 53 criteria all the time.

40|$|International audienceThe {{geography}} of the creative class: The case of French urban areas The creative class approach (Florida, 2002 b) focuses on the major economic role of creative skills in a knowledge-based economy. The ability to be creative, to produce new ideas, new symbols, or innovations became a permanent economic activity for firms and individuals. The creative class gathers individuals that own creative occupations. Such individuals are crucial for firms because they generate innovation, new knowledge and new ideas. The originality of such a class is to jointly consider creative individuals in fields such as the arts, science and engineering, and to define them as key resources of firms' comparative advantage and survival. This approach took a fresh look on socio-economic determinants that underpin innovation and local development. It raised an issue of great importance for cities: creative people are highly mobile and following Lucas (1988), cities have to attract, retain, organise and generate the creative class to attain the virtuous path of economic competitiveness. In order to draw creative people, cities have to supply a competitive people's climate founded on tolerance and openness to diversity and low entry barriers to new comers and new ideas (Florida, 2005 b). Tolerance, cultural and socialisation opportunities such as "third places" (Oldenburg, 1991) shape this people's climate and <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>factors</b> leading to creative people location in cities. In turn, creative people attract or create firms because firms have to locate near of their essential productive resources. In spite of much criticism, this original approach of local development has been implemented in public policies (Florida et al, 2002; Florida and Stolarick, 2006). Moreover, the creative class approach has been adapted in Europe. Particularly, the {{geography of}} the creative class and the identification of its determining factors have been studied in European cities through the international research project Technology, Talent, and Tolerance in European Cities. However, these questions have not been investigated in French cities. This is why this article proposes the first overview of creative people location in France. Additionally, it produces the Tolerance-Amenities-Opportunities model (TAO model) {{in order to identify}} factors that shape creative class geography. TAO accounts for Tolerance, Amenities and Opportunities. According to several authors (Andersen and Lorenzen, 2006; Fritsch, 2007; Clifton, 2008; Hansen, 2008; Boschma and Fritsch, 2009), such factors are the main dimensions of creative people location in Europe. Mapping the creative class in France allows us to observe that creative people mainly concentrate in the largest cities. Moreover, TAO model's results show that the creative class is co-located in cities that gather large artistic communities. Globally, geographies of creative class and tolerance overlap in France. These findings converge with previous work carried out in the United States and in Europe.
