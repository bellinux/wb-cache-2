25|$|Students {{enrolled}} {{in one of}} the undergraduate programs of the Faculty of Social Sciences can earn a degree with a certification through one of the collaborative programs with local colleges. There are 11 Collaborative programs in which social science majors can choose from; Behavioural Science, Child and Youth Workers, Contemporary Labour Studies, Emergency Management, Film Studies, <b>Geomatics,</b> Journalism, Paralegal, Policing and Criminal Justice, Public Relations and Yukon College. Applications must be submitted after completion of their first year of study maintaining a 70% average. Students spend their first, second and fourth year at Brock while their third is spent at the preferred local college. For example, Media and Communication students can enrol in their third year of study in the Public Relations collaborative program with Mohawk College. This allows students to end their undergraduate with a certification of Public Relations and a Bachelor of Arts in four years rather than five if done consecutively. Students who complete this program tend to go into the government sector, private agencies, corporations and/or non-profit.|$|E

The knowledge indicator used in this study is the patent ownership against the background of emergence of new core technologies and innovations in the field of GNSS. Looking at the dismal performance of <b>Geomatic</b> professionals in terms of innovative activities in most part of Asian and Malaysia in particular, is it there is something that holding up these professionals from doing so? With our universities and numerous polytechnics offering <b>Geomatic</b> program, more is expected from them. Is it a problem of lack or inadequacy of skills? Or is it these professionals are too busy and being narrowly focused on doing something else?

The use of low-cost photogrammetry based on the use of economical, conventional, non-metric digital cameras mounted on low-cost aircrafts, together with the use of the latest computational vision techniques and open-source <b>geomatic</b> tools, provides useful <b>geomatic</b> products. The proposed methodology, compared with conventional photogrammetry or other traditional methods, led to a cost savings of up to 45 %.
