40|$|There is a {{very large}} demand for basic {{telephone}} service in developing nations, and remote parts of industrialized nations, which cannot be met by conventional wireline and cellular systems. This is the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest unserved market. We describe a system which uses recent advances in active phased arrays, fast-packet switching technology, adaptive routing, and light spacecraft technology, in part {{based on the work of}} the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and on recently-declassified work done on the Strategic Defense Initiative, to make it possible to address this market with a global telephone network based on a large low-Earth-orbit constellation of identical satellites. A telephone utility can use such a network to provide the same modem basic and <b>enhanced</b> <b>telephone</b> services offered by telephone utilities in the urban centers of fully-industrialized nations. Economies of scale permit capital and operating costs per subscriber low enough to provide service to all subscribers, regardless of location, at prices comparable to the same services in urban areas of industrialized nations, while generating operating profits great enough to attract the capital needed for its construction. The bandwidth needed to support the capacity needed to gain those economies of scale require that the system use Ka-band frequencies. This choice of frequencies places unusual constraints on the network design, and in particular forces the use of a large number of satellites. Global demand for basic and <b>enhanced</b> <b>telephone</b> service is great enough to support at least three networks of the size described herein.

40|$|Aim To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of a program of computer-generated tailored advice for callers to a telephone helpline, and to assess whether it enhanced a series of callback telephone counselling sessions in aiding smoking cessation. Design Randomized controlled trial comparing: (1) untailored self-help materials; (2) computer-generated tailored advice only, and (3) computer-generated tailored advice plus callback telephone counselling. Assessment surveys were conducted at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Setting Victoria, Australia. Participants A total of 1578 smokers who called the Quitline service and agreed to participate. Measurements Smoking status at follow-up; duration of cessation, if quit; use of nicotine replacement therapy; and extent of participation in the callback service. Findings At the 3 -month follow-up, significantly more (χ 2 (2) = 16. 9; P < 0. 001) participants in the computer-generated tailored advice plus telephone counselling condition were not smoking (21 %) than in either the computer-generated advice only (12 %) or the control condition (12 %). Proportions reporting not smoking at the 12 -month follow-up were 26 %, 23 % and 22 %, respectively (NS) for point prevalence, and for 9 months sustained abstinence; 8. 2, 6. 0, and 5. 0 (NS). In the telephone counselling group, those receiving callbacks were more likely {{than those who did not}} to have sustained abstinence at 12 months (10. 2 compared with 4. 0, P < 0. 05). Logistic regression on 3 -month data showed significant independent effects on cessation of telephone counselling and use of NRT, but not of computer-generated tailored advice. Conclusion Computer-generated tailored advice did not <b>enhance</b> <b>telephone</b> counselling, nor have any independent effect on cessation. This may be due to poor timing of the computer-generated tailored advice and poor integration of the two modes of advice. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{design flow}} of multi-standard down-conversion CMOS mixers for three modern standards: Global System Mobile, Digital <b>Enhanced</b> Cordless <b>Telephone</b> and Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems is presented. Three active mixer’s {{structures}} are studied. The first {{is based on}} the Gilbert cell which gives a tolerable noise figure and linearity with a low conversion gain. The second and third structures use the current bleeding and charge injection techniques in order to increase the conversion gain. An improvement of about 2 dB of the conversion gain is achieved without a considerable degradation of the other characteristics. The models used for noise figure, conversion gain and IIP 3 used are studied. This study describes the nature of trade-offs inherent in such structures and gives insights that help in identifying which structure is better for given conditions...|$|R

40|$|Software {{agents are}} the result of the {{development}} in the fields of human computer interaction, artificial intelligent and cognitive science. Recently it was the focus of both computer science research and the software industry. It has become clear that agents can take many roles in helping people complete their tasks. But, agents in real life have not been perfect things that can satisfy everybody. Some problems related to agent's usability have arisen, such as, whether an agent can provide useful help without annoying its users? Whether an agent can be trusted? Building agents that will be satisfied with and trust is important issue in the agents' design. In this thesis, different approaches used in building agents and some current existing agents are introduced. Human-learning, machine-learning, and feedback learning are analysed. The thesis describes extensions made to an existing telephone agent. The <b>enhanced</b> <b>telephone</b> agent is presented by applying machine learning and feedback learning techniques. A demonstration is also given to show how the enhanced agent can make suggestions to its user unobtrusively with appropriate frequency and adjust its behaviour to support its user's daily work. Furthermore, a methodology for agents' development is derived from this case study. It is emphasised that through design and implementation to testing and maintenance, user's needs and user's satisfaction should always be the main concern of agent's designers. The thesis provides a frame for agents' development, which allows the construction of agents that meet these criteria...|$|E

In addition to standard answering machine functions, the VMC features programmable outgoing message selection, message routing, response to caller's touch tone signals, and remote programming ability. The VMC will answer incoming telephone calls, deliver outgoing messages which are Programmably selectable from as many as 16 digitized audio messages stored on the PC's hard disk, record incoming messages to the hard disk or optionally to an external tape recorder, route messages to a specified receiver, respond to a caller's touch tone signals, and enter a remote programming mode {{as a result of}} a special code sent by the caller. Audio messages are processed digitally via A/D and D/A converters which receive and send 8 -bit data to and from the IBM PC through a selectable port address. The A/D conversion is implemented with the ADC 0802 which is operated at a clock rate of 512 kHz. The D/A conversion is implemented with the DAC 0830. Interface with the telephone line is accomplished with the speech circuit TP 5700 coupled through opto-couplers.

40|$|In this paper, a mixer {{topology}} {{selection for}} a multi-standard high image-reject front-end is presented. The receiver {{is intended to}} work for Digital <b>Enhanced</b> Cordless <b>Telephone</b> (DECT) systems (at 1. 9 GHz and 2. 4 GHz) and for Bluetooth (at 2. 4 GHz). It will be implemented in 18 m CMOS technology. A double-quadrature low-IF architecture is employed because it can provide a high image rejection and flexibility for different standards. Building block specifications are optimized {{in order to achieve}} high image rejection and high sensitivity. Since the downconverter is the core of the front-end, it is necessary to select a high performance mixer topology that can provide low noise figure, high voltage gain, low power consumption and moderate linearity. Instead of simply using standard Gilbert cell and focus on its optimization, as it is quite often done in the literature, three mixer topologies, are examined. The evaluation is done analytically and by simulations with SpectreRF. A novel folded switching mixer topology achieves the best performance. With this topology the following simulation results are achieved: noise figure (NF) 14 dB, voltage gain (G) 17 dB, linearity (IIP 3) 1 dBm with a power consumption of 4 5 mW at the operating frequency of 2 5 GHz. Good matching between expected and simulated results is observed. A low voltage operation, which implies robustness for technology scaling, is also considered. At the end the final results are reported and the most promising topology is selected...|$|R

Weight management interventions can be <b>enhanced</b> using mobile <b>telephone</b> technology to deliver support in real time, real world settings (Heron & Smyth, 2010) Methods: In this controlled study, overweight adults completing a weight management programme participated in an additional 12 -week text message based intervention (‘LEAP Beep’). Participants (n= 17, 7 males; 10 females; mean age 58. 3 ± 12. 1 years) were allocated daily targets for steps, fruit, vegetable and breakfast consumption. Twice weekly, participants ‘texted’ with progress and received practitioner feedback.

40|$|Although {{intervention}} {{is effective in}} reducing the disability associated with stroke, limited resources mean that physiotherapy services often cease by six months after stroke. The purpose of this clinical trial {{was to investigate the}} efficacy of resource-efficient physiotherapy services in improving mobility and quality of life after stroke. Twenty-six people with residual walking difficulties after stroke were randomised into an experimental or control group after discharge from physiotherapy services. The experimental group participated in a six-week, home-based mobility program. The control group participated in a six-week, home-based program of upper-limb exercises (i. e. ‘sham’ mobility exercises). Subjects met with the therapist for prescription of exercises only three times during the six weeks. Strategies used to offset potential problems associated with minimal subject-therapist interaction included videotaped instructions to encourage correct performance of exercises, modification of the environment and involvement of carers to <b>enhance</b> safety, and <b>telephone</b> contact and self-monitoring to promote compliance. Standing (Functional Reach), walking (MAS Item 5) and quality of life (SA-SIP 30) were measured prior to, immediately after, and two months after intervention ceased by an assessor who was blinded to group allocation. Subjects in the experimental group demonstrated significant improvement in standing compared to the control group (p = 0. 01) which was maintained two months after the cessation of intervention (p = 0. 04). There was no difference between the groups in walking (p = 0. 50) or quality of life (p = 0. 70). The six-week, resource-efficient mobility program was effective in improving some of the mobility in people after discharge from stroke rehabilitation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the predictors {{and extent of}} noncompliance with a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine {{and the effectiveness of}} a compliance enhancement strategy. DESIGN: Cohort analysis and randomized clinical trial. SUBJECTS: A total of 256 consecutive adults attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic from October 1992 to July 1993 who were seronegative for hepatitis B virus and agreed to receive hepatitis B vaccination. SETTING: Hamilton, Ont. INTERVENTION: Subjects were followed up for 4 months. Those who did not return for the second dose of vaccine by 6 weeks after the first (2 weeks overdue) were randomly assigned to the <b>enhanced</b> intervention group (<b>telephone</b> and mail reminders) or the regular intervention group (mail reminder only). Subjects were considered noncompliant if they did not return for the second dose by 4 months after the first. RESULTS: The risk of not returning for the second dose of vaccine within 4 months after the first was strongly and linearly associated with level of education (p = 0. 004). The noncompliance rate among those with less than a grade 10 education was 50 %, grade 10 - 13 education 34 %, some college education 15 % and some university education 9 %. In the randomized controlled trial the enhanced intervention group had twice the compliance rate of the regular intervention group (48 % v. 25 %; p = 0. 008). Subjects with no postsecondary education were highly responsive to the enhanced intervention (relative risk 2. 1; p = 0. 02) compared with those with a higher level of education (relative risk 1. 0; p = 1. 0).
