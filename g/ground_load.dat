40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{are expected}} to be a major component of the smart grid. The rapid proliferation of EVs will introduce an unprecedented load on the existing electric grid due to the charging/discharging behavior of the EVs, thus motivating the need for novel approaches for routing EVs across the grid. In this paper, a novel gametheoretic framework for smart routing of EVs within the smart grid is proposed. The goal of this framework is to balance the electricity load across the grid while taking into account the traffic congestion and the waiting time at charging stations. The EV routing problem is formulated as a noncooperative game. For this game, it is shown that selfish behavior of EVs will result in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with the price of anarchy upper bounded by the variance of the <b>ground</b> <b>load</b> induced by the residential, industrial, or commercial users. Moreover, the results are extended to capture the stochastic nature of induced <b>ground</b> <b>load</b> as well as the subjective behavior of the owners of EVs as captured by using notions from the behavioral framework of prospect theory.

The trim condition that aerodynamic lift must balance the total weight of the aircraft is enforced by allowing the root angle of attack to change.

The eruptive history of VolcaÃÅn de Colima shows that Plinian eruptions occur approximately every 100 years and the last eruption, the 1913, represents the largest historic eruption of this volcano.

The new tyre model is presented using a point follower approach that makes a novel contribution to this area by uniquely combining elements of two existing tyre models used by the aircraft industry, namely the NASA R 64 model developed by Smiley and Horne and the Engineering Sciences Data Unit (ESDU) Mitchell tyre model. Before the tyre model was used with a full helicopter model, a virtual tyre test rig was used to examine the tyre and to predict the tyre forces and moments for a range of tyre states. The paper concludes by describing the successful application of the new tyre model with a full helicopter model and the simulation of representative landing, take-off and runway taxiing manoeuvres.
