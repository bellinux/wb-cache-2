Immediately, he was branded as a big liar and was quickly {{accused of being a}} Katipunero himself! The guards took turns in hitting him with their rifle butts on the head, chest and back to force <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> but Duman only wept in pain and insisted that he knew nothing. The soldiers continued to beat him up until nothing but blood came out of his mouth, nose and ears. Exasperated, the soldiers tied his elbows in miquit-a-sicu fashion, and with a long rope tied around his neck, the bloodied Duman was taken on foot to the town hall for further interrogation. Once inside the municipal jail, the guards mercilessly beat him up with solid bamboo clubs to extract revolutionary information to no avail. No food or water was given him.|$|E

500|$|... "Occupation", and {{following}} episode [...] "Precipice" [...] {{were written by}} series creator Ronald D. Moore. The Cylon occupation of New Caprica, and the human resistance fighting them, was inspired by wars and military occupations from history, including the Quartering Acts, World War II, and the more recent occupation in Iraq. In the original writing, Moore did not originally consider including Tigh with an eye removed until the final drafts were written. Portraying actor Michael Hogan was initially hesitant with the idea. He recalled that when the producers called <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about how his character would be maimed, they suggested having an eye removed. Hogan responded by laughing, and the producers assumed he agreed.|$|E

He was {{the heart of the}} conversation, very enthused and willing to share pearls of wisdom so that others could benefit from his work. This generosity extended to other areas of his life. He helped his own family in Sumatra and families in Singapore he had [...] "adopted", sending them medicine and other items with what little he could afford, even though his own family was not well off at the time.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics show Madonna's {{interest}} in her Roman Catholic upbringing, as the song theme is about a girl who admits to her father that she is pregnant and refuses {{to have an abortion}} or give up the baby for adoption despite what her friends are telling her to do. It is constructed in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third and final chorus. At the beginning, she addresses her father directly, asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her as an adult, [...] "You should know by now that I'm not a baby". The transition to the chorus employs a more dramatic voice with a higher range, ending nearly in cries as she sings the word [...] "Please". Leading to the chorus, Madonna switches to a pleading voice, singing the song's main hook in a high tone. During the bridge, the song features a Spanish-inspired rhythm, one of the earliest examples of the influence that Hispanic music had on Madonna's musical style.|$|E

Although he got somewhat better, giving his annual dinner to the King's Counsel, it was noticed that {{he was unable to}} drink his wine properly. He went to the Midland Circuit in June, as it was the easiest one, but he suffered from [...] "a violent cough" [...] and other symptoms, returning to his home in Hendon. After the first day of a two-day case he found himself losing his appetite and suffering from a fever, which caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> incoherently and become delirious. The disease baffled doctors, and finally killed him on 4 November 1832 at his home in Queen Square, London; his last words were [...] "and now, gentlemen of the jury, you will consider of your verdict".

[...] His interrogators resorted to the forgery of correspondence between Garnet and other Catholics, but to no avail. [...] His jailers then allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with another priest in a neighbouring cell, with eavesdroppers listening to every word. [...] Eventually Garnet let slip a crucial piece of information, that there was only one man who could testify that he had any knowledge of the plot. Under torture Garnet admitted that he had heard of the plot from fellow Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, who had learnt of it in confession from Catesby. [...] Garnet was charged with high treason and tried in the Guildhall on 28March, in a trial lasting from 8am until 7pm. According to Coke, Garnet instigated the plot: [...] " [...] hath many gifts and endowments of nature, by art learned, a good linguist and, by profession, a Jesuit and a Superior as indeed he is Superior to all his predecessors in devilish treason, a Doctor of Dissimulation, Deposing of Princes, Disposing of Kingdoms, Daunting and deterring of subjects, and Destruction." [...] Garnet refuted all the charges against him, and explained the Catholic position on such matters, but he was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death.|$|E

500|$|Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw, who {{had been}} chairing COBRA during the siege, was rushed back to Whitehall from a {{function}} he had been attending in Slough, roughly [...] away, arriving 19 minutes after the shots had been reported. He was briefed on the SAS plan by de la Billière, who told him to expect that up to 40 percent of the hostages would be killed in an assault. After deliberations, Whitelaw instructed the SAS to prepare to assault the building at short notice, an order that was received by Mike Rose at 15:50. By 17:00, the SAS were {{in a position to}} assault the embassy at ten minutes' notice. The police negotiators recruited the imam from a local mosque at 18:20, fearing that a [...] "crisis point" [...] had been reached, and asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the gunmen.

Oan announced that a hostage had been killed, and the rest would die in 30minutes unless his demands were met. A few minutes later, Lavasani's body was dumped out of the front door. Upon a preliminary examination, conducted at the scene, a forensic pathologist estimated that Lavasani had been dead for at least an hour, meaning he could not have been killed by the three most recent shots, and leading the police to believe that two hostages had been killed. In fact, only Lavasani had been shot.|$|E

Todd Beamer attempted to call his wife from row32 at 09:43:48, but was routed to GTE phone operator Lisa D. Jefferson. Beamer told the operator that the flight was hijacked and that two people who he thought were the pilots were on the floor dead or dying.

When the hijackers veered the plane sharply south, Beamer briefly panicked, exclaiming, [...] "We're going down! We're going down!"
