And when they {{went out to the}} human world, that's when I really blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, artist Boo Sze Yang {{presented}} The Father at iPreciation Gallery, a {{solo exhibition}} featuring eight oil-on-canvas portraits of Lee in unconventional settings, like an embellished throne or {{a scene that}} depicts the Last Supper. [...] In regard to his opinion of Lee, Boo was quoted as saying, [...] "I look at him as how <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> my own father, a powerful and distant figure for whom I have mixed feelings – a lot of gratitude, but also doubt." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{my young}} days... I had been {{attracted}} {{to the idea of}} pure creativity, taking the form of abstract art.... I derived ideas for my abstract studies from life around me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a man, a house, a plant, at intricate machinery, extravagant shadowscapes on walls or ceilings, at quivering bonfire flames, and would compose them into abstract pictures, creating in my imagination visions that were not like actual reality.... Fortunately I soon realised that it was not given to me, a human being, to create from 'nothing', in the way only God can create. I realised that everything that I created was conditioned by what was already in existence. I could not invent a new colour or line that had never existed anywhere before. An abstract picture is like a string of words, beautiful and sonorous in themselves, perhaps, but never expressing a complete thought..."—Preface to St Silouan the Athonite ...|$|E

60|$|For these reasons, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the proof}} sheets--I am {{determined}} {{to maintain the}} position of [sic] truly saying I never saw the proof sheets, or any part of their work, before its publication.|$|R

2500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Lennie James as Morgan Jones in a brief uncredited post-end credits cameo. It marked his third appearance in the show, after the pilot, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and the season three episode [...] "Clear". Gimple explained {{in an interview with}} The Hollywood Reporter that Morgan's appearance was the [...] "beginning of something" [...] for the character, but would not state further; he instead said, [...] "Looking at him, how he's dressed, how he's acting — it's not a 42-minute episode there — but you get some hints about where he's at. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than the last time we saw him. He looks pretty well put together. You know, he’s not talking to himself. I would say that, just laying eyes on him, it looks like a different Morgan." [...] Kirkman stated that Morgan was possibly following Rick's trail, as Rick left him a map in [...] "Clear". He also said that the post-credits scene was used not only to surprise the audience, but to also [...] " [...] story of this episode...into its own contiguous piece." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Sometimes Mrs Davidson and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{one another}} and the tears would stream down our cheeks. We worked without ceasing, day and night, and we seemed to make no progress. I don't know what I should have done without her then. When I felt my heart sink, when I was very near despair, she gave me courage and hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he is n't, and {{he never}} will! I am sure of him,--as sure as that I sit here. Do you think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him if I had n't known {{he was a man}} of his word?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why not, dear, when there's {{nothing in}} the whole world at which I wouldn't laugh at just now? {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you. Also I wasn't laughing, I was loving, and when one is loving very much, the truth comes out." ...|$|R
60|$|It was the 7th of November. The fight {{began at}} {{seven in the}} morning. I was on the 'R. H. W. Hill.' Took over a load of troops from Columbus. Came back, and took over a battery of artillery. My partner {{said he was going}} to see the fight; wanted me to go along. I said, no, I wasn't anxious, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it from the pilot-house. He said I was a coward, and left.|$|E

I haven't been used to it, and so now I am just looking for a little place to suit me. I have been up to Tavistock, and then some one said that Carnesford was a pretty village. I said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Carnesford, and so you see here I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{made this}} nurse the {{following}} offer: If she {{would bring the}} dilatory boy to my rooms and leave him there {{for half an hour}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. At first Mary, to whom the offer was passed on, rejected it with hauteur, but presently she wavered, and the upshot was that Irene, looking scornful and anxious, arrived one day with the perambulator. Without casting eyes on its occupant, I pointed Irene to the door: [...] "In half-an-hour," [...] I said.|$|E

60|$|Mrs Bowater's {{little house}} being towards {{the crest of}} the hill, with sunrise a little to the left across the meadows, my window {{commanded}} about three-fifths of the southern and eastern skies. By day I would kneel down and study for hours the charts, and thus be prepared for the dark. Night after night, when the weather was fair, or the windy clouds made mock of man's celestial patternings, I would sit in the glow of the firelight and summon these magic shiners each by name--Bellatrix, huge Betelgeuse, Aldebaran, and the rest. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> one, and, while so doing, watch another. This not only isolated the smaller stars, but gradually I became aware that they were one and all furtively signalling to me! About a fortnight later my old Lyndsey friend, the Dogstar, topped the horizon fringe of woodland. I heard myself shout at him across the world. His sudden molten bursts of crimson betwixt his emeralds and sapphires filled me with an almost ridiculous delight.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{her just}} for pleasure's sake. Her hair {{was of the}} colour of undyed silk, with darker strands in it; her skin pale; and she had an odd little stutter in her light young voice when she was excited. I would often compare her with Fanny. What curious {{differences}} there were between them. She was graceful, but {{as if she had}} been taught to be. Unlike Fanny, she was not so fascinatingly just a beautiful body--with that sometimes awful Someone looking out of its windows. There was a lovely delicacy in her, as if, absurd though it may sound, every bit of her had been selected, actually picked out, from the finest materials. Perhaps it was her food and drink that had helped to make her so; for I don't think Miss Stebbings's diet was more than wholesome, or that following the sea in early life makes a man rich enough to afford many dainties for his children. Anyhow, there was nothing man-made in Fanny; and if there are women-shaped mermaids I know what looks will be seen in their faces.|$|E
5000|$|Watts {{described}} Jones's role {{in these}} early days: [...] "Brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning. Keith and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him and say he was barmy. It was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid half-a-crown and to be billed as an R&B band".|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> {{thought you}} <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Jane Robinson's and Julia Wright's which are lying {{there in the}} basket. I did Rebecca's myself before tea, till my old eyes were sore." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a fine}} day, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the blue}} sky or at the stately houses round me; my mind was bent on one thing, finding out [...] "Mr. Brown, Numero --, Rue Royale," [...] for so my letter was addressed. By dint of inquiry I succeeded; I stood at last at the desired door, knocked, asked for Mr. Brown, and was admitted.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you like," [...] {{she agreed}} simply, [...] "but somehow I believe that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather wait. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> mother's eye, roving around the table. Give me my gloves, please, Hugh. Don't be long." ...|$|R

5000|$|Manush was nicknamed [...] "Heinie" [...] {{due to his}} German ancestry. He was one {{of eight}} {{children}} in the family, seven boys and one girl. All seven boys took up baseball, five of them playing the game professionally. His brother Frank Manush was 18 years older than Heinie and played professional baseball from 1907 to 1921. Manush {{was seven years old}} when Frank made his major league debut in 1908 and later recalled: [...] "When I was as young as 7 or 8, Frank used to bring home all his baseball equipment and uniform. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that weird paraphernalia and wish I could wear it.

5000|$|In 1965 Motherwell {{worked on}} another {{prominent}} series called the [...] "Lyric Suite", named after Alban Berg’s string quartet. Motherwell recalled, “I {{went to a}} Japanese store to buy a toy for a friend’s kid, and I saw this beautiful Japanese paper and I bought a thousand sheets. And made up my mind, {{this was in the}} beginning of April 1965, that I would do the thousand sheets without correction. I’d make an absolute rule for myself. And I got to 600 in April and May, when one night my wife and I were having dinner and the telephone rang. And it was Kenneth Noland in Vermont saying that I should come immediately. And I said, ‘what’s happened?’ And he said, ‘David Smith’s been in an accident’.” Smith, the sculptor, was Motherwell and Frankenthaler’s great friend. Jumping into their Mercedes they sped to Vermont but arrived 15 minutes after Smith had died. Motherwell stopped work on the series. He said of them: “And then one year I had them all framed, and I like them very much now. I should also say that I half painted them and they half painted themselves. I’d never used rice paper before except occasionally as an element in a collage. And most of these were made with very small, I mean very thin lines. And then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> amazement on the floor after I’d finished. It would spread like spots of oil and fill all kinds of strange dimensions.” ...|$|E
