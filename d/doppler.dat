5|$|<b>Doppler</b> {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal <b>Doppler</b> shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the <b>Doppler</b> redshift. The <b>Doppler</b> redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the <b>Doppler</b> redshift.|$|E

5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} line filter is usually {{equal to the}} <b>Doppler</b> profile of the vapor cell, the natural range of {{frequencies}} at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source. The <b>Doppler</b> profile is {{the width of the}} spectrum of <b>Doppler</b> shifted radiation emitted by the vapor cell due to its thermal motion. This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the subject began with the {{development}} in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the <b>Doppler</b> effect. The effect is named after Christian <b>Doppler,</b> who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845. <b>Doppler</b> correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves, and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars {{could be attributed to}} their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's temperature, not motion. Only later was <b>Doppler</b> vindicated by verified redshift observations.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultrasound}} equipment must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to provide both color and <b>Doppler</b> imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of ultrasound. The use of <b>Doppler</b> measurements which trace the echoes of the generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The overlay of color onto the <b>Doppler</b> information lets these images be seen more clearly.|$|E
5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of <b>Doppler</b> and color <b>Doppler.</b> <b>Doppler</b> measurements using <b>Doppler</b> effect can show {{the direction of the}} blood flow and its relative velocity and color <b>Doppler</b> is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe to make a good acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E
5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the <b>Doppler</b> shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the <b>Doppler</b> shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The <b>Doppler</b> shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given <b>Doppler</b> shift value.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by <b>doppler</b> shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the <b>Doppler</b> shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the <b>Doppler</b> shift of their motion in flight. The <b>Doppler</b> shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the <b>Doppler</b> shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of redshifts and blueshifts {{has been}} applied to develop several {{terrestrial}} technologies such as <b>Doppler</b> radar and radar guns. Redshifts are also seen in the spectroscopic observations of astronomical objects. Its value is represented by the letter z.|$|E
5|$|Less {{commonly}} used tests might include trans-illumination (to detect congestion of the maxillary sinus or to highlight {{a crack in}} a tooth), dyes (to help visualize a crack), a test cavity, selective anaesthesia and laser <b>doppler</b> flowmetry.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 47 Ursae Majoris c was discovered by detecting changes in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. This was done by measuring the <b>Doppler</b> shift of the star's spectrum.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 1998, an {{extrasolar planet}} was {{announced}} in orbit around Gliese876 by two independent teams led by Geoffrey Marcy and Xavier Delfosse. The planet was designated Gliese876b and was detected by <b>Doppler</b> spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|Operationally Erika {{was never}} {{upgraded}} to hurricane status. Based on a persistent eye feature on radar and <b>Doppler</b> weather radar-estimated surface winds of 75mph (120km/h), the National Hurricane Center posthumously upgraded Erika to a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides <b>Doppler</b> data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. <b>Doppler</b> information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. <b>Doppler</b> information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{ultrasonography}} {{in medicine}} soon followed in different {{locations around the}} world. In the mid-1950s more research was undertaken by Professor Ian Donald et al., in Glasgow, which advanced the practical technology and applications of ultrasound. In 1963, in France, Léandre Pourcelot started on his thesis, which was presented in 1964, and used pulsed <b>Doppler</b> for blood flow calculation as its subject. This was followed up by Peronneau in 1969. Dr. Gene Strandness and the bio-engineering group at the University of Washington who conducted research on <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease, published their first work in 1967. The first report published about the venous system appeared around 1967–1968.|$|E
5|$|A second instrument, <b>Doppler</b> Orbit and Radio Positioning Integration by Satellite, or DORIS, {{is used to}} {{calculate}} precisely the spacecraft's orbit. An array of retroreflectors are also carried aboard the spacecraft, and allow measurements to be made from the ground to verify the orbital data provided by DORIS.|$|E
5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of <b>Doppler</b> weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal <b>Doppler</b> Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{hoped to}} {{implement}} a survey called the N2K Consortium, a collaboration which uses <b>Doppler</b> spectroscopy to find radial velocity measurements of stars that hadn't been previously surveyed. The project searched particularly for gas giants with short orbits around metal-rich stars to find how the metallicity of the star and {{the mass of the}} planet are related.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 {{was first}} {{targeted}} for a planet search in 2004 by the N2K Consortium, a collaboration of astronomers hoping to take radial velocity measurements of previously untargeted stars using <b>Doppler</b> spectroscopy; however, HD 154672 {{had been previously}} targeted {{by a series of}} surveys, and was previously included in the Henry Draper catalog and the catalog of the European Space Agency's Hipparcos satellite.|$|E
5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment. <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound, CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high <b>Doppler</b> shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found {{that the majority of}} these nebulae are moving away from us.|$|E
5|$|Isabel dropped {{light to}} {{moderate}} precipitation across {{the eastern half}} of Ohio, with isolated locations reporting over 3in (75mm). Moisture from Isabel dropped light rainfall across eastern Michigan and peaked at 1.55inches (39mm) at Mount Clemens. Additionally, <b>Doppler</b> weather radar estimated rainfall approached 2.5inches (64mm) in St. Clair County. No damage was reported from Isabel in the region.|$|E
5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the <b>Doppler</b> shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying {{what they thought was}} a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed <b>Doppler</b> shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{pharmacological}} therapies for DVT {{were introduced in}} the 20th century: oral anticoagulants in the 1940s, subcutaneous LDUH in 1962 and subcutaneous LMWH in 1982. Diagnoses were commonly performed by impedance plethysmography in the 1970s and 1980s, {{but the use of}} <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound techniques, with their increased sensitivity and specificity, largely superseded this method.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is used for}} coherent <b>Doppler</b> lidar measurements capable of detecting very weak light scattered in the atmosphere and monitoring wind speeds with high accuracy. It has application in optical fiber communications, in various high resolution spectroscopic techniques, and the self-heterodyne method {{can be used to}} measure the linewidth of a laser.|$|E
5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to small changes in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the <b>Doppler</b> shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated <b>Doppler</b> shifts.|$|E
5|$|The {{base model}} Su-25 {{incorporates}} {{a number of}} key avionics systems. It has no TV guidance but includes a distinctive nose-mounted laser rangefinder, that is thought to provide for laser-based target finding. A DISS-7 <b>doppler</b> radar is used for navigation; the Su-25 can fly at night, in visual and instrument meteorological conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the <b>doppler</b> shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using <b>doppler</b> broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E
