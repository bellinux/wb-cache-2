25|$|Ciclosporin is {{currently}} in a phase II/III (adaptive) clinical study in Europe to determine its ability to ameliorate neuronal cellular damage and reperfusion injury (phase III) in traumatic brain injury. This multi-center study is being organized by NeuroVive Pharma and the European Brain Injury Consortium using NeuroVive's formulation of ciclosporin called NeuroSTAT (also known by its cardioprotection trade name of CicloMulsion). This formulation uses a lipid emulsion base instead of cremophor and ethanol. NeuroSTAT was recently compared to Sandimmune in a phase <b>I</b> <b>study</b> and found to be bioequivalent. In this study, NeuroSTAT did not exhibit the anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions found in cremophor- and ethanol-based products.|$|E

Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. <b>I</b> <b>study</b> English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher.
