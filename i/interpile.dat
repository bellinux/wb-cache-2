40|$|U-section {{steel sheet}} piles {{are used for}} {{constructing}} retaining walls and they are connected together to form continuous walls using sliding joints located along their centerlines. <b>Interpile</b> movement along these joints can, in theory, reduce strength by 55 % and stiffness by 70 %, {{in comparison with the}} performance of piles in which no slip occurs (full composite action). This problem of interlock slippage is known as reduced modulus action (RMA). Despite the potential for this problem, it is common practice in many countries to ignore RMA in design, although the exact conditions governing when it becomes a design issue are not fully understood. This paper presents results from an investigation into this problem using experimental tests carried out using miniature piles. Unlike previous studies these tests were carried out using a similar load arrangement to that found in practice. The investigation indicates that the loading configuration affects the development of RMA and that friction between pile interlocks has the potential to mitigate much of the effect of RMA. A numerical model simulating the tests was developed and it has been used to model full-scale piles. The study indicates that many commonly occurring forms of steel sheet pile walls are unlikely to exhibit significant problems from RMA and this is relevant to pile design using Eurocode 3 : Part...|$|E
40|$|Summary. It were {{considered}} and analyzed the existing schemes of piles work in clay soils. 1. Leningrad scientific school, where {{the formation of}} pile bearing capacity use {{as the basis of}} the thixotropic clay soils hardening and radial soil pressing around the pile shaft during the piles driving with pile-driving equipment for the exploitation period. 2. Odessa scientific school, in which the uplift soil formation from the edge pile use as the basis of the pile bearing capacity during the piles driving, the formation of the pressed zones (platform) in the piles edge plane, the gap formation around the pile shaft during its diving by ground pushed moving with the pile edge. 3. Preconditions of the pile bearing capacity formation of the pile by the thixotropic soil hardening in time and the radial soil pressing around the pile shaft can not give an answer to the following questions: 1) Why during the pile driving is formed the gap around the trunk of dived piles, when by condition there is a radial soil hardening around the trunk? 2) Why in the <b>interpiled</b> space is formed the lune (deflection), not the soil mass swelling (due to the radial hardening) ? 3) By what is formed the calculated soil resistance under the lower end (edge) of the pile? which is about 10 times higher than the calculated soil resistance in the edge plane, according to the Building Code V. 2. 1 - 10. 2009 ? The justified answers on all these and other technical and technological matters give perquisites of the Odessa scientific school with additions and authors development...|$|R
