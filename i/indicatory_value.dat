40|$|The {{stations}} and ecological <b>indicatory</b> <b>value</b> {{of the plant}} community Landolphio - Lecaniodiscetum cupanioidis have been studied in the natural undergrowth of teak plantations of Djigb√© forest in south Benin. The main {{results show that the}} association occures on reddish non hydromorphic clay soils slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6 to 7, 3). Its soils are associated with low slopes (5 % on the average). The association is linked to the stations presenting the largest risks of windthrow (30 % on average), by reason of the shallow depth of the large roots (50 cm on the average). The main factor which controls the extent of the windthrow is the presence of clay horizon in the first 40 cm of the soil. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
