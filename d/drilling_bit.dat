500|$|Borehole drilling: By {{at least}} the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the Chinese used deep {{borehole}} drilling for mining and other projects; The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe states that borehole sites could reach as deep as 600m (2000ft). K.S. Tom describes the drilling process: [...] "The Chinese method of deep drilling was accomplished {{by a team of}} men jumping on and off a beam to impact the <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> while the boring tool was rotated by buffalo and oxen." [...] This was the same method used for extracting petroleum in California during the 1860s (i.e. [...] "Kicking Her Down"). A Western Han Dynasty bronze foundry discovered in Xinglong, Hebei had nearby mining shafts which reached depths of 100m (328ft) with spacious mining areas; the shafts and rooms were complete with a timber frame, ladders and iron tools. (For further information, see the entry on [...] "natural gas as fuel" [...] below.) ...|$|E

50|$|The Drill Floor is {{the heart}} of any {{drilling}} rig. This is the area where the drill string begins its trip into the earth. It is traditionally where joints of pipe are assembled, as well as the BHA (bottom hole assembly), <b>drilling</b> <b>bit,</b> and various other tools.

The included angle of the spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> so that the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|R
5000|$|In the oil industry, {{xanthan gum}} {{is used in}} large {{quantities}} to thicken drilling mud.

When the circulation stops, the solids still remain suspended in the drilling fluid. The widespread use of horizontal drilling {{and the demand for}} good control of drilled solids has led to its expanded use.

50|$|Oil well {{drilling}} utilises tri-cone roller, carbide embedded, fixed-cutter diamond, or diamond-impregnated drill bits {{to wear away}} at the cutting face. This is preferred {{because there is no}} need to return intact samples to surface for assay as the objective is to reach a formation containing oil or natural gas. Sizable machinery is used, enabling depths of several kilometres to be penetrated. Rotating hollow drill pipes carry down bentonite and barite infused drilling muds to lubricate, cool, and clean the <b>drilling</b> <b>bit,</b> control downhole pressures, stabilize the wall of the borehole and remove drill cuttings. The mud travels back to the surface around the outside of the drill pipe, called the annulus. Examining rock chips extracted from the mud is known as mud logging. Another form of well logging is electronic and is commonly employed to evaluate the existence of possible oil and gas deposits in the borehole. This can take place while the well is being drilled, using Measurement While Drilling tools, or after drilling, by lowering measurement tools into the newly drilled hole.|$|E

5000|$|Also {{known as}} {{ballistic}} well drilling and sometimes called [...] "spudders", these rigs raise and drop a drill string {{with a heavy}} carbide tipped <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> that chisels through the rock by finely pulverizing the subsurface materials. The drill string is composed of the upper drill rods, a set of [...] "jars" [...] (inter-locking [...] "sliders" [...] that help transmit additional energy to the drill bit and assist in removing the bit if it is stuck) and the drill bit. During the drilling process, the drill string is periodically removed from the borehole and a bailer is lowered to collect the drill cuttings (rock fragments, soil, etc.). The bailer is a bucket-like tool with a trapdoor in the base. If the borehole is dry, water is added so that the drill cuttings will flow into the bailer. When lifted, the trapdoor closes and the cuttings are then raised and removed. Since the drill string must be raised and lowered to advance the boring, the casing (larger diameter outer piping) is typically used to hold back upper soil materials and stabilize the borehole.|$|E
50|$|The {{people of}} Zigong have been {{drilling}} {{in the area for}} Salt since before the Han Dynasty (76-88 A.D.) to extract salt from brine. Some historian estimates are that China has been active in producing salt since about 6000 BC. The brine aquifers in the area have salinity of at least 50 grams per liter. The classical method of drilling and production was the following: a drilling rig is erected and a borehole is drilled using a <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> and rope. Brine is extracted by dropping a long tube down the borehole. A membrane valve then captures the brine for retrieval on the surface. Once the brine is retrieved it's then piped to flat pans for boiling. In the boiling process some water and crushed yellow soybean is added. The soybean absorbs the impurities in the salt. Once boiled, a yellow layer is formed - this is scraped off leaving absolutely pure salt. The salt is a medium grain salt with different size flakes which have a very strong and unique salt taste. This salt has no additives so it does clump. Locals use grains of rice in the salt to keep the salt from clumping.|$|E

This combined with lab comprehensive lab drilling simulations and mechanisms of rock penetration can hold promise for improving drilling efficiency in deep wells. This paper reviews the mechanical characteristic parameters of rock engineering and demonstrates the obstacle of rock penetration in deep wells.

40|$|Key words:diamond;saw blade; {{drilling}} bit;embedding strength Abstract. It is {{stated that}} Diamond saw blades requires high embedding {{strength of the}} diamond, while diamond drill bits do not. It is necessary to improve the embedding strength of diamond in diamond saw blades, {{rather than in the}} diamond drilling bits. It is recommended to count the number of diamond particles on the matrix surface and get the embedding strength of diamond by calculation. Another recommendation is to use the compound powder of cobalt and tungsten carbide for pelletizing in order to improve the embedding strength of diamond and lower the cost of matrix. There are people studying how to raise embedding strength of diamond, for both diamond saw blades and diamond <b>drilling</b> <b>bit.</b> However, the requirements for embedding strength of diamond saw blades and diamond <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> are different.

The constructed drilling rig uses human power to operate and for this reason it can only be used for shallow borehole drilling, where the water table is close to the surface. A device of this nature can be manufactured in small workshop to aid water supply in small farms especially during dry season, mostly in the rural areas.

40|$|Introduction An {{effectiveness}} of mining largely {{depends on the}} driling rate, which is determined in great part by a <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> shape and properties.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} characteristics (HCs) of any pipe {{are important}} in determining its accept-ability for water conveyance. Bamboo culms made into pipes by drilling through their septa at the nodes have been in use for many years but very few documented researches have been reported on their HCs. The HCs of Bambusa vulgaris (Schrad) pipe were there-fore investigated to contribute to knowledge of its potential usage in irrigation of agricul-tural land. Three drilling bits namely hole saw <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> (HSDB), Ethiopian <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> (EDB) and Tanzanian <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> (TDB) were studied and compared, in {{the removal of the}} septa at the nodes to make bamboo pipes (BPs) from the Bambusa vulgaris culms. Experimental set-ups were made using 9 m length of the BPs to determine hydraulic pa-rameters such as the head loss due to the nodes and the internodes; friction factors and flow types. The data obtained were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance which were further tested using Duncan post-hoc test. The HSDB performed significantly better (p< 0. 05) than the TDB and EDB in the smoothness of septa removal at the nodes with the average percentage head loss value of 0. 36 %, 0. 42 % and 0. 46 % respectively. Average friction factor obtained were 0. 037, 0 047 and 0. 049 for HSDB, TDB and EDB prepared BPs respectively. All these values are within the acceptable limits for a good hydraulic pipe.

40|$|Rock {{drilling}} is {{the process}} employed to retrieve both the conventional and the unconventional resources, such as gas and oil buried deep under the ground. This study attempts to improve {{the understanding of the}} interaction between the <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> and rock by investigating the mechanics involved. In terms of achieving such a goal, a numerical modeling, if successful, can provide insights that are not possible through either field tests or laboratory experiments. When the cutting depth progresses from shallow to deep, there is a failure mode transition from ductile to brittle, and a critical depth that governs this transition. This study introduced Bažant’s simple size effect law into interpreting the transition process of rock cutting. By treating the cutting depth as a measure of size, the law was found applied well to rock cutting based upon the data available in the literature, and the Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling results. By introducing the concept of characteristic length, this study also reinterpreted the previous understanding of the critical depth in rock cutting, by introducing the concept of characteristic length, and obtained the influence of characteristic length on critical depth through numerical modeling. The Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and the Rate of Penetration (ROP) are two key factors for evaluating the efficiency of a drilling process and together they form a good base for strategizing a desirable drilling operation. In the absence of cutter wear rate, a relationship between MSE and ROP for a rectangular cutter has previously been suggested. This study presented a simple model for a circular cutter that includes the wear progression, which could explain the laboratory result of cutting high strength rock under high pressure. The operation of a <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> in the field is mainly achieved through circular cutting action.
