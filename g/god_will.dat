40|$|Divine voluntarism (Divine command theory) is {{a series}} of {{theories}} that claim that God is prior to moral obligation and that moral obligation is determined by <b>God's</b> <b>will.</b> Divine voluntarism has to be formulated {{in a way that it}} does not have undesirable implications, e. g., that moral obligation is arbitrary and that God's goodness is trivial. Also, while it avoids these undesirable implications, divine voluntarism must not imply that God is, in some way, restricted by moral obligation which exists independently of Him. Divine voluntarism can admit God's sovereignty over moral obligation and avoid making moral obligation arbitrary or God's goodness trivial by admitting various aspects of <b>God's</b> <b>will.</b> Moral obligation is relevant to both <b>God's</b> <b>will</b> for human moral obligation and <b>God's</b> <b>will</b> for human moral good. After all, <b>God's</b> <b>will</b> for human moral obligation is <b>God's</b> <b>willing</b> that His own will for human moral good constitute moral obligation for humans...|$|R
5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of <b>God</b> <b>will</b> never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant {{that he is not}} actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.|$|E
5|$|After many hardships - {{including}} {{being pursued}} by four Indios who try their best to leave them stranded or dead - Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, finding {{it to be a}} surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun <b>god,</b> <b>will</b> set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E

Castor and Pollux, the demigod Hercules (Kevin Sorbo), the Titan cyclops Polyphemus, the Gorgon Stheno, and the giant scorpion Skorpius also appear in the multiplayer as bosses and/or environmental obstacles.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{the gift}} from God, [...] "the Freedom to choose" [...] to serve God and always do <b>God's</b> <b>Will</b> {{here on earth}} makes us {{partners}} in creation. Being that <b>God's</b> <b>Will</b> was revealed to the People of Israel on Mount Sinai and spread {{to the world in}} the Torah we have Freedom to choose to do so. If a human does the opposite of <b>God's</b> <b>Will</b> it is in God's realm to alter the cosmic plan of Creation that He Himself devised, that He Himself wants but since nothing exists but God, including the universe and this [...] "nothing" [...] is not above the knowledge that [...] "nothing is too hard for God" [...] and [...] "Our wisdom is not His Wisdom", it is a fundamental theme in Torah that we must do <b>God's</b> <b>will</b> yet we have Freedom to serve or not and if we go against <b>God's</b> <b>will,</b> it is still a lack on our part as partners with God here on earth but this itself is <b>God's</b> <b>Will</b> and will not upset the cosmic original plan.|$|R

5|$|After {{three years}} as a galley slave, Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who {{has been charged with}} destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that <b>God</b> <b>will</b> aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by falling on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow <b>God</b> <b>will</b> be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that <b>God</b> <b>will</b> never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E

What <b>God</b> has <b>willed</b> and chosen we should be. What <b>God</b> has <b>willed</b> and chosen we should do. The {{greatest}} philosopher of the 18th century said that every rational being had to answer four questions--Where am I? What can I know? What must I do? Whither am I going? And he knew well that--as the Bible tells us throughout--the {{only way to get}} any answer to those four tremendous questions is--To delight in the law of the Lord; to struggle, think, pray, till we get some understanding of God's will; of <b>God's</b> <b>will</b> about ourselves and about the world; and so be blessed indeed.|$|R
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator <b>god</b> <b>will</b> one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that <b>God</b> <b>will</b> not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
