[...] However, there are practical reasons for this dispute. [...] Analysis of existing horse armour located in the Royal Armouries indicates the equipment was originally worn by horses of , or about the size and build of a modern field hunter or ordinary riding horse. Research undertaken at the Museum of London, using literary, pictorial and archaeological sources, supports military horses of , distinguished from a riding horse by its strength and skill, rather than its size. This average does not seem to vary greatly across the medieval period. Horses appear to have been selectively bred for increased size from the 9th and 10th centuries, and by the 11th century the average warhorse was probably , a size verified by studies of Norman horseshoes as well as the depictions of horses on the Bayeux Tapestry.

2500|$|During the 1880s the {{discrepancies}} between {{the best available}} lunar tables (published by Hansen in 1857) and observations had become so large that navigators could no longer use the moon's position to determine their longitude accurately. Nevill tackled the problem by first verifying Hansen's treatment of lunar perturbations caused by the direct action of the sun. He then devised an improved method for calculating perturbations caused by Venus. The remaining errors he ascribed to the gravitational pull of the other planets, whose effects were very difficult to calculate. This work was published, among others, in a paper in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society (1885), describing the corrections required by Hansen's tables. He next studied all available lunar observations {{since the middle of}} the 17th century and reduced them to a uniform basis. Comparing these observations to Hansen's tables, he used {{the discrepancies}} to derive the amplitudes and periods of appropriate correction terms. After all these improvements the tables provided an <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> to all lunar observations made since 1650.|$|E

[...] He bought about [...] of magnetite rich land. Grubb also noticed that his land had the other natural resources needed to produce iron. Namely, vast stands of timber for the production of charcoal, running water to operate the bellows, and an ample supply of limestone needed to add flux to the smelting furnaces. Grubb's plans were further helped {{by the fact that the}} magnetite at Cornwall was either very close to or on the surface of his land. He was ready to venture into the iron business and set about the task of building an iron [...] "plantation". These centers of iron production were usually located well away from the heavily cleared farmlands and were nestled in the Ridge and Valley section of Pennsylvania. Grubb constructed his furnaces, first a bloomery and later the more modern charcoal-fired blast furnace and the support buildings and mill village that was needed to house his workers. [...] He named his operation Cornwall because his father, John Grubb had come from Cornwall, UK in 1677. [...] Cornwall Iron Furnace was an <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> for the agricultural based economy of the Thirteen Colonies. Iron was needed to make into tools, nails and weapons. The official policy of Great Britain frowned on manufacturing in the colonies, but England was no longer able to produce the needed iron for its needs let alone the needs of the colonists.
