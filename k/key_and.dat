50|$|Early 3270s offered {{three types}} of keyboards. The {{typewriter}} keyboard came in both a 66 key version, with no programmed function (PF) <b>keys,</b> <b>and</b> a 78 <b>key</b> version with twelve. Both versions had two program attention (PA) keys. The data entry keyboard had five PF <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> two PA <b>keys.</b> The operator console keyboard had twelve PF <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> two PA <b>keys.</b> Later 3270s had twenty-four PF <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> three PA <b>keys.</b> When one of these keys is pressed, it will cause its control unit to generate an I/O interrupt to the host computer and present a special code identifying which key was pressed. Application program functions such as termination, page-up, page-down, or help can be invoked by a single key press, thereby reducing the load on very busy processors.|$|R

5|$|Dubstep's early {{roots are}} in the more {{experimental}} releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the South London-based 2-step garage sound. These experiments often {{ended up on the}} B-side of a white label or commercial garage release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor <b>key</b> <b>and</b> can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, and an almost omnipresent sub-bass. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.|$|E
5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus.

Matheos then asked Chroma <b>Key</b> <b>and</b> ex-Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore to contribute by adding keyboard arrangements to the music he had written. Moore instead heavily edited the music, changing the song structures and adding vocals.
