40|$|In recent years, health {{behaviour}} interventions {{have received a}} great deal of attention in both research and policy as a means of encouraging people to lead healthier lives. The emphasis of such interventions has varied over time, in terms of level of intervention (e. g. individual vs community) and drawing on different disciplinary perspectives. Recently, a number of critiques have focused on how {{health behaviour}} interventions sometimes sideline issues of social context, framing health as a matter of individual choice and, by implication, a personal responsibility. Part of this criticism is that health behaviour interventions often do not draw on alternative social science understandings of the structured and contextual aspects of behaviour and health. Yet to our knowledge, no study has attempted to empirically assess the extent to which, and in what ways, the health behaviour <b>intervention</b> <b>field</b> has paid attention to social context. In this article, we undertake this task using bibliometric techniques in order to map out the health behaviour <b>intervention</b> <b>field.</b> We find that the number of health behaviour interventions has grown rapidly in recent years, especially since around 2006, and that references to social science disciplines and concepts that foreground issues of social context are rare and, relatively speaking, constitute less of the field post 2006. More quantifiable concepts are used most, and those more close to the complexities of social context are mentioned least. The document co-citation analysis suggests that pre 2006, documents referring to social context were relatively diffuse in the network of key citations, but post 2006 this influence had largely diminished. The journal co-citation analysis shows less disciplinary overlap post 2006. At present, health behaviour interventions are continuing to focus on individualised approaches drawn from behavioural psychology and behavioural economics. Our findings lend empirical support to a number of recent papers that suggest more interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to advance the field...|$|E

We propose that the early <b>intervention</b> <b>field</b> address the concerns expressed about the lack of sensitivity in parent education approaches, develop strategies for parent education that are consistent with contem-porary family service concepts, address the need for explicit instruction of service providers in parent education strategies, and conduct research on the immediate and long-term effects of parent education on children and families.

40|$|THE EARLY <b>INTERVENTION</b> <b>field</b> is {{witnessing}} {{some major}} {{shifts in the}} focus of efficacy research. The traditional preoccupation with {{the question as to}} whether early intervention works is giving way to greater concern with understanding how programs make their impact. While this is seen as a progressive shift, much of the focus has so far been placed on how specific dimensions of the intervention process contribute to outcomes. Little {{attention has been paid to}} extra‐program variables which impinge upon or interact with the intervention process to shape outcomes. This paper presents the perspective that an intervention program is only one of many factors with potential influence on child and family functioning. Consequently program efficacy must be assessed in relation to both program and extra‐program variables.

This article {{suggests a}} multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) for achieving the dual goals of program optimization and program evaluation in the behavioral <b>intervention</b> <b>field.</b> Methods. MOST {{consists of the}} following three phases: (1) screening, in which randomized experimentation closely guided by theory is used to asses an array of program and/or delivery components and select the components that merit further investigation; (2) refining, in which interactions among the identified set of components and their interrelationships with covariates are investigated in detail, again via randomized experiments, and optimal dosage levels and combinations of components are identified; and (3) confirming, in which the resulting optimized intervention is evaluated {{by means of a}} standard randomized intervention trial. In order to make the best use of available resources, MOST relies on design and analysis tools that help maximize efficiency, such as fractional factorials. Results. A slightly modified version of an actual application of MOST to develop a smoking cessation intervention is used to develop and present the ideas. Conclusions.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{understanding}} of the term ‘harm reduction from a multi-agency perspective in order to assess the level of consensual meaning and shared understanding. The study then goes on to assess the need for consensus of meaning in policy interpretation and implementation in Ireland. Using a qualitative methodological approach, data was collected from two focus groups with six participants in each. The participants were members of the co-ordinating group responsible for policy development in the Western Health Board region. Interpretative content analysis was used to expose the participants’ understanding of harm reduction, identifying significant themes from each group. The primary conclusion is that no consensual meaning of the term ‘harm reduction’ exists in Ireland. The lack of debate and policy direction to date has contributed to various definition and interpretations of ‘harm reduction’ being adopted. Although there is no consensus of meaning, there is an agreement that the general concept of ‘harm reduction’ is that of a positive intervention in the treatment of people with drug problems. However, there is less certainty about its application in drug education.

Hybrid operating rooms consist of interventional radiology, open surgery, computed tomography, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and other techniques. This means that several disciplines and professionals need to work in new constellations creating a multidisciplinary team around the patient. In accordance with this development, higher professional education must provide new pedagogic strategies to successfully address the knowledge expected in today's complex working life. Aim: To explore the use of Applied Drama as a learning medium, focusing {{on the use of}} Forum Theatre, to foster team work and collaboration in the field of radiography and learning. Methods: A qualitative approach, closely related to Ethnography, was utilized. Result: The Drama Workshop utilising Forum Theatre created a dynamic learning environment and enabled the participants from three professions to understand each other's priorities better. The use of drama within health care education allows the students to take different roles in order to find the best way to co-operate. Conclusion: Forum Theatre is a useful learning medium in order to promote teamwork and collaboration in the radiological <b>intervention</b> <b>field.</b> By choosing a personal working experience, Forum Theatre seem to engage the participants at a deeper level and to experience various communication strategies and how the outcome changed depending on the approach.

It includes young children with all disabilities, as well as children identified as having developmental delays. Depending on the state, it may also include children {{who are at risk}} for developing disabilities or developmental delays based on conditions in the child (e. g., low birth weight) or in the environment (e. g., poverty). Early intervention services include a comprehensive system of services that address the multiple needs of these children, and the multiple needs, concerns and priorities of their families. It may be provided by any one or more type of agency, school or program, and may involve the services of professionals from any one or more discipline (e. g., special education, social work, occupational therapy).

This research quantitatively analyses the psychological health benefits of engaging {{in a range of}} green exercise activities and assesses its therapeutic properties for those experiencing mental ill-health. A series of four studies was conducted comprising one laboratory study, one observational field study, one <b>intervention</b> <b>field</b> study and a six-week nature-based intervention programme for people with mental health problem. Results were analysed using multivariate statistics. Key findings showed that participating in all types of green exercise activities, of different durations, intensities and exposure time enhanced mood (p< 0. 001) and improved self-esteem (p< 0. 001). blood pressure significantly reduced when viewing rural pleasant pictures (p< 0. 05) and exercise alone could not explain the improved health outcomes. Introducing a nature-based intervention programme for people with mental ill-health led to improvements in self-esteem (p< 0. 001), indicating its therapeutic properties. The findings have important implications for individual and community health, environmental protection and national and international policies. There are many areas of policy reform that could help increase participation in green exercise activities, although it is clear {{that there is a need}} for more comprehensive economic analyses to place a monetary value on avoided health costs. Participating in green exercise activities could offer a more sustainable option in maintaining long-term activity levels. However, in order to take advantage of these opportunities, a wide range of policy reform to increase the health and greenspace dividend is still required.

40|$|Background: Robust {{evidence}} supports {{the effectiveness of}} screening and brief alcohol interventions in primary healthcare. However lack of understanding about their ‘active ingredients’ and concerns over {{the extent to which}} current approaches remain faithful to their original theoretical roots, has led some to demand a cautious approach to future roll-out pending further research. Against this background, this paper provides a timely overview of the development of the brief alcohol intervention evidence base in order to assess {{the extent to which it}} has achieved the four key levels of intervention research: efficacy; effectiveness; implementation; and demonstration. Methods: Narrative overview based on:(1) results of a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effectiveness of brief alcohol intervention in primary healthcare;(2) synthesis of the findings of key additional primary studies on the improvement and evaluation of brief alcohol intervention implementation in routine primary healthcare. Results: The brief <b>intervention</b> <b>field</b> seems to constitute an almost perfect example of the evaluation of a complex intervention. Early evaluations of screening and brief intervention approaches included more tightly controlled efficacy trials and have been followed by more pragmatic trials of effectiveness in routine clinical practice. Most recently, attention has shifted to dissemination, implementation and wider-scale roll-out. However, delivery in routine primary health remains inconsistent, with an identified knowledge gap around how to successfully embed brief alcohol intervention approaches in mainstream care, and as yet unanswered questions concerning what specific intervention component prompt the positive changes in alcohol consumption. Conclusion: Both the efficacy and effectiveness of brief alcohol interventions have been comprehensively demonstrated, and intervention effects seem replicable and stable over time, and across different study contexts...|$|E
