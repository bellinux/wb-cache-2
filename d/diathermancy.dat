The <b>Diathermancy</b> of Ebonite, by some incomprehensible process, drove her bewildered mind {{back on her}} old companion. [...] "I want to give Teresa a little {{pleasure}} before we part," [...] she said timidly; [...] "may she go with us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The stupidest woman living {{would have}} {{understood}} what this proposal really meant. Mrs. Gallilee sanctioned it as composedly as if Ovid and Carmina had been brother and sister. [...] "I wish I could go with you," [...] she said, [...] "but my household affairs fill my morning. And there is a lecture this afternoon, which I cannot possibly lose. I don't know, Carmina, whether {{you are interested in}} these things. We are to have the apparatus, which illustrates the conversion of radiant energy into sonorous vibrations. Have you ever heard, my dear, of the <b>Diathermancy</b> of Ebonite? Not in your way, perhaps?" ...|$|E

[...] Again: when she contemplates {{taking part in a}} discussion on Matter, she has been slily looking into Chambers's Encyclopaedia, and has there discovered the interesting conditions on which she can [...] "dispense with the idea of atoms." [...] Briefly, not a word of my own invention occurs, when Mrs. Gallilee turns the learned side of her character to your worships' view.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Diathermancy</b> (from [...] "dia" [...] {{through and}} [...] "thermē" [...] heat) is the {{property}} of some fluids that allows rays of light through them without itself being heated. A diathermanous fluid is thus [...] "permeable" [...] by heat.). <b>Diathermancy</b> was first described by German physicist and chemist Heinrich Magnus in the 1800s. Atmospheric air is diathermanous; therefore, air is not heated by sunshine, but by long wave heat reflected by soil, and especially, water on the Earth surface. Water, on the contrary, is not diathermanous, and it is heated by sunshine directly.|$|E

His research output was continuous over his lifetime: the first memoir {{was published in}} 1825 {{when he was still}} a student, and the last appeared shortly after his death in 1870. From 1825 to 1833 he was occupied mainly with chemical researches. These resulted in the discovery of the first of the platino-ammonium class of compounds (see Magnus's green salt). He was first to identify the three sulfonic acids sulphovinic acid, ethionic acid and isethionic acid and their salts; and, in cooperation with CF Ammermüller, of per-iodic acid and its salts. He also reported on the diminution in density produced in garnet and vesuvianite by melting (1831). Subjects on which he published research after 1833 include: the absorption of gases in blood (1837-1845); the expansion of gases by heat (1841-1844); the vapour pressures of water and various solutions (1844-1854); thermoelectricity (1851); electrolysis of metallic salts in solution (1857); electromagnetic induction of currents (1858-1861); absorption and conduction of heat in gases (1860s); polarization of heat (1866-1868); and the deflection of projectiles from firearms (see Magnus effect). From 1861 onwards he devoted much attention to the question of <b>diathermancy</b> in gases and vapours, especially to the behaviour in this respect of dry and moist air, and to the thermal effects produced by the condensation of moisture on solid surfaces. Magnus was an experimenter, not a theoretician.|$|E

The difficult of {{high accuracy}} of heat inspect system was how to get the heat information with high accuracy and control the system at real time. In traditional method, the linear system was used to control the feedback of the heat, with the data sampled discrete, the model-based heat inspect of chemical industry was easily influenced by modeling errors and disturbances of complex chemical environment, which cause underreporting or false alarms, the result was not good. So a high accuracy application of sensitive <b>diathermancy</b> design method was proposed and applied in high accuracy chemical unite operation and chemical industry, a heat inspect method of principal component cluster analysis for the chemical industry, the accurate <b>diathermancy</b> heat inspect data was sampled with many sensitive <b>diathermancy</b> in different location, the corresponding heat inspect signal through effective heat inspect method was analyzed to deter the corresponding chemical <b>diathermancy</b> was faulty, with the data fusion method, the accurate data was output to control the system. Simulation results show that with sensitive <b>diathermancy</b> used in chemical unit operation, the heat data is outputted with high accuracy, and it has good application value in chemical industry...|$|E

The temperature characteristic in the soil of the dam is numerically simulated. The space location is parameterized and the objective function is setup. The time and ot her parameters denoting space location of the concentrated seepage are estimated by temperature regression via the data extracted from the numerical simulation of dam, and then the goal to detect {{the location of the}} concentrated seepage is reached. The precision of the location parameters are higher and that of time is poor...|$|E
