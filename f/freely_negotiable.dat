Copyrights, especially the right to publish a work, became transferrable through these licenses. The intention clearly was that the old-style authors' contracts were to be used amongst Soviet partners for domestic publication, whereas the new licensing scheme was to be [...] employed towards foreign publishers. Upon a decree of August 16, 1973, the [...] "All-Union Agency on Copyrights" [...] (VAAP [...] ) was founded on September 20, 1973. The VAAP replaced the several previously existing collecting societies (such as the VUOAP), taking over their tasks and additionally managing copyrights on foreign works in the USSR and also the copyrights on Soviet works abroad. Officially, the VAAP was a non-governmental organization sponsored by creative unions (such as the Union of Soviet Writers) and seven state organs; but for all practical purposes, it was a state agency. All contracts with foreign publishers had to be concluded through VAAP; authors were forbidden to negotiate directly with foreign publishers. In the standard authors' publishing contracts, an author transferred the right to use the work abroad to the first publisher; and publishers were also obliged to go through VAAP for international copyright deals. The VAAP held the state monopoly on the import and export of copyrights. Only the state organs for cinematography (Goskino, through its Soveksportfilm agency) and television and radio broadcasts (Gosteleradio), as well as the news agency Novosti were exempted from that monopoly, but even they had to register all contracts with foreign partners with VAAP.|$|E
50|$|Significant wealth {{has been}} brought into the High Weald over the centuries by those from outside wishing to live there. The trend for prosperous urban dwellers {{to move to the}} {{countryside}} is apparent as early as the 14th century. Kent was the most popular destination due in part to its accessibility to London and its particular form of land tenure which enabled land to be <b>freely</b> <b>negotiable.</b> The process of migration accelerated in the 19th century {{with the advent of the}} railways, which made access from London much easier. The resources brought into the area by wealthy incomers created and maintained the many parks and gardens that are now characteristic of the High Weald landscape.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic Discounting {{describes}} {{a collection of}} methods in which payment terms can be established between a buyer and supplier to accelerate payment for goods or services {{in return for a}} reduced price or discount. Dynamic Discounting methods are used for business-to-business transactions when contractual or pre-established early payment terms may not exist or the payment date does not conform to agreed upon discount terms. Dynamic Discounting includes the ability to agree upon terms that vary the discount according to the date of early payment. The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. In addition, it includes an ability for either buyer or supplier to propose an early payment date and discount for a one-time payment using electronic mail or specialized software. Through the use of dynamic discounting methods, buying organizations can increase the number and size of early payment discounts they receive and suppliers can get paid sooner at a lower cost of capital than alternative options. A range of concepts is available to implement dynamic discounting into supply chain finance (SCF): dynamic discounting {{can be seen as a}} comparatively simple form, whereby the supplier grants a cash discount for early payment of its invoices - the amount of the reduction and the time of payment are quickly and <b>freely</b> <b>negotiable.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} effects of three {{different}} transfer fee systems in European football on contract lengths, wages, profits, education incentives {{and the number of}} talents being educated. The different regimes, being used until the Bosman judgement of 1995, currently in use, and recently proposed by the European Commission differ with respect to the transfer fee an initial club must accept in case of a transfer depending on whether a player has a valid contract or not. In particular, we argue that due to its averse effects on investment incentives, the Commission should refrain from its Suggestion of abolishing <b>freely</b> <b>negotiable</b> transfer fees. Our analysis also sheds some light on the issue under which circumstances binding long-term contracts should be allowed in general labor law...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Discussions on {{the role}} of markets in {{healthcare}} easily lead to political and unfruitful polarized positions. Actors arguing in favour of markets as a solution for the quality/cost conundrum entrench themselves against others pointing out the risk of markets for the delivery and governance of healthcare. These binary options of more or less marketization preclude a more empirical analysis of how markets, as multiple arrangements, are constructed and what their consequences are for public values like affordability and quality. To empirically explore the relation between markets and public values in healthcare, in this paper we analyze the construction of a market for hospital care in the Netherlands, based on a system of diagnoserelated groups (DBCs), {{and the development of a}} market for long term care based on care-load packages (ZZPs). In these cases we address the intended result of care markets according to various policy actors, the visible and invisible work done by various actors to make markets work and the values enacted in market practices. We show that where policy aims within these markets focus on providing choice and increasing diversity of care institutions, the instruments of DBCs and ZZPs rather produce isomorphism and homogenization. Furthermore, the strong influence of financial instruments in shaping healthcare markets assume that cost and quality can both be strengthened while it in fact has a profound influence on how public values like quality get defined in practice. These translations between values pursued and outcomes produced indicate that conceptualizing the role of the state as defining public values that markets (have to) implement is problematic, as this removes crucial normative work in the shaping of our welfare states to the realm of the technical operationalization of markets. An alternative relation between state, market and society can be conceived once we accept that such values are shaped in practice and that the relationship between policy aims and policy consequences can never be fully captured through a logic of implementation. This then calls for an experimental role of the state: a state that sees market developments as experimental devices in which the aim is a good composition of public values. We propose this experimentation could for example focus on market developments that do not ascribe a privileged status to financial devices and price-mechanism, such as a market for the DBC A-segment, in which prices are not <b>freely</b> <b>negotiable.</b> Such experiments could allow competition to focus on other public values like quality and maintaining accessibility while at the same time function as learning laboratories for reconceiving the role between state, market and society...|$|E
