5000|$|The extra {{sensory organs}} (SOs) in Drosophila arise from cell-clusters known as sensory mother cells (SMCs). Once an imaginal disc cell has been {{selected}} to become an SMC, it {{will go on to}} mature into an SO. Therefore, the regulation of which imaginal disc cells become SMCs is vital to neural development. This transition is caused by the Da and AS-C genes, which are transcription factors with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domains. The Da protein (made by the daughterless gene) is a Class I <b>HLH</b> <b>protein,</b> meaning it has generalized distribution, whereas the AS-C proteins (made by the as-c gene complex) are Class II HLH proteins, meaning they have restricted distribution. The Emc protein itself is a Class V <b>HLH</b> <b>protein</b> due to its lack of the basic region and consequential inability to bind DNA. The interaction between Da or AS-C proteins with Emc to form dimers renders them inactive as transcription factors. It is the interplay between concentrations of Da, AS-C, and Emc proteins that determines whether or not a cell will become an SMC, and later on an SO. In this way, [...] "Emc provides positional information for SO patterning." [...] The levels of each of these proneural proteins is likely to be regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, as the lack of Notch causes an excess of neural cells while [...] "constitutive Notch signaling...suppresses neural differentiation." [...] Notch has been shown to mediate lateral specification of proneural cell-clusters by restricting the expression of AS-C proteins to only the neuroblast, while causing the surrounding dermoblast cells to cease expression of the as-c complex.|$|E
5000|$|ETV6-NTRK3 {{gene fusion}} is the {{translocation}} of genetic material between the ETV6 gene {{located on the}} short arm (designated p) of chromosome 12 at position p13.2 (i.e. 12p13.2) and the NTRK3 gene located on the long arm (designated q) of chromosome 15 at position q25.3 (i.e. 15q25.3) to create the (12;15)(p13;q25) fusion gene, ETV6-NTRK3. This new gene consists of the 5' end of ETV6 fused to the 3' end of NTRK3. ETV6-NTRK3 therefore codes for an chimeric oncoprotein consisting of the helix-loop-helix (<b>HLH)</b> <b>protein</b> dimerization domain of the ETV6 protein fused to the tyrosine kinase (i.e. PTK) domain of the NTRK3 protein. The ETV6 gene codes for the transcription factor protein, ETV6, which suppresses the expression of, and thereby regulates, various genes that in mice are required for normal hematopoiesis {{as well as the}} development and maintenance of the vascular network. NTRK3 codes for Tropomyosin receptor kinase C a NT-3 growth factor receptor cell surface protein that when bound to its growth factor ligand, neurotrophin-3, becomes an active tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine residues on, and thereby stimulates, signaling proteins that promote the growth, survival, and proliferation of their parent cells. The tyrosine kinase of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein is dysfunctional in that it is continuously active in phophorylating tyrosine residues on, and thereby continuously stimulating, proteins that promote the growth, survival, and proliferation of their parent cells. In consequence, these cells take on malignant characteristics and are on the pathway of becoming cancerous. Indeed, the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene appears to be a critical driver of several types of cancers. It was originally identified in congenital fibrosarcoma and subsequently found in secretory breast cancer (also termed juvenile breast cancer), Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary glands (also termed MASC or MASCSG), congenital fibrosarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, rare cases of acute myelogenous leukemia, ALK-negative Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, and radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma.|$|E

Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a cDNA library constructed from B cells, we identified the E-box-binding proteins E 12 and E 47 as potential lymphoid dimerization partners for LYL 1. The interaction of LYL 1 with E 2 a proteins was further characterized in vitro and shown to require the HLH motifs of both proteins. Immunoprecipitation analyses showed that in T-ALL and other cell lines, endogenous LYL 1 exists in a complex with E 2 a proteins. A preferred DNA-binding sequence, 5 '-AACAGATG(T/g) T- 3 ', for the LYL 1 -E 2 a heterodimer was determined by PCR-assisted site selection. Endogenous protein complexes containing both LYL 1 and E 2 a bound this sequence in various LYL 1 -expressing cell lines and could distinguish between the LYL 1 consensus and muE 2 sites.

Dominant-negative (antimorph) <b>HLH</b> <b>proteins</b> encoded by Id-related genes, such as ID4, also contain the HLH-dimerization domain but lack the DNA-binding basic domain. Consequently, Id proteins inhibit binding to DNA and transcriptional transactivation by heterodimerization with bHLH proteins.|$|R
40|$|The Id {{subfamily}} of helix-loop-helix (<b>HLH)</b> <b>proteins</b> plays {{a fundamental}} {{role in the}} regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. The major mechanism by which Id proteins are thought to inhibit differentiation is through interaction with other <b>HLH</b> <b>proteins</b> and inhibition of their DNA-binding activity. However, Id proteins have also been shown to interact with other proteins involved in regulating cellular proliferation and differentiation, suggesting a more widespread regulatory function. In this study we demonstrate functional interactions between Id proteins and members of the Pax- 2 /- 5 /- 8 subfamily of paired-domain transcription factors. Members of the Pax transcription factor family have key functions in regulating several developmental processes exemplified by B lymphopoiesis, in which Pax- 5 plays an essential role. Id proteins bind to Pax proteins in vitro and in vivo. Binding occurs through the paired DNA-binding domain of the Pax proteins and results in the disruption of DNA-bound complexes containing Pax- 2, Pax- 5, and Pax- 8. In vivo, Id proteins modulate the transcriptional activity mediated by Pax- 5 complexes on the B-cell-specific mb- 1 promoter. Our results therefore demonstrate a novel facet of Id function in regulating cellular differentiation by functionally antagonizing the action of members of the Pax transcription factor family...|$|R
