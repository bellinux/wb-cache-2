40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} the Nofer Institutes of Occupational Medicine in Łódź's {{results of the}} assessment of individual dose equivalents Hp(0. 07) of medical staff exposed to X-rays in Poland in 2012. In addition, the collected data was analysed in terms of types of medical units performing medical procedures and the categorization of personnel. Material and Methods: Dosimetric service was provided for medical staff of interventional radiology departments occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation in terms of individual dose equivalents Hp(0. 07). In 2012, personal dosimetry Hp(0. 07) determinations were performed by the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Łódź and covered 2044 employees from 174 health facilities. The determinations were performed using thermoluminescence dosimetry according to the procedure accredited by the Polish Centre for Accreditation (document number AB 327). The measurements were performed using ring-dosimeters in the periods of 1 or 2 months. Results: Mean annual <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> Hp(0. 07) in 2012 was equal to 3. 3 mSv (annual limit for Hp(0. 07) is 500 mSv). The average value of annual <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> Hp(0. 07) decreased comparing to the previous year. In 2012, no single case of exceeding the annual limit for Hp(0. 07) was reported. Data stored in the file indicates that more than 96 % {{of all of the}} annual doses did not exceed the level of 10 mSv. Conclusions: The analysis of data on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation confirms a stable level of exposure and satisfactory radiological protection in interventional radiology facilities monitored by the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Łódź in Poland in 2012.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} radiological {{dose assessment}} of equipment decontamination, subsurface disposal, landspreading, equipment smelting, and equipment burial {{was conducted to}} address concerns regarding the presence of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) in production waste streams. The assessment estimated maximum <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalents</b> for workers and the general public. Sensitivity analyses of certain input parameters also were conducted. On {{the basis of this}} assessment, it is concluded that (1) regulations requiring workers to wear respiratory protection during equipment cleaning operations are likely to result in lower worker doses, (2) underground injection and downhole encapsulation of NORM wastes present a negligible risk to the general public, and (3) potential doses to workers and the general public related to smelting NORM-contaminated equipment can be controlled by limiting the contamination level of the initial feed. It is recommended that (1) NORM wastes be further characterized to improve studies of potential radiological doses; (2) states be encouraged to permit subsurface disposal of NORM more readily, provided further assessments support this study; results; (3) further assessment of landspreading NORM wastes be conducted; and (4) the political, economic, sociological, and nonradiological issues related to smelting NORM-contaminated equipment be studied to fully examine the feasibility of this disposal option...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the International Nuclear Workers Study conducted in France, the UK and the U. S. (INWORKS), updated and expanded methods were developed to convert recorded doses of ionizing radiation to estimates of organ <b>doses</b> or <b>individual</b> personal <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> [H(p) (10) ] for a total number of 308, 297 workers, including 40, 035 women. This approach accounts for differences in dosimeter response to predominant workplace energy and geometry of exposure and for the recently published ICRP report on dose coefficients for men and women separately. The overall mean annual <b>individual</b> personal <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent,</b> including zero <b>doses,</b> is 1. 73 mSv [median = 0. 42; interquartile range (IQR) : 0. 07, 1. 59]. Associated <b>individual</b> organ <b>doses</b> were estimated. INWORKS includes workers who had potential for exposure to neutrons. Therefore, we analyzed neutron dosimetry data to identify workers potentially exposed to neutrons. We created a time-varying indicator for each worker, classifying them according to whether they had a positive recorded neutron dose and if so, whether their neutron dose ever exceeded 10 % of their total external penetrating radiation dose. The number of workers flagged as being exposed to neutrons was 13 % for the full cohort, with 15 % of the cohort in France, 12 % of the cohort in the UK and 14 % in the U. S. We also used available information on in vivo and bioassay monitoring to identify workers with known depositions or suspected internal contaminations. As a result of this work, information is now available that will allow various types of sensitivity analyses. R 03.

40|$|According to {{results of}} {{in-depth}} studies, {{the risk of}} the radiation-induced cataract is higher than it was considered earlier. In April 2011, ICRP released a statement on the tissue reactions. The statement recommends that for the case of for occupational exposure in planned exposure situations, an equivalent dose for the lens of the eye should be less than 20 mSv in a year, averaged over the defined periods of 5 years, with no single year exceeding the value of 50 mSv. In this regard, the new standard IAEA № GSR Part 3 provides the dose limit of 20 mSv in a year for occupational exposure for the lens of the eye. The dosimetric data on levels of exposure for personnel in the Russian Federation is practically absent. This paper performs a preliminary evaluation of equivalent dose for the lens of the eye for personnel working in X-ray operating rooms of medical facilities in Saint Petersburg and Kazan. This group of personnel was selected {{because of the fact that}} methodic of carrying out procedures forces medical staff to be not only in the zone of scattered radiation but also in the X-ray beam. This fact significantly increases exposure doses for the personnel.

Several radiation components (photons, neutrons, charged particles, muons, etc.), spanning {{a wide range}} of energies, contribute to the total <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent.</b> The radiation fields are produced by beam losses interacting with structural material during the acceleration or at the ejection to experimental areas or other accelerators. The particle beam is usually not continuous but separated in "bunches" or pulses, which further complicates dose measurements at high-energy accelerators. An ideal dosimeter for operational radiation protection should measure <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> for any composition of radiation components in the entire energy range even when the field is strongly pulsed. The objective of this work was to find out if an ionisation chamber operated as a "recombination chamber" and a TEPC instrument using the variance-covariance method ("Sievert Instrument") are capable of assessing the ambient <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> in radiation fields with short pulses. The results are compared to those of a conventional TEPC instrument (HANDI-TEPC) and to the total <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> values obtained from the suitable combination of readings from instruments currently used at CERN. These instruments are a combination of several detectors with different characteristics measuring <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> fractions (i. e. an argon-filled chamber, a hydrogen-filled chamber and a rem ionisation chamber). The HANDI-TEPC is usually the preferred reference instrument in mixed radiation fields of unknown composition at CERN, but in strongly pulsed fields it fails because of pile-up effects. Although the mixed {{stray radiation}} fields differ strongly from those applied in standard calibration, the first step in using a radiation protection instrument is the intensive study and characterisation of the detector behaviour in reference fields of calibration sources. This forms the basis for improving the reliability and accuracy of measurements in unknown radiation fields. The next step is to test the detectors in mixed reference fields, which simulate workplace fields but are produced under laboratory conditions. At CERN, an opportunity for such a reference field is realized by the CERF-field (CERN-EU high-energy reference field). The field provides a mixed field of mainly neutrons ranging from thermal energies up to hundreds of GeV accompanied by photons and muons. At CERF the HANDI-TEPC was known to be suitable {{to be used as a}} reference instrument for the total <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent.</b> For this reason the results of the recombination chamber and Sievert Instrument were compared to those of the HANDI-TEPC for several reference locations and different beam intensities. In particular, the background radiation at CERF was studied, which has a non-negligible influence on the total <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> and is strongly dependent on the reference location. At CERF, a very good agreement between the instruments was found. Finally the instruments were investigated in an unknown mixed stray radiation field with short pulses on the "PS-bridge". This PS-bridge is a location where 260 cm of concrete shield the beam line of the PS accelerator. The operation of the PS at CERN is composed of a supercycle of 16. 8 s divided in 14 cycles of 1. 2 s each. The duration of the particle pulse can be as short as 10 µs. In such a field the HANDI-TEPC was not able to resolve the single events within one particle pulse because of pile-up effects. The recombination chamber and the Sievert Instrument, however, appear to be capable of assessing the total <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> correctly provided that the response is interpreted carefully by using appropriate corrections and calibration factors...|$|R

40|$|Measurements were {{performed}} to assess the <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> outside a primary proton treatment field, using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microdosimeter. The SOI microdosimeter {{was placed on the}} surface of an anthropomorphic phantom and <b>dose</b> <b>equivalents</b> were determined as a function of lateral distance from a typical passively scattered and modulated prostate treatment field. Measurements were also completed within a polystyrene plate phantom as a function of depth for a distance of 5 cm from the field edge, as function of lateral distance from field edge at two different depths, and as a function of distance from the distal edge on the central beam axis. The <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> at the surface of the anthropomorphic phantom decreases from 3. 9 to 0. 18 mSv/Gy when the lateral distance from the proton field edge increases from 2. 5 to 60 cm. Measurements along the proton depth dose distribution at a constant distance of 5 cm from the primary field edge indicate a decrease in <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> as a function of depth, with a 38 % decrease relative to the surface dose at a depth of 5 cm in polystyrene. Measurements completed as a function of lateral distance from the primary field at two separate depths within polystyrene illustrate a convergence of the <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> at approximately 20 cm from the primary field edge. Past the distal edge of the spreadout Bragg peak <b>dose</b> <b>equivalents</b> decrease exponentially for increasing distance, with an initial value of 1. 6 mSv/Gy at 0. 6 cm from the distal edge. Silicon microdosimetry measurements were also compared with published results obtained utilizing different measurement techniques. This study demonstrates the applicability of SOI microdosimetry in determining the <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> outside proton treatment fields, and provides valuable information on the <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> both at the surface and at depth experienced by prostate cancer patients treated with protons...|$|R
