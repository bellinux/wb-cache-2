5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> observed in layer V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 <b>expression</b> <b>is</b> restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E

40|$|Protein kinase C (PKC) is {{a family}} of protein kinases {{controlling}} protein phosphorylation and playing important roles in the regulation of metabolism. We have investigated expression levels of PKC isoforms in pancreatic islets and liver of diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats with and without insulin treatment to evaluate their association with glucose homeostasis. mRNA and protein expression levels of PKC isoforms were assessed in pancreatic islets and liver of Wistar rats and GK rats with or without insulin treatment.

40|$|Neurotrophins {{and their}} receptors {{modulate}} cerebral cortical development. Tubers in the {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} (TSC) are characterized histologically by disorganized cortical cytoarchitecture and thus, we hypothesized that expression of neurotrophin mRNAs and proteins might be altered in tubers. Using in situ transcription and mRNA amplification to probe cDNA arrays, we found that neurotrophin- 3 (NT 3) and trkB mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>were</b> reduced whereas neurotrophin- 4 (NT 4) and trkC mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>were</b> increased in whole tuber sections. Alterations in mRNA abundance were defined in single microdissected dysplastic neurons (DNs) and giant cells (GCs). NT 3 mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> reduced in GCs and trkB mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> reduced in DNs. NT 4 mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> increased in DNs and trkC mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> increased in both DNs and GCs. In three patients, TSC 2 locus mutations were confirmed and the mean tuberin mRNA <b>expression</b> levels <b>was</b> reduced across all nine cases. Consistent with these observations, NT 3 mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> reduced but trkC mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>was</b> increased in vitro in human NTera 2 neurons (NT 2 N) transfected with a tuberin antisense construct that reduced tuberin expression. Western analysis of tuber homogenates and computer-assisted densitometry of immunolabeled sections confirmed the neurotrophin mRNA expression data in whole sections and single neurotrophin immunoreactive cells. We conclude that alterations in NT 4 /trkB and NT 3 /trkC expression may contribute to tuber formation during brain development as downstream effects of the hamartin and tuberin pathway in TSC...|$|R
