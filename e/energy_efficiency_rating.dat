40|$|The State-of-Charge (SOC) is an {{important}} performance parameter and evaluation index in rechargeable battery energy storage systems. Here, a novel smart estimation method based on coulomb counting is proposed {{in order to enhance}} estimation accuracy. Firstly, an enhanced model for the initial SOC (SOC 0) estimation based on dynamic multi-parameter method is investigated, because SOC 0 {{plays a key role in}} calculating real SOC in-time. All the design limits, such as voltage, temperature, are used as its constraints. And more importantly, the relaxation effect also is considered. The SOC 0 with the main parameters satisfies Gauss function. Secondly, the quantitative relations of the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are measured and analyzed under the moderate discharging situation. The results show a negative quadratic correlation between <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and <b>rate,</b> and exhibit a reduction in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> as <b>rate</b> increases.
