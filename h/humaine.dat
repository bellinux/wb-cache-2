5|$|Although critics panned the novel, Balzac {{remained}} steadfast in {{his belief}} that it provided an important look at philosophy, especially metaphysics. As he developed the scheme for La Comédie <b>humaine,</b> he placed Louis Lambert in the Études philosophiques section, and later returned to the same themes in his novel Séraphîta, about an androgynous angelic creature.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{published}} Z. Marcas in {{the first}} issue of the Revue Parisienne, 25 July 1840. It was republished a year later under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux ("The Death of an Ambitious Man"), in a collection from various authors called Le Fruit défendu ("Forbidden Fruit"). Shortly before his death, Balzac placed the story in the Scènes de la vie politique section of his collection La Comédie <b>humaine.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1958 Poulenc {{embarked}} on a collaboration with his old friend Cocteau, in an operatic version of the latter's 1930 monodrama La Voix <b>humaine.</b> The work was produced in February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, under Cocteau's direction, with Duval as the tragic deserted woman speaking to her former lover by telephone. In May Poulenc's 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter's retirement from public performance.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, {{particularly}} {{in his native}} country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. During the 21st century more {{attention has been given}} to his serious works, with many new productions of Dialogues des Carmélites and La voix <b>humaine</b> worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and choral music.|$|E
5|$|Louis Lambert is an 1832 {{novel by}} French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850), {{included}} in the Études philosophiques section of his novel sequence La Comédie <b>humaine.</b> Set mostly in a school at Vendôme, it examines the life and theories of a boy genius fascinated by the Swedish philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772).|$|E

5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie <b>humaine,</b> in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E
5|$|When Balzac {{began writing}} Le Père Goriot in 1834, {{he had written}} several dozen books, {{including}} a stream of pseudonymously published potboiler novels. In 1829 he published Les Chouans, the first novel to which he signed his own name; {{this was followed by}} Louis Lambert (1832), Le Colonel Chabert (1832), and La Peau de chagrin (1831). Around this time, Balzac began organizing his work into a sequence of novels that he eventually called La Comédie <b>humaine,</b> divided into sections representing various aspects of life in France during the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|When he {{developed}} his scheme for organizing {{all of his}} novels and stories into a single sequence called La Comédie <b>humaine,</b> Balzac placed La Peau de chagrin {{at the start of}} the section called Études philosophiques ("Philosophical Studies"). Like the other works in this category– including the similarly autobiographical Louis Lambert (1832)– it deals with philosophy and the supernatural. But it also provides a bridge to the realism of the Études des mœurs ("Study of Manners"), where the majority of his novels were located.|$|E

5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie <b>Humaine</b> reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine Bette, however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8October to 3December, and Balzac rushed {{to keep up with}} the newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of La Cousine Bette was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection La Comédie <b>humaine</b> in 1848.|$|E
5|$|To raise {{additional}} {{funding for the}} over-running production, Zwoboda had used the success of La Bête <b>Humaine</b> to sell advanced screening rights in large theatres to Jean Jay, {{the director of the}} Gaumont Film Company. When shooting in Sologne finally began progress was slow because of the constant improvisations of the actorswhich Renoir encouragedand Gregor's struggles with her role. Jay visited the set and was unhappy with the slow progress and with Renoir's performance. The cast and crew however admired Renoir and enjoyed the carefree atmosphere on set, forgetting about the impending political situation. The cast's improvisations caused some changes from the original script. Christine was initially written as a bored, upper class bourgeois whose main preoccupation was planning parties, but Renoir amended this to accommodate Gregor's acting. Renoir also cut most of the references to Christine's conductor father Stiller, such as his relationship with the Marquis. The Marquis was initially written as a patron of the arts and music instead of a collector of music boxes.|$|E
