40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we {{investigate}} the optimal capital injection behaviour of {{an insurance company}} if the interest rate is allowed to become negative. The surplus process of the considered <b>insurance</b> <b>entity</b> is assumed to follow a Brownian motion with drift. The changes in the interest rate are described via a Markov-switching process. It turns out that in times with a positive rate, it is optimal to inject capital only if the company becomes insolvent. However, if the rate is negative it might be optimal to hold a strictly positive reserve. We establish an algorithm for finding the value function and the optimal strategy, which is proved to be of barrier type. Using the iteration argument, we show that the value function solves the Hamilton [...] Jacobi [...] Bellman equation, corresponding to the problem...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we assume}} that the surplus process of an <b>insurance</b> <b>entity</b> is {{represented}} by a pure diffusion. The company can invest its surplus into a Black-Scholes risky asset and a risk free asset. We impose investment restrictions that only a limited amount is allowed in the risky asset and that no short-selling is allowed. We further assume that when the surplus level becomes negative, the company can borrow to continue financing. The ultimate objective is to seek an optimal investment strategy that minimizes the probability of absolute ruin, i. e. the probability that the liminf of the surplus process is negative infinity. The corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is analyzed and a verification theorem is proved; applying the HJB method we obtain explicit expressions for the S-shaped minimal absolute ruin function and its associated optimal investment strategy. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we study the optimization problem with both investment and proportional reinsurance control.

Eighty-four percent of the U. S. population has health insurance, either from private or public sources. 1 Health insurance plans have several common features. Individuals, or someone on their behalf (such as employers or the government), pay monthly insurance premiums, in return for which the <b>insurance</b> <b>entity</b> pays for some share of their medical costs. The share that is not paid by the insurer is the patient’s “co-insurance ” amount, and is borne by the individual. A central question for designing health insurance plans is: how large should such a co-insurance amount be? This question has been an important source of debate among both academics and health policy-makers. There is a clear tradeoff as patient co-insurance amounts rise. On the one hand, co-insurance can induce patients to use care more efficiently. With no co-insurance costs, patients have no financial disincentive to forgo care, even if it is of dubious value; but once patients bea...|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} demand for services further propagated by {{population growth and}} by people's response to newly emerging pathologies, nations in sub-Saharan Africa are faced with insurmountable problems in sustaining their health systems. Realizing the inadequacy of solely relying on the public sector, these countries are seeking alternative mechanisms for health financing. Among the alternatives suggested are risk-sharing mechanisms that include community-based schemes that tap the potential of indigenous social arrangements. In Ethiopia, eders are major forms of indigenous arrangements utilized mainly for assisting victims in bereavement and executing funeral-related activities. These associations are also called upon in various self-help activities and sometimes provide health insurance, even though mostly in an informal manner. Therefore, they {{have the potential to}} serve as social financing mechanisms. Since these are already functioning groups, the administrative cost for the extra health-related activity will not be as high {{as in the case of}} forming a new <b>insurance</b> <b>entity.</b> In addition, the fact that eders are based on mutual understanding among members minimizes the possibility of adverse selection. Based on the above background, an exploratory study was conducted in 40 villages distributed in various parts of Ethiopia to assess the possible roles eders might play in providing insurance for health financing. Both qualitative and quantitative (household and health facility exit interview surveys) methods of data collection were utilized. The study concludes that eder-based schemes are, indeed, options for experimentation as mechanisms for financing health care in rural Ethiopia. It was also found that 21. 5 % of respondents in the household and 16 % of those in the exit surveys were already utilizing eders to finance part of their health expenditure.
