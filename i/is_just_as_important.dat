25|$|Psychology {{was first}} {{recognized}} as a major subject at the university by Professor Imre Sándor, who realized {{that the study of}} psychology <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as that of pedagogy. Accordingly, on 20 October 1926, he filed his petition to the directors of the university {{for the establishment of a}} fundamentally different, modern Department of Pedagogy and Psychology. György Málnási Bartók, the Professor of the Department of Philosophy, was an avid supporter of the petition, since the tuition of Psychology had been the responsibility of his department at that period. In his petition, Imre Sándor listed the following fields and branches as belonging to the new Department's sphere of competence: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Psychology of Differences, Education of Backward Children, Psychotechnics, and Pedagogical Somatology.|$|E
25|$|While Poe herself {{admitted}} that her biggest {{strength in the}} campaign was her surname, she also conceded {{that it would be}} insufficient for her to be elected simply on that alone, emphasizing that her platform <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as her name in getting her elected to the Senate. She also dismissed claims that her candidacy was her family's revenge against her father's loss in 2004, saying that all she wants to do is serve should she be elected to the Senate. A day after the election, Poe was announced as among the winners with her having the highest number of votes. She was officially proclaimed a senator by the COMELEC board on May 2013, along with fellow Team PNoy candidates Chiz Escudero, Sonny Angara, Alan Peter Cayetano, and Loren Legarda, as well United Nationalist Alliance candidate Nancy Binay (who did not attend, opting instead to send her lawyer to represent her).|$|E
500|$|... "Dog Gone" [...] is {{the eighth}} {{episode of the}} eighth season of the {{animated}} comedy series Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 29, 2009. The episode features Brian, the family pet, attempting to prove that a dog's life <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> {{as that of a}} human's, after he accidentally kills another dog with no consequences. Meanwhile, the Griffin family hires Consuela, a stereotypical Hispanic woman, as the household maid, which they each end up regretting once she takes advantage of the family's home.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the event {{is that it is a}} team competition. A competitor who manages to reach fourth place instead of a projected sixth place can <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important,</b> or even more important, for the end result as a [...] "star" [...] that secures the expected first place. A fight to the finish between competitor number five and six, half a lap behind the winner, can <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the actual winner. The race is not over until the last competitor crosses the line. For many of the competitors the international is the most prestigious competition of the year.|$|R
500|$|Its {{importance}} {{is not limited}} to the historical information it provides, however. It <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> a source for the early development of English. The Peterborough Chronicle changes from the standard Old English literary language to early Middle English after 1131, providing some of the earliest Middle English text known. Howe notes, in [...] "Rome: Capitol of Anglo-Saxon England", that many of the entries indicate that Rome was considered a spiritual home for the Anglo-Saxons, Rome and Roman history being of paramount importance in many of the entries; he cites the one for AD 1, for instance, which lists the reign of Octavian Augustus before it mentions the birth of Christ.|$|E
500|$|In 2016, Sensation Comics {{featured}} Wonder Woman officiating a same-sex wedding (Issue #48) {{drawn by}} Australian illustrator Jason Badower. Inspired by the June Supreme Court ruling that established marriage equality in all 50 United States, Badower says DC Comics was [...] "fantastic" [...] about his {{idea for the}} issue. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, he said his editor [...] "Was like 'great, I love it! Let's do it. It was almost anticlimactic." [...] Wonder Woman's advocacy for gay rights was taken a step further in September 2016, when comic book writer Greg Rucka announced that she is canonically bisexual, according to her rebooted Rebirth origin. Rucka stated that in his opinion, she [...] "has to be" [...] queer and has [...] "obviously" [...] had same-sex relationships on an island surrounded by beautiful women. This follows the way Wonder Woman {{was written in the}} alternate continuity or non-canon Earth One by Grant Morrison, and fellow Wonder Woman writer Gail Simone staunchly supported Rucka's statement. Surprised at the amount of backlash from her fanbase, Rucka responded to [...] "haters" [...] that consensual sex with women <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> to Wonder Woman as the Truth is to Superman.|$|E

2500|$|Word {{order is}} {{comparatively}} free. Adjectives may precede or follow nouns; subjects, verbs and objects may occur in any order. However, the article [...] "the", demonstratives such as [...] "that" [...] and prepositions (such as [...] "at") must come before their related nouns. Similarly, the negative [...] "not" [...] and conjunctions such as [...] "and" [...] and [...] "that" [...] must precede the phrase or clause that they introduce. In copular (A = B) clauses, word order <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as in English: [...] "people are animals" [...] is distinguished from [...] "animals are people".|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} Judaism spans more than 3,000 years. Judaism {{has its roots}} as a {{structured}} religion in the Middle East during the Bronze Age. Judaism {{is considered one of}} the oldest monotheistic religions. The Hebrews and Israelites were already referred to as [...] "Jews" [...] in later books of the Tanakh such as the Book of Esther, with the term Jews replacing the title [...] "Children of Israel". Judaism's texts, traditions and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity, Islam and the Baha'i Faith. Many aspects of Judaism have also directly or indirectly influenced secular Western ethics and civil law. Hebraism <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> a factor in the development of Western civilization as , and Judaism, as the mother religion of Christianity, has considerably shaped Western ideals and morality since the Christian Era.|$|E

However, it is probably relevant that Grime's Graves were close to the very rich soils of the Fens, and forest clearance here would rely on local products.|$|R

2500|$|Emotional support <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> in {{employee}} {{health as}} it is in non-work related circumstances. [...] It is important for POS to be high because an employee's feeling of belonging, respect, and support raises his or her morale, which has a positive effect on performance. [...] It is similar to the feeling of support from family and friends. [...] However, although each employee most likely has some need to be fulfilled, those needs are not necessarily all the same. [...] Also, some employees might need more support than others. [...] Some might have higher socioemotional needs. [...] An example given in an article on POS was about police officers. [...] The police officers who needed more [...] "approval, esteem, emotional support, or affiliation" [...] issued more speeding tickets and arrested more people for driving under the influence when their POS was high.|$|E
2500|$|The date {{chosen for}} the African and Caribbean War Memorial to be {{permanently}} installed in Windrush Square was 22 June 2017 (Windrush Day), when an unveiling and dedication ceremony was held. Other associated activities included a play, Remembered, at the Paul Robeson Theatre in Hounslow, West London, and the launch of a book entitled Remembered: In Memoriam, an anthology of essays, articles and narratives about African and Caribbean experiences during and {{in the aftermath of}} the world wars, compiled by Jak Beula and Nairobi Thompson. In a letter of support to the Nubian Jak Community Trust, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II said: [...] "It is now over 70 years since the end of that war, but it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> to remember the ultimate sacrifice made by those men and women who were prepared to lay down their live for our freedoms." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{first put}} into production, {{the film was}} {{promoted}} as having the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which was later changed to Rapunzel. Disney's previous animated feature The Princess and the Frog in 2009, while being well-received by various critics [...] and taking in nearly $270 million worldwide was not as successful as Disney had hoped. Catmull would later admit in writing that Disney Animation's faith that The Princess and the Frogs excellent quality would bring in all audiences notwithstanding the word [...] "princess" [...] in the title was their version of [...] "a stupid pill." [...] In order to market the film to both sexes and additional age groups, Disney changed the film's name from Rapunzel to Tangled while also emphasizing Flynn Rider, the film's prominent male character, showing that his story <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as Rapunzel's. Disney was criticized for altering the classic title as a marketing strategy. Floyd Norman, a former Disney and Pixar animator and story artist, said, [...] "The idea of changing {{the title of a}} classic like Rapunzel to Tangled is beyond stupid. I'm convinced they'll gain nothing from this except the public seeing Disney as desperately trying to find an audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|It can be assumed, that Hahn was {{in close}} contact with the universally known natural {{scientist}} Jakob Sturm and probably with his two sons. He named a spider species after Jakob: Araneus Sturmii, now Atea sturmi (Hahn, 1831). His relationship with Johann Georg Wagler must have been similarly close. He also named a spider species after him: Lÿcosa Waglerii, now Pardosa wagleri (Hahn, 1822). Nothing reliable is known about other contacts within the remarkably productive Nuremberg zoologist scene. Nor is there any proof, that Hahn knew Franz von Paula (von) Schrank personally, a highly regarded natural scientist, to whom he dedicated the [...] "Monograph on Spiders". The scientific value of Hahn's lifework in natural history varies. His ornithological work, for example, never had any discernible influence on this field. On the other hand, Hahn's work on the true bugs (Heteroptera) <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as his works on spiders (Araneae). One species of bug even carries his name: Lopus hahni Stål, 1860. He was also given this honour in the field of arachnology: Carl Ludwig Koch, who continued [...] "Die Arachniden" [...] after Hahn's death, called a genus after him in 1841 (Hahnia), on which later the name of the whole family was based – Hahniidae Bertkau, 1878.|$|E
