5000|$|The {{importance}} of materials {{design and the}} understanding of grain boundaries was highlighted during the operation of Hinkley point. In 1969 there was a catastrophic failure of the Hinkley Point ‘A’ turbine-generator at near normal speeds (3200 rev/min). The interaction of fragments of the burst disc and the shaft caused the adjacent disc to burst almost immediately afterwards, and in the general disruption that followed another disc disintegrated completely and the entire unit was irreparably damaged. This {{is thought to be}} the first catastrophic failure of a turbine-generator in Britain. The characteristics of the material from which the burst discs were made were a contributory factor in the failure. The 3 Cr-Mo steel made by the a.0.h. process was temper embrittled during slow <b>furnace</b> <b>cooling</b> after heat treatment and therefore had poor fracture toughness, i.e. low tolerance of very sharp crack-like defects in highly stressed regions. Such material can of course be used quite safely in highly stressed regions in the absence of cracks. A material of higher fracture toughness would have tolerated larger cracks without succumbing to their unstable propagation, and the failure would have been postponed if not avoided. At the time of the manufacture of these discs, almost 15 years ago, {{it was not possible to}} quantify the effect of embrittlement on the material’s ability to tolerate small cracks in the most highly stressed regions. The reason for the failure was down to transport of phosphor towards the grain boundaries which embrittled the chromium steel causing it to fail ...|$|E

40|$|Selective laser melting (SLM) {{is used to}} {{manufacture}} dense NiTi parts. The microstructure and texture are assessed (before and after annealing followed by <b>furnace</b> <b>cooling)</b> and linked to the compression behaviour and shape memory response. It is shown that SLM strongly orients the fine austenite subgrains towards the building direction. This texture induces the highest spring back along the building (vertical) direction and the lowest along the horizontal direction after compression. The compressive stiffness, on the other hand, is the highest along horizontal direction and the lowest in vertical direction. The internal stresses due to SLM processing are another factor that may induce large martensite plates, decreasing the spring back. Although post-annealing (followed by <b>furnace</b> <b>cooling)</b> annihilates these large SLM stress induced martensite plates, it is unsuccessful to achieve completely isotropic properties. The <b>furnace</b> <b>cooling</b> after annealing may even segregate austenite and martensite within SLM solidified tracks, causing a mixed shape memory response. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{residual}} mechanical properties of OPC and OPC/slag concretes, exposed to either 400 or 800 ºC followed by <b>furnace</b> or water <b>cooling.</b> The heat transfer from surface to {{centre of the}} specimens maintained similar trend for all blends for both 400 and 800 ºC. After 400 ºC, OPC and OPC/slag water cooled specimens presented a further 20 % loss in the residual strength when compared with <b>furnace</b> <b>cooled</b> specimens. This additional strength decrease of 20 % is possibly due to thermal stresses caused by the thermal shock of the concrete with water at 20 ºC.

However, water cooled OPC specimens presented strength loss of 14 % when compared with <b>furnace</b> <b>cooled</b> specimens, and therefore, thermal stresses cannot solely {{be the cause of}} this strength loss.
