40|$|At the end {{of their}} service life, {{concrete}} members can be demolished and reused as alternative constituents in the production of new concrete mixtures. This process leads to producing a sustainable construction material often referred to as Recycled Aggregates Concrete (RAC), in which ordinary aggregates are (partially or totally) replaced by Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCAs). However, due to the intrinsic characteristics of RCAs (i. e., higher porosity in comparison with ordinary aggregates) the definition of reliable relationships, capable of predicting the relevant properties of RACs, is still considered an open issue. Moreover, in last years, the scientific community mainly focused on understanding the mechanical behavior of RAC at hardened state and only few studies addressed the properties at the fresh state. The present paper investigates the influence of RCAs on the resulting rheological behavior of RACs. In fact, the higher porosity of aggregates generally modifies the actual amount of free water, which controls the resulting workability, according to the well-known Lyse’s rule. Moreover, the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condition</b> of aggregates is a further aspect to be duly taken into account. Therefore, this study is mainly intended at extending to RAC some conceptual tools, such as the aforementioned Lyse’s rule and the simplified Bingham model, whose application is well-established for ordinary concrete mixture. With this aim, several experimental tests were performed (i. e., slump and rheometer test) in order to investigate the effect of various aspects and parameters, such as the processing procedures of RCAs, the actual aggregate replacement ratio and the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condition</b> of coarse recycled aggregates. Finally, it is worth highlighting that this work results from the SUPERCONCRETE Project (H 2020 -MSCA-RISE- 2014 – n. 645704), funded by the European Union as part of the H 2020 Programme...|$|E

Hydration processes are monitored via temperature measurements in hardening concrete samples and the time evolution of the degree of hydration is determined through a 1 D hydration and heat flow model.

However, such influences vary depending on other factors such as rainfall characteristics, soil properties, and <b>initial</b> soil <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions.</b> Thus, in-depth {{research is needed to}} better understand and evaluate the combined effects of these factors on overland flow dynamics. The objective of this experimental study was to examine how surface microrelief, in conjunction with the factors of rainfall, soil, and <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions,</b> impacts overland flow generation and runoff processes in both laboratory and field settings. A series of overland flow experiments were conducted for rough and smooth surfaces that represented distinct microtopographic characteristics and the experimental data were analyzed and compared. Across different soil types and <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions,</b> both laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that a rough soil surface experienced a delayed initiation of runoff and featured a stepwise threshold flow pattern due to the microrelief-controlled puddle filling-spilling-merging dynamics.

However, enhanced capability of overland flow generation and faster puddle connectivity of a rough field plot occurred during the subsequent rain events...|$|R

40|$|Drying {{shrinkage}} {{of concrete}} {{has been found}} to cause cracking, water leakage and other serviceability problems and is thus an important research topic. In early studies, it has been found that the shrinkage of concrete varies with the rock aggregate used. This is partly because the aggregate also shrinks and the shrinkage of aggregate is dependent on the type of rock from which the aggregate is derived. However, there have been few studies on the shrinkage of rock and how the shrinkage of aggregate would affect the shrinkage of concrete. In this study, the shrinkage of the granite rock in Hong Kong was measured. It has been found that the rock shrinks quite substantially upon drying and that its shrinkage is dependent on the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condition.</b> Based on such observation, two alternative methods of treating the aggregate before use so as to reduce the shrinkage of concrete are proposed. Long-term shrinkage measurement of concrete made with untreated and treated aggregates revealed that the proposed methods of aggregate treatment, which are still rudimentary, can significantly reduce the shrinkage of concrete. © 2010 Thomas Telford Ltd. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study on the {{mechanical}} behaviour of recycled aggregate concretes (RACs) and is mainly intended at unveiling how they are fundamentally influenced by the mixture constituents and conditions. To this end, it summarises the results of some experimental tests carried out at the Laboratory of Material testing and Structure (LMS) of the University of Salerno (Italy) on samples of concrete mixtures made with natural aggregates (NAs) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs), characterised by two different <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions.</b> The compressive strength determined at different curing ages and the time evolution of temperature developed within the concrete samples during setting and hardening are reported for each concrete mixture. By making use of a theoretical heat flow model, temperature measurements could be employed for identifying the hydration process of cement, which take place in such mixtures. These analyses clearly highlighted that the hydration reaction is significantly influenced, not only by the nominal water-cement ratio, but also by the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions</b> of recycled aggregates, whose significantly higher porosity modifies the water content actually available in the mixture for cement hydration. Moreover, linear correlations emerged between the so-called "degree of hydration" and the corresponding compressive strength. In fact, introducing the degree of hydration as a fundamental parameter connects the micro-structural evolution {{to the development of the}} macro-scale mechanical properties of RACs. This multi-scale approach is considered as a key step in simulating the behaviour of structures made of concretes with recycled aggregates...|$|R

There are some standards which give guidelines and recommendations to control cracking, but these cannot be directly used for local masonry due to the differences in properties of masonry units used, environmental conditions and the construction techniques.

40|$|The {{construction}} sector {{is more and}} more committed to reduce its environmental impacts. One of the key actions undertaken in the last decade deals with the ability of turning construction and demolition waste into new raw materials. For instance, the use of recycled aggregates for producing new concrete {{was one of the most}} investigated. Thus, in the last decade, plenty of researches were involved in project on characterising the mechanical behaviour of concrete made with recycled aggregates. However, these projects were mainly experimental in nature and generally led to merely empirical formulations. Conversely, this paper is intended at providing a contribution for predicting the mechanical properties of Recycled Aggregates Concrete (RAC). Particularly, it aims at quantifying the effect of replacing ordinary aggregates with Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) on the resulting compressive strength of RAC. To this end, a conceptual model considering both the relevant physical properties of regular and recycled aggregates, including the attached mortar content, and the hydration reactions of Portland cement paste is proposed. The actual predictive capacity of the proposed model is assessed through an experimental validation against experimental tests carried out on several concrete batches produced with various values for the different keys parameters, such as the nominal water-to-cement ratio, the aggregates replacement ratio and the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condition</b> of aggregates.

40|$|Enhancing the {{environmental}} sustainability of human activities and industrial processes {{is a common}} challenge in various branches of the modern research and technology. The construction sector is fully concerned by this challenge. Particularly, since concrete is the most widely employed construction material, several solutions are nowadays under investigation to reduce {{the environmental}} impact of its production. They mainly consist of partially replacing "natural" constituents with recycled ones, in view of the twofold objective of reducing both the demand of raw materials and the amount of waste to be disposed in landfills. However, the definition of stable correlations between the actual properties of concrete produced with the aforementioned recycled constituents is still considered as an open issue. This paper is intended as a contribution to such an issue and reports the main results of a wide experimental campaign recently carried out (and partially still ongoing) at the Laboratory of Materials testing and Structures (LMS) of the University of Salerno (Italy) in which the mechanical and physical properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) made with aggregates obtained by crushing some concrete structural elements, are investigated.

40|$|Landslide {{events are}} one of the {{commonly}} experienced natural disasters in Hong Kong that often cause enormous economic losses and threaten public safety. Among various mechanism causing landslides, infiltration from rainfall is the main one that leads to slope failure. Therefore, modeling of rainwater infiltration and prediction of pore water pressure distribution in both saturated and unsaturated soil are essential in determining the stability of a slope. The conventional approach in modeling flow behaviors in steep slopes is to decouple the surface and subsurface flow processes. However, infiltration is affected by the temporal and spatial variations of the subsoil condition and surface runoff depth. To improve modeling the rainfall-infiltration-runoff process it is desirable to simultaneously consider the interactions between surface and subsurface flows. Very little research has been done on coupling both surface and subsurface flow processes to predict the pore-water pressure distribution in slope stability analysis. Therefore, this study attempts to apply and examine a coupled surface-subsurface flow model, in conjunction with the slope stability analysis, to simulate the rainfall-infiltration-runoff-slope stability process. In addition, uncertainties exist in all aspects of surface-subsurface flow modeling process. The surface roughness, soil-water retention characteristics, as well as shear strength properties are all subject to uncertainty. As a result, the corresponding model outputs are also subject to uncertainty. Therefore, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses are employed to analyze the effects of model inputs on the model outputs. Reliability analysis is also performed to quantify the failure probability of a slope. It is found that slope angle, <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condition,</b> and shear strength properties are the major factors contributing to the uncertainty of determining the safety factor. Saturated hydraulic conductivity and air entry parameter (α) are the two main parameters affecting the flow behaviors and soil moisture condition as well as the pore-water pressure distribution...|$|E

Compared to continuous-event calibration, event-based calibration appears to perform better in simulating the overall shape of hydrograph, peak flow and time to peak.

40|$|Wick {{action is}} the {{transport}} of water through a concrete element from a face in contact with water to a drying face as occurs in basements, tunnels, slabs on grade and hollow offshore structures. Water transport through concrete due to wick action is many times greater due to pressure permeability under typical environmental conditions. Therefore wick action {{plays an important role}} in the watertightness and durability of concrete structures. Current models of wick action are based on an equilibrium developing between the rate of water entering concrete by sorptivity and leaving by water vapour diffusion where initial moisture content should not change the steady state rate, only the dominant factor in the early stages. Wick action tests were conducted on concrete specimens of varying <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condition,</b> thickness, orientation and composition over periods ranging up to 450 days. Some wick action tests were conducted at 50 % and 75 % relative humidity and using a penetrating solution of reduced surface tension. The rate of wick action was found to be inversely proportional to thickness regardless of the initial moisture content of the specimen. Initial saturation was found to significantly increase wick action and moisture flow in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and hydrophobic (HI) concretes drying at 75 % RH and HI concrete drying at 50 % RH. The data are consistent with the well documented hysteresis between sorption/desorption isotherms. Concretes containing silica fume (SF) and ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) did not exhibit such hysteresis. Reducing the surface tension of the pentrating solution profoundly reduced the sorptivity into dried specimens but not the depth of penetration or the steady state wick action rate. Direct measurements on osmotic flow through vacuum saturated specimens showed that osmotic effects had a limited effect on wick action at salt concentrations expected in most environmental conditions. The research demonstrates that desorptivity from the drying surface rather than sorptivity into the wetting surface is the dominant factor determining wick action through concrete. The ease with which desorptivity can be measured and the simple empirical model developed provides practicising engineers with a useful tool to estimate water transport due to wick action through concrete in partially immersed conditions...|$|E
40|$|Catchment and hillslope {{hydrology}} is a {{major research}} area in geoscience and the understanding of its underlying processes is still poor. Direct investigation of steep hillslopes via drilling is often infeasible. In this paper, we present the results of non-invasive time-lapse monitoring of a controlled infiltration test at a site in the Italian Central Alps. The hillslope considered is steep (30 - 35 degrees), covered with grass and a soil layer 1 - 1. 5 m thick above a variably fractured metamorphic bedrock. The key hydrologic question is whether rainfall infiltrates mainly into the underlying fractured bedrock, thus recharging a deeper hydraulic system, or flows in the soil layer as interflow towards the stream channel a few hundred metres downhill. In order {{to respond to this}} question, we applied 2200 mm of artificial rain on a 2 m x 2 m slope box over about 18 hours. We estimated the effective infiltration by subtracting the measured runoff (7 % of total). Due to the limited irrigation time and the climate conditions, the evapotranspiration was considered as negligible. The soil moisture variation and the underlying bedrock were monitored via a combination of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), TDR probes and tensiometers. A small-scale 3 D cross-hole ERT experiment was performed using 2 m deep boreholes purposely drilled and completed with electrodes in the irrigated plot. A larger scale (35 m long) 2 D surface ERT survey was also continuously acquired across the irrigated area. Monitoring continued up to 10 days after the experiment. As a result, we observed a very fast vertical infiltration through the soil cover, also favoured by preferential flow patterns, immediately followed by infiltration into the fractured bedrock. The surface layer showed a fast recovery of <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condition</b> nearly completed in the first 12 hours after the end of irrigation. The lateral transmission of infiltrating water and runoff were negligible as compared to the vertical infiltration. These experiment results confirm that the fractured bedrock has a key role in controlling the fast hydrological dynamics of the small catchment system under study. We concluded that deep water circulation is the key pathway to hillslope processes at this site...|$|E
40|$|Between 2004 {{and early}} 2006 a large-scale, instrumented, {{potentially}} contaminating trial waste rock dump was constructed and monitored at Cadia Hill Mine, in NSW, Australia. The trial waste rock dump was instrumented with lysimeters to measure rainfall infiltration and seepage through its base, and temperature sensors and gas sampling tubes to evaluate oxidation {{of the waste}} rock, together with three instrumented trial store and release covers on the surface. This thesis describes the construction and instrumentation of the trial waste rock dump and the monitoring results obtained to date, and applies unsaturated soil mechanics principles to understanding the early performance and predicting the future performance of the trial waste rock dump and trial store and release covers. For a given rainfall regime, the rate and quantity of rainfall infiltration into a waste rock dump of a given height, the wetting up of the dump over time, and the occurrence of base seepage will largely be dictated by the particle size distribution of the waste rock delivered to the dump, and the stratigraphy of the dump. The particle size distribution of the waste rock delivered to the dump {{will depend on the}} fragmentation of the rock due to blasting and the degree of weathering and hence breakdown on handling of the rock. A waste rock dump constructed by conventional loose end-dumping from haul trucks from a tip-head, as was the case for the trial waste rock dump, consists of a trafficked surface layer extending to a depth of approximately 1 m, underlain by discontinuous alternating coarse and fine-grained layers raveling at the angle of repose of the waste rock, with a base rubble zone of boulders which ravel to the toe of the dump on end-dumping. Trafficking of the surface of the dump by dozers and haul trucks leads to the breaking down, burial and side-casting of the rock to form a well-graded material typically finer than 100 mm in particle size, with a moderate to high water storage capacity. The underlying coarse-grained angle of repose layers serve as air pathways during dry conditions and preferred seepage pathways during and following periods of heavy rainfall resulting in base seepage. The fine-grained angle of repose layers have a moderate to high water storage capacity and largely retain water in storage rather than generating base seepage. The base rubble zone may contain boulders up to 1 m in size, depending on the fragmentation of the rock due to blasting and the degree of weathering and hence breakdown on handling of the rock. It serves largely as a pathway for air during dry conditions, while passing base seepage during and following periods of heavy rainfall. As the dump wets up, partially saturated “fingers” develop and extend into the dump. Partially saturated fine-grained layers, having a medium to high water storage capacity, largely retain their partial saturation, while coarse-grained layers drain resulting, in base seepage. Plugs of water temporarily stored within the dump drain down through the dump, so that the base seepage that emerges is “old” water, not the rainfall infiltration (“new” water) that generated it. The size of the rainfall event required to generate base seepage will decrease as the dump wets up and the partially saturated fingers extend closer {{to the base of the}} dump. The residence time of water within the dump that passes along preferred seepage pathways will be relatively short and will become shorter as the dump wets up, while the residence time of water stored within the fine-grained layers will be very long, and possibly indefinite in a dry climate. The ingress of air through the base rubble zone, up the coarse-grained angle of repose layers, through the sides of the dump, and to a lesser extent through the trafficked layer, by the processes of convection, advection and diffusion, respectively, results in the exposure of reactive waste rock to oxidation. The fine-grained reactive waste rock, presenting a far greater surface area per unit volume than the coarse-grained waste rock, and typically having a greater proportion of fresh surfaces, is by far the most reactive. The ingress of air into the fine-grained layers is largely by diffusion from the adjacent coarse-grained layers. The transport of oxidation products from the dump largely occurs during and following periods of heavy rainfall, when preferred pathway flow is mobilised and base seepage occurs. The main exposure to preferred pathway flow is along these pathways, where the surface area per unit volume and hence the proportion of oxidation products are low, with much of the oxidation products formed on the fine-grained particles retained within the dump along with stored water. Due to the discontinuous stratigraphy of a waste rock dump, the preferential pathways for flow are randomly located within the dump. In addition, preferential pathways evolve over time as the waste rock weathers, settles, and as fines are transported with the flow. The trafficked surface of the dump also evolves over time, becoming more heterogeneous as the surface settles differentially, generating internal rainfall runoff and the transport of fines, and the development of “sinkholes” for the preferred entry of ponded rainfall. The principle purpose of cover systems over waste rock dumps is to restrict net percolation into the dump, so that percolation through the reactive waste rock is minimal in the longer term. The approach used to design any cover system is dominated by climate. Semi-arid environments are conducive to store and release cover systems which take advantage of well-graded oxide materials to provide high storage capacities, low percolation and stability. Three trial store and release covers, each comprising a sealing layer overlain by a thick mounded rocky soil mulch layer, were installed at Cadia Hill Mine in 2005 - 2006 to assess their feasibility to limit net percolation under the climatic conditions encountered at Cadia. This research described in this thesis has demonstrated a number of key issues that should be considered in the management and closure of waste rock dumps: • the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>condition</b> of the end-dumped waste rock will effect its early ability to store incidental rainfall; • the available water storage capacity of the waste rock will affect the size of the triggering rainfall event and the base seepage response time, with the storage capacity being taken up as the dump wets up, reducing both the size of the triggering rainfall event and the response time; • iterative modelling and calculations using HYDRUS- 2 D suggest that the trial waste rock dump will take between 3 years and 6 years to become sufficiently saturated that it will pass any rainfall infiltration, depending on the extent to which the waste rock weathers over time; and • all three trial store and release covers have demonstrated good performance over the monitoring period, and this has been verified using HYDRUS- 2 D,, with any net percolation being the result of an initial high placement moisture content of the cover materials...|$|E
40|$|SummaryOne of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} that flood forecasters are faced with is evaluating how errors and uncertainties in forecasted precipitation propagate into streamflow forecast. These errors, must be combined {{with the effects of}} different <b>initial</b> soil <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions</b> that generally {{have a significant impact on}} the final results of a flood forecast. This is further complicated by the fact that a probabilistic approach is needed, especially when small and medium size basins are considered (the variability of the streamflow scenarios is in fact strongly influenced by the aforementioned factors). Moreover, the ensemble size is a degree of freedom when a precipitation downscaling algorithm is part of the forecast chain. In fact, a change of ensemble size could lead to different final results once the other inputs and parameters are fixed. In this work, a series of synthetic experiments have been designed and implemented to test an operational probabilistic flood forecast system in order to augment the knowledge of how streamflow forecasts can be affected by errors and uncertainties associated with the three aforementioned elements: forecasted rainfall, soil <b>moisture</b> <b>initial</b> <b>conditions,</b> and ensemble size...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the mechanical behaviour of structural concretes made with recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). Particularly, {{it is intended}} at investigating the influence of some critical parameters on the actual development of the cement hydration reactions and, then, on the time evolution of the concrete compressive strength. To this end, a wide research was carried out at the Laboratory of Materials testing and Structures (LMS) of the University of Salerno. Since {{the results of that}} comprehensive campaign are reported within a companion paper, only the key information about the composition of the ten tested mixtures and the relevant experimental observations in terms of both temperature monitoring and cubic compressive strength development in curing concrete samples are outlined herein. Then, the temperature measurements are considered to calibrate the parameters of a theoretical model already presented by the authors to simulate the cement hydration process in curing concrete: the fundamental assumptions of this model are briefly outlined herein. The numerical results obtained for such parameters, which characterise the ten concrete mixtures under consideration, are finally related to the corresponding mixture compositions. The resulting correlations unveil the fundamental influence of aggregate replacement ratio, nominal water/cement ratio and <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions</b> of coarse aggregates, on the mechanical properties of concrete made with recycled aggregates...|$|R

The soil moisture converges to a similar value {{towards the end of the}} simulation period in WRF-base and WRF-GLDAS run at Hengchun site; however, at Chiayi site, due to distinct soil moisture initialization between WRF-base and WRF-GLDAS, the difference of soil moisture is still apparent at Chiayi site even after the 6 -month simulation time. Orth and Seneviratne (2012) also indicated that the extremely dry or wet states of the soil tend to increase soil moisture memory.|$|R
40|$|The spatio-temporal {{variability}} of rainfall, especially at fine {{temporal and spatial}} scales can significantly affect flood generation, leading to a large variability in the flood response and uncertainty in its prediction. In this study we quantify the impact of rainfall spatial and temporal structure on the catchment hydrological response based on a numerical experiment. Rainfall ensembles generated using a state-of-the-art space–time stochastic model are used as input into a distributed process-based hydrological model. The sensitivity of the hydrograph to several structural characteristics of storm rainfall for three soil <b>moisture</b> <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> is numerically assessed at the basin outlet of an Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. The results highlight that the flood response is strongly affected by the temporal correlation of rainfall {{and to a lesser}} extent by its spatial variability. <b>Initial</b> soil <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions</b> play a paramount role in mediating the response. We identify the underlying mechanistic explanations in terms of runoff generation and connectivity of saturated areas that determine the sensitivity of flood response to the spatio-temporal {{variability of}} rainfall. We show that the element that mostly influences both the flood peak and the time of peak occurrence is the clustering of saturated areas in the catchment which leads to local enhanced runoff...|$|R
40|$|Flash floods are {{the most}} {{destructive}} natural hazards {{that occur in the}} Mediterranean region. Rainfall-runoff models can be very useful for flash flood forecasting and prediction. Event-based models are very popular for operational purposes, but {{there is a need to}} reduce the uncertainties related to the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions</b> estimation prior to a flood event. This paper aims to compare several soil moisture indicators: local Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements of soil moisture, modelled soil moisture through the Interaction-Sol-Biosphere-Atmosphere (ISBA) component of the SIM model (Meteo-France), antecedent precipitation and base flow. A modelling approach based on the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number method (SCS-CN) is used to simulate the flood events in a small headwater catchment in the Cevennes region (France). The model involves two parameters: one for the runoff production, S. and one for the routing component, K. The S parameter can be interpreted as the maximal water retention capacity, and acts as the initial condition of the model, depending on the antecedent <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions.</b> The model was calibrated from a 20 -flood sample, and led to a median Nash value of 0. 9. The local TDR measurements in the deepest layers of soil (80 - 140 cm) were found to be the best predictors for the S parameter. TDR measurements averaged over the whole soil profile, outputs of the SIM model, and the logarithm of base flow also proved to be good predictors, whereas antecedent precipitations were found to be less efficient. The good correlations observed between the TDR predictors and the S calibrated values indicate that monitoring soil moisture could help setting the initial conditions for simplified event-based models in small basins...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} soil {{moisture}} on convective precipitation, convective indices, surface energy balance components, and near-surface meteorological variables is analysed for seven intensive observation periods of the Convective and Orographically induced Precipitation Study (COPS) conducted in summer 2007 using a non-hydrostatic limited-area atmospheric prediction model. The control runs are compared to sensitivity experiments under dry (- 25 %) and wet (+ 25 %) <b>initial</b> soil <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the wet experiment, surface fluxes produce moister and cooler boundary layers with increased equivalent potential temperatures. Furthermore, the lifting condensation {{level and the}} level of free convection are lowered for all analysed regions, even under different synoptic controls. The comparison of boundary-layer and mid-tropospheric forcing regimes reveal that the impact of soil moisture on the atmosphere is not systematically higher for boundary-layer forcing. Whereas the Bowen ratio exhibits a clear dependence on soil <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions,</b> the impact on precipitation is complex and strongly depends on convective inhibition. A considerable, but non-systematic dependence of convective precipitation on soil moisture exists in the analysed complex orography.

40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} {{of differential}} equations describe physical problems and provide general insight of the studied natural mechanisms. Although {{they may be}} not suitable to solve complex hydrological problems, they are fast and useful to test numerical procedures. The solutions proposed in this work are obtained for arbitrary flux boundary conditions and arbitrary soil <b>moisture</b> <b>initial</b> <b>conditions.</b> This permits to use standard meteorological data: precipitation data (incoming flux) and Bowen ratio data (outgoing flux), which are very common, while soil volumetric water content measurements are usually not available exactly at the soil-atmosphere interface. A first class of solutions is obtained with a uniform initial condition for the soil moisture and a time dependent surface flux, which well represents experimental precipitation/ evaporation cases. A solution with a more general boundary condition is derived using a sum of simple solutions obtained for constant boundary conditions. Finally the same technique {{is applied to the}} soil <b>moisture</b> <b>initial</b> <b>condition</b> too. The vertical profiles of the soil water content computed by this simple sum of solutions are compared with the results of the aforementioned analytical solutions...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{construction}} sector is among the most energy- and resource-intensive industrial activities. Therefore, the European Union has recently adopted a policy intended at promoting the use of recycled aggregates for concrete production (up to 70 % for 2020), with the twofold aim of reducing the need for natural sources in the construction sector and minimising the environmental impact of the concrete industry. This research is intended at providing a contribution for better understanding and carefully predicting the effect of Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCAs) on the resulting mechanical properties of structural concrete. First of all, it reports the results of a wide experimental campaign carried out at the Laboratory for testing Materials and Structures (LMS), University of Salerno, Italy. Several concrete mixtures were prepared and sampled by considering the variation of some relevant parameters and aspects, such as the water-to-cement ratio, the aggregates replacement ratio and the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions</b> of the coarse aggregates. The time evolution of both the cubic compressive strength and the temperature developed by the hydration reaction were monitored during the hardening stage. Secondly, a theoretical model was employed for converting the measured temperatures into the corresponding values of degree of hydration supposed to be achieved into the concrete samples tested in compression. Finally, based on the resulting correlation between the compressive strength and the degree of hydration, a formulation is proposed for the mix-design of concrete made out with recycled aggregates. The proposed formulation represents a generalisation of the well-known Abram’s law to the case of Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) ...|$|R
40|$|Since Hewlett and Hibbert’s {{publication}} {{on small}} watershed hydrology in 1967, {{there has been}} a slow recognition that saturated excess runoff is the main runoff mechanisms in vegetated watersheds. While most pedo-transfer functions for predicting runoff are based on infiltration excess runoff, few are based on saturation excess runoff. We, therefore, developed a simple pedo-transfer function. The function was tested in eight watersheds distributed over three continents that differ in climate, size, topographic relief and land use. Six watersheds were used to develop the pedo-transfer function. The watershed response to rainfall was very similar. In each catchment, a threshold amount of rainfall needed to be exceeded before direct runoff (consisting of both surface runoff and interflow) would occur. After the threshold was exceeded, direct storm runoff was linearly related to rainfall depth indicating that a nearly constant proportion of the watershed was the source area for direct runoff. The source areas were small for watersheds with deep soils. Threshold was strongly dependent on the <b>initial</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the remaining two watersheds, we predicted the water level each of the terminal lakes for a 30 year period using the saturation excess pedo-transfer function where the rainfall threshold was computed using the Thornthwaite-Mather procedure and the baseflow from remaining watershed employing a linear reservoir model. Taking the simplicity of the prediction technique with only four calibrated parameters into account, the lake levels were predicted well including the rise in the lake level {{in the last ten years}} when the climate became wetter...|$|R
