40|$|Before human {{interference}} in the Delta of the South-West Netherlands, the hydro-ecological relations {{in the waters of}} this Delta were taken very much for granted. As a result of the man-made changes, the natural relations disappeared. The construction of the Delta Works completely altered the face of the Delta. This was not the first occasion on which the relations between the waters of the Delta had been affected. Take for example the construction of the Sloe Dam and Kreekrak Dam {{in the latter half of}} the 19 th century, which resulted in the loss of the connection between the <b>Eastern</b> aad Western <b>Scheldt.</b> Nevertheless, the Delta in its present form is largely the brainchild of hydraulic engineers of the latter half of the present century. The original Delta Project treated the Delta as a single entity, but purely from the point of view of safety and water control. At that time the integral approach of ecological interests had yet to be developed. Although ecological considerations have gained in importance over the years, the present compartmentalization of the Delta is still to a great extent the product of the original Delta Project. The completion of the water management infrastructure of the Delta marks, for the time being at least, the end of an era of major hydraulic projects in the Delta. But while these works were being carried out, a new era had already begun; one which centred on careful supervision and responsible management of the newly-created systems. This approach will put to use what has been learned about the behaviour of compartmentalized systems. If we respond to changes by making informed use of the scope for control and regulation presented by the Delta Works, we can develop these new systems to their full potential...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> (Oosterschelde) is {{a former}} estuary in the {{province}} of Zeeland, Netherlands, between Schouwen-Duiveland and Tholen on the north and Noord-Beveland and Zuid-Beveland on the south. It is also the largest national park in the Netherlands, founded in 2002.|$|E
50|$|Yerseke is {{a village}} {{situated}} on the southern shore of the Oosterschelde (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt)</b> estuary in the Dutch province of Zeeland. A separate municipality until 1970, it today forms part of the municipality of Reimerswaal. As of 2010 Yerseke had a recorded population of 6.695 inhabitants divided over 2.680 households.|$|E
50|$|Mussels {{have always}} been a staple along the coast, but only {{at the end of the}} 19th century were there concerted efforts at standardising production. Beginning {{approximately}} after the war, mussels have slowly gained ever greater economic significance and eclipsed the oyster in importance. This is manifest by the village hosting the only mussel auction in the world. In the past, mussels were caught and harvested with small sailing sloops, the so-called hoogaars and hengst. Today, highly advanced and much larger ships are employed, able to not only manage the harvest on the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> but sail longer distances, including to the Wadden Sea where mussels have been seeded and harvested since about 1950 when a parasite threatened the harvest in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> The mussels are grown and harvested entirely at sea in a mostly natural process.|$|E
50|$|A museum {{close to}} the main church details the town’s history, the fishing {{industry}} and the natural environment of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> Several seafood restaurants in the village showcase the fishing industry, including the recently closed Nolet het Reymerswale that for years boasted a Michelin star (the adjacent restaurant Nolet’s Vistro remains open and shares the same kitchen).|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{remained}} the primary {{activity of the}} town until the 16th century, when the Saint Felix flood inundated large parts of land around the now lost trading city of Reimerswaal to the east. As a result, Yerseke turned from a landlocked village into one located along {{the shores of the}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> which would shape much of its future.|$|E
50|$|Annually, around 50,000 people {{visit the}} event. They {{come from the}} close region, but also from Belgium, Germany and France. Mosseldag is known for eating mussels, a local delicacy, and other seafood. You can go freely on a trip over the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> with a mussel fishing boat (or watch the fleet go by), walk along the fair and watch the tattoo and {{fireworks}} in the evening.|$|E
50|$|The {{locality}} is {{well known}} in the region and farther afield, especially in Belgium, for its aquaculture and fishing industry: particularly for the cultivation from the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> of mussels, oysters, periwinkles, and lobster. Due to the economic success and wealth created by the oyster and mussel industries, Yerseke has received the nickname “Klondike of Zeeland”, while mussels are sometimes referred to as “black gold” (‘’Zwart Goud’’).|$|E
5000|$|The Oosterscheldekering [...] (English: <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> {{storm surge}} barrier), between the islands Schouwen-Duiveland and Noord-Beveland, {{is the largest}} of the 13 ambitious Delta Works series of dams and storm surge barriers, {{designed}} to protect the Netherlands from flooding from the North Sea. The construction of the Delta Works was in response to the widespread damage and loss of life due to the North Sea Flood of 1953.|$|E
50|$|After the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, {{it was decided}} to close off the Oosterschelde by means of a dam and barrier. The Oosterscheldekering (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> Storm Surge Barrier), between Schouwen-Duiveland and Noord-Beveland, is the largest of 13 ambitious Delta Works {{designed}} to protect {{a large part of the}} Netherlands from flooding. A four-kilometre section has huge sluice gates, which are normally open but can be closed in adverse weather.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{there were}} two {{branches}} from that point: the Oosterschelde (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt)</b> and the Westerschelde (Western Scheldt) but in the 19th century the river was cut off from its eastern (actually: northern) branch by a dyke that connects Zuid-Beveland with the mainland (North Brabant). Today the river therefore continues into the Westerschelde estuary only, passing Terneuzen to reach the North Sea between Breskens in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and Vlissingen (Flushing) on Walcheren.|$|E
50|$|During most of {{this period}} {{the economy of the}} Netherlands slowed or contracted, with the {{exception}} of the agricultural sector. However, the region benefitted from advances in transportation, connected in 1868 to Roosendaal by railroad with the inauguration of the Zeeland Line (la Zeeuwse Lijn: la «Ligne zélandaise»). In 1850 work began on the Zuid-Beveland Canal which linked the Western Scheldt and the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> across a narrow neck of land in the east of the province.|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands, {{the water}} reached {{the highest level}} since the North Sea flood of 1953 at 3.99m above normal sea level. In 1953, the water rose to 4.55m {{on the night of}} 1 February, and dykes broke in at least 90 places {{resulting}} in the worst natural disaster in the Netherlands in the 1900s. The <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> storm surge barrier closed all its 62 locks on Thursday night and several areas around Rotterdam experienced some flooding. Minor flooding was also reported in Dordrecht and Vlaardingen.|$|E
5000|$|The type {{locality}} {{for this}} species {{is on the}} Dutch coast. A specimen from near Goes, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> Zeeland was designated as a neotype in a recent review of the genus Doto. It has been reported elsewhere in the North Atlantic Ocean (European waters, Canada, Gulf of Maine) and the Mediterranean Sea (Greece) but many records {{are likely to be}} of sibling species. It was erroneously reported from around the South African coast where it is found from the Atlantic coast to Knysna [...] and this species has been described as Doto africoronata.|$|E

50|$|Starting {{approximately}} in 1870, {{the village}} began large-scale cultivation of oysters, partly {{in response to}} high French demand. For this purpose, parcels within the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> were leased out by the government for farming, while pits outside the dikes employing roof tiles were constructed for cultivation of oyster larvae. These pits were eventually abandoned in the 20th century, replaced by pits built within the dikes close to the harbour, where roof tiles {{have given way to}} modern racks. The pits also serve to flush oysters harvested from the estuaries, and are surrounded by old, characteristic warehouses.|$|E
50|$|The {{storm surge}} barrier closes {{only when the}} sea-level is {{expected}} to rise 3 metres above mean sea level. Under normal conditions, the estuary's mouth is open, and salt water flows in and out with the tide. As a result of the change, the weak dikes along the Oosterschelde needed to be strengthened. Over 200 km of the dike needed new revetments. The connections between the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> and the neighboring Haringvliet had to be dammed to limit the effect of the salt water. Extra dams and locks were needed at the east part of the Oosterschelde to create a shipping route between the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp.|$|E
50|$|Nehalennia is {{a goddess}} {{of the ancient}} {{religion}} known around the province of Zeeland. Her worship dates {{back at least to}} the 2nd century BC, and flourished in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. She was possibly a regional goddess, either Celtic or pre-Germanic - sources differ on the culture that first worshipped her. During the Roman Era, her main function appeared to be the protection of travelers, especially seagoing travelers crossing the North Sea. Most of what is known about her comes from the remains of over 160 carved stone offerings (votives) which have been dredged up from the Ooster Schelde (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt)</b> since 1970. Two more Nehalennia offering stones have also been found in Cologne, Germany.|$|E
50|$|While {{the oyster}} {{industry}} created wealth, it also suffered many setbacks and upheavals, {{as well as}} creating social inequalities. In 1885, some oyster farmers sought greater opportunities by immigrating to West Sayville, New York on Long Island, where wild oysters were once abundant. During the 20th century, further setbacks {{in the form of}} harsh winters, especially in 1963, and the threatened closing of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> by a dam almost led to the collapse of the oyster industry. After moderate recovery, the bacterium Bonamia ostreae infected the prevalent flat oysters, again decimating the industry in 1980. This led to the introduction of the Pacific Oyster, now the most cultivated oyster species, which some consider an invasive species.|$|E

50|$|A European {{windstorm}} crosses over Scotland and plunges {{into the}} mouth of the North Sea, to the west of Norway, where its strong winds push large bodies of water Southeast, towards coastal regions in England and the Netherlands. The tidal surge puts both nations on red alert as the English evacuate some coastal villages and close the Thames Barrier. The Dutch close the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> storm surge barrier and the enormous Maeslant barrier in order to prevent massive flooding as the storm mimics the situation that caused the devastating North Sea flood of 1953. For the first time since 1976, the entire Dutch coastline is put on alert and is closely monitored by officials. The tidal surge turned out to be too weak to cause any significant damage to the strong Dutch coastal defenses. In England, only minor flooding occurred.|$|E
5000|$|The {{project could}} not be kept a secret however and a Dutch task force of fifty ships, also largely {{consisting}} of small rivercraft but containing some larger flyboats, under Zealandic Vice-Admiral Marinus Hollare, intercepted the fleet in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> Seeing their intended route blocked, the Spanish first tried to capture the more southern island of Tholen instead, to show something for their efforts, but this attempt was thwarted by a regiment of two thousand English and Scots mercenaries {{under the command of}} Colonel Thomas Morgan from the continental fortress of Steenbergen who marched at low tide through the shallow sea to the island, arriving just in time to deter a landing. Van Nassau in his desperation then took the bold decision to attempt to sneak past the Dutch fleet during the night and so achieve the original goal after all.|$|E
50|$|The main natural {{feature of}} the town is the Moer (moor) {{partially}} surrounding the town, extending westwards along the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> shoreline, and southeast to the hamlet of Vlake along the canal. This natural area is a former salt-water tidal marsh, separated by dikes from the sea around 1200 AD by monks {{for the purposes of}} farming and peat extraction, which boasted a high salt content (a lucrative commodity in the Middle Ages). Extraction has since formed the characteristic landscape today: rich, low-lying meadows atop a thick peat layer are interspersed by sandy creek ridges along which roads and paths have developed over the centuries. Due to large variation in soils and sand, a great variety of fauna has developed and the area has become a protected bird sanctuary. A trail guides walkers through the moor.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 March 1814 Butcher in Antelope {{joined the}} fleet of Admiral William Young off {{the mouth of}} the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> in the Netherlands. Antelope was sent with two other ships to {{reinforce}} the squadron of frigates in the Western Scheldt, but owing to the illness of one pilot and the desertion of the other, Antelope ran aground off Flushing. For 48 hours she lay exposed to continuous barrage of shells from enemy batteries on shore, but was (to the astonishment of the whole fleet) eventually able to free herself and escape. Subsequently, by order from Lord Melville, Captain Butcher attended a grand levée at Portsmouth, and was presented to the Prince Regent by Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood as [...] "the officer who had so highly distinguished himself in the Scheldt." [...] After a voyage to Quebec, Butcher paid off the Antelope on 22 December 1815.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Delta Works {{to prevent}} future {{flooding}} after the 1953 flooding, the originally proposed closed earthen dam of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> was altered into an open storm surge barrier. This engineering work served to (partially) protect {{the ecology of the}} estuary and with it the vital fishing industry of the town that depends on regular tidal movements. Resistance from Yerseke and her fisherman, as well as environmentalists, prevented the complete closure of the Eastern Scheldt.During the third Saturday of August every year, the village celebrates the official start of the mussel harvest with the annual Mosseldag, although these days the season tends to begin earlier. The event attracts approximately 50,000 visitors who come to eat mussels, take free cruises on mussel ships, and enjoy flee markets, beer tents, parades and marching bands, as well as traditional regional activities including regional dress. The Friday evening before the event, a dance festival is organised. Fireworks above the harbour and a rock concert are held on Saturday night to officially close the celebration.|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{protection}} measures are planned and executed worldwide {{to combat the}} effects of global warming and climate change, in particular the acceleration of sea level rise, higher storm surge flooding and extensive coastal inundation. The {{extent to which these}} defensive measures may impact coastal and estuarine ecosystems is still poorly understood. Since the building of a storm surge barrier, movement of harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena {{in and out of the}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> tidal bay (SW-Netherlands) may be limited. To measure residency, porpoises stranded along the Dutch North Sea coast between 2006 and 2008 were sampled for muscle (n = 102) and bone tissue (n = 118), of which 9 muscle (8. 8 %) and 12 bone samples (10. 2 %) were collected from animals stranded within the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> Stable carbon (d 13 C) was analysed to get insight into the habitat use and residency of porpoises in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> Our data showed significantly higher d 13 C values in the muscle of porpoises stranded within the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> (µ = - 17. 7 ‰, SD = 0. 4 ‰) compared to animals stranded along the Dutch coast (µ = - 18. 3 ‰, SD = 0. 5 ‰). This suggests that most porpoises stranded in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> foraged there for a longer period. The distinct d 13 C signature of animals from the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> was not observed in bone tissue, suggesting a relatively recent shift in habitat use rather than life-long residency of porpoises within the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> The high number of strandings within the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> suggests a higher mortality rate compared to the Dutch coastal zone. Our study indicates that along with other changes in the physical environment, the storm surge barrier may play an important role in determining the residency of porpoises in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> and that the area might act as an ecological trap for porpoises entering it...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{completion}} of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> project in 1987 there has been a decrease of tidal volume, range and current in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> estuary. This has led to morphologic changes in the basin. The channels are in demand of sediment and as the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> barrier itself blocks most of the sediment transport from the North Sea to the basin, this sediment comes from the intertidal areas inside the basin. As a result, the intertidal areas inside the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> basin are eroding with have consequences for ecology, safety, shipping, recreation and fishery. One of the larger shoals in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> is the Galgeplaat. The Galgeplaat is eroding at a high rate. So far the governing processes behind channel-shoal interactions for accretion or erosion of intertidal areas such as the Galgeplaat are not exactly known.

40|$|In the {{south-western}} {{part of the}} Netherlands, {{the system}} of estuaries, tidal basins and islands called the Delta, has been shaped and studied by humans for centuries. By far the largest event that determined its current configuration was the storm surge that occurred in 1953. This giant flooding gave rise {{to one of the}} largest engineering programs in the world: the Delta Plan. The aim of this plan was to ensure safety against flooding, {{while at the same time}} allow for other utilisations of the Delta. This system of dams, barriers and sluices has had, and is still having a strong effect on the morphology of the Delta coast and basins, especially the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> tidal basin. The objective of this research is to gain understanding of the mechanisms that govern the exchange of sediment between the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> basin and its ebb-tidal delta, and the effects of human interventions on these mechanisms. In order to gain better understanding of the processes determining the morphology of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> inlet, analysis of bathymetric and hydraulic data is combined with process-based numerical modelling. From this study on the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> and its surroundings, it has become clear that the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> is a basin that has been shaped strongly by a multitude of human interventions throughout the past few centuries.

40|$|The worst {{flood of}} the 20 th century {{happened}} at the night of January 31, 1953. After this disastrous flood the Dutch government came up with The Deltaworks, a large scale plan to protect the hinterland against future threats of high water. As part of the Deltaworks the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> area was compartmentalized with the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> storm surge barrier as imposing capstone of the compartmentalization. The barrier has greatly (and is still) contributed {{to the safety of}} the Netherlands, but it has also had a large impact on the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> area. The <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> area is facing future (unanticipated) challenges like the sea level rise, the sand demand of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> the scour holes near the shores of Schouwen-Duiveland and new safety standard for flood defenses. These challenges can be influenced by the barrier. Analyses of the challenges revealed that adjustments to the storm surge barrier, which are respond to the sand demand, are the most promising to effectuate. As a consequence of the compartmentalization of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> the flow velocity in the tidal basin decreased with approximately 50 %. As a result, the net buildup of tidal flats stopped while the waves remained stable or even increased in height. The waves crumble the edges of the tidal flats causing the tidal flats to decrease in height. This phenomenon is called the ’sand demand’ of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> To outweigh the Sand demand some adjustments to the moveable part of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> storm surge barrier are examined. A lowered sill beam alternative is developed to influence the tide during normal tidal conditions. In this alternative the effective cross sectional area of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> storm surge barrier will increase with approximately 6, 200 m^ 2 (from 17, 900 to 24, 100 m^ 2). The measures in this alternative include the following adjustments: 1.) Lowering of 50 sill beams, 2.) Extension of 50 gates, 3.) Adjusting the sill construction. By enlarging the cross sectional area of the barrier the tidal volume through the barrier and the tidal flow velocity in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> enlarges. The governing force in shoal build up is the tidal flow velocity, therefore the enlargement of the tidal velocity in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> should result in an improvement of the sand demand problem. Instead of removing the whole sill beam it is chosen to lower the sill beams. From a safety point of view it is chosen to not lower the outer sill beams to reduce the possible negative effects on the shores of Schouwen and Noord-Beveland. The lowered sill beam alternative must outweigh the current situation. The current situation holds the maintaining of the current barrier and planned investment in preservation of the tidal flat by sand suppletion. The estimated cost for maintaining the current barrier in its original state is approximately 650 million euro (within a range of +/- 20 %). The further research into the alternative has shown that the cost of adjusting the sill beam of the barrier cost more than maintaining the barrier in its current state. Because of the higher costs and the uncertainty in the actual effect of the measures, it seems more effective and safer to maintain the barrier in its current state. In this regard a critical note should be placed at designing with a lifetime of 200 years. Because of the robustness of the design {{it is almost impossible to}} make, economically attractive, modifications to improve the functionality of the barrier. If designing with a lifetime of 200 year is still desirable, the structure should be designed in such a way that it is adaptive to future changes.

40|$|The {{diagenesis}} in fine-grained sediments from a 300 to 400 -years-old Dunkirk deposit, exposed on the intertidal flat, was {{studied at}} a site in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> A new in situ pore water sampling technique that allowed repeated sampling {{at exactly the same}} place was used to monitor the seasonal fluctuations in interstitial water composition. The pore-water sampler proved to be useful for monitoring seasonal variations in the pore-water composition, because spatial variability as a disturbing factor could be ruled out. The use of this sampler is advised for unconsolidated sediments in salt marshes, intertidal flats and other shallow (< 0. 5 m) water bodies. Subrecent Dunkirk deposits, exposed on intertidal flats in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> contain predominantly non-metabolizable organic carbon. Consequently, rates of organic carbon mineralization and nutrient regeneration in these sediments are low underneath the superficial 0 to 2 cm of sediment in which metabolizable organic matter may temporarily accumulate. The contribution of these sediments to the carbon and nutrient dynamics in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> is negligible, because of its restricted surface area and its refractory organic matter. The organic carbon from these types of sediments, after erosion, will behave as inert stuffing in the recent fine-grained deposits, accumulating elsewhere in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> {{tidal basin}} and its ebb tidal delta have changed {{drastically}} {{in the recent}} centuries {{under the influence of}} natural processes and human interventions. A Storm Surge Barrier, one of constructions within framework of Delta Project in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> is considered as the largest impact to changes in hydrodynamics and morphology of the ebb tidal delta. The barrier was built in 1987 to maintain the tide and to protect the area from flooding. The barrier closes under severe storm surge conditions and remains open during normal conditions to preserve the tide-dominated character of the ecosystem. However, this storm surge barrier caused a reduction of tidal volume and tidal current in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> Since 1987, there has been a remarkable reduction of the tidal prism by 30 %, of the average tidal range by 12 % and of the average tidal current velocities by 33 %. As a result, sediment export from the basin towards its ebb tidal delta has ceased. This led and still to changes in morphology of the ebb tidal delta. In order to adapt to changes in tidal volume, the tidal channels become sinks of sediment and this sediment has been and still is taken from the tidal shoals nearby. Sediment volume of these shoals therefore has decreased drastically. The deposition in channels and erosion on the shoals caused a number of negative effects to ecology, safety, navigation, recreations and fishery in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> To analyse the morphological developments of the ebb tidal delta before, during and after the implementation of the Storm Surge Barrier in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> bathymetry maps which present the changes in deposition and erosion parts in the ebb tidal delta in every four years (from 1960 to 2004) were used. In summary, the morphology of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> ebb tidal delta experienced enormous changes due to the Delta Project. These changes comprise shoaling and reorientation of channels- from updrift to downdrift (northward) migration of channels, landward migration of shoals, development and diminishing of ebb and flood chutes and development of scour holes near the entrance of the storm surge barrier. As a result, it would take a long time (centuries) to establish a new dynamic equilibrium between hydraulic conditions and geomorphology in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Scheldt</b> inlet.
