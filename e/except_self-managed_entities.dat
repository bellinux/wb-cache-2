40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{new service}} {{oriented}} networking paradigm is presented, where network nodes (peers) are self-organized into individual service entities. The key idea {{relies on the}} overlay approach, where there exists a virtual service plane, fragmented into self-organized and <b>self-managed</b> <b>entities</b> called islands of service transparency. The islands are formed in an upstream, ad-hoc mode from the non-networking resources (i. e VoD, grid server, etc) towards all ingress routers of the network, using link state advertisements and multi-cost path selection algorithms (i. e residual bandwidth, server capacity, storage, etc). Organization and re-organization of nodes around non-network resources is transparent to end-users, and thus any request within a specific service island is transparently routed to the island’s resource for execution. A service proxy is commissioned to resolve service addresses and service attributes to QoS metrics. In this paper, we present the main notations and metrics of the proposed architecture as well as node behavior and potential GMPLS extensions for implementation issues. Index Terms — service transparency, optical transparen...|$|R
40|$|Autonomicity, {{realized}} through {{control loop}} structures operating within network devices {{and the network}} as a whole, is an enabler for advanced and enriched self-manageability of communication systems. Unfortunately, very little practical knowledge is currently available that would guide a network engineer through realizing this ambitious vision. In this survey, we intend to fill this gap by providing a practical guideline for building truly autonomic systems. Our main motivation is the recognition {{that it is not}} necessary to rebuild the whole network infrastructure out of piecemeal-designed, autonomic-aware protocol components. Instead, the framework of Autonomic Networking is broad enough to accommodate many of, if not all, existing off-the-shelf network technologies. This is because a sophisticated network protocol machinery is usually a quite capable <b>self-managing</b> <b>entity</b> in itself, complete with all the basic components of an autonomic networking element, like embedded control loops, decision-making modules, distributed knowledge repositories, etc. What remained to be done to achieve the desired autonomic behavior is to open up of some of these intrinsic control loops and incorporate them into external decision making logics. We demonstrate this idea on the example of building advanced self-adaptive routing mechanisms on top of OSPF. First, we present a generic framework for autonomic networks, designed to integrate well-tested, legacy network technology and modern, inherently autonomic-aware functionality into a single feature-rich self-managing infrastructure. Then, we cast an illustrious legacy network technology, the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, in this framework, we identify the control loops intrinsic to it, and we describe the way these can be incorporated into higher level control loops. Finally, we demonstrate this design process through two illustrative case studies, namely, adding risk-awareness and autonomic routing resilience to the OSPF routing protocol...|$|R
40|$|Similar to the Autonomous Computing initiative, {{that has}} mainly been {{advancing}} techniques for self-optimisation focussing on computing systems and infrastructures, Organic Computing (OC) has been driving {{the development of}} system design concepts and algorithms for self-adaptive systems at large. Examples of application domains include, for instance, traffic management and control, cloud services, communication protocols, and robotic systems. Such an OC system typically consists of a potentially large set of autonomous and <b>self-managed</b> <b>entities,</b> where each entity acts with a local decision horizon. By means of cooperation of the individual entities, the behaviour of the entire ensemble system is derived. In this article, we present our work on how autonomous, adaptive robot ensembles can benefit from OC technology. Our elaborations are aligned with the different layers of an observer/controller framework which provides {{the foundation for the}} individuals' adaptivity at system design-level. Relying on an extended Learning Classifier System (XCS) in combination with adequate simulation techniques, this basic system design empowers robot individuals to improve their individual and collaborative performances, e. g. by means of adapting to changing goals and conditions. Not only for the sake of generalisability, but also because of its enormous transformative potential, we stage our research in the domain of robot ensembles that are typically comprised of several quad-rotors and that organise themselves to fulfil spatial tasks such as maintenance of building facades or the collaborative search for mobile targets. Our elaborations detail the architectural concept, provide examples of individual self-optimisation {{as well as of the}} optimisation of collaborative efforts, and we show how the user can control the ensembles at multiple levels of abstraction. We conclude with a summary of our approach and an outlook on possible future steps...|$|R
40|$|Background: As {{the amount}} of {{information}} in electronic health care systems increases, data operations get more complicated and time-consuming. Intensive Care platforms require a timely processing of data retrievals to guarantee the continuous display of recent data of patients. Physicians and nurses rely on this data for their decision making. Manual optimization of query executions has become difficult to handle due to the increased amount of queries across multiple sources. Hence, a more automated management is necessary to increase the performance of database queries. The autonomic computing paradigm promises an approach in which the system adapts itself and acts as <b>self-managing</b> <b>entity,</b> thereby limiting human interventions and taking actions. Despite the usage of autonomic control loops in network and software systems, this approach has not been applied so far for health information systems. Methods: We extend the COSARA architecture, an infection surveillance and antibiotic management service platform for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), with self-managed components to increase the performance of data retrievals. We used real-life ICU COSARA queries to analyse slow performance and measure the impact of optimizations. Each day more than 2 million COSARA queries are executed. Three control loops, which monitor the executions and take action, have been proposed: reactive, deliberative and reflective control loops. We focus on improvements of the execution time of microbiology queries directly related to the visual displays of patients' data on the bedside screens. Results: The results show that autonomic control loops are beneficial for the optimizations in the data executions in the ICU. The application of reactive control loop results in a reduction of 8. 61 % of the average execution time of microbiology results. The combined application of the reactive and deliberative control loop results in an average query time reduction of 10. 92 % and the combination of reactive, deliberative and reflective control loops provides a reduction of 13. 04 %. Conclusions: We found that by controlled reduction of queries' executions the performance for the end-user can be improved. The implementation of autonomic control loops in an existing health platform, COSARA, has a positive effect on the timely data visualization for the physician and nurse...|$|R
40|$|First made {{available}} online in May 2015. It {{has long been}} established that pay formulas containing an element of profit-sharing have non-inflationary employment promotion properties (Vanek, 1965), <b>except</b> in <b>self-managed</b> enterprises (e. g. Vanek, 1970). In recent literature economy-wide profit-sharing combined with workers' strict exclusion from employment decisions is being promoted as a scheme guaranteeing the achievement of a blissful state of non-inflationary excess demand for labour, absorbing {{all or part of}} possible deflationary shocks (Weitzman, 1983, 1984, 1985 a, 1985 b, 1986). Weitzman's proposal is reminiscent of the set-up in Catch- 22, where a wheeler-dealer retrades and speculates with army supplies originally meant for the soldiers, who are supposed instead to benefit from their share in the profit of his operations; everybody has a share, nobody has a say, and the main beneficiary of the scheme is its proposer. The {{purpose of this paper is}} that of separating the beneficial effects of profit-sharing which are neither new nor controversial from the new propositions put forward by Weitzman which I shall argue to be overclaims...|$|R
40|$|Every form {{of social}} {{organisation}} makes efforts to insure its identity. In other words, the supposition, which {{must be carried out}} in order to reproduce a certain way of production in the mode of life, consists in the fact that individuals and social groups accept institutionalized normative system as their own value orientation, to be able to connect their own identity with it. However, the system of socio-cultural values regularly comes into opposition with the social reality, and it makes efforts to solve, ideally, the way of existence of an individual as the member of a group, and the group (class) as a part of society. Its final activity and motor power, which moves people to carry out such a project by means of social action, seems to be hidden in it. The final consequence of a certain contrast of the two or more systems of value consciousness is the open conflict between the social groups. That particularly becomes evident when class in the process of totalization, besides its special interests, manages to speak »in the name of the right of all people«, and equalizes itself with value consciousness of the whole society. That is why Marx, in his programme for the theory of classes, accentuates the social (class) consciousness. In the contemporary, that is, normal conditions, the working class and other social groups, have been exposed to the ideals of the producer-consumer civilization in the process of socialization. The problem, concerning formation of the revolutionary socialistic system of socio-cultural values in the West and in the East, is again rather emphasized. In other words, if we consider values as the symbols of interpretation, choice and realization of social roles and the instruments of social control and pressure, we cannot neglect the ruling culture of the capitalist and state socialist society. Values, that those organist social conceptions (economic growth with the mythology of social ascent-promotion and welfare, {{as well as with the}} utilitarian and functionally limited relation between people and groups) originate from, serve to preserve the existing social system. This is particularly important from the viewpoint of socialism, regarded as the project that can be realized only by means of autonomous creativity of the working class and its allies. System of socio-cultural values is particularly important for the »phase« of social revolution after the take over of power, because social processes gradually and unperceiveably change social reality, and the way of people’s participation depends upon whether they share the same system of values with social organisation or they have critical attitude towards normative social consciousness, until it becomes abolished. The author has tried to research the problem taking Yugoslavia as en example The development of industrial society, after the liberation, progressed on the foundations of the capital formation economy, and owing to the process of economization of consciousness, what caused interruption of natural evolution in the system of socio-cultural values, after defining revolutionary movement through nation. Disociability (instead of differentiation) of group-class symbols into the universal and individual ones took place, as well the changes in experiences of temporal social dimension, what caused the decline of energetic potential of group symbols (together with the decline of motivation). A certain disparity between the ideals and social reality has always been present though, but owing to that process, the gap between the inferiority of values and reality, has passed that critical limit up to which the disparity is stimulating. The immediate socio-psychological consequence may be a feeling of insecurity, even frustration, because of the existential thread, with the new value orientation (usually towards past). We find a proof of such a movement in the events of the 70 s. In order to find the consequences of social status upon value orientation, the author has occupied himself with some fundamental characteristics of social processes. He showed the influence of the pre-industrial ethos of peasantry upon value orientation of principal social participators in the development of the self-managing socialism. In his opinion,, dominating social processes caused destructuralization and restructuralization of hierarchy, and the content of the system of socio-cultural values in practical, social and political dimensions of the traditional and revolutionary value orientation. The roots of the more prevailing orientations for the group-contracting and so called dirigistic model of management can be seen in the persistence of a certain wage relation, and in the reproduction of the hierarchic structure of power, as well as in the comodity-monetary market relation. Concentration of social power, and its alienation from a producer interrupted, to a grat extent, a possibility for the realization of values of the self-managing social integration, therefore, delegate system and the constitution of basic organizations of associated labour, represent new institutionalized attempt in the realization of self-management. Essential characteristic in the way of life of production strata is still their occupation with the instrumental industrial production, rationally-functional relation, routine labour and monetarization of social consciousness, in spite of the good re suits, achieved in overcoming the situation of alienation by means of the development of self-management on horizontal social level. Functional differentiation causes generalization in the principles of effectiveness and rationality applied on the whole social and cultural life. Alienation and depersonalization are deepened by the products of mass culture in mass-media. Social differentiation, brought out from the distribution of production conditions and position in the division of labour, also represents basis for the consumer aspirations and privatization etc. Specific system of socio-cultural values in an average social consciousness, has generated in such conditions. Universality and homogeneity were being realized only in domain of the consumer style of life, but not so much when the socialist system of all the self-management as a value, comes in question. The author concludes that the existence of the objectively different ways of production, contradictory social status of groups and characteristics of subjective social forces in the contemporary Yugoslav society, cause the existence of pluralism of value orientations. There is a number of varieties among those orientations, but what they all — <b>except</b> the revolutionary <b>self-managing</b> value orientation — have in common, is the fact that they represent a barrier to the natural evolution of human sociability, presupposed by socialist revolution. In the so called average social consciousness, pluralism of values has been noticed in more or less all social groups, and it could be characterized as inarticulate, sincretically connected, very often competitive and mutually excluding ideals...|$|R
