40|$|Ladies and gentlemen, first I {{would like}} to begin by thanking the organisers for the {{invitation}} to speak here at this conference today. From all the available evidence, {{it is clear that}} the global economy is experiencing a period of unprecedented economic and financial instability. Risks have increased substantially in recent months. The crisis, and not just here in Europe, has entered a new and dangerous phase. Against this background, the a priori expectation would have been that a country with its own considerable banking and fiscal difficulties, and one that was already in an <b>external</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programme,</b> would see its situation worsen. However, that is not what has happened to Ireland. While market sentiment still remains fragile, and even allowing for the recent reversal in Irish bond yields, there has been an improvement in market perceptions of the risks associated with the Irish sovereign and the domestic banking sector since the summer. Notably, Ireland has also received favourable comment in some official circles, being referred to as an example, and even a role model, in terms of implementing a programme of adjustment. While these are welcome developments, they largely reflect the fact that, to date, Ireland i...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} transformation of the structures of secondary education in two Latin American countries: Brazil and Colombia, with particular reference to the 1970 s. At that time, these educational reforms aimed to introduce vocational education, as a preparation for the world of work, into the formal system of education. This thesis argues that the educational reforms leading to vocational education were a complex product of the interaction of foreign influences and specific local conditions, framed by the dependent character of the development pursued by both societies. These processes included the restructuring of local institutions, emulating external models. and following international advice. In both countries these reforms were affected by local socio-economic demands, and also provided the governments with an useful instrument of political propaganda and ideological control, within claimed intentions of increasing social mobility through education. To discuss these interpretations in terms of the interplay of internal and external influences on secondary and vocational education reforms, in Brazil and Colombia, this thesis is made up of five chapters. Following the Introduction, chapter 1 discusses the theoretical basis of the investigation, exploring the possibilities of using a particular branch of dependency perspective as a way to analyse educational change. Chapter 2 reviews the historical context of the main educational reforms of secondary education in Brazil and Colombia. Chapter 3 analyses the role played by international agencies and <b>external</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in the reforms leading to vocational education. Chapter 4 discusses the specific political and social conditions in each country which affected the introduction and implementation of vocational education. Chapter 5 offers a re-interpretation of the historical and structural conditions for educational reforms in Brazil and Colombia in recent decades, highlighting the contemporary crisis within the impasse resulting from the dependent development of those countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of psychological {{support in the}} workplace (also known as workplace counselling) are well documented. Most large organisations in the UK have staff counselling schemes. However, it is unclear what, if any, factors affect employee decisions to use such schemes. This study has used a qualitative methodology to explore the reasons that make employees use workplace counselling. Eleven employees of a university {{in the north of}} England who had used the staff counselling service of their employer took part in the study. The employer had two schemes available: an internal staff counselling service and an <b>external</b> Employee <b>Assistance</b> <b>Programme</b> (EAP). A semi-structured interview was used with each participant and grounded theory techniques were used to analyse the interviews. The analysis resulted in the construction of a model of psychological help-seeking in the workplace. The main findings indicate that most participants were motivated to use their employer's counselling service by their prior positive experiences of similar or other type of mental health services. Other encouraging factors were: recommendation of service by others, a supportive environment and trust in the confidential ethos of the service. Conversely, negative preconceptions of psychological help-seeking and a perception of the employing environment as unsafe were shown to have been discouraging factors. The study concludes with suggestions for practice and for further research...|$|R
40|$|Background Mental {{health care}} is now a major {{occupational}} health issue in Japan. Although realizing effective use of <b>external</b> employee <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> (EAPs) {{has been identified as}} crucial for mental health care, few scientific papers describe or analyse the characteristics of EAPs in Japan. Aims This study sought to clarify the characteristics of an external EAP in Japan. Methods The characteristics of an external EAP were clarified in terms of programme description and utilization. A total of 10 260 counselling sessions from 1996 to 2000 were used for utilization analysis. Results The EAP studied had contracts with 133 organizations, half of which were health insurance societies. The EAP provided employees and family members with free, confidential counselling. Annual mean utilization rate per 1000 individuals increased from 1. 3 in 1996 to 2. 7 in 2000. Less than one-third of counselling sessions were for work-related mental health issues, and male users (30 %) consulted significantly more often than female users (14 %) for such problems. Among men, career development issues were most common, while job dissatisfaction was highest among women. Absenteeism, depression and fatigue were the most frequently observed problems in both sexes. Conclusions EAP use in Japan is rising. The majority of its use is for non-work-related health issues. Male users were more likely to consult for work-related mental health problems.

40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, the Government of Indonesia has {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> intended {{to improve the lives of}} the poor and help them escape poverty. Many of these programmes are now operating at a national scale and cover millions of Indonesians. Using a new household survey dataset that covers the eastern areas of Indonesia (Indonesian Family Life Survey East 2012), this paper investigates the household-level determinants of access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The analysis reveals that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are relatively more available in poorer provinces and that poorer households—all things being equal—are more likely to access social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> than nonpoor households, which suggests that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in eastern Indonesia are successful in their efforts to target the poor (poverty targeting), both across regions and households. However, poverty targeting still has scope for improvement in terms of accuracy. Besides the poverty status (as measured in per capita consumption expenditures), the authors found that several other factors infl uence programme access. Having a disabled household member or having a household head who is a widow(er) appears to increase the likelihood of receiving social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Likewise, the level of trust and confl ict in a community affects access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Particularly in the case of Raskin, we found that the programme is distributed more widely among those communities that are characterized by higher levels of confl ict and lower levels of trust. The authors did not fi nd that poor access to infrastructure and remoteness infl uences household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> once they controlled for province fi xed effects in the regression framework. Furthermore, the fi ndings suggest that possession of a local ‘poverty letter’ strongly improves household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> even after controlling for a wide set of socioeconomic characteristics. In general, determinants of programme access differ signifi cantly among provinces and between rural and urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} noted {{as one of the}} {{important}} keys to determining the success of the recovery process in the aftermath a disaster. It has also been shown that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster, significantly contribute to the recovery phase of disaster management, by utilizing the communities? capacity to facilitate community recovery from a disaster. Through the community recovery framework, social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> with active collaboration and interaction between the community and the social assistants, can speed up community recovery efforts; contributing to the disaster recovery management. The Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2009 and Regulation of the Ministry of Social of the Republic of Indonesia Number 82 of 2006 set out and guide the social assistance delivery to the community. However, most of the literature addressing social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> following a disaster in Indonesia, is from the government?s perspective, the legislation outlook and the social assistants? point of view. Little is known about the benefit and practice of the social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspectives of the affected community. Therefore, the current study sought to address this gap by exploring the experiences of social assistance within the affected community following a disaster. With this knowledge, the government, NGOs, private sectors and other parties would gain insights, inputs and recommendations from the affected community, to whom the programmes were delivered, so that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster may be made more effective. A qualitative study was conducted in Kinahrejo hamlet, the most affected community from the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption. Data was analysed using qualitative descriptive methodology via open-ended and close-ended questions with 10 participants. The study explored whether the lived experiences of the Kinahrejo community was congruent with Indonesian regulation regarding social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> This study has contributed to the field of research on social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster by providing findings on the importance of the mentioned programmes toward the affected community from the community?s experiences and perspectives...|$|R

In this context, concerns have arisen that poor government policies and inadequate donor coordination have reduced the effectiveness of such assistance. The paper discusses the sources of policy success and policy failure of such international <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> within a principal-agent framework that models the influence of misaligned objectives, differing incentive structures, asymmetric information and moral hazard facing the different actors in the institutional structure of <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> In this political economy approach the varying influences on multiple principals and agents are key determinants {{of the effectiveness of}} policy. The paper takes a sectoral view in examining <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in the vocational education sector, where large donor effort has been applied in the Western Balkans over the last decade to modernise and reform the education system. The specific focus is on secondary vocational education in Serbia. The paper identifies causes of policy failure in EU pre-accession assistance in this key policy area...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects of {{government}} <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> on internationalization of SMEs from an Asian developing nation. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data from a sample of 203 SMEs in three export-oriented industries in Bangladesh were analyzed using structural equations model to examine both direct and indirect causal effects of government assistance on their internationalization. Findings - Results suggest that the usage of market development-related government assistance significantly influence internationalization directly as well as indirectly via other determinants, whereas finance- and guarantee-related assistance has only indirect effect. Practical implications - Government export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> play an important role in the SMEs' internationalization process by contributing to a number of firm- and management-related factors that determine international marketing performance of a firm. The study provides a guideline for SME managers as to how they can benefit from both categories of export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in improving their positive attitudes towards the export market environment, building their knowledge and enhancing commitment to exporting for better success in their international operations. Originality/value - The importance of export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> is well recognized in the literature but its causal effect on internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is low. The paper tries to fill this gap by reporting the results of an empirical study examining effects of government <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> on internationalization of SMEs from an Asian developing nation, where there is a gross dearth of research.
