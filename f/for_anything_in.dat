5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her {{to stand up for}} herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and never asked <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E

The negative ad backfired, as The Scranton Times-Tribune found that {{all but a few}} of Casey's contributors donated when he was running for other offices, and none were investigated <b>for</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>In</b> fact, two of the persons cited in Santorum's campaign ad actually gave contributions to Santorum in 2006, and one died in 2004. Santorum's campaign countered that those donations were not kept, and had been donated to educational institutions.|$|E

25|$|The {{initials}} GWR have {{an association}} with the Great Western Railway especially in the South West of England, {{and there is a}} popular misconception with listeners that the station stands for Great Western Radio. Indeed, neighbouring GWR Wiltshire was called Wiltshire Radio (WR) before its merger with Radio West. However, according to group management, the letters GWR did not stand <b>for</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>In</b> fact the station management at the time did try to secure the name Great Western Radio, however it was already the trading name of a Bristol electronics shop, who refused to relinquish the title.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Bittaker {{was arrested}} for assault with attempt to commit murder. This charge arose from an {{incident}} in which he stabbed a young supermarket clerk named Gary Louie following a confrontation in a supermarket parking lot: Louie had observed Bittaker steal a steak from the supermarket in which he (Louie) worked. Upon observing Bittaker's actions, Louie had followed Bittaker into the car park and calmly asked him whether he had forgotten to pay <b>for</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>In</b> response to this question, Bittaker stabbed Louie once in the chest, narrowly missing his heart.

Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz, who for six months had given part of his ration {{and a piece of}} bread to Levi without asking <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> return.

Levi made several trips to rescue his old friend from the streets, but in 1952 Lorenzo died.|$|E

It is {{said that}} due to the {{depletion}} of natural resources, overpopulation, and the failure of the Space Exploration Project, humanity has virtually eradicated itself through biological and nuclear warfare, turning a once prosperous civilization into complete ruin, cast in darkness and poisoned by constant rain from nuclear fallout. One military invasion in the past was at Mare Nectaris. The bloodshed continues 30 years after the war in a dystopic world via automated war machines, which kill anyone trespassing into their territory. Of the remaining humans, there are those known as [...] "junkers" [...] who go around scavenging <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> order to survive; the protagonist in the story is one.|$|E

The contract was not what it seemed, however, as Martin would not sign it himself until he had heard an audition, and later said that EMI had [...] "nothing to lose," [...] as it offered one penny for each record sold, which was split among the four members. Martin suggested to EMI (after the release of [...] "From Me to You") that the royalty rate should be doubled without asking <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> return, which led to Martin being {{thought of as a}} [...] "traitor in EMI".|$|E

500|$|Sarria {{became the}} first openly gay {{candidate}} in the United States to run for public office, running in 1961 for {{a seat on the}} San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Sarria almost won by default. On the last day for candidates to file petitions, city officials realized that there were fewer than five candidates running for the five open seats, which would have assured Sarria a seat. By the end of the day, 34 candidates had filed. Sarria garnered some 6,000 votes, shocking political pundits and setting in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics.

Van Morrison's exploration of spirituality is discussed in the book, including his experiences with mysticism, Christianity, and Dianetics. In the last chapter of the book, Turner comments on Van Morrison's experiences in religion, writing: [...] "His development of religion as a normal topic of discourse in popular song {{may turn out to}} be his most lasting contribution." ...|$|E

Sarria garnered some 6,000votes in the citywide race, finishing ninth. This was not enough to win a seat but was enough to shock political pundits and set in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics.

500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. Now that I have a franchise, what do I do with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E
500|$|In 1925, the NFL was {{in need of}} a {{franchise}} in a large city market {{that could be used to}} showcase the league. To achieve this, NFL President, Joseph Carr traveled to New York City to offer boxing promoter Billy Gibson, {{a franchise}}. Gibson was chosen by Carr since he had owned the league's last New York franchise, the New York Brickley Giants, in 1921. However, Gibson refused the offer for a new franchise, but he did refer Carr to a friend of his, Tim Mara. Mara, a bookmaker (then a legal profession), businessman, and promoter, with an investment of US$500, then established the modern-day New York Giants franchise. Other than the name, there is no relation between the Brickley Giants and the modern New York Giants franchise. Mara decided to invest the $500 in the Giants as opposed to heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney in a spur-of-the-moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> New York is worth $500." [...] Mara owned the team until his death in 1959, when it was passed on to his sons Wellington and Jack Mara. Legally named [...] "New York Football Giants" [...] to distinguish themselves from the baseball team of the same name, the Giants played their first game against All New Britain in New Britain, Connecticut, on October 4, 1925.
