5|$|With the Zanj subdued, after 883 al-Muwaffaq {{turned his}} {{attention}} again to the east. Ya'qub al-Saffar's brother and successor, Amr ibn al-Layth, had acknowledged the Caliph's suzerainty and had been rewarded with the governorship over the eastern provinces and the position of sahib al-shurta of Baghdad—essentially the same posts the Tahirids had held—in exchange for an annual tribute, but soon <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> asserting his authority, especially in Khurasan, where Rafi ibn Harthama emerged {{as the leader of}} the former Tahirid troops. In 884/885, Amr was formally deprived of his governorship of Khurasan in favour of the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz, and the army under the vizier Sa'id ibn Makhlad conquered most of the province of Fars, forcing Amr himself to come west. After initial success against the general Tark ibn al-Abbas, Amr was routed by Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz in 886, and again in 887 by al-Muwaffaq in person. Nevertheless, the threat by the Tulunids and the Byzantines in the west forced al-Muwaffaq to negotiate a settlement in 888/889 that largely restored the previous status quo. In 890, al-Muwaffaq again attempted to take back Fars, but this time Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz was defeated, and another agreement restored peace and Amr's titles and possessions.|$|E

Mr Fraser had lost his right forearm and his left forearm was severely lacerated and appeared to be broken. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> breathing and required urgent medical treatment. Having got him to shore, Ms Amey then joined {{the rest of the team}} in doing what they could for Mr Fraser until he could be flown to New Zealand. Ms Amey displayed great courage and bravery with complete disregard for her own safety in going to Mr Fraser's assistance.|$|E

500|$|Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club {{said the}} faux-documentary {{style of the}} show, and Leslie's naive faith about her project and {{department}} in this episode, draw unflattering comparisons to The Office, which was also made by the Park and Recreation creators. Tobias said the Scrabble subplot brought [...] "the few good laughs" [...] in the episode. Jason Hughes of TV Squad said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> connecting to the Leslie character, but felt [...] "The Reporter" [...] allowed for further development of supporting characters like Ron, Tom and Mark, who is portrayed as self-absorbed and [...] "a bit of a douche."

500|$|American {{science fiction}} {{magazines}} had by the mid-1930s begun to publish some more sophisticated stories than the straightforward adventure fiction {{that was a}} staple of the earliest years of the genre. [...] Gillings decided that many British science fiction readers would not be familiar with most of the developments in American sf, and so he did not make a point of seeking innovative and original material. [...] The first issue contained [...] "The Perfect Creature", an early story by John Wyndham, under the name [...] "John Beynon", as well as [...] "The Prr-r-eet", by Eric Frank Russell. [...] The second issue included Wyndham's novel Sleepers of Mars, and William F. Temple's [...] "Lunar Lilliput", which was Temple's first science fiction sale. [...] "Stenographer's Hands", a story by David H. Keller, also appeared in the second issue, reprinted from a U.S. magazine; Gillings claimed that this was to introduce British science fiction readers to American developments in sf, but in fact it was because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> obtaining good quality material from British writers.|$|E
500|$|On May 12, 1990, Henson {{traveled}} to Ahoskie, North Carolina, {{with his daughter}} Cheryl, to visit his father and stepmother. They both returned to New York on May 13, and Henson canceled a Muppet recording session scheduled for May 14. That night, Henson's wife Jane, from whom he was separated, came to visit for the last time. Hours later, on May 15, Henson suffered a medical emergency; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> breathing and began coughing up blood. He suggested to his wife {{that he might be}} dying, but did not want to take time from his schedule to visit a hospital. Jane later stated that while Henson's Christian Science upbringing [...] "affect his general thinking", it did not have any influence on his postponement of medical treatment, and still later told People magazine that his avoidance was likely due to his desire not to be a bother to anyone. His stepmother and others also denied rumors that Henson's Christian Science beliefs might have contributed to his death, as Henson had ceased practicing in his early 20s. Two hours later, Henson finally agreed to be taken by taxi to New York Hospital in New York City. After arriving there at 4:58a.m. (EST), Henson stopped breathing and an X-ray revealed he had abscesses in his lungs. Henson was placed on a ventilator, but his condition deteriorated rapidly despite aggressive treatment with multiple antibiotics.|$|E
