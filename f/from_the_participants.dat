500|$|The Chronicle {{incorporates}} {{material from}} multiple sources. The entry for 755, describing how Cynewulf took the kingship of Wessex from Sigebehrt, is {{far longer than}} the surrounding entries, and includes direct speech quotations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in those events. It seems likely that this {{was taken by the}} scribe from existing saga material. Early entries, up to the year 110, probably came from one of the small encyclopaedic volumes of world history in circulation at the time the Chronicle was first written. The chronological summary to Bede's Ecclesiastical History was used as a source. The Chronicle gives dates and genealogies for Northumbrian and Mercian kings, and provides a list of Wessex bishops; these are likely to have had separate sources. The entry for 661 records a battle fought by Cenwalh that {{is said to have been}} fought [...] "at Easter"; this precision implies a contemporary record, which survived and was re-used by the Chronicle scribe.|$|E

2500|$|The 17th {{century is}} {{noted for its}} biographical [...] "mémoires". [...] The first great outpouring of these comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> of the Fronde (like Cardinal de Retz), who used the genre as {{political}} justification combined with novelistic adventure. Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy (known as Bussy-Rabutin) {{is responsible for the}} scandalous Histoire amoureuse des Gaules, a series of sketches of amorous intrigues by the chief ladies of the court. [...] Paul Pellisson, historian to the king, wrote a Histoire de Louis XIV covering 1660–1670. [...] Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux wrote Les Historiettes, a collection of short biographical sketches of his contemporaries.|$|E
2500|$|Yamada {{believes}} that the language {{used to describe the}} plight of the concubine make the reader sympathize with her, especially during the rape and its aftermath. [...] "Thus, the narrator's elaborate description of the woman's attempt to return to the old man's house highlights for the reader the devastating effects of the preceding night's events, emphasizing her desolate state. The woman's raped and exhausted body becomes a symbol of the wrong that is committed when 'every man did what was right in his own eyes.' The image of this woman struggling to the door demands a response <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in the story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early promotional {{copies of}} Smells Like Children {{featured}} unauthorized {{samples from the}} films Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, {{as well as other}} sound bites considered [...] "too extreme", therefore resulting in the track listing to be re-edited accordingly for public release, much to Manson's chagrin. Interscope was not interested in buying licenses to use the film samples and demanded written affidavits <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in the sound bites, certifying their consent to be recorded. The removed clips were the original opening track,"Abuse, Part 1 (There is Pain Involved)", featuring the voices of Manson and Wiggins as they attempted to calm down a masochistic girl when things got rather out-of-hand, and [...] "Abuse, Part 2 (Confessions)", featuring an interview with a teenage girl who confesses to molesting her 7-year-old male cousin. These were replaced by [...] "The Hands of Small Children" [...] and [...] "May Cause Discoloration of the Urine or Feces", respectively.|$|E
6000|$|In order {{fully to}} {{understand}} this, {{it is necessary}} to realise, genuinely and thoroughly, {{that there is such a}} thing as an international difference in humour. If we take the crudest joke in the world--the joke, let us say, of a man sitting down on his hat--we shall yet find that all the nations would differ in their way of treating it humourously, and that if American humour treated it at all, it would be in a purely American manner. For example, there was a case of an orator in the House of Commons, who, after denouncing all the public abuses he could think of, did sit down on his hat. An Irishman immediately rose, full of the whole wealth of Irish humour, and said, [...] "Should I be in order, Sir, in congratulating the honourable gentleman on the fact that when he sat down on his hat his head was not in it?" [...] Here is a glorious example of Irish humour--the bull not unconscious, not entirely conscious, but rather an idea so absurd that even the utterer of it can hardly realise how abysmally absurd it is. But every other nation would have treated the idea in a manner slightly different. The Frenchman's humour would have been logical: he would have said, [...] "The orator denounces modern abuses and destroys to himself the top-hat: behold a good example!" [...] What the Scotchman's humour would have said I am not so certain, but it would probably have dealt with the serious advisability of making such speeches on top of someone else's hat. But American humour on such a general theme would be the humour of exaggeration. The American humourist would say that the English politicians so often sat down on their hats that the noise of the House of Commons was one crackle of silk. He would say that when an important orator rose to speak in the House of Commons, long rows of hatters waited outside the House with note-books to take down orders <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in the debate. He would say that the whole hat trade of London was disorganised by the news that a clever remark had been made by a young M. P. on the subject of the imports of Jamaica. In short, American humour, neither unfathomably absurd like the Irish, nor transfiguringly lucid and appropriate like the French, nor sharp and sensible and full of realities of life like the Scotch, is simply the humour of imagination. It consists in piling towers on towers and mountains on mountains; of heaping a joke up to the stars and extending it to the end of the world.|$|E
