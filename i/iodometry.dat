2500|$|The {{traditional}} way {{to analyze the}} ascorbic acid content {{is the process of}} titration with an oxidizing agent, and several procedures have been developed, mainly relying on <b>iodometry.</b> Iodine is used {{in the presence of a}} starch indicator. Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex with the starch indicator. [...] This indicates the end-point of the titration. As an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator. The preceding iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by potentiometric titration in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday's law.|$|E

In this method, excess but known amount of iodide is added to known volume of sample, in which only the active (electrophilic) can oxidize iodide to iodine. The iodine content and thus the active chlorine content can be determined with <b>iodometry.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Iodometry,</b> {{also known}} as iodometric titration, is a method of {{volumetric}} chemical analysis, a redox titration where the appearance or disappearance of elementary iodine indicates the end point.|$|E
50|$|The {{precipitation}} {{occurs in}} slightly acidic medium, thus avoids {{the problem of}} decomposition of iodide and thiosulfate in strongly acidic medium, and the hexacyanoferrate(III) can be determined by <b>iodometry</b> as usual.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{quantitative}} {{nature of this}} reaction, as well as because Na2S2O3·5H2O has an excellent shelf-life, it {{is used as a}} titrant in <b>iodometry.</b> Na2S2O3·5H2O is also a component of iodine clock experiments.|$|E
50|$|Iodine monobromide is an interhalogen {{compound}} {{with the}} chemical symbol IBr. It {{is a dark}} red solid that melts near room temperature. Like iodine monochloride, IBr is used in some types of <b>iodometry.</b> It serves {{as a source of}} I+.|$|E
5000|$|The {{iodine test}} {{is used to}} test for the {{presence}} of starch. Starch turns an intense [...] "blue-black" [...] colour upon addition of aqueous solutions of the triiodide anion, due to the formation of an intermolecular charge-transfer complex. In the absence of starch, the brown colour of the aqueous solution remains. This interaction between starch and triiodide is also the basis for <b>iodometry.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Iodometry</b> is {{commonly}} used to analyse the concentration of oxidizing agents in water samples, such as oxygen saturation in ecological studies or active chlorine in swimming pool water analysis.To a known volume of sample, an excess but known amount of iodide is added, which the oxidizing agents oxidizes iodide to iodine. Iodine dissolves in the iodide-containing solution to give triiodide ions, which have a dark brown color.|$|E
50|$|Some redox titrations do {{not require}} an indicator, due to the intense color of the constituents. For instance, in permanganometry a slight {{persisting}} pink color signals the endpoint of the titration {{because of the color}} of the excess oxidizing agent potassium permanganate. In <b>iodometry,</b> at sufficiently large concentrations, the disappearance of the deep red-brown triiodide ion can itself be used as an endpoint, though at lower concentrations sensitivity is improved by adding starch indicator, which forms an intensely blue complex with triiodide.|$|E
50|$|This {{particular}} {{analysis is}} an example of <b>iodometry.</b> A solution of iodine is yellow/brown in color. When this is added to a solution to be tested, however, any chemical group (usually in this test C=C double bonds) that react with iodine effectively reduce the strength, or magnitude of the colour (by taking iodine out of solution). Thus the amount of iodine required to make a solution retain the characteristic yellow/brown colour can effectively be used to determine the amount of iodine sensitive groups present in the solution.|$|E

50|$|At a {{laboratory}} scale, mixing {{is achieved by}} magnetic stirrers or by simple hand-shaking. Sometimes mixing in laboratory vessels is more thorough and occurs faster than is possible industrially. Magnetic stir bars are radial-flow mixers that induce solid body rotation in the fluid being mixed. This is acceptable on a small scale, since the vessels are small and mixing therefore occurs rapidly (short blend time). A variety of stir bar configurations exist, {{but because of the}} small size and (typically) low viscosity of the fluid, it is possible to use one configuration for nearly all mixing tasks. The cylindrical stir bar can be used for suspension of solids, as seen in <b>iodometry,</b> deagglomeration (useful for preparation of microbiology growth medium from powders), and liquid-liquid blending. Another peculiarity of laboratory mixing is that the mixer rests {{on the bottom of the}} vessel instead of being suspended near the center. Furthermore, the vessels used for laboratory mixing are typically more widely varied than those used for industrial mixing; for instance, Erlenmeyer flasks, or Florence flasks may be used in addition to the more cylindrical beaker.|$|E

The method of indirect <b>iodometry</b> {{was used in}} the process of the analysis, and received results were converted into the content of KI in mg/kg of salt. Beside the content of KI, the content of NaCl was also determined, counted to dry meter and water content, and received results were compared with the requests determined by Regulations of Table Salt Quality Meant for Human Diet and by manufacturers' declaration. Received results show that the volumetric method of indirect <b>iodometry,</b> applied in this analysis, is very reliable for determination of potassium iodine in table salt, because of its high precision and reproducibility of the analysis results. All received results show that the samples of table salt which can be bought in supermarkets are according to the demands given by Regulations.

Measured humidity in the samples of table salt received from sea salt (sample 1) is higher than humidity in the samples received from rock salt as the result of magnesium presence in sea salt, which is hygroscopic material. Although samples 5 and 6 also originate from sea salt, their smaller humidity is the result of additional heating and salt processing. ...|$|E
