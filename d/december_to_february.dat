5|$|Mumbai has a {{tropical}} climate, specifically {{a tropical}} {{wet and dry}} climate (Aw) under the Köppen climate classification, with seven months of dryness and peak of rains in July. The cooler season from <b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February</b> {{is followed by the}} summer season from March to June. The period from June to about the end of September constitutes the south-west monsoon season, and October and November form the post-monsoon season.|$|E
5|$|This list {{presents}} {{the following information}} for each species: common and scientific name of each species, preferred habitat, breeding status in Vieques and frequency of occurrence for each season (winter spans from <b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February,</b> spring from March to May, summer from June to August, fall from September to November). Tags (described below) are used to describe this information for each species.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season {{varies according to}} latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, <b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February</b> in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. Softly growling, he approaches the female and bows {{three or four times}} to her. His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which are either living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.|$|E

5|$|The male red-tailed black {{cockatoo}} courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, {{and hiding}} the beak; it then sings and struts, {{ending in a}} jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him. Breeding generally takes place from May to September except {{in the case of}} the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (<b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February).</b> Pairs of the subspecies samueli in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. Hollows can be 1 to 2metres (3–7ft) deep and 0.25–0.5metres (10–20in) wide, with a base of woodchips. A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over <b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February.</b> They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda has a {{temperate}} tropical highland climate, {{with lower}} temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries {{because of its}} high elevation. Kigali, in {{the centre of the}} country, has a typical daily temperature range between , with little variation through the year. There are some temperature variations across the country; the mountainous west and north are generally cooler than the lower-lying east. There are two rainy seasons in the year; the first runs from February to June and the second from September to December. These are separated by two dry seasons: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from <b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February.</b> Rainfall varies geographically, with the west and northwest of the country receiving more precipitation annually than the east and southeast. Global warming has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons. According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group, change in climate has reduced the number of rainy days experienced during a year, but has also caused an increase in frequency of torrential rains. Both changes have caused difficulty for farmers, decreasing their productivity. Strategic Foresight also characterise Rwanda as a fast warming country, with an increase in average temperature of between 0.7°C to 0.9°C over fifty years.|$|E

25|$|The diverse {{climate of}} Chile ranges from the world's driest desert in the north—the Atacama Desert—through a Mediterranean climate in the center, humid {{subtropical}} in Easter Island, to an oceanic climate, including alpine tundra and glaciers {{in the east}} and south. According to the Köppen system, Chile within its borders hosts at least ten major climatic subtypes. There are four seasons in most of the country: summer (<b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February),</b> autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and spring (September to November).|$|E
25|$|In India, Ropalidia marginata has an aseasonal, {{indeterminate}} and perennial colony cycle, {{which means}} that nest initiation starts throughout the year, and nests are active throughout the year. Colonies are started more frequently from May to July when food is abundant and less frequently from <b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February</b> when temperatures are colder. Each colony has one reproductive female, a queen, and that position can be taken by adopting an abandoned nest, taking over queenship at an existing nest, or starting a new nest alone or with other foundresses.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 1917, the {{armistice}} of Erzincan (Erzincan Cease-fire Agreement) signed between the Russians and Ottomans in Erzincan {{that ended the}} armed conflicts between Russia and Ottoman Empire.

They created a spectacle en route, for, to the amazement of the homeward-bound Russian soldiers, they were moving toward, not away from, the forward lines. Russian soldiers left equipment and guns to the newly constructed Armenian national army soldiers. After the nationalization (or democratization for some sources) of these left over forces throughout 1917, there was no effective Russian military force {{by the end of}} 1917 in the region.|$|E

Northerly winds are responsible for humid climate from April to June. It is usually rainy during the months of April, May, June, November and December.|$|E
25|$|Bosaso has a hot {{desert climate}} (Köppen climate {{classification}} BWh). It has a mean annual relative humidity of around 60%. The average daily mean temperature year-round is 30°C, {{with an average}} annual high of 35°C and an average annual low of 25°C. Average low temperatures are coolest {{during the winter months}} of <b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February,</b> when thermometer readings typically level out at 20°C. The weather slowly heats up in the spring, as the April rainy season begins. Average high temperatures later peak during the summer months of June to August, when they consistently exceed 40°C (104°F). Come September, cooler weather starts to set in again. Rainfall reaches a high over this period, with an average precipitation of 7mm (0.28 inches) in November. Total rainfall year-round is around 19mm (0.76 inches).|$|E

25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} can breed twice a year, but {{younger and}} less experienced mothers normally {{have a single}} litter {{per year in the}} spring. Depending on forage availability, older and more experienced females may breed again in summer. In a year of abundant food, 36% of females bear two litters, but none will do so in a year of poor food. Their breeding seasons are <b>December</b> <b>to</b> <b>February</b> and May to June, though this is slightly delayed in more northern latitudes. The first litter is born in February or March, the second in June or July, though, again, bearing may be advanced or delayed by a few weeks depending on climate, temperature, and forage availability. In any given breeding season, an average of 61 – 66% of females bear young. If a female fails to conceive or loses her young to unusually cold weather or predation, she re-enters estrus and has a later litter.|$|E
