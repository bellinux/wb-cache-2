Using perturbative arguments, Flory arguments, and a replica calculation, {{we show that}} a stiff <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> in 1 +d dimensions undergoes a localization transition with increasing disorder for $d> 2 / 3 $. We demonstrate that this transition is accessible by numerical transfer matrix calculations in 1 + 1 dimensions and analyze {{the properties of the}} disorder-dominated phase. On the basis of the two-replica problem, we propose a relation between the localization of stiff <b>directed</b> <b>lines</b> in 1 +d dimensions and of <b>directed</b> <b>lines</b> under tension in 1 + 3 d dimensions, which is strongly supported by identical free energy distributions. This shows that pair interactions in the replicated Hamiltonian determine the nature of <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> localization transitions with consequences for the critical behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. Furthermore, we quantify how the persistence length of the stiff <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> is reduced by disorder. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new edge-based {{matching}} kernel for graphs by using discrete-time quantum walks. To this end, we commence by transforming a graph into a <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> graph. The reasons {{of using the}} line graph structure are twofold. First, for a graph, its <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> graph is a dual representation and each vertex of the line graph represents a corresponding edge in the original graph. Second, we show that the discrete-time quantum walk {{can be seen as}} a walk on the line graph and the state space of the walk is the vertex set of the line graph, i. e., the state space of the walk is the edges of the original graph. As a result, the <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> graph provides an elegant way of developing new edge-based matching kernel based on discrete-time quantum walks. For a pair of graphs, we compute the h-layer depth-based representation for each vertex of their <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> graphs by computing entropic signatures (computed from discrete-time quantum walks on the line graphs) on the family of K-layer expansion subgraphs rooted at the vertex, i. e., we compute the depth-based representations for edges of the original graphs through their <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> graphs. Based on the new representations, we define an edge-based matching method for the pair of graphs by aligning the h-layer depth-based representations computed through the <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> graphs. The new edge-based matching kernel is thus computed by counting the number of matched vertices identified by the matching method on the <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> graphs. Experiments on standard graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our new kernel...|$|R

5|$|On 8 June 1867, Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz {{formally}} recognized Isma'il Pasha by {{the title}} Khedive, which ranked {{higher than that}} of Vizier but lower than that of Caliph. The Khedivate of Egypt was still nominally a subject of the Ottoman Sultan, and its rulers were still technically appointed and dismissed by an imperial firman. Nevertheless, the Khedive actually exercised most sovereign powers, including the appointment of his council of ministers, the rector of Al-Azhar, and high-ranking military and naval officers. He could also sign treaties with foreign powers and borrow money for the state treasury. On 17 May 1866, the rule of succession in Egypt was changed from one based on agnatic seniority to one based on male primogeniture in the <b>direct</b> <b>line</b> of Isma'il Pasha. After the British occupied the country in 1882, the Khedive's exercise of power was limited greatly by the advice of the British agent and consul general, who became the de facto ruler of the country.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the School's operation, the {{character}} of the area had changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four villages on Ermine Street (later the A10 road), surrounded by marshland and farmland. The construction of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1840, with stations at Tottenham Hale and Marsh Lane (later Northumberland Park), made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time (albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via Stratford, more than double the distance of the direct road route), as well as providing direct connections to the Port of London. In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a <b>direct</b> <b>line</b> from Enfield to Liverpool Street station, including a station at Bruce Grove, close to Bruce Castle; the railway provided subsidised workmen's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London. As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area; {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself, and the waterlogged floodplains of the River Lea at Tottenham Marshes and of the River Moselle at Broadwater Farm.|$|E

5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in <b>direct</b> <b>line</b> with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E

Travelling at average speeds of , {{passengers}} were charged from 1d per mile for third class to 2.2d per mile for first. Horses were still used on trains in the mid-1850s: a horse-drawn coach was still independently operated between Middlesbrough and Stockton in 1854 on Sundays, as the only S services that run on that day were the mail trains, and locomotives replaced horses on passenger trains to West Auckland in 1856. The S opened a carriage works south of Darlington North Road station in 1853 and later it built a locomotive works nearby to replace its works at Shildon. Designed by William Bouch, who had taken over from Hackworth as Locomotive Supervisor in 1840, it completed its first locomotive in 1864. In 1858 the Brusselton Inclines were bypassed by {{a line from the}} north end of Shildon Tunnel; the same year a passenger service started on the Hagger Leases branch and a mineral line opened from Crook via two inclines to Waterhouse.

5|$|In {{the early}} Medieval period, British kingship was not {{inherited}} in a <b>direct</b> <b>line</b> from previous kings, {{as would be}} the case in the late Middle Ages. There were instead a number of candidates for kingship, who usually needed {{to be a member of}} a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor.

The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but occasionally themselves had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have placed obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. After a victory, sub-kings may have received rewards in return for this service. Interaction with and intermarriage into the ruling families of subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of these mergers, it is likely that a complex process by which kingship was gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties was taking place.|$|E

5|$|On 6 August 1915, Mackay was {{involved}} in the Battle of Lone Pine. When the attack began, Mackay went over the top at the head of an attack. He ignored the first Turkish trench, taking a <b>direct</b> <b>line</b> to his objective. Firing from the hip, he shot and killed several Turks in the trenches below. Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches, shooting down more enemy troops. When no others appeared, he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay. The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead, as were the next two after him. The rest decided not to follow. Mackay took up a position on a fire step, a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top. Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench. Mackay attempted to fire but his magazine was empty. He lunged at the Turks, grazing one and making all three run. Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags. As the barricade was built up, it became possible {{for the rest of the}} party to join Mackay. The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine. It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops. Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack.

5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A <b>direct</b> <b>line</b> with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north.

In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating {{that it was more}} important to secure a fast connection to Ski.
