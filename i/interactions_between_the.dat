5|$|The planet e's {{eccentricity}} {{is poorly}} defined; varying values between 0 and 0.4 does not significantly improve the fit, so an eccentricity of 0.2 was assumed. Taking <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planets into account {{results in a}} near-zero orbital eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 c is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} outer planets Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 e: for every orbit of planet e, planet b completes two orbits and planet c completes four. This leads to strong gravitational <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planets, causing the orbital elements to change rapidly as the orbits precess. This {{is the second}} known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Tales of Legendia was designed {{to focus on the}} <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> main cast. However, a unique feature to this game is the addition of a second series of scenarios after the player has completed the main story that focuses more on the individual characters themselves. Animated sequences also accompany certain story segments.|$|E
40|$|The E 1 and E 2 {{proteins}} from bovine papillomavirus bind cooperatively to binding {{sites in}} the viral origin of DNA replication. The DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of the two proteins interact with each other, and the E 2 transactivation domain interacts with the helicase domain of E 1. Mutations that disrupt <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two DBDs also disrupt <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> E 2 activation domain and the E 1 helicase domain, demonstrating interdependence of the two interactions. Cooperative binding of the two DBDs generates a sharp bend in the DNA that is required for <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> E 2 activation domain and E 1. This indicates that <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two DBDs plays an architectural role, ‘triggering’ a productive <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> E 2 transactivation domain and E 1 through introduction of a sharp bend in the DNA. This two-step mechanism may be a required feature for cooperative DNA binding to proximal binding sites...|$|R

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Cm(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Cm3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and adenosine triphosphate. Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying the <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres.

5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed. Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two {{theories}} {{for climate}} modification {{have also been}} studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Large wolf populations {{limit the}} numbers of small to {{medium-sized}} felines. Wolves encounter cougars along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges. Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations. In winter, however, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two species become more likely. Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal kills. They have been reported killing mothers and their kittens. Wolves hunt steppe cats, and may scavenge from snow leopard kills. Wolves may also reduce Eurasian lynx populations. Wolves may kill lynxes by running them down, or killing them before they can escape into trees. Similar reports of encounters between wolves and bobcats have been documented.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children.

5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E
5|$|The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial {{velocity}} has one problem, {{it is that}} only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.|$|E
