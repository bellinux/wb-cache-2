Ille peregrinator et scriptor Hierosolyma, Bethaniam, Bethphage and Bethlehem visitabat. Perdicas poema fecit, in quo loca sancta in ducentis quinquaginta novem versibus descripsit. Hic poeta etiam de natura pulchra Palaestinae narrat. Caelum, nebulae, lux, rupes, lapides, aqua plantaeque mire adorant Creatorem suum et serviunt Deo in locis Terrae Sanctae, quae a Saracenis occupata sunt.
