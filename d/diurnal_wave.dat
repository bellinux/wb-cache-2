50|$|The {{first term}} in (3) {{on the right}} is the global mean of the exospheric {{temperature}} (of the order of 1000 K). The second term P20 represents the heat surplus at lower latitudes and a corresponding heat deficit at higher latitudes (Fig. 2a). A thermal wind system develops with wind toward the poles in the upper level and wind away from the poles in the lower level. The coefficient ΔT20 ≈ 0.004 is small because Joule heating in the aurora regions compensates that heat surplus even during quiet magnetospheric conditions. During disturbed conditions, however, that term becomes dominant, changing sign so that now heat surplus is transported from the poles to the equator. The third term (with P10 = sin φ) represents heat surplus on the summer hemisphere and is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the summer into the winter hemisphere (Fig. 2b). Its relative amplitude is of the order ΔT10 ≃ 0.13. The fourth term (with P11(φ) = cos φ) is the dominant <b>diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> (the tidal mode (1,−2)). It is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the daytime hemisphere into the nighttime hemisphere (Fig. 2d). Its relative amplitude is ΔT11≃ 0.15, thus on the order of 150 K. Additional terms (e.g., semiannual, semidiurnal terms and higher order terms) must be added to eq.(3). However, they are of minor importance. Corresponding sums can be developed for density, pressure, and the various gas constituents.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the present ocean tide model cannot provide {{time-varying}} ocean loading effects, which is a possible source of temporal variation in the tidal parameters (Calvo et al. 2014). This study focuses on the FCN resonance variations in <b>diurnal</b> tidal <b>waves,</b> which primarily affect the K 1 and ψ 1 waves adjacent to the FCN frequency, as shown in Fig.  2. Time variance in the ocean loading effect should appear in all <b>diurnal</b> tidal <b>waves</b> of one station with a similar pattern. Thus, by comparing the variation in <b>diurnal</b> <b>waves</b> and at stations located in different regions, the resonance variation can be distinguished from the time-varying ocean loading effect. Moreover, for most stations, SG instruments are installed in quiet inland areas, far from the ocean where the ocean tide effect is small.|$|R

The energy balance closure ratio (ε) is extremely sensitive to the ratio of soil surface heat flux amplitude (A 4 ) to net radiation flux amplitude (A 1 ), and large value of A 4 /A 1 causes a significant failure in surface energy balance closure.

The internal waves brake close to the shoreline and into the lake's bottom, which generates baroclinic circulation and water masses mixing. According to the data obtained with a ADCP, two diurnal and two semidiurnal inclined waves propagate in the lake towards each other in depth and can form fluctuations of a vertical mode, if the depth of the lake is a multiple of one-half the vertical wavelength.

40|$|In {{addition}} to their own convective breaking, the energetic baroclinic tides at a generation site stimulate the weaker non-linear interactions that might comprise the more-typical open ocean energy cascade. Observations of two classes of nonlinear interactions are presented. The first transfers energy from the semidiurnal tide to near- diurnal subharmonics. The second transfers energy from low -frequency, high-shear waves to high frequencies. Evidence is shown for wave-wave interactions between the low-mode, semidiurnal tide and high-mode, near-inertial motions. Profiles of velocity and density were collected aboard the Research Platform FLIP, at two sites during the Hawaii Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME). In HOME Nearfield, significant bicoherences are observed between the dominant low-mode semidiurnal tide and opposing pairs of near- <b>diurnal</b> <b>waves</b> of vertical scale O(100 m). Growth rates of <b>diurnal</b> <b>waves</b> during each fortnightly cycle agree with theoretical predictions for the Parametric Subharmonic Instability (PSI) mechanism. At the Farfield location, 430 km from the generation site, near-diurnal waves are also observed but are not significantly bicoherent with the semidiurnal tide. Triple correlations between low frequency vertical shears and high frequency Reynolds stresses, -, are used at both HOME sites to estimate energy transfers from low frequencies, including both wind-generated motions and PSI subharmonics, to high frequencies. Energy bispectra show significant energy transfers to pairs of waves with nearly identical frequency. However, wavenumber resonances do not fit either the Induced Diffusion (ID) or eikonal models of interaction. Peak transfer rates in the Nearfield are of order 1 x 10 ⁻⁷ W kg⁻¹, while transfer rates in the Farfield are 3 - 4 x smaller. Nearfield energy transfers are larger than local turbulence dissipation, but fall within an order of magnitude. Farfield energy transfers and turbulence dissipation agree within a factor of 3 throughout the measurement profile.

The shorter-period variability was well correlated with coastal sea-level variations measured at a land point near to one of the moorings.

40|$|Data {{obtained}} with the Mariner 9 infrared spectroscopy experiment during the Martian dust storm of 1971 - 72 are examined {{for evidence of}} topographic influence on the atmospheric thermal structure. Temperature perturbations which are well correlated with the planetary-scale topography are found superposed on the large-amplitude diurnal thermal tide previously reported. Applications of tidal theory to the data indicate that the observed perturbations result from the kinematic interaction of the westward traveling <b>diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> with the large-scale components of topography. The dominant mode is excited by the wavenumber 2 topography component and is a vertically evanescent, eastward traveling wave with an equivalent depth comparable to the atmospheric-scale height. The principle dynamic effect of this mode is the enhancement of the amplitude of the near-surface diurnal wind to over 40 m/s in limited areas near 30 deg S latitude. Thus, it appears likely that dust was injected into the atmosphere in these regions during the storm. Other waves excited include vertically propagating modes which produce little effect in the lower atmosphere, but may represent a source of energy for the upper atmosphere during dust storm conditions...|$|E

30|$|The {{numerical}} artefacts {{due to an}} insufficient frequency, {{as detailed}} analyzed by Meurers et al. (2016), can also cause the temporal variations in the tidal parameters of the M 2 wave. It is an important effect we cannot exclude now. But the numerical artefacts should affect all waves. The amplitude of P 1 is much larger than ψ 1 and could be observed more precisely, but there is high correlation in the temporal variation in ψ 1 wave but not in P 1 wave, which means the frequency resolution artifact {{may not be the}} main reason for this temporal variation. Moreover, the first station class (Fig.  7) are all European stations where the modulation of <b>diurnal</b> <b>waves</b> is relatively weak as mentioned in “Atmospheric and ocean tide loading effects” section. Therefore, the consistency between the neighboring K 1 and ψ 1 waves suggests that this temporal variation is possibly due to FCN period variation.|$|R
30|$|The {{precision}} of tidal parameters {{depends on the}} quality of SG observations, which relates to the station environment and instrument status. For a single tidal wave, the precision is inversely proportional to the wave’s amplitude. The precision for actual SG observations varies significantly between stations. According to previous research (Cui et al. 2014), the standard deviation of the amplitude factor for <b>diurnal</b> <b>waves</b> can achieve Q 1 – 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 4, O 1 – 4 [*]×[*] 10 − 5, P 1 – 9 [*]×[*] 10 − 5, K 1 – 3 [*]×[*] 10 − 5, ψ 1 – 4 [*]×[*] 10 − 3, φ 1 – 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 3, which could represent high precision data in the current global SG stations.

For some stations, the standard deviation could be one or two orders of magnitude larger than above one.|$|R
30|$|The loading {{effects of}} ocean tides on the O 1 and K 1 waves are {{generally}} {{larger than those}} on the P 1 and Q 1 waves as the effects are proportional to the amplitude of these waves. Remarkably, the loading effects, globally, depend on {{the distance between the}} station and the sea or the strength of the oceanic tide around the station. At coastal stations such as Canberra, Kamioka, Matsushiro, TIGO Concepcion and Ny-Alesund, the loading effects are significantly stronger. The results from the offshore Syowa station are extremely large, and possibly inaccurate, as the three newest ocean tide models in this paper offer far larger values than previous models, such as Fes 2004 (Table  2, in Sun et al. 2009). In contrast, inland stations, especially those located in Europe, have much lower loading effects in the diurnal band due to the small adjacent diurnal ocean tides. However, the M 2 wave is very different. The loading effects of the M 2 wave in these European stations are about 2 orders of magnitude larger than those for the K 1 or O 1 waves, whose amplitude are similar to the M 2 wave. This is important as the modulation of M 2 in some European stations is very obvious (Meurers et al. 2016), but <b>diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> modulation is weak.|$|E

MGS constant altitude density data are used, obtaining longitudinal wavelike structures at fixed local times which appear to be dominated by low zonal wave number harmonics. Comparisons with simulated data for different seasons and latitudinal bands at constant altitude are performed. Excellent agreement is obtained between the simulated and observational data for low latitudes, with accuracy in both mean and zonal structure. Higher latitudes show a reduction in agreement between GCM results and MGS data. Comparisons that result in good agreement with the observational data allow for the study of wave composition in the MGS data. In particular, the excellent agreement between the simulations and the data obtained at 115 km during areocentric longitude Ls ≈ 65 ° allows the extraction of the major contributors to the signature, with the eastward propagating diurnal waves of wave numbers one to three being the major players. Significant contributions are also obtained for eastward propagating semidiurnal waves of wave numbers two, three, and five and <b>diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> number five. A sensitivity study is performed to delineate the effects of the near-IR tidal forcing of the upper atmosphere on the wave content at those heights.

40|$|The first long-period ADCP series {{collected}} in two {{locations of the}} salinity front of the Río de la Plata estuary are explored for periods less than 30 hours. Barotropic velocity shows tidal and mean currents consistent with {{what is known about}} the estuarine circulation in tidal and seasonal scales. Baroclinic currents provide the first evidence of the occurrence of internal waves, which can account for half of the total variance. In the northernmost location, predominantly zonal oscillations with semidiurnal period, and oscillations with a dominant meridional component and diurnal period, are found. Whereas the first ones can be related to the semidiurnal tide, the second ones seem to be atmospherically forced by the land/sea breeze. In the southernmost location, more rotational oscillations are observed, with periods around the inertial and diurnal ones. Inertial oscillations could result from wind relaxation, whereas diurnal oscillations also seem to be forced by breeze. Wave activity in the diurnal band was less frequent in the northernmost than in the southernmost location. This can be attributed to less frequent favorable stratification conditions in that area during the observed period. Wave activity in the southernmost location resulted weaker during the observed fall than during the summer. This could be a typical feature given that in autumn both the number of storms destroying the thermolialine structure increases and land/sea breeze is less frequent. This suggests a likely seasonal cycle in the <b>diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> activity in this area, given that those unfavorable conditions are even more marked during winter.

40|$|Studies of {{the daily}} {{variation}} of cosmic ray intensity by power spectral techniques have been essentially limited {{in the past to}} demonstrating the existence of peaks at frequencies corresponding to the 24 -hour (<b>diurnal)</b> <b>wave</b> and its harmonics. The Fourier analysis technique has largely been used in many detailed investigations {{of the daily}} variation. A recent comparative study of both techniques over five solar rotations has revealed the correspondence between the two techniques and the suitability of the power spectral method in relating cosmic ray observations to interplanetary parameters. The study of the daily variation of the cosmic ray intensity over a long interval, extending, for example, over the 11 -year solar cycle, is complicated by other types of superposed variations. An analysis of real data can be considerably facilitated by a power spectral study using simulated input incorporating different artificial but physically based variations. The present study utilizes, in the simulation data, the known average characteristics of the daily variation as well as other variations present in real data. Power spectra are then calculated from a series of test data sets, each of which consists of hourly values for an interval of 27 days. The essential parameters relating to the peaks of the daily variation are tabulated. The study demonstrates the effects of superposed variations (starting from the simple case of a pure sinusoid) on power spectral features. The ambient power (background power level under the diurnal peak) is found to be dependent on the day-to-day phase changes in the daily variation.

Rhea's southern pole was again observed during a more distant (51, 000 km) flyby on 10 th February 2015 during orbit 212. The results show Rhea's southern winter pole {{is one of}} the coldest places directly observed in our Solar System: surface temperatures of 25. 4 +/- 7. 4 K and 24. 7 +/- 6. 8 K are inferred from orbit 183 and 212 data, respectively. The surface temperature of the northern summer pole inferred from orbit 183 data is warmer: 66. 6 +/- 0. 6 K. Assuming the surface thermophysical properties of the two polar regions are comparable then these temperatures can be considered a summer and winter seasonal temperature constraint for the polar region. Orbit 183 will provide solar longitude (LS) coverage at 133 deg and 313 deg for the summer and winter poles respectively, while orbit 212 provides an additional winter temperature constraint at LS 337 deg. Seasonal models with bolometric albedo values between 0. 70 and 0. 74 and thermal inertia values between 1 and 46 J m(exp 2) K(exp 1) s (exp 1 / 2) (otherwise known as MKS units) can provide adequate fits to these temperature constraints (assuming the winter temperature is an upper limit). Both these albedo and thermal inertia values agree within the uncertainties with those previously observed on both Rhea's leading and trailing hemispheres. Investigating the seasonal temperature change of Rhea's surface is particularly important, as the seasonal wave is sensitive to deeper surface temperatures (approximately tens of centimeters to meter depths) than the more commonly reported <b>diurnal</b> <b>wave</b> (typically less than a centimeter), the exact depth difference dependent upon the assumed surface properties. For example, if a surface porosity of 0. 5 and thermal inertia of 25 MKS is assumed then the depth of the seasonal thermal wave is 76 cm, which is much deeper than the approximately 0. 5 cm probed by diurnal studies of Rhea (Howett et al., 2010). The low thermal inertia derived here implies that Rhea's polar surfaces are highly porous even at great depths.

We suggest that the <b>diurnal</b> topographic <b>wave</b> {{can be an effective}} mechanism for cross slope exchange between the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea shelf, and important for benthic and pelagic biological processes on the shelf and slope...|$|R
40|$|Traveling {{disturbance}} {{data obtained}} by Munro (1953, 1958) in Australia are {{used to test the}} concept that thermospheric winds act as a directional filter for gravitational <b>waves.</b> <b>Diurnal</b> contours for winter are presented graphically, showing the number of hours required for gravity waves to reach a height of 300 km...|$|R
40|$|Computations are {{conducted}} for the periods of free modes in the Martian atmosphere {{with a view to}} the short atmospheric radiative damping time and the seasonal and interannual variation of globally representative temperatures, both of which differ from their terrestrial counterparts by an order of magnitude. Attention is given to the possibility of atmospheric resonance and the efficient excitation (or even the resonant amplification) of forced modes. A thermally-forced <b>diurnal</b> Kelvin <b>wave</b> is recommended as the most reasonable of several alternative explanations of the short-period transient mode that occurs just before, or during, Mars' great episodic dust storms...|$|R
40|$|The {{results from}} the {{meteorology}} instruments on the Viking 1 lander are presented for the first 4 sols of operation. The instruments are working satisfactorily. Temperatures fluctuated {{from a low of}} 188 K to an estimated maximum of 244 K. The mean pressure is 7. 65 millibars with a diurnal variation of amplitude 0. 1 millibar. Wind speeds averaged over several minutes have ranged from essentially calm to 9 meters per second. Wind directions have exhibited a remarkable regularity which may be associated with nocturnal downslope winds and gravitational oscillations, or to tidal effects of the <b>diurnal</b> pressure <b>wave,</b> or to both...|$|R
