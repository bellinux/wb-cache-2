In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created, and Kohli, a nine-year-old, was part of its first intake. Kohli's father {{took him to the}} academy after their neighbours suggested that [...] "Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club". Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time. Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, [...] "He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he did and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldn’t leave." [...] In ninth grade, he shifted to Savier Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice. Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as [...] "a bright and alert child". Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.|$|E
2500|$|Although she {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for being forthright and demanding, her behavior during filming of Mr. Skeffington was erratic and out of character. She alienated Vincent Sherman by refusing to film certain scenes and insisting that some sets be rebuilt. She improvised dialogue, causing confusion among other actors, and infuriated the writer, Julius Epstein, who was called upon to rewrite scenes at her whim. Davis later explained her actions with the observation, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> unhappy I lashed out rather than whined." [...] Some reviewers criticized Davis for the excess of her performance; James Agee wrote that she [...] "demonstrates the horrors of egocentricity on a marathonic scale;" [...] but despite the mixed reviews, she received another Academy Award nomination.|$|E
2500|$|When Cave was 9 {{he joined}} the choir of Wangaratta’s Holy Trinity Cathedral. At 13 he was {{expelled}} from Wangaratta High School. In 1970, having moved {{with his family to}} the Melbourne suburb of Murrumbeena, he became a boarder and later day student at Caulfield Grammar School. He was 19 when his father was killed in a car accident; his mother told him of his father's death while she was bailing him out of a St Kilda police station where he was being held on a charge of burglary. He would later recall that his father [...] "died at a point in my life when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> confused" [...] and that [...] "the loss of my father created in my life a vacuum, a space in which my words began to float and collect and find their purpose".|$|E

2500|$|Zuckerberg {{founded the}} Start-up: Education foundation. On September 22, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, [...] "The thing that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate." [...] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously. The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.|$|E
