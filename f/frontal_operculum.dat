Whole brain voxel-based morphometry was performed to identify gray matter (GM) regional differences in 60 individuals with SZ during their first psychotic episode (FE-SZ), 31 individuals at genetic high risk for SZ (GHR-SZ) individuals, and 71 healthy controls. Significant {{differences were found in}} several regions including the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, occipital lobe, and cerebellum among the three groups (p< 0. 05, corrected). Compared to the HC group, the FE-SZ group had significantly decreased GM volumes in several regions including the cerebellum, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri and significantly increased GM volumes in the middle frontal gyrus and inferior <b>operculum</b> <b>frontal</b> gyrus (p< 0. 05).

2500|$|Several brain imaging {{studies using}} {{positron}} emission tomography and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} techniques have shown that higher levels of processing correlate with more brain activity and activity {{in different parts of the}} brain than lower levels.

[...] Similarly, an auditory analysis task showed increased activation in the left inferior prefrontal cortex when subjects performed increasingly semantic word manipulations. [...] Synaptic aspects of word recognition have been correlated with the left <b>frontal</b> <b>operculum</b> and the cortex lining the junction of the inferior frontal and inferior precentral sulcus. [...] The self-reference effect also has neural correlates with a region of the medial prefrontal cortex, which was activated in an experiment where subjects analyzed the relevance of data to themselves.

40|$|Exteroceptive bodily signals (including tactile, {{proprioceptive}} {{and visual}} signals) are important information contributing to self-consciousness. Moreover, prominent theories proposed that visceral signals about internal bodily states are equally {{or even more}} important for self-consciousness. Neuroimaging studies have described several brain regions which process signals related to bodily self-consciousness (BSC) based on the integration of exteroceptive signals (e. g. premotor cortex, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and extrastriate body area), and that another brain region, the insula/operculum which is involved in interoception and interoceptive awareness, processes signals critical for self-awareness. Providing evidence for the integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive bodily signals, recent behavioral experiments have demonstrated that the manipulation of interoceptive (e. g. cardiac) signals, coupled with exteroceptive (e. g. visual) signals, also modulates BSC. Does this integration occur within or outside the structures described above? To this end, we adapted a recently designed protocol that uses cardio-visual stimulation to induce altered states of BSC to fMRI. Additionally, we measured neural activity in a classical interoceptive task. We found six brain regions (bilateral Rolandic operculum, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, right <b>frontal</b> inferior <b>operculum</b> and left temporal superior gyrus) that were activated differently during the interoception task {{as opposed to a}} control task. The brain regions which showed the highest selectivity for BSC based on our cardio-visual manipulation were found in the bilateral Rolandic operculum.

The BOLD responses were minimally affected in areas of chronic diaschisis. Conclusions. Within the confines of this study, the mechanism underlying the BOLD signal, which includes a mismatch between neuronally driven increases in blood flow and a corresponding increase in oxygen use, appears to be intact in areas of chronic diaschisis.

40|$|Background: Frontostriatal and frontoamygdalar {{connectivity}} {{alterations in}} patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been typically described in functional neuroimaging studies. However, structural covariance, or volumetric correlations across distant brain regions, also provides network-level information. Altered structural covariance has been described {{in patients with}} different psychiatric disorders, including OCD, but to our knowledge, alterations within frontostriatal and frontoamygdalar circuits have not been explored. Methods: We performed a mega-analysis pooling structural MRI scans from the Obsessive-compulsive Brain Imaging Consortium and assessed whole-brain voxel-wise structural covariance of 4 striatal regions (dorsal and ventral caudate nucleus, and dorsal-caudal and ventral-rostral putamen) and 2 amygdalar nuclei (basolateral and centromedial-superficial). Images were preprocessed with the standard pipeline of voxel-based morphometry studies using Statistical Parametric Mapping software. Results: Our analyses involved 329 patients with OCD and 316 healthy controls. Patients showed increased structural covariance between the left ventral-rostral putamen and the left inferior <b>frontal</b> gyrus/frontal <b>operculum</b> region. This finding had a significant interaction with age; the association held only in the subgroup of older participants. Patients with OCD also showed increased structural covariance between the right centromedial-superficial amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study. Because this is a multisite data set analysis, participant recruitment and image acquisition were performed in different centres. Most patients were taking medication, and treatment protocols differed across centres. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence for structural network-level alterations in patients with OCD involving 2 frontosubcortical circuits of relevance for the disorder and indicate that structural covariance contributes to fully characterizing brain alterations in patients with psychiatric disorders...|$|R

However, no previous report describes patients who show perseveration only for drawing a human figure. Objective. The present report describes a group of patients who show body awareness-related cognitive impairment during a human figure drawing task, a different presentation from previously described neuropsychological cases.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: It {{is known}} that taste is {{centrally}} represented in the insula, <b>frontal</b> and parietal <b>operculum,</b> {{as well as in}} the orbitofrontal cortex (secondary gustatory cortex). In functional MRI (fMRI) experiments activation in the insula has been confirmed, but activation in the orbitofrontal cortex is only infrequently found, especially at higher field strengths (3 T). Due to large susceptibility artefacts, the orbitofrontal cortex is a difficult region to examine with fMRI. Our aim was to localize taste in the human cortex at 3 T, specifically in the orbitofrontal cortex {{as well as in the}} primary gustatory cortex. METHODS: Event-related fMRI was performed at 3 T in seven healthy volunteers. Taste stimuli consisted of lemon juice and chocolate. To visualize activation in the orbitofrontal cortex a dedicated 3 D SENSE EPI fMRI sequence was used, in addition to a 2 D SENSE EPI fMRI sequence for imaging the entire brain. Data were analyzed using a perception-based model. RESULTS: The dedicated 3 D SENSE EPI sequence successfully reduced susceptibility artefacts in the orbitofrontal area. Significant taste-related activation was found in the orbitofrontal and insular cortices. CONCLUSION: fMRI of the orbitofrontal cortex is feasible at 3 T, using a dedicated sequence. Our results corroborate findings from previous studies. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{category}} differences {{are thought to be}} produced by the adjacent hubs.

40|$|Whereas {{studies of}} somatotopic {{representation}} of touch have been useful to distinguish multiple somatosensory areas within primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex regions, no such analysis exists for {{the representation of}} pain across nociceptive modalities. Here we investigated somatotopy in the operculo-insular cortex with noxious heat and pinprick stimuli in 11 healthy subjects using high-resolution (2 × 2 × 4 mm) 3 T {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Heat stimuli (delivered using a laser) and pinprick stimuli (delivered using a punctate probe) were directed to the dorsum of the right hand and foot in a balanced design. Locations of the peak fMRI responses were compared between stimulation sites (hand vs. foot) and modalities (heat vs. pinprick) within four bilateral regions of interest: anterior and posterior insula and <b>frontal</b> and parietal <b>operculum.</b> Importantly, all analyses were performed on individual, non-normalized fMRI images. For heat stimuli, we found hand-foot somatotopy in the contralateral anterior and posterior insula [hand, 9 ± 10 (SD) mm anterior to foot, P < 0. 05] and in the contralateral parietal operculum (SII; hand, 7 ± 10 mm lateral to foot, P < 0. 05). For pinprick stimuli, we also found somatotopy in the contralateral posterior insula (hand, 9 ± 10 mm anterior to foot, P < 0. 05). Furthermore, the response to heat stimulation of the hand was 11 ± 12 mm anterior to the response to pinprick stimulation of the hand in the contralateral (left) anterior insula (P < 0. 05). These results indicate the existence of multiple somatotopic representations for pain within the operculo-insular region in humans, possibly reflecting its importance as a sensory-integration site that directs emotional responses and behavior appropriately depending on the body site being injured...|$|R
40|$|Temporal 'plus' epilepsies are {{characterized}} by seizures involving a complex epileptogenic network including the temporal lobe and the closed neighboured structures such as the orbito-frontal cortex, the insula, the <b>frontal</b> and parietal <b>operculum</b> and the temporo-parieto-occipital junction. Temporal 'plus' epilepsies are currently identified by means of intracerebral electrodes but whether their diagnosis can be suspected non-invasively has not been evaluated yet. The aim of this retrospective study was {{to address this issue}} in 80 consecutive patients who were thought to suffer from non-lesional temporal lobe seizures which finally proved, on the basis of stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG) recordings, to be 'purely' temporal (TL group, n = 58) or temporal 'plus' (T+ group, n = 22). Our results showed that the two groups of patients were difficult to differentiate on the basis of general clinical features or MRI data. Even the presence of hippocampal sclerosis did not distinguish the two groups. Conversely, both ictal clinical symptoms and scalp-EEG findings significantly differentiated TL from T+ patients. Patients with TL epilepsies more frequently presented an ability to warn at seizure onset (P = 0. 003), an abdominal aura (P = 0. 05), gestural automatisms (P = 0. 04) and a post-ictal amnesia (P = 0. 02). Patients suffering from T+ epilepsies more frequently had gustatory hallucinations (P = 0. 02), rotatory vertigo (P = 0. 02) and auditory illusions (P = 0. 02) at seizure onset; they exhibited more frequently contraversive manifestations of the eyes and/or head (P = 0. 001), piloerection (P = 0. 03) and ipsilateral tonic motor signs (P = 0. 05), and they were more often dysphoric in the post-ictal phase (P = 0. 0001). Cluster analysis mainly indicated that some associations of symptoms were relevant for differentiating TL cases from T+ cases. Interictal EEG of T+ patients more frequently exhibited bilateral or precentral abnormalities, while ictal EEG more frequently pointed over the anterior frontal, temporo-parietal and precentral regions. Neither TL interictal spikes, nor TL ictal EEG onset, allowed us definitely to rule out the possibility of T+ epilepsies. Our findings may be useful for identifying, among patients suffering from 'atypical' non-lesional TL epilepsies, those who should undergo invasive recordings before surgery...|$|R

5000|$|There {{have been}} many studies done to observe the {{functionality}} of the primary gustatory cortex and associated structures with various chemical and electrical stimulations as well as observations of patients with lesions and GC epileptic focus. It {{has been reported that}} electrical stimulation of the lingual nerve, chorda tympani, and a lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve elicit evoked field potential in the <b>frontal</b> <b>operculum.</b> Electrical stimulation of the insula in the human elicit gustatory sensations. Gustatory information is conveyed to the orbitofrontal cortex, the secondary gustatory cortex from the AI/FO. Studies have shown that 8% of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex respond to taste stimuli, and a part of these neurons are finely tuned to particular taste stimuli. It has also been shown in monkeys that the responses of orbitofrontal neurons to taste decreased when the monkey eats to satiety. [...] Furthermore neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex respond to the visual,and/or olfactory stimuli in addition to the gustatory stimulus. These results suggest that gustatory neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex may {{play an important role in}} food identification and selection. A patient study reported that damage in the rostral part of the insula caused gustatory disturbance, as well as taste recognition and intensity deficits in patients with insular cortex lesions. [...] It has also been reported that a patient who had an epileptic focus in the <b>frontal</b> <b>operculum</b> and epileptic activity in the focus produced a disagreeable taste. Activation in the insula also takes place when exposed to gustatory imagery. Studies compared the activated regions in subjects shown food pictures to those shown location pictures and found that food pictures activated the right insula/operculum and the left orbitofrontal cortex.|$|E
50|$|The {{frontal lobe}} {{contains}} the precentral gyrus and prefrontal cortex and, by some conventions, the orbitofrontal cortex. These three areas {{are represented in}} {{both the left and}} the right cerebral hemispheres.The precentral gyrus or primary motor cortex is concerned with the planning, initiation and control of fine motor movements dorsolateral to each hemisphere. The dorsolateral part of the frontal lobe is concerned with planning, strategy formation, and other executive functions. The prefrontal cortex in the left hemisphere is involved with verbal memory while the prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere is involved in spatial memory. The left <b>frontal</b> <b>operculum</b> region of the prefrontal cortex, or Broca's area, is responsible for expressive language, i.e. language production. The orbitofrontal cortex is concerned with response inhibition, impulse control, and social behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Two other {{components}} {{related to the}} frontal lobes contribute to the social behavior of a witzelsucht patient. Previous studies have established a connection with the right hemisphere and emotional responsiveness. The specific anatomical location is still unclear, but it was shown that the right <b>frontal</b> <b>operculum</b> was most relevant in emotional gesturing. This, combined with the dissociation between cognitive and affective stimuli can explain why patients show no reaction to humor. Personality and drawing on past experiences {{have been shown to}} influence humor processing and appreciation. A person may remember past experiences in their own life in order to fully understand a joke in the current context. This remembering of personally experienced events is considered episodic memory, which is processed within the frontal lobes. Additionally, this inability to remember past experiences could also cause a person to forget what is socially appropriate; which could explain why witzelsucht patients sometimes say hypersexual comments in public.|$|E
50|$|The {{gustatory}} cortex is {{the primary}} receptive area for taste. The word taste is used in a technical sense to refer specifically to sensations coming from taste buds on the tongue. The five qualities of taste detected by the tongue include sourness, bitterness, sweetness, saltiness, and the protein taste quality, called umami. In contrast, the term flavor refers to the experience generated through integration of taste with smell and tactile information. The gustatory cortex consists of two primary structures: the anterior insula, located on the insular lobe, and the <b>frontal</b> <b>operculum,</b> located on the frontal lobe. Similarly to the olfactory cortex, the gustatory pathway operates through both peripheral and central mechanisms. Peripheral taste receptors, located on the tongue, soft palate, pharynx, and esophagus, transmit the received signal to primary sensory axons, where the signal is projected to {{the nucleus of the}} solitary tract in the medulla, or the gustatory nucleus of the solitary tract complex. The signal is then transmitted to the thalamus, which in turn projects the signal to several regions of the neocortex, including the gustatory cortex.|$|E
