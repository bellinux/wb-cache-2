30|$|To {{ensure the}} mapping from our {{national}} data to <b>inspire</b> data is efficient and lossless, we conducted the following attribute mapping. First, we identified the attributes in the <b>INSPIRE</b> schema {{that we have}} national data to fulfil. Secondly, we identified the attributes in the <b>INSPIRE</b> schema that can be mapped to a constant value. Thirdly, we identified the attributes in the <b>INSPIRE</b> schema that should refer to the data sets in <b>INSPIRE,</b> for example “CountryCode”. Lastly, there are also quite some “nillable” attributes in the <b>INSPIRE</b> schema {{that we have no}} national data to fulfil. They were defined as xsi:nil[*]=[*]“true” with proper nilReason.|$|R

However, the story artists and animators often disagreed with Woolverton's liberated vision for the character. Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn, the former of whom based the character's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas' ballerinas, Belle's European facial features were <b>inspired</b> by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn.

40|$|The <b>INSPIRE</b> {{directive}} (EC 2007) obligates all EU {{member states}} to support and contribute to a common Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) (Nebert 2004) for Europe that provides integrated geospatial information services. These services should rely mostly on existing geospatial data sources, without significant collection of new data and reengineering of already established databases (<b>INSPIRE</b> 2004). These sources have heterogeneous data models (schemas), which makes them hard to integrate. The schema transformation across various systems is hampered by differences in terminology and conceptualization, particularly when multiple information communities are involved (Schade 2010). The <b>INSPIRE</b> directive stresses the need to address this lack of harmonization between various geospatial datasets and the difficulty in using such datasets. <b>INSPIRE</b> suggests common schemas to be followed, but the major problem is {{how to make the}} existing data sources compatible with <b>INSPIRE</b> Data Specifications (<b>INSPIRE</b> 2009). Manual mapping from national data models to <b>INSPIRE</b> schemas is tedious and error prone.
