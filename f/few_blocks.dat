40|$|Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) is a {{means of}} {{increasing}} the density of hard drives that brings a new set of challenges. SMR drives increase storage density by overlapping the write tracks (shingling) to be as wide as the read head. Due to the nature of SMR disks, updating in place is not an option. Holes left by invalidated data can only be filled if the entire band is reclaimed, and a poor band compaction algorithm could result in {{spending a lot of time}} moving blocks over the lifetime of the device. I propose using write frequency to separate blocks to reduce data movement and provide three band compaction algorithms that implement this heuristic in varying degrees: cold-weight, empty-separation, and separation+cold-weight. I demonstrate that using the techniques from the log-structured file system (LFS) perform worse than the greedy baseline algorithm. I demonstrate how my algorithms provides a reduction in long-term data movement. The cold-weight algorithm results in 1. 81 times <b>fewer</b> <b>blocks</b> moved during required data movements when compared to naive approaches to band management. The empty-separation algorithm results in 135 times <b>fewer</b> <b>blocks</b> moved during required data movements compared to the greedy baseline algorithm. The separation+cold-weight algorithm results in moving up to 319 times <b>fewer</b> <b>blocks</b> during required data movements compared to the greedy baseline algorithm...|$|R

A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E
5|$|After NY448, NY117 {{becomes a}} four-lane, {{undivided}} at-grade street as it heads northeast through a residential area of Mount Pleasant. Just past the NY448 junction, NY117 enters adjacent interchanges with Saw Mill River Road (NY9A and NY100) and the northbound {{direction of the}} Taconic State Parkway near Graham Hills County Park. From here, the highway passes south of Pace University's Pleasantville campus on {{its way into the}} village of Pleasantville, where it narrows to two lanes and initially serves mostly commercial neighborhoods.

50|$|The final {{level is}} a Reed-Solomon code. Reed-Solomon codes are optimal {{in terms of}} {{recovering}} from failures, but slow to generate and recover. Since each level has <b>fewer</b> <b>blocks</b> than the one before, the Reed-Solomon code has {{a small number of}} recovery blocks to generate and to use in recovery. So, even though Reed-Solomon is slow, it only has a small amount of data to handle.|$|R

The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west-east oriented.

It parallels US9 for a couple of blocks, intersecting NY3 (Cornelia Street) just a block west of its eastern terminus at that highway. After Boynton Avenue, the separate streets reunite and turns northwest just before it has its second and final exit with the Northway. Just after the exit, NY374 begins along the westbound route as NY22 turns to the north once again.|$|E
50|$|Pentominoes, {{and similar}} shapes, {{are also the}} basis of a number of other tiling games, {{patterns}} and puzzles.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between April 16, 1991 and September 27, 1991, using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage.

Meyer copied a technique used during filming of Citizen Kane, where the filmmakers let the set fall into darkness to save money on construction. The film was shot in Super 35 instead of anamorphic format, because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.|$|E

As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E
