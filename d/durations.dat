40|$|Two {{experiments}} on <b>duration</b> programming of a discrete sliding movement in choice reactions are reported. In the first experiment it was examined whether <b>duration</b> of movement might be preprogrammed when varied across sessions. The result suggested that programming of movement <b>duration</b> {{is dependent on}} direction uncertainty. Experiment 2 used the movement precue technique {{in an attempt to}} further examine programming of movement <b>duration</b> and direction. Movement <b>duration,</b> movement direction, movement form and foreperiod <b>duration</b> were manipulated. When <b>duration</b> was not precued, a <b>duration</b> effect was found, while precueing resulted in disappearance of the <b>duration</b> effect, demonstrating that <b>duration</b> of sliding movements can be preprogrammed. Moreover, (pre) programming <b>duration</b> was independent of direction uncertainty, supporting an independent order notion of programming of these response variables. Evidence that motor preparation comprises different processing stages was derived from the additive effects of foreperiod <b>duration</b> and of the movement variables <b>duration</b> and direction...|$|R

40|$|Adaptation to the <b>duration</b> of {{a visual}} {{stimulus}} causes the perceived <b>duration</b> of a subsequently presented stimulus {{with a slightly}} different <b>duration</b> to be skewed away from the adapted <b>duration.</b> This pattern of repulsion following adaptation {{is similar to that}} observed for other visual properties, such as orientation, and is considered evidence for the involvement of duration-selective mechanisms in <b>duration</b> encoding. Here, we investigated whether the encoding of <b>duration</b> - by duration-selective mechanisms - occurs early on in the visual processing hierarchy. To this end, we investigated the spatial specificity of the <b>duration</b> after-effect in two experiments. We measured the <b>duration</b> after-effect at adapter-test distances ranging between 0 and 15 Â° of visual angle and for within- and between- hemifield presentations. We replicated the <b>duration</b> after-effect: the test stimulus was perceived to have a longer <b>duration</b> following adaptation to a shorter <b>duration,</b> and a shorter <b>duration</b> following adaptation to a longer <b>duration.</b> Importantly, this <b>duration</b> after-effect occurred at all measured distances, with no evidence for a decrease in the magnitude of the after-effect at larger distances or across hemifields. This shows that adaptation to <b>duration</b> does not result from adaptation occurring early on in the visual processing hierarchy. Instead, it seems likely that <b>duration</b> information is a high-level stimulus property that is encoded later on in the visual processing hierarchy...|$|R

5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free.
