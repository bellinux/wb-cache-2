40|$|Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors ” (the Directive). The Directive {{requires}} {{the development and}} agency implementation of a mandatory, government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal employees and contractors. As required by the Directive, the Department of Commerce issued Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (the Standard). This memorandum provides implementing instructions for the Directive and the Standard. Inconsistent agency approaches to facility security and computer security are inefficient and costly, and increase risks to the Federal government. Successful implementation of the Directive and the Standard will increase the security of your Federal facilities and information systems. As noted in the attached guidance, this standard identification applies to your employees and contractors who work at your facilities or have access to your information systems. Following implementation, Federal departments and agencies {{will be able to}} recognize and accept this common identification standard. It is important to note the use of standard identification <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> <b>your</b> existing law or OMB policy responsibilities; including the laws and policies governing personnel security...|$|E
