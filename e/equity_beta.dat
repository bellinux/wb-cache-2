Second, under 3 different scenarios of changing tax rates (20 %, 25 % and 28 %), we recognized that there is not large disperse in <b>equity</b> <b>beta</b> values, estimated at 0, 109, 0, 108 and 0, 107.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the effect of tax {{convexity}} on firms’ market risk, where tax convexity measures the progressivity of firms’ tax function. We examine the relation between <b>equity</b> <b>beta</b> and tax convexity based on a standard contingent-claims model, in which firms face nonlinear tax schedules. We verify that in the presence of default and growth options, the effect of tax convexity on beta is significant and depends on several countervailing forces. Tax convexity has a direct, positive effect on beta, as well as two indirect countereffects through default and growth options. The overall effect is ambiguous and quantitatively significant. As asymmetric tax schedules are used in most countries, assuming a linear tax schedule in the valuation framework may misestimate beta and thus fail to assess risk accurately. Our theoretical model shows that tax convexity should be taken into consideration when estimating <b>equity</b> <b>beta...</b>|$|E

If market <b>equity</b> <b>beta</b> {{is determined by}} firm characteristics as {{the literature on the}} determinants {{of systematic}} risk holds, and if those characteristics change over the lifecycle of the firm following a definite pattern as firm lifecycle theory suggests, then market <b>equity</b> <b>beta</b> should change over the lifecycle of the firm following a predictable pattern. Our findings indicate that, holding other determinants of beta constant, the coefficient of systematic risk tends to fall in magnitude following a nonlinear pattern as firm age increases. In addition, we find that the volatility of market <b>equity</b> <b>beta</b> also tends to fall over the lifecycle of the firm. We argue that our main variable of concern, i. e. firm age, proxies for variables that have hitherto been omitted in the literature on the determinants of systematic risk. In particular, we maintain that firm age may proxy for the positive reputation that firms acquire over time with shareholders. This research is useful for both practitioners and researchers in that it may suggest ways to adjust empirical estimates of systematic risk. In addition, our results are important for research on beta forecasting as they show that the length of the stationary interval of betas is shorter for young companies, so that beta forecasting may be less accurate for firms {{in the early stages of}} their lifecycle compared to beta forecasting for mature firms...|$|E

40|$|The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) {{is among}} the {{earliest}} and most widely used security valuation models.

The commonly used WACC method fails to recognize the effects of taxation on the risk sharing pattern between the firm and the tax authority and thus is misleading.

However, {{it is impossible to}} find the analytical solutions and the risk neutral valuation method using Monte Carlo simulation, originally developed for derivative pricing in financial markets, can be applied under reasonable assumptions. It is found that the number of periods can increase the risk but still the after-tax betas are significantly lower than the pre-tax cash flows. Under carryforwards tax rule the betas are even lower compared to no-loss-offset rule. Surprisingly, the interest payment from tax authority does not reduce the betas significantly compared to the no interest payment case. The sensitivity test on tax rate also suggests taxation does have a strong effect on the after-tax betas...|$|R
