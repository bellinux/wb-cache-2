To achieve this goal, a safety standard separation distance has been defined : 5 Nm (Nautical miles) horizontally and 1000 feet vertically. Air traffic controllers are responsible for ensuring the respect of these separation rules. Air traffic being constantly increasing, controllers in charge of an aviation sector must handle more and more flights. Nowadays, air-traffic management (ATM) has already used every available ressource to increase airspace capacity.

40|$|With the {{development}} of information and communication technology (ICT), plagiarism becomes an ever more serious problem in the academic community. According to the studies on academic plagiarism conducted at universities in four different European countries, plagiarism rates among students are quite high and students mostly ignore or allow plagiarism {{because of a lack}} of knowledge, lack of consequences, or simply because ICT makes plagiarism easy to commit. The findings of the studies presented in this paper indicate that strict policies against plagiarism need to be introduced at universities. We believe that the problem of plagiarism should be brought to public attention and discussed at a higher level and that effective measures against plagiarism should be implemented. Prevalence of plagiarism among students and their attitudes towards plagiarism are influenced by cultural environment as well as the academic setting. In multicultural communities, such as the European community, it is necessary to investigate and compare academic behaviour in different countries in order to establish <b>equivalent</b> <b>standards</b> in education across Europe...|$|E

Minorities including African-American and Latino students ’ standardized test scores are much lower than white students.

By eighth grade, they have slipped three years behind, and by twelfth grade, four years behind (Columbia University, 2005). Students ’ socioeconomic backgrounds and teachers ’ racial expectations are two factors that contribute to the academic achievement gap. In order to close the gap, there must be <b>equivalent</b> <b>standards</b> and expectations for high and low achieving schools, as well as regular evaluation of instruction. Creating rigorous curricula for all students and helping students catch up by offering “tried and true” intervention programs will assist in the closure of American’s racial academic achievement gap...|$|E

The performance of charge nurses and sisters in the villas was similar to that of junior nursing staff, but the wardens and deputies of the locally-based hospital units spent little time contacting clients. Given higher staff/client ratios, there were greater numbers of staff in the locally-based hospital units contacting clients and handling materials designed for their use, thus showing that <b>equivalent</b> <b>standards</b> of staff performance can be attained in alternatives to large mental handicap hospitals.

40|$|Communications in {{coal mines}} are poor by general {{industry}} standards, and generate significant risks in {{the lack of}} information available from underground areas. Mines often employ multiple incompatible systems for communication. This report concludes that there is no technical barrier to the upgrading of coal mine communications to <b>equivalent</b> <b>standards</b> of those used by general commercial and industrial organisations. The greatest needs are for a system that has a common standard, has wide band capacity, and allows for easy connectivity for sub-networks which are customised for specific applications. Mines are vulnerable in times of emergency, as traditional communications systems may fail. A new emergency communication system LAMPS {{has the potential to be}} integrated into a mine communications network, but still retains functionality following a major incident in the mine. An improved communications system would allow real time risk assessment to be carried out at the mine, and the requirements for monitoring, assessment and decision making have been investigated for some common hazards. These include ventilation issues, strata control and emergency response. This would incorporate the latest technologies in safety management and real time risk assessment, using computerbased assessment, assisted decision making, and virtual reality. ...|$|E
40|$|The UGY 1088 MMIC is {{a device}} which covers all {{push-pull}} applications. Dependent {{on the application}} circuit, the gain can be set between 21 dB and 35 dB power gain with a flat power gain response and excellent input and output return loss over the 40 MHz to 1003 MHz frequency range. It is especially suited for CATV amplifiers. The UGY 1088 is a highly linear, monolithic GaAs RF amplifier that has been developed to replace standard CATV hybrid amplifiers. Offered in a HVQFN 32 surface mount package, the MMIC consists of 3 stages of balanced amplifiers that are optimized for exceptionally low distortion and noise figure. The flat power gain response and excellent input and output return loss over the 40 MHz to 1003 MHz CATV downstream band is formed when one UGY 1088 is cascaded between transmission line baluns. The gain level is set by the external feedback circuit in the final MMIC application. CAUTION This device is sensitive to ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD). Observe precautions for handling electrostatic sensitive devices. Such precautions are described in the ANSI/ESD S 20. 20, IEC/ST 61340 - 5, JESD 625 -A or <b>equivalent</b> <b>standards.</b> 1. 2 Features and benefit...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{on-going}} {{controversy about}} the impact of competing committee standards – i. e., two or more functionally equivalent ‘open’ standards – on innovation (Blind, 2008; Egyedi and Koppenhol, 2010; West and Fomin, 2011). This paper takes a different angle and focuses on its impact on interoperability (e. g. e-government) and large IT users such as public authorities, in particular. Moreover, it extends the notion of ‘competing standards’ to include standards change (i. e., different standards versions) as a source of competition next to standards wars. The conceptual framework on economic functions of committee standards (i. e. information, compatibility, variety reduction; Blind, 2004) is used to analyse relevant literature and reason {{about the impact}} of single and multiple competing standards. An economic equation is formulated to capture the cumulative and dynamic effects of competing standards on interoperability. The literature and theoretical findings indicate that it would be difficult and costly for public authorities to sustain commitment for supporting two or more functionally <b>equivalent</b> <b>standards</b> and maintain long-term interoperability. In the light of the scientific controversy, the paper concludes that tension between innovation and interoperabilit...|$|E

As a result the EU ROs Mutual Recognition (MR) scheme was initiated. This paper investigates the current implementation of the requirements of Article 10 through a developed questionnaire and case studies.
