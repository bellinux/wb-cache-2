40|$|Efficiencym costs saving, and {{environmental}} friendly are the challanges must {{be faced by}} the engineers of oil refinery plant. one of the effective solutions is the process integration that not only can be applied on the grassroots industries but also to retrofit the old ones. This study is aimed to identify the energy savings by integrating the heat system of turbine gas and <b>fired</b> <b>heater</b> of crude distiller unit (CDU) at Indonesia's oil refinery plant, through pinch analysis method. By routing the oxygen contain of the excess of exhaust gas turbine into <b>fired</b> <b>heater,</b> the heat load in <b>fired</b> <b>heater</b> will reduce and the heat of exhaust gas will minimize the heat needs for combustion. The adding of 10 % of fuel flowrate into gas turbine chamber will reduce 54. 9 % of the oil consumption in <b>fired</b> <b>heater...</b>|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{integration}} of subsystems {{results in an}} energy-efficient and cost-effective design of the overall system. In many industrial applications, heat transfer fluid (HTF) is used to supply required amount of heat to multiple heat demands from a single heat source. Appropriate {{integration of}} <b>fired</b> <b>heater</b> with a process leads to overall reduction in energy requirement as well as capital investment. In this paper, four methodologies are developed to integrate <b>fired</b> <b>heater</b> appropriately with a process. Firstly, a targeting methodology is proposed to determine the minimum HTF flow rate to supply heat from single heater to multiple heat demands. Secondly, a methodology to integrate radiant <b>fired</b> <b>heater</b> with a process through HTF is discussed. Thirdly, indirect integration of <b>fired</b> <b>heater,</b> incorporating energy recovery from flue gas through the air preheater, is developed. Finally, improvement of overall energy efficiency by utilizing process heat below pinch through air preheating is demonstrated. It is also illustrated {{that the number of}} <b>fired</b> <b>heater</b> can be reduced, and hence, the total cost of the system can also be reduced by indirect integration.

50|$|In {{industrial}} <b>fired</b> <b>heaters,</b> {{power plant}} steam generators, and large gas-fired turbines, {{the more common}} terms are percent excess combustion air and percent stoichiometric air. For example, excess combustion air of 15 percent means that 15 {{percent more than the}} required stoichiometric air (or 115 percent of stoichiometric air) is being used.|$|E
50|$|Finch {{recognized}} that when tobacco curing barns switched from wood to gas or oil <b>fired</b> <b>heaters</b> in the 1940s, bluebirds {{were attracted to}} the metal vent pipes with rain caps as potential nesting sites. Millions of bluebirds became trapped in the pipes and the combustion chambers to starve. As many as 20 dead bluebirds were found when the burners were cleaned. The eastern bluebird was virtually extirpated from tobacco producing areas in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|In the Oil and Gas, Petrochemical and Oil Refining industries, Liquid-Gas {{coalescers}} {{are widely}} used to remove water and hydrocarbon liquids to <0.011 ppmw (plus particulate matter to <0.3 um in size) from natural gas to ensure natural gas quality and protect downstream equipment such as compressors, gas turbines, amine or glycol absorbers, molecular sieves, PSA's, metering stations, mercury guard beds, gas <b>fired</b> <b>heaters</b> or furnaces, heat exchangers or gas-gas purification membranes.|$|E

50|$|Following the desalter, {{the crude}} oil is further heated by exchanging heat {{with some of}} the hot, {{distilled}} fractions and other streams. It is then heated in a fuel-fired furnace (<b>fired</b> <b>heater)</b> to a temperature of about 398 °C and routed {{into the bottom of the}} distillation unit.|$|R
50|$|An {{industrial}} furnace or direct <b>fired</b> <b>heater,</b> is an equipment {{used to provide}} heat for a process or can serve as reactor which provides heats of reaction. Furnace designs vary as to its function, heating duty, type of fuel and method of introducing combustion air. However, most process furnaces have some common features.|$|R
50|$|Onshore {{terminals}} {{generally have}} <b>fired</b> <b>heaters</b> followed by separators and coalescers to stabilise the crude and remove any produced water not separated offshore. Onshore separators tend {{to operate at}} a lower pressure than the offshore separators and so more gas is evolved. The associated gas is generally compressed, dew-pointed and exported via a dedicated pipeline. If gas export is uneconomical then it may be flared. Onshore terminals frequently have large crude oil storage tanks to allow offshore production to continue if the export route becomes unavailable. Export to the oil refinery is either by pipeline or tanker.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{as a form}} {{of energy}} that is {{transferred}} from one body to another results in a difference in temperature. This reduces surface tension and viscosity of the oil and thus assists in releasing gas that is hydraulically retained in the oil. The most effective method of heating crude oil is to pass it through a heated-water bath. A spreader plate that disperses the oil into small streams or rivulets increases the effectiveness of the heated-water bath. Upward flow of the oil through the water bath affords slight agitation, which is helpful in coalescing and separating entrained gas from the oil. A heated-water bath is probably the most effective method of removing foam bubbles from foaming crude oil. A heated-water bath is not practical in most oil and gas separators, but heat can be added to the oil by direct or indirect <b>fired</b> <b>heaters</b> and/or heat exchangers, or heated free-water knockouts or emulsion treaters can be used to obtain a heated-water bath.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{efficiencies}} {{of water}} heaters in residential use can vary greatly, particularly depending on manufacturer and model. However, electric heaters {{tend to be}} slightly more efficient (not counting power station losses) with recovery efficiency (how efficiently energy transfers to the water) reaching about 98%. Gas <b>fired</b> <b>heaters</b> have maximum recovery efficiencies of only about 82-94% (the remaining heat is lost with the flue gasses). Overall energy factors can be as low as 80% for electric and 50% for gas systems. Natural gas and propane tank water heaters with energy factors of 62% or greater, as well as electric tank water heaters with energy factors of 93% or greater, are considered high-efficiency units. Energy Star-qualified natural gas and propane tank water heaters (as of September 2010) have energy factors of 67% or higher, which is usually achieved using an intermittent pilot together with an automatic flue damper, baffle blowers, or power venting. Direct electric resistance tank water heaters {{are not included in}} the Energy Star program, however, the Energy Star program does include electric heat pump units with energy factors of 200% or higher. Tankless gas water heaters (as of 2015) must have an energy factor of 90% or higher for Energy Star qualification. Since electricity production in thermal plants has efficiency levels ranging from only 15% to slightly over 55% (combined cycle gas turbine), with around 40% typical for thermal power stations, direct resistance electric water heating may be the least energy efficient option. However, use of a heat pump can make electric water heaters much more energy efficient and lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, even more so if a low carbon source of electricity is used.|$|E

40|$|Total site {{integration}} {{across many}} process plants {{can result in}} substantial energy conservation. Indirect integration through an intermediate fluid to transfer heat from one process to the other is widely practiced.

The site grand composite curve represents the total utility requirement at any temperature after achieving maximum integration between different processes through intermediate fluid. However, the choice of intermediate fluid influences the overall site grand composite curve.
