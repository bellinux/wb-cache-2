5|$|<b>Earwigs</b> are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, {{and like many}} other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon <b>earwigs.</b> Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of <b>earwigs</b> for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of <b>earwigs,</b> Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon <b>earwigs</b> when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize <b>earwigs</b> that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on <b>earwigs.</b> The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other <b>earwigs.</b> A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common <b>earwigs,</b> sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet acarine mites on European <b>earwigs.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Earwigs</b> {{are mostly}} nocturnal and often hide in small, moist crevices during the day, and are active at night, feeding {{on a wide}} variety of insects and plants. Damage to foliage, flowers, and various crops is {{commonly}} blamed on <b>earwigs,</b> especially the common earwig Forficula auricularia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Earwigs</b> {{have five}} molts {{in the year}} before they become adults. Many earwig species display {{maternal}} care, which is uncommon among insects. Female <b>earwigs</b> may care for their eggs, and even after they have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show.|$|E
50|$|Species in this include Forficula auricularia (the European <b>earwig</b> or common <b>earwig)</b> and Apterygida media (the short-winged <b>earwig</b> or hop-garden <b>earwig).</b>|$|R

50|$|Apterygida {{media is}} {{a species of}} European <b>earwig,</b> known as the short-winged <b>earwig</b> or hop-garden <b>earwig.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Earwigs</b> {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that <b>earwigs</b> crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Few <b>earwigs</b> survive winter {{outdoors}} in cold climates. They {{can be found}} in tight crevices in woodland, fields and gardens. Out of about 1,800 species, about 25 occur in North America, 45 in Europe (including 7 in Great Britain), and 60 in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>earwigs</b> are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, {{living in}} small amounts of debris, in various forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species {{have been found to}} be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous; {{reported}} to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of <b>earwigs</b> can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.|$|E
50|$|Forficula lesnei, or Lesne's <b>earwig,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>earwig</b> from Europe, {{particularly}} Britain. Compared to the common <b>earwig,</b> Lesne's <b>earwig</b> is shorter, with a body length around 8 mm. It can be found dwelling on the shrub Clematis vitalba.|$|R
50|$|The Saint Helena <b>earwig</b> or Saint Helena giant <b>earwig</b> (Labidura herculeana) {{was a large}} {{species of}} <b>earwig</b> endemic to the oceanic island of Saint Helena in the south Atlantic Ocean. It is now {{considered}} extinct.|$|R
50|$|The ringlegged <b>earwig</b> (Euborellia annulipes) is {{a species}} of <b>earwig</b> in the family Anisolabididae.|$|R
5|$|Other orders {{such as the}} Dermaptera (<b>earwigs),</b> Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets), Mantodea (praying mantis) and Blattodea (cockroaches) have rigid {{leathery}} forewings that aren't flapped while flying, {{sometimes called}} tegmen (pl. tegmina), elytra, or pseudoelytron.|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine {{system is}} typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal ganglion, three {{thoracic}} ganglia, and six abdominal ganglia. Strong neuron connections connect the neurohemal corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal ganglion, where the closely related median corpus allatum produces juvenile hormone III {{in close proximity to}} the neurohemal dorsal arota. The digestive system of <b>earwigs</b> is like all other insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and hindgut, but <b>earwigs</b> lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect. Long, slender (extratory) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut.|$|E
5|$|Timema spp. {{differ from}} other Phasmatodea in that their tarsi have three {{segments}} rather than five. For stick insects, they have relatively small, stout bodies, {{so that they}} look somewhat like <b>earwigs</b> (order Dermaptera).|$|E
50|$|Anisolabis subarmata, {{commonly}} known as the Christmas Island <b>earwig,</b> is a species of <b>earwig</b> in the family Anisolabididae.|$|R
50|$|Labia minor, {{the lesser}} <b>earwig</b> or small <b>earwig,</b> is {{a species of}} <b>earwig.</b> It is {{widespread}} globally in temperate climates, preferring warm locations such as compost heaps in parts of its range. It is 4-7 mm long, including the pincer, and chocolate brown in color.|$|R
25|$|Forficula auricularia, {{the common}} <b>earwig</b> or European <b>earwig,</b> is an {{omnivorous}} insect {{in the family}} Forficulidae. The European <b>earwig</b> survives {{in a variety of}} environments and is a common household insect in North America. The name <b>earwig</b> comes from the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded; the species name of the common <b>earwig,</b> auricularia, is a specific reference to this feature. However, they are considered a pest because of the damage they do to crops, their frightening appearance, their ability to fly (which they rarely use), foul odor, and tendency to invade crevices in homes and consume pantry foodstuffs.|$|R
5|$|<b>Earwigs</b> {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to <b>earwigs</b> is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Some earwig {{specimen}} fossils {{are in the}} extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera, {{the former}} dating to the Late Triassic and the latter to the Middle Jurassic. Many orders of insect have been theorized to be closely related to <b>earwigs,</b> though the icebugs of Grylloblattaria are most likely.|$|E
5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged <b>earwigs,</b> the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E
50|$|Anisolabis pacifica, {{commonly}} known as the Pacific <b>earwig,</b> is a species of <b>earwig</b> in the genus Anisolabis, the family Anisolabididae, the suborder Forficulina, and the order Dermaptera.|$|R
50|$|Growing {{as large}} as 84 mm long (including forceps), the Saint Helena <b>earwig</b> was the world's largest <b>earwig.</b> It is shiny black with reddish legs, short elytra and no hind wings.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} 9 {{families}} in this suborder. The best known species is Forficula auricularia, the European <b>earwig,</b> {{also known as the}} Common <b>earwig,</b> which is in the family Forficulidae.|$|R
5|$|<b>Earwigs</b> {{are mostly}} scavengers, {{but some are}} {{omnivorous}} or predatory. The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing the forceps. The forceps are used {{for a variety of}} purposes. In some species, the forceps have been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and <b>earwigs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} of insects {{and other small}} arthropods. One study of red-capped robin faeces conducted near Kambalda, Western Australia, revealed 96% of their diet {{was made up of}} beetles, while ants made up the remainder. Other prey recorded include spiders, and insects such as grasshoppers including the Australian Plague Locust (Chortoicetes terminifera), adult and larval butterflies and moths, including geometer moths, dragonflies and damselflies, mantises, antlions, true bugs, including chinch bugs of the family Lygaeidae and shield bugs, various types of beetles, <b>earwigs,</b> and flies such as blow-flies and horse-flies.|$|E
50|$|Doru aculeatum, the spine-tailed <b>earwig,</b> is {{an insect}} {{in the family}} Forficulidae. This <b>earwig</b> {{is found in the}} woods and grassy areas of eastern North America and occurs at outdoor lights at night.|$|R
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of <b>earwig</b> species are in Forficulina, grouped into nine families of 180 genera, including Forficula auricularia, the common European <b>Earwig.</b> Species within Forficulina are free-living, have functional wings and are not parasites. The cerci are unsegmented and modified into large, forceps-like structures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Earwig!</b> Tuam Community Arts Group {{was formed}} in October 2003 to provide Tuam and its {{surroundings}} with an outlet for its creative talent. Since 2003, the group has organised the <b>Earwig!</b> Tuam Arts Festival which includes visual arts, theatre, drama, spectacle, children's arts workshops, street performance and music. The festival has now established itself {{as one of the}} highlights of the West of Ireland's arts scene. <b>Earwig!</b> also takes part in the annual St. Patrick's Day parade in Tuam with an emphasis on bringing movement and spectacle.|$|R
5|$|The grey currawong is an {{omnivorous}} and opportunistic feeder. It preys on many invertebrates, such as snails, spiders and woodlice, and a {{wide variety}} of insects including beetles, <b>earwigs,</b> cockroaches, wasps, ants and grasshoppers, and smaller vertebrates, including frogs, lizards such as the bearded dragon as well as skinks, rats, mice, and nestlings or young of Tasmanian nativehen, red wattlebird, eastern spinebill, house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and splendid fairywren (M. splendens), It has been recorded hunting at the nests of the superb fairywren (Malurus cyaneus), and the bell miner (Manorina melanophrys).|$|E
5|$|<b>Earwigs</b> are {{abundant}} {{and can be}} found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{is largely}} insectivorous and feeds on both pest and other arthropods. The food range includes spiders, crane flies, moths, mayflies, dragonflies, damsel flies, grasshoppers, <b>earwigs,</b> lacewings, caddisflies, flies, beetles, sawflies, bees, wasps and ants. Prey are consumed in both adult and larvae stages of development, and common starlings will also feed on earthworms, snails, small amphibians and lizards. While {{the consumption of}} invertebrates is necessary for successful breeding, common starlings are omnivorous and can also eat grains, seeds, fruits, nectar and food waste if the opportunity arises. The Sturnidae differ from most birds in that they cannot easily metabolise foods containing high levels of sucrose, although they can cope with other fruits such as grapes and cherries. The isolated Azores subspecies of the common starling eats the eggs of the endangered roseate tern. Measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the terns return to their breeding colonies in spring.|$|E
50|$|Forficula decipiens is {{a species}} of <b>earwig.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Earwig</b> Music Company is an American {{blues and}} jazz {{independent}} record label, founded by Michael Frank in October 1978 in Chicago. Since its founding, <b>Earwig</b> Music has issued 66 albums, fifty-one produced by Frank, {{among them the}} last recordings of Louis Myers, Maxwell Street Jimmy Davis, and Willie Johnson.|$|R
