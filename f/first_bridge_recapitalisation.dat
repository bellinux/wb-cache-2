50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> {{over the}} river was opened in 1934 near Litli Dímon. It is 242 meters long and {{was at the time}} the longest bridge in Iceland. A second bridge was built in 1978 at Emstrur. A third bridge was opened in 1992 a few {{kilometers}} south of the <b>first</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was built}} in 1715-16 by order of Peter the Great, and named after its engineer, Mikhail Anichkov. The bridge was made of wood with several spans built on piles of {{supports}} lying just above the Fontanka River. It was designed by Domenico Trezzini. Nothing remains of this <b>first</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> was {{constructed}} with two stone arches {{at each end}} and seven timber arches in between, which proved costly to maintain {{and as a consequence}} the bridge only lasted 30 years. In 1782 Robert Tunstall, son of the builder of the <b>first</b> <b>bridge,</b> obtained consent to replace the bridge and work began on 4 June 1783, the anniversary date of the <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> opening to the public. The new bridge was designed by James Paine who had previously been responsible for Richmond Bridge. The cost was £16,500 which was raised by means of a tontine.|$|R

50|$|In 1836, the <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was built}} by the Dingmans. Under the terms of its charter, churchgoers, schoolchildren, and funeral processions were given free passage, a {{condition}} that is still in effect today. The <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> lasted until 1847 when high water washed away the Milford Bridge upstream and swept the debris into Dingman's Bridge.|$|R

40|$|The <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> {{diagrams}} of {{the classical}} theory of liquids are discussed for two fluids of Lennard-Jones spheres and for a fluid of a two-centre Lennard-Jones model of liquid bromine. The bridge diagram of liquid bromine is calculated using a biased Monte-Carlo method. We investigate the <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> diagrams, the bonds of which are either Mayer functions f or total correlation functions h. The Mayer f-bond representation leads to very high values of the <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> diagram, {{which can not be}} used alone in a truncated expansion of the diagrammatic series of the bridge function. We analyse the origin of these high values. In the case of the h-function representation, the bridge function series truncated to the sole <b>first</b> <b>bridge</b> diagram is introduced into the closure of the Ornstein-Zernike equation and leads to some improvement of the pair distribution function upon the HNC result, as compared to the exact simulated values...|$|R
