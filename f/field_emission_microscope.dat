5000|$|Müller {{was born}} in Berlin, where he studied at the Technical University under Gustav Hertz. He {{received}} his degree in engineering in 1935 and his doctorate in 1936. Müller worked at the Siemens Research Laboratory, where he invented the <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> <b>microscope</b> in 1936 that allowed resolutions of 2 nanometers.|$|E
50|$|High Field Consultants {{has created}} a museum to {{preserve}} {{the legacy of the}} <b>Field</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>Microscope</b> and its progenies, the Field Ion Microscope and the Atom-Probe. The <b>Field</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>Microscope</b> was introduced in 1936. It was the first microscope to achieve nanometer resolution. In 1951 its progeny; the Field Ion Microscope, was introduced and in 1956 it became the first microscope to image isolated atoms on a metal surface. In 1967 the Atom-Probe Field Ion Microscope was introduced and extended the capability of the microscope by determining the chemical identity of the imaged atoms. In 1973 the paradigm shifted away from the Field Ion Microscope with the introduction of the 10 cm Atom Probe. Patented and dubbed the Imaging Atom-Probe in 1975, it became the progenitor of future atom probes. Today, the Atom-Probe is a commercial tool in the arsenal of instruments used to develop new materials for technology and industry.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in the 1970s and {{continuing}} {{to the present day}} commercial electron microscopes were developed based on Crewe’s innovations. These systems enabled significant advances in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries.Hitachi Corporation produced the first successful commercial version of the <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> scanning electron <b>microscope</b> in 1970 which received an IEEE Milestone award in 2012. [...] Crewe was a consultant to Hitachi in this effort. Since that time Hitachi has produced over 5300 cold <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> Scanning Electron <b>Microscopes</b> and over 4000 (Schottky) thermal <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> scanning electron <b>microscopes.</b> They are considered the highest resolution instruments available and cost over one million USD each to build. Today there are over 5000 <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> <b>microscopes</b> operational in semiconductor fabrication facilities worldwide, enabling companies like Intel and IBM to produce the latest and fastest microprocessors.|$|R

Raman microscope (Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRam HR 800 with excitation wavelength of 632.8  nm) was employed to characterize graphene coating.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Field</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>Microscope</b> {{consists}} of a metallic sample {{in the form of}} a sharp tip and a conducting fluorescent screen enclosed in ultrahigh vacuum. The tip radius used is typically of the order of 100 nm. It is composed of a metal with a high melting point, such as tungsten. The sample is held at a large negative potential (1-10 kV) relative to the fluorescent screen. This gives the electric field near the tip apex to be the order of 1010 V/m which is high enough for field emission of electrons to take place. Fig.1 shows the experimental set up for FEM.|$|E

Smith {{graduated}} from Oxford with a metallurgy degree in 1965, and did postgraduate {{work in the}} Chemistry Department, where he used the <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> <b>microscope</b> and the field ion microscope to study the epitaxial growth of nickel on tungsten.Smith returned to the Department of Materials [...] where {{he worked as a}} Postdoctoral Research Fellow with Sir Peter Hirsch to establish a research group for metallurgical field ion microscopy. He led the Oxford research group where Cerezo, Smith, and Godfrey developed novel atom probe techniques for the direct observation of solid materials in three dimensions on the atomic scale.

40|$|Goal was to {{determine}} the field emission of laser-ablated hard carbon coatings. The coatings, deposited on Mo tip arrays, were found (with ion <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> <b>microscope)</b> to have excellent Fowler-Nordheim behavior: plots of the logarithm of emission current divided by voltage squared vs inverse of voltage are linear. This indicates the tips are operating as field emitters. Field emission current of as-coated tip arrays was lower than uncoated tips; this disagrees with observations in literature. Hydrogen plasma cleaning was studied. Cleaned, laser-ablated carbon coatings of field emission tips have two benefits: the emission current increases at fixed voltage, and stability of the emission increases. These results would be advantageous for field emission flat panel displays...|$|E

40|$|It is {{reported}} that lattice imaging with a 300 kV <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> <b>microscope</b> {{in combination with}} numerical reconstruction procedures {{can be used to}} reach an interpretable resolution of about 80 pm for the first time. A retrieval of the electron exit wave from focal series allows for the resolution of single atomic columns of the light elements carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen at a projected nearest neighbor spacing down to 85 pm. Lens aberrations are corrected on-line during the experiment and by hardware such that resulting image distortions are below 80 pm. Consequently, the imaging can be aberration-free to this extent. The resolution enhancement results from increased electrical and mechanical stability of the instrument coupled with a low spherical aberration coefficient of 0. 595 + 0. 005 mm.

40|$|Methods are {{developed}} to describe catalytic reactions on multi-facetted surfaces in high electric {{fields in the}} conditions of field emission microscopy. These methods are applied to the hydrogen–oxygen–rhodium system for which a mean-field kinetic model is established. This model is shown to reproduce not only the nonequilibrium regimes of bistability and oscillations and their nanopatterns, but also the temperatureprogrammed desorption spectra of hydrogen and oxygen on rhodium, {{as well as the}} equilibrium phase diagram of oxygen on rhodium with the transition to the trilayer surface oxide ORhO. The dependence of the kinetic constants on the surface orientation of the facets is taken into account by expanding them in kubic harmonics suitable for the fcc rhodium crystal. The electric field modifies the gas pressure as well as the activation energies of the different kinetic processes.
