50|$|Some Italian Renaissance portraits {{thought to}} be of {{pregnant}} women show them wearing a gauzy underdress called a guarnello, often associated with pregnancy or the period after childbirth. These include Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, where the garment first became visible under <b>infra-red</b> <b>scans</b> in 2006, suggesting that Lisa del Giocondo, the sitter, was pregnant or {{just had a baby}} when she was painted. Another painting with a guarnello is Botticelli's Portrait of a Lady Known as Smeralda Brandini, where the sitter also holds a hand over the top of her bump. This is a feature seen in many images such as Visitation scenes where pregnancy is certain, and that probably indicates it in cases where it is much less clear, including some portraits by Anthony van Dyck. La Donna Gravida ("The Pregnant Lady") by Raphael is another example, with an apparently pregnant woman sitting with her left hand over her stomach, but such depictions remained infrequent in Renaissance art.|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} {{is made of}} how heat flux {{might be used to}} infer gas fluxes from municipal solid waste landfills. Thermodynamic principles are used to estimate the amount of heat generated per mole of anaerobically-produced methane gas. An equation is derived to relate a landfill's surface flux of methane to its flux of heat. A closed landfill in Christchurch, New Zealand, is used to demonstrate how the equation might be applied. An <b>infra-red</b> <b>scan</b> of the landfill by helicopter noted higher temperatures at the surface of one portion of the landfill. At six sites in that portion of the landfill, thermistor-fitted probes were driven to one meter depth and soil temperatures monitored. An estimate of methane flux from heat measurements is compared to an estimate based on literature and site-specific information. The two methods give similar results. Variability in the heat flux measured at the landfill raises concerns about the difficulties that might arise in attempts to improve the reliability of this new method of estimating methane generation rates. The ease of temperature monitoring suggests that further investigation of the technology is warranted...|$|R

The addition of bagasse nanofibres (2. 5 to 20 wt%) to modified potato starch (i. e. soluble starch) reduced the moisture uptake by up to 17 % at 58 % relative humidity. The film’s tensile strength and Young’s modulus increased by up to 100 % (3. 1 to 6. 2 MPa) and 300 % (66. 3 to 198. 3 MPa) respectively with 10 and 20 wt% fibre addition. However, the strain at yield dropped by 50 % for the film containing 10 wt% fibre. Models for composite materials were used to account for the strong interactions between the nanofibres and the starch matrix. The storage and loss moduli as well as the glass transition temperature (Tg) obtained from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, were increased with the starch-nanofibre films indicating decreased starch chain mobility due to the interacting effect of the nanofibres.

40|$|Polymer biostability {{is one of}} the {{critical}} parameters by which these materials are selected for use as biomedical devices. This is the major rationale for the use of polymers which are highly crystalline and stiff namely expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and Dacron in particular, as arterial bypass grafts. While this is immaterial in high-flow states, it becomes critically important at lower flows with a greater need for more compliant vessels. Polyurethanes being one of the most compliant polymers known are as such, the natural choice to build such constructs. However, concerns regarding their resistance to degradation have limited their use as vascular prostheses and in order to augment their strength, herein a novel polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane integrated poly(carbonate-urea) urethane (POSS-PCU) nanocomposite was synthesised by our group.

40|$|MIPAS is a limb viewing fourier {{transform}} spectrometer {{operating in the}} <b>infra-red.</b> It <b>scans</b> the tangent altitude range 6 - 68 km at a vertical resolution of approximately 3 km. CO has various natural and anthropogenic sources including forest fires and industry. In the troposphere, CO is the main sink of the principal oxidising agent - the hydroxyl radical - and so reduces its capacity {{for the removal of}} other atmospheric pollutants. In the stratosphere, its intermediate lifetime makes it useful as a tracer for stratospheric motions and processes of tropospheric-stratospheric exchange. However, the retrieval of CO from a limb sounding IR instrument is complicated because of non-LTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) effects. Ordinarily, the internal vibrational energy level populations are controlled by collisions between molecules and follow the translational (kinetic) energy distribution of the ambient gas (LTE). However, if collisions are infrequent, radiative processes can lead to a non-Boltzmann distribution of the internal energy level populations (non-LTE). CO is strongly affected by non-LTE in the IR down to around 40 km and modelling these processes is difficult. These effects are especially problematic in the limb viewing geometry due to the long path length viewed through the upper atmosphere. However, using a joint CO, vibrational temperature (Tv) retrieval it is possible to estimate the non-LTE effects without modelling the energy level populations. Instead, we retrieve a parameterisation of the non-LTE effects, Tv, directly from the emission spectra...|$|R

As long as the fiber tip does not contact tissue, it remains in near pristine condition and transmits the laser light to cause a photocoagulative tissue effect. Once the tip contacts tissue; however, degradation of the tip occurs and transmission of the laser energy is decreased. The laser energy is absorbed at the contact tip causing it to heat up. In this condition the tip can only be used for tissue incision or ablation. The process of damaging the tip has been termed as burn-in. The longer the fiber tip is in contact with tissue, the more damage it accumulates such as spalling or melting. Catastrophic damage of the silica fiber tip is an unwanted event during laser surgery. Ideally, a laser optical fiber should remain stable when contacting tissue, that is, never burn-in;The first detailed study {{has been made of}} silica laser surgical fibers and their interaction with tissue. Silica optical fibers were lased in chicken and beef tissue using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser at powers from 5 to 50 Watts and in a pulsed mode. The silica fiber tips were then characterized using surface reflectance <b>infra-red</b> spectroscopy, <b>scanning</b> electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Using the information obtained from the degradation of silica optical fibers, a new laser optical fiber was then developed and its potential as a surgical optical fiber was investigated using the same investigative techniques mentioned above. Also, alternatives to laser fiber optic delivery systems were investigated. These included alternative materials to the sapphire contact probes, and the feasibility of diamond coating existing silica optical fibers...|$|R
