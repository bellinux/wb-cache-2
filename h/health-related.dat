5|$|In the {{interests}} of standardising <b>health-related</b> units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the curie (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides; the becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Mexico, Honduras's {{government}} provided {{food and}} shelter for its citizens, {{but was unable to}} properly address <b>health-related</b> needs. As a result, the Save the Children Fund provided $83,000 worth of medicine and latrines to 40municipalities in Honduras.|$|E
5|$|The <b>health-related</b> {{quality of}} life (HRQL) after an attack of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} can be significantly impaired. About a fifth are unable to walk unaided after six months, and many experience chronic pain, fatigue and difficulty with work, education, hobbies and social activities. HRQL improves significantly in the first year.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 Welsh health survey, {{conducted}} by the Welsh Assembly, reported that 51% of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21% described their health as fair or poor. The survey also recorded that 27% of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Enquiries into <b>health-related</b> lifestyle choices report 27% {{of the adult population}} are smokers, 45% admit drinking alcohol above recommended guidelines at least once a week, while 29% undertake the recommended weekly physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Ashland Community and Technical College (ACTC), {{located in}} Ashland, Kentucky, United States, {{is one of}} 16 two-year, open-admissions colleges of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS). It was founded in 1938 to allow {{students}} the opportunity to obtain associate degrees, certificates and diplomas as well as provide vocational and technical training. The courses offered range from Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, business, education, <b>health-related</b> courses, information technology and a range of industrial technology degrees among others.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma was the 21st-largest {{recipient}} of medical {{funding from the}} federal government in 2005, with <b>health-related</b> federal expenditures in the state totaling $75,801,364; immunizations, bioterrorism preparedness, and health education were the top three most funded medical items.

5|$|Three campuses {{encompass}} the ACTC system, the primary campus located on College Drive near downtown Ashland near 13th Street and is where business, education, <b>health-related,</b> {{information technology and}} transfer programs are offered. The Roberts Drive campus, located at {{the southern edge of}} Ashland, offers several industrial technology degrees, such as Air Conditioning, Applied Process Technologies, Auto Mechanics, Computer Aided Drafting and Fire and Rescue Technology, and courses in Cosmetology and Culinary Arts.|$|E
5|$|A natural bobtail can {{be found}} in some members of the breed, which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. <b>Health-related</b> research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform <b>health-related</b> tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E
5|$|Metropolitan Orlando sustains the world's largest {{recognized}} {{cluster of}} modeling, simulation and training companies.

Research Park is the 7th largest research park in the nation, with 2,700 Department of Defense personnel and direct support contractors. Collectively, those defense organizations manage $5.2 billion in contracts every year. Many of the employees in Research Park work with UCF researchers and students on projects in the sciences, engineering, photonics and optics, modeling and simulation, and <b>health-related</b> fields.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual <b>health-related</b> medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E

25|$|Observational {{studies have}} two components, {{descriptive}} and analytical. Descriptive observations {{pertain to the}} “who, what, where and when of <b>health-related</b> state occurrence”. However, analytical observations deal more with the ‘how’ of a <b>health-related</b> event. Experimental epidemiology contains three case types: randomized controlled trials (often used for new medicine or drug testing), field trials (conducted on those at {{a high risk of}} conducting a disease), and community trials (research on social originating diseases).|$|E

25|$|An {{effort has}} been made by city {{officials}} to diversify the economy by attracting <b>health-related,</b> high-tech and other commercial interests.

Each drawing is held on behalf {{of one or more}} of the society lotteries, whose revenues go to support <b>health-related</b> causes in their respective area. The Health Lottery received criticism on launch for only pledging to donate 20.3% of ticket costs to charity, compared to the National Lottery's 28%, and that the lottery's structure was designed to contravene British law regarding lotteries.|$|E
