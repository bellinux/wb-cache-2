5000|$|So far, C-One {{circuit boards}} have been {{produced}} by German company Individual Computers, and they [...] sell for â‚¬333 with the FPGA <b>extender</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{extender}} board (or board <b>extender,</b> <b>card</b> extender, <b>extender</b> <b>card)</b> is {{a simple}} circuit board that interposes between a card cage backplane and the circuit board of interest to physically 'extend' the circuit board of interest out from the card cage allowing access to {{both sides of the}} circuit board to connect diagnostic equipment such as an oscilloscope or systems analyzer. For example, a PCI extender board can be plugged into a PCI slot on a computer motherboard, and then a PCI card connected to the extender board to 'extend' the board into free space for access. This approach was common in the 1970s and 1980s particularly on S-100 bus systems.|$|E
50|$|The 5161 was an {{expansion}} chassis that used an identical case and power supply as the XT but had {{instead of a}} system board a backplane with 8 card slots (and no microprocessor). The 5161 came with a 10 MB hard drive and had room for another one. The 5161 {{was connected to the}} 5160 using an <b>Extender</b> <b>Card</b> in the system unit and a Receiver Card in the Expansion Unit, connected by a custom cable. The Expansion Unit could also contain extra memory, but the <b>Extender</b> <b>card</b> inserted wait states for memory in the Expansion Unit, so it was preferable to install memory onto the XT system board or on memory cards in slots plugged into the XT system board directly. The 5161 could be connected to either an XT or to the earlier 5150 (the original IBM PC). This expansion feature was not available for later machines like the IBM PC AT and in fact the 5161 is completely incompatible with anything but an 8088-based PC.|$|E
40|$|The SIU <b>Extender</b> (SIUEXT) <b>card</b> is {{a passive}} component, {{providing}} a mechanical {{extension of the}} SIU bus. It has a standard plug and a standard receptacle FEE-SIU interface connector, so the SIUEXT can be inserted between the SIU (or the SIMU) and the FEE. It provides a connection to a logic analyser (LA), having 5 LA connnectors. The Logic Analyser {{can be used for}} monitoring of the transactions on the FEE-SIU interface...|$|R
50|$|Next, ALF {{produced}} {{a number of}} incidental S-100 products: a <b>card</b> <b>extender,</b> which facilitates testing an S-100 card by raising it above the other cards in the computer; an S-100 motherboard; an S-100 motherboard testing card, which simplified checking for assembly errors on a motherboard; and a random number generator. The motherboard testing card was sold though local hobby-electronics stores, and the motherboard was used in a subsequent product (the AD8).|$|R
5000|$|A {{hard disk}} {{could not be}} {{installed}} into the 5150's system unit without changing to a higher-rated power supply (although later drives with lower power consumption {{have been known to}} work with the standard 63.5 Watt unit). The [...] "IBM 5161 Expansion Chassis" [...] came with its own power supply and one 10 MB hard disk and allowed the installation of a second hard disk. The system unit had five expansion slots, and the expansion unit had eight; however, one of the system unit's slots and one of the expansion unit's slots had to be occupied by the <b>Extender</b> <b>Card</b> and Receiver Card, respectively, which were needed to connect the expansion unit to the system unit and make the expansion unit's other slots available, for a total of 11 slots. A working configuration required that some of the slots be occupied by display, disk, and I/O adapters, as none of these were built into the 5150's motherboard; the only motherboard external connectors were the keyboard and cassette ports.|$|E
30|$|The AP 1000 {{has lots}} of {{features}} to support complex system prototyping, including test access and expansion capabilities. The PCB is a 64 -bit PCI card that can be inserted in a standard expansion slot on a PC motherboard or PCI backplane. Use of the PMC site requires a second chassis slot on the backside {{of the board and}} an optional <b>extender</b> <b>card</b> to provide access to the board I/O. The AP 1000 platform includes a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC 2 VP 100 FPGA and is connected to dual banks of DDR SDRAM (64 [*]MB) and SRAM (2 [*]MB), Flash Memory (16 [*]MB), Ethernet and other interfaces. It is configured as a single board computer based on two embedded IBM PowerPC processors, and it is providing an advanced design starting point for the designer to improve time-to-market and reduce development costs.|$|E
