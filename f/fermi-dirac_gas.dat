40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} optical properties of a <b>Fermi-Dirac</b> <b>gas</b> {{in the presence}} of a superfluid state. We calculate the leading quantum-statistical corrections to the standard column density result of the electric susceptibility. We also consider the Bragg diffraction of atoms by means of light-stimulated transitions of photons between two intersecting laser beams. Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing between atoms in different internal levels magnifies incoherent scattering processes. The absorption linewidth of a <b>Fermi-Dirac</b> <b>gas</b> is broadened and shifted. Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing introduces a collisional local-field shift that may dramatically dominate the Lorentz-Lorenz shift. For the case of the Bragg spectroscopy the static structure function may be significantly increased due to superfluidity in the nearforward scattering.

Similarly, the inclusion of quantum statistics affects very little the shear viscosity. On the other hand, the quantum statistics becomes important for description of the phenomena connected with the bulk viscosity.

40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} {{are given}} for the static structure factor S(k) and the pair correlation function g(r) for uniform ideal Bose-Einstein and <b>Fermi-Dirac</b> <b>gases</b> for all temperatures. In the vicinity of Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) temperature, g(r) becomes long ranged and remains so in the condensed phase. In the dilute gas limit, g(r) of bosons & fermions do not coincide with Maxwell-Boltzmann gas but exhibit bunching & anti-bunching effect respectively. The width of these functions depends on the temperature and is scaled as (inverse atomic mass). Our numerical results provide the precise quantitative values of suppression/increase (antibunching and bunching) of the density fluctuations at small distances in ideal quantum gases in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation for almost non-trapped dilute gases.

40|$|A {{class of}} {{high-order}} kinetic flux vector splitting schemes are presented for solving ideal quantum gas dynamics based on quantum statistical mechanics. The collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation approach is adopted and both Bose-Einstein and <b>Fermi-Dirac</b> <b>gases</b> are considered. The formulas for the split flux vectors are derived based oil the general three-dimensional distribution function in velocity space and formulas for lower dimensions {{can be directly}} deduced. General curvilinear coordinates are introduced to treat practical problems with general geometry. High-order accurate schemes using weighted essentially nori-oscillatory methods are implemented. The resulting high resolution kinetic flux Splitting schemes are tested for 1 D shock tube flows and shock wave diffraction by a 2 D wedge and by a circular cylinder in ideal quantum gases. Excellent results have been obtained for all examples computed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{the spirit}} of Bose–Einstein condensation, we present a {{detailed}} account of the statistical description of the condensation phenomena for a <b>Fermi–Dirac</b> <b>gas</b> following the works of Born and Kothari. For bosons, while the condensed phase below a certain critical temperature, permits macroscopic occupation at the lowest energy single particle state, for fermions, due to Pauli exclusion principle, the condensed phase occurs only {{in the form of a}} single occupancy dense modes at the highest energy state. In spite of these rudimentary differences, our recent findings [Ghosh and Ray, 2017] identify the foregoing phenomenon as condensation-like coherence among fermions in an analogous way to Bose–Einstein condensate which is collectively described by a coherent matter wave. To reach the above conclusion, we employ the close relationship between the statistical methods of bosonic and fermionic fields pioneered by Cahill and Glauber. In addition to our previous results, we described in this mini-review that the highest momentum (energy) for individual fermions, prerequisite for the condensation process, can be specified in terms of the natural length and energy scales of the problem. The existence of such condensed phases, which are of obvious significance in the context of elementary particles, have also been scrutinized...|$|E
40|$|The quantum {{principles}} that establish the energy levels and degeneracies needed {{to evaluate the}} partition functions are explored. The uncertainty principle {{is associated with the}} dual wave-particle nature of the model used to describe quantized gas particles. The Schroedinger wave equation is presented as a generalization of Maxwell's wave equation; the former applies to all particles while the Maxwell equation applies to the special case of photon particles. The size of the quantum cell in phase space and the representation of momentum as a space derivative operator follow from the uncertainty principle. A consequence of this is that steady-state problems that are space-time dependent for the classical model become only space dependent for the quantum model and are often easier to solve. The partition function is derived for quantized free particles and, at normal conditions, the result is the same as that given by the classical phase integral. The quantum corrections that occur at very low temperatures or high densities are derived. These corrections for the Einstein-Bose gas qualitatively describe the condensation effects that occur in liquid helium, but are unimportant for most practical purposes otherwise. However, the corrections for the <b>Fermi-Dirac</b> <b>gas</b> are important because they quantitatively describe the behavior of high-density conduction electron gases in metals and explain the zero point energy and low specific heat exhibited in this case...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of general {{relativity}} and quantum statistics, it was shown (Neslušan L. : 2009, Phys. Rev. D 80, 024015, arxiv: 0808. 3484) that the equation of state (ES) of extremely hot <b>Fermi-Dirac</b> <b>gas</b> in the surface layer of an ultra-relativistic compact object converges to the same form as the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium (RETE), which is the condition of stability of the object. The description of energy state of a gas particle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type energy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of the relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann form in the classical limit. The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's surface layer, becomes perfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's physical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the internal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer increases over all limits {{in the frame of}} the volume and this opens the question if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems to be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or, so far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a distant observer. In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form of the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the RETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional form. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate identity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its gravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the infinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed object. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at the stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be not necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e. g. to an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the central, ultra-compact object.
