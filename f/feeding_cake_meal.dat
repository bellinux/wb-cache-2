40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the feasibility of an aqueous process for the biorefinery of sunflower whole plant using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. Traditionally, aqueous extraction of oil is looked upon as an environmentally cleaner alternative technology to the solvent extraction (Rosenthal et al., 1996) and the twin-screw extruder carries out three essential unit operations continuously: conditioning and grinding of whole plant, liquid/solid extraction and liquid/solid separation. Wringing out the mixing is favoured thanks to the stalk fibers. However, drying of the <b>cake</b> <b>meal</b> is not optimal and lixiviation of cotyledon cells within the seed is incomplete. Extraction efficiency depends on the operating conditions: screw rotation speed, input flow rates of whole plant and water. In best conditions, oil yield is 57 % and residual oil content in the <b>cake</b> <b>meal</b> is 14 %. These conditions lead to the co-extraction of proteins, pectins and hemicelluloses. Protein yield is 44 % and residual protein content in the <b>cake</b> <b>meal</b> is 7 %. Oil is extracted in the form of two oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by phospholipids and proteins at interface. An aqueous extract containing part of the water-soluble constituents from whole plant, mainly proteins and pectins, is also generated.

40|$|Biorefinery of {{sunflower}} whole {{plant can}} be realized using a twin-screw extruder. Thermo-mechanical fractionation and aqueous extraction are conducted simultaneously. A filter section is outfitted along the barrel to collect continuously an extract and a raffinate (<b>cake</b> <b>meal).</b> Oil yield obtained is 53 %. Proteins are partly extracted at the same time, just as pectins and hemicelluloses. Protein yield is 46 %. <b>Cake</b> <b>meal</b> is relatively moist (66 % for the moisture content). It is first dried to make easier its conservation. It is largely composed of lignocellulosic fibres (59 % of the dry matter) from depithed stalk. Lipid content is 13 % of the dry matter or 35 % of the oil in whole plant. Protein content is 7 % of the dry matter or 45 % of the proteins in whole plant. DSC measurements indicate that denaturation of proteins is almost complete in the <b>cake</b> <b>meal.</b> DMTA spectrum of its milled powder reveals a significant peak at high temperature (between 175 and 200 °C). As already observed with industrial sunflower <b>cake</b> <b>meal,</b> it {{can be associated with}} the glass transition of proteins. As a mixture of fibres and proteins, the <b>cake</b> <b>meal</b> can be considered as a natural composite. It is successfully processed into biodegradable and value-added agromaterials by thermo-pressing. As for DMTA analysis, the glass transition of proteins in the <b>cake</b> <b>meal</b> is also observed with PVT analysis at around 180 °C. It makes easier the choice of the best thermo-pressing conditions to produce panels with higher mechanical properties in bending. These properties increase simultaneously with temperature, pressure and time chosen for molding operation. The highest flexural strength at break (11. 5 MPa) and the highest elastic modulus (2. 22 GPa) are obtained for the next molding conditions: 200 °C and 320 kgf/cm 2 during 60 s. Drop angle measurements show that the corresponding panel is also the most resistant to water. No significant transition is observed inside this panel above 0 °C and until 200 °C with DMTA analysis. Proteins ensure the agromaterial cohesion without any phase change in this temperature range, and fibres entanglement also acts like reinforcement. This panel could be used as inter-layer sheets for pallets or for the manufacturing of biodegradable containers (composters, crates for vegetable gardening) by assembly of panels...|$|R

The Plackett-Burman design and one-variable-at-a-time design indicated that glucose and rice meal as the complex carbon sources, and peanut <b>cake</b> <b>meal</b> and NH 4 NO 3 as the complex nitrogen sources were beneficial for MIL-C production in S. rimofaciens ZJU 5119.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the feasibility of an aqueous process to extract the residual oil from sunflower press cakes using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. Two different configurations were tested: the expression from whole seeds followed by the aqueous extraction, in two successive apparatus or in the same one. For the aqueous extraction stage, the oil yield depended on the operating conditions including screw rotation speed, screw profile, and inlet flow rates of press cakes and water. Liquid/solid separation required the addition of a lignocellulosic residue (wheat straw), upstream from the filtration zone. However, even with maximum fiber inlet flow (around 20 % of the inlet flow rate of the solid matters for the highest amount of wheat straw), drying of the <b>cake</b> <b>meal</b> did not improve. The lixiviation of the material was also incomplete. Oil yield was better when the expression and the aqueous extraction were conducted in the same extruder. For all the trials carried out using such a configuration, the corresponding <b>cake</b> <b>meal</b> contained less than 10 % residual oil, and the total oil yield was 78 % in the best operating conditions. Nevertheless, the contribution of the aqueous extraction stage was extremely limited, less than 5 % in the best trial, partly due to a ratio of the water to the press cake too low. For the aqueous extraction stage, the oil was extracted in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion whose stability was minimized because of its low proteins content due to their thermomechanical denaturation during the expression stage...|$|R
