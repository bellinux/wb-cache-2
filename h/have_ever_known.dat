As he is dead, it is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention {{that he was one of}} the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or anywhere else.|$|E

By then, {{she and her husband}} finally recognise Lisa, the orphan circus star, as their lone child Susanna. The Scowlers have their happiest moment ever due to this; afterwards, Master plays a pleasant tune on his violin, and everybody dances to it. Eventually, the Scowlers rekindle their relationship, and the town dwellers celebrate along with them. In time, Lapitch becomes the most respected shoemaker they <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E

25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E

500|$|Tommy Handley died {{suddenly}} on 9 January 1949; the BBC {{decided that he}} was [...] "so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance" [...] of ITMA, that they cancelled the show immediately. Jacques later remarked that Handley was [...] "one of the greatest radio performers we <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> I learned... so much from him". Later that year Le Mesurier divorced his wife; shortly after the divorce came through, Jacques proposed to him, asking, [...] "don't you think it's about time we got married?"

500|$|Nevertheless, Stanford did {{not seriously}} {{consider}} studying anywhere else. Neither Dublin nor London offered any comparable musical training; {{the most prestigious}} British music school, the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), {{was at that time}} hidebound and reactionary. He was dismayed to find in Leipzig that Bennett had recommended him to a German pedant no more progressive than the teachers at the RAM. Stanford said of Reinecke, [...] "Of all the dry musicians I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> he was the most desiccated. He had not a good word for any contemporary composer... He loathed Wagner ... sneered at Brahms and had no enthusiasm of any sort." [...] Stanford's biographer Paul Rodmell suggests that Reinecke's ultra-conservatism may have been unexpectedly good for his pupil [...] "as it may have encouraged Stanford to kick against the traces." [...] During his time in Leipzig Stanford took piano lessons from Robert Papperitz (1826–1903), organist of the city's Nikolaikirche, whom he found more helpful.|$|E
500|$|His {{resignation}} {{was announced}} amid {{an outpouring of}} appreciation from politicians and naval comrades. Battenberg had written to Churchill on 28 October, [...] "What I shd value above all else is {{to be admitted to}} the Privy Council." [...] The King later swore Louis in as a Privy Councillor in a public show of support. Labour party politician and trade union leader J. H. Thomas wrote to The Times: [...] "I desire to express my extreme regret at the announcement that Prince Louis of Battenberg has, by his resignation, pandered to the most mean and contemptible slander I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> ... I was simply astounded to hear the base suggestions and rumours current, and I am afraid that his action will simply be looked upon as a triumph for the mean and miserable section of people, who, at a time of national trial, is ever ready to pass a foul lie from lip to lip without a tittle of evidence." [...] Admiral of the Fleet Lord John Hay thought that the [...] "ingeniously propagated lies" [...] originated from Germany.|$|E
500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, {{he was a member of}} our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E

500|$|Observing {{similarities}} between the character and herself, Rashad described Clair as [...] "a warm, loving mother"; the actress is also similar in both appearance and personality to Camille. Rashad's acting had always been more straight-faced to counter Cosby's humor, typically playing straight woman to Cosby's comedic antics. In preparation for the second season, Cosby decided to provide Rashad with more comedic material upon learning that the actress is [...] "capable of handling comedy on her own–without Cliff." [...] Jets Robert E. Johnson observed that Rashad portrays her character using [...] "soft, sophisticated humor". The sixth season episode [...] "Off to See the Wretched", in which Clair scolds Vanessa for traveling to Baltimore to see a rock concert against her parents' orders, features Rashad's most [...] "uncontrolled" [...] performance as the character. Speaking fondly of his co-star, Cosby said [...] "There's nobody whom I can be more thankful about than Phylicia." [...] In {{the aftermath of a}} highly publicized article originally published in TV Guide before the series premiered that labeled Cosby [...] "one of the most arrogant celebrities", Rashad took over the majority of the show's promotional appearances herself. Rashad also defended Cosby against the accusations, calling him [...] "one of the most intelligent people I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> In addition to being a few years younger than Clair was originally intended to be, Rashad is only 10 years older than actress Sabrina LeBeauf, who portrays eldest child Sondra. Meanwhile, actress Ethel Ayler, who portrays Clair's mother Carrie, is only 14 years her senior. Originally, actress Clarice Taylor auditioned for the role of Carrie, deliberately making herself over in attempt to look young enough to play Rashad's mother before Cosby ultimately cast her as his own character's.|$|E

2500|$|As Robert Nichols {{stated in}} The Times:Sir Henry possessed the fullest {{as well as}} the wisest mind I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> It was no unusual thing to hear him in the course of one evening {{discourse}} on topics so various as: the influence of reasoning upon Goethe and Mozart, types of apprehension in listeners to symphonic music, sensations while looping the loop (he was over 60 when he did so), the painting of Guardi, 'co-ordination' in a star golfer, Ninon de Lenclos, Conrad as a narrator (Sir Henry was far the ablest literary critic I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known),</b> religious ecstasy, the relation of art and science, the social customs of Melanesia. On each of such topics he not only appeared to have more information than anybody in the room, but spoke after a more illuminating fashion, for, like Leonardo (on whom he was an authority) he had a supreme eye for the significant. Nor did he resemble Leonardo in mind only. He had Leonardo's lofty human compassion, humility, patience, and profound serenity of spirit." [...] (10 October 1940) ...|$|E

[...] The word was used again one year later by the Palestinian poet Burhan al-Deen al-Abushi.|$|E

She was known for being remarkably strong-willed, but after her death, Norton Baskin wrote of her, [...] "Marjorie was the shyest person I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> This was always strange to me as she could stand up to anybody in any department of endeavor but time after time when she was asked to go some place or to do something she would accept -'if I would go with her.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein ( [...] ; 26 April 1889 – 29 April 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher {{who worked}} {{primarily}} in logic, {{the philosophy of}} mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language.

During his lifetime he published just one slim book, the 75-page Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), [...] one article, one book review and a children's dictionary. His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously. [...] Philosophical Investigations appeared as a book in 1953, and has since come to be recognised {{as one of the}} most important works of philosophy in the twentieth century.
