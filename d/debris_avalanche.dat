5|$|In April 1980, Voight's {{publications}} on landslides and avalanches {{and other}} mass movements {{attracted the attention}} of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked him to look at a growing bulge on the Mount St. Helens volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the <b>debris</b> <b>avalanche</b> that initiated the eruption. After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufrière Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.|$|E

About 35,000years ago a {{collapse}} of Chimborazo produced a <b>debris</b> <b>avalanche</b> with an average thickness of forty meters. which underlies the city of Riobamba.

25|$|Mount Bandai, one of Japan's most noted volcanoes, {{rises above}} {{the north shore of}} Lake Inawashiro. Mount Bandai is formed of several {{overlapping}} stratovolcanoes, the largest of which is O-Bandai forming a complex volcano. O-Bandai volcano was constructed within a horseshoe-shaped caldera that formed about 40,000 years when an earlier volcano collapsed, forming the Okinajima <b>debris</b> <b>avalanche,</b> which traveled to the southwest and was accompanied by a plinian eruption. Four major phreatic eruptions have occurred during the past 5,000 years, two of them in historical time, in 806 and 1888. Seen from the south, Bandai presents a conical profile, but much of {{the north side of the}} volcano is missing as a result of the collapse of Ko-Bandai volcano during the 1888 eruption, in which a <b>debris</b> <b>avalanche</b> buried several villages and formed several large lakes.|$|E

25|$|The hummocky {{deposits}} on Augustine's lower flanks resemble both topographically and lithologically {{those of}} the great landslide or <b>debris</b> <b>avalanche</b> that initiated the spectacular May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The deposit of that landslide revealed the origin of coarse diamicts with hummocky topography at other strato volcanic cones. Since 1980 many hummocky coarsely fragmental deposits on Augustine's lower flanks {{have come to be}} interpreted as deposits of numerous great landslides and debris avalanches.|$|E
500|$|The <b>debris</b> <b>avalanche</b> deposit is [...] {{long and}} well preserved.

30|$|Large scale {{instability}} processes, erosional landforms and <b>debris</b> <b>avalanches</b> {{present a}} particular relevance {{in the case}} study of the Stromboli island. As a consequence of rapid construction, many volcanoes are liable to massive flank or slope failures resulting from structural instability. The slope failures have produced mobile <b>debris</b> <b>avalanches,</b> travelling on long distances beyond the flank of volcanoes at high velocities. A description of geological processes involving the flank failures and the related deposits has been provided in detail by several authors (Voight et al. 1983; Siebert et al. 1987; Crandell 1988; Glicken 1991; Moore et al. 1994).|$|R

The “GeoFlow_SPH” depth-integrated model is used which allows: (i) adequately {{taking into account the}} irregular topography of real slopes which greatly affect the propagation stage and (ii) using a less time consuming model than fully 3 D approaches. In this work the behavior of <b>debris</b> <b>avalanches</b> is analyzed with special emphasis on the apical angle, one of the main features of this type of landslide, in relation to soil rheology, hillslope geometry and features of triggering area. An important case study of Campania region (Italy) is analyzed related to pyroclastic soils coming from the eruptive products of Vesusius volcano.

Since the large <b>debris</b> <b>avalanche</b> 4,800years ago, a number of more minor landslides have occurred at it, including one 1,100years ago and another event 500years ago. Both landslides ultimately blocked the Squamish River and created lakes upstream that lasted for a limited amount of time. In 1968 and 1983, a series of landslides took place that caused considerable damage to logging roads and forest stands, but did not result in any casualties. Future landslides from Mount Cayley and potential damming of the Squamish River are significant geological hazards to the general public, as well as to the economic development in the Squamish valley.|$|E

40|$|<b>Debris</b> <b>avalanches</b> {{are complex}} {{phenomena}} {{due to the}} variety of mechanisms that control the failure stage and the avalanche formation. Regarding these issues, in the literature, either field evidence or qualitative interpretations can be found while few experimental laboratory tests and rare examples of geomechanical modelling are available for technical and/or scientific purposes. As {{a contribution to the}} topic, the paper firstly highlights as the problem can be analysed referring to a unique mathematical framework from which different modelling approaches can be derived based on limit equilibrium method (LEM), finite element method (FEM), or smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Potentialities and limitations of these approaches are then tested for a large study area where huge <b>debris</b> <b>avalanches</b> affected shallow deposits of pyroclastic soils (Sarno-Quindici, Southern Italy). The numerical results show that LEM as well as uncoupled and coupled stress–strain FEM analyses are able to individuate the major triggering mechanisms. On the other hand, coupled SPH analyses outline the relevance of erosion phenomena, which can modify the kinematic features of <b>debris</b> <b>avalanches</b> in their source areas, i. e. velocity, propagation patterns and later spreading of the unstable mass. As a whole, the obtained results encourage the application of the introduced approaches to further analyse real cases in order to enhance the current capability to forecast the inception of these dangerous phenomena...|$|R

40|$|<b>Debris</b> <b>avalanches,</b> {{resulting}} from flank collapses that shape volcanic and mountainous edifices are rapidand dangerous gravity-driven granular flows that travel long run out distances. The dynamic and the transport mechanisms behind this high mobility remain poorly understood. The numerous models proposed {{to explain this}} high mobility include processes based on lubrication or fluidisation of the granular mass of the flow body, but also the dynamic disintegration of the transported particles. To date,all these proposed mechanisms lack observational support and quantification {{of the state of}} the particles of the granular mass during the transport. To identify the main transport mechanisms, we propose here detailed field studies of volcanic <b>debris</b> <b>avalanches</b> deposits resulting of flank-collapse events on an oceanic shield volcano, the Piton des Neiges (La Réunion Island, Indian Ocean). This study has been combined with morphometric (fractal dimension and circularity), exoscopic and grain-size analyses. Moreover, the fabric of the deposits has been investigated by with the characteristics of the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (ASM). From these data we highlight a proximal to distal evolution of the <b>debris</b> <b>avalanches</b> transport and emplacement dynamics. We demonstrate that syn-transport dynamic disintegration continuously operates with the distance from the source down to a grinding limit of 500 μm. Below this limit, the particle size reduction exclusively results from the attrition of the particles by frictional interactions. Thus, the exceptional mobility of <b>debris</b> <b>avalanches</b> may be explained by thecombined effect of elastic energy release during the dynamic disintegration of the larger clasts (> 500 μm) and frictional reduction within the matrix due to the dispersive interactions between the finer particles (500 μm et par une réduction de la friction interne à la matrice liée aux interactions dispersives des particules fines (< 500 μm).
