Ewes enter into oestrus cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. The phenomenon of the <b>freemartin,</b> a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep.

40|$|The {{chromosome}} {{constitution of}} a set of bovine heterosexual triplets consisting of two <b>freemartins</b> and one male was studied by means of blood culture, colchicine treatment of bone marrow cells and tissue cultures from several organs. As controls, four multiparous cows, including one female from another heterosexual triplets origin and a set of homosexual triple females, were also studied chromosomally using the blood culture technique. The sexual organs of the <b>freemartins</b> were examined macroscopically and histologically. The results are summarized as follows : 1) Cultured leukocytes and bone marrow cells in both <b>freemartins</b> and the co-tripled male manifested 2 A-XX/ 2 A-XY chimerism. The chimera ratios were parallel with each other among these three individuals. Tissue cultures from thyroid, kidneys, lung, gonads and seminal vesicle-like structures of these animals failed to show chimerism. No chimerism was observed, on the other hand, in leukocyte cultures from the control animals. Thus, <b>freemartins</b> involved in heterosexual triplets can also be diagnosed chromosomally {{as well as in the}} case of twins. 2) Two <b>freemartins</b> submitted to this study considerably differed in the morphological characteristics of the sexual organs, despite having similar characters in sex-chromosome chimerism...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the behaviour of the gonads, {{in terms of}} hormonal secretion, in a model of intersexual development naturally occurring in mammals, we determined plasma concentrations of testosterone, progesterone, and anti-M€ullerian hormone (AMH) in bovine <b>freemartins,</b> and compared them to normal levels measured in males and females from birth to puberty. We found that newborn males and <b>freemartins</b> have very high concentrations of AMH (over 700 ng/ml). Conversely, plasma AMH concentration is always below 120 ng/ml in females. While values remain stable in males {{for the first five}} months of life, they sharply decrease in the <b>freemartins</b> within the first fortnight, and reach female levels, which demonstrates that AMH is essentially originated in the male twin. In young bulls the trend of plasma testosterone concentrations is opposite to that of the AMH. The rise in testosterone production at puberty corresponds to a sharp decline in AMH concentrations. Bovine plasma concentrations of AMH are surprisingly higher than those measured in other mammals, including man and mouse.

40|$|Background: Freemartinism {{occurs in}} some speices of {{ruminants}} and affects most female bovine fetuses in hterrosexual, multiple pregnancies owing of susion of the chorionic blood circulations soon after implantation. Maldevelopment of the ovaries and Müllerian ducts {{have been described}} and recognized as resulting from exposure of their respective primoridia to an excess of anti-Müllerian hormone. The Present study aimed to analyse the prenatal growth {{the development of the}} gubernaculum in <b>freemartins</b> to find out its pssible affliction through foetal testis hormones derived from their male co-twin. Methods: Histolgical sections of young and frawings and photographs of further developed <b>freemartins</b> and conrol male and female bovine foeuses were analysed. The specimens had been collected ealier for analsis of the time course of male and female gonadal and gential development and its impairment associated with freemartinism. Results: The gubernaculum of 35 – 40 day-old male and female fetuses was in the intial stage of development and of similar appearance in all specimens. Gubenacula of 60 – 70 -day-old male fetuss differed from those of females of similar age in various respects: the male gubernaculum size was larger and extension of the processus vaginalis was deeper. <b>Freemartins</b> showd and intermediate development with some individuals resembling male and othes resembling female agemates. During furher development, gubernacula in males developed into muscular cremaster sacs, whereas those in females generally did not develop beyond the size and structural complexity of 70 -day-old foetuses. Beyond day 70 of fetal life, gubernaculum development in <b>freemartins</b> definitly showed male characteristics with respect to size and growth of a processus vaginalis with a cremaster muscular wall. The male-like pattern of the outgrowth of the processus vainalis changed {{during the second half of}} prenatal life. Rather than its further deepening as in mals, this structure became inveted to become emerging as a papilla-like structure from the inguinal abdomen bottom. An explanation is proposed for this unprecedented inversion, taking into account: (1) the faster and higher reaching rightsided ascent of the kidneys and gonads, (2) the femalelike outgrowth of the cranial gonadal suspensory ligaments, and (3) the absence of scrotum development. The ovaries and mesonephric remnants in developing <b>freemartins,</b> during their ascent together with the kidneys while remaining attached to the bottom of the developing processus vaginalis sacs via the gubernaculum ligament, are proposed to act together to pull up the bottom of the processus vaginalis sacs. From this action, “inverted hernia sacs” result as the irreversible consequence. Conclusion: The data support the concept that foetal testes act, via as an yet unidentified third hormone, to establish malelike development of gubernacula into muscular cremaster sacs. Further work is required to reveal the identity of this hormone. Furthermore, the apparent similarity of the freemartins' inverted processus vaginalis sacs and the fetal rodents' gubernacular cones suggests that the ruminants' and rodents' processus vaginalis are essentially similar structures. Thus there is no longer an urgent need to distinguish between two different types of gubernaculum development and testis descent in rodents and ruminants, respectively, and involving or not fetal gubernacular cones. The present observations may thus contribute to the development of a unified hypothesis for sexually dimorphic development of the gubernaculum throughout the mammalian class. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

50|$|Twins {{are common}} in many animal species, {{including}} cats, sheep, ferrets, giant pandas, dogs, deer, marmosets, and tamarins.

50|$|Microchimerism {{occurs in}} most pairs of twins in cattle.

40|$|The wide {{variance}} in anatomical characteristics among heifers born co-twin to a bull make diagnosis of freemartinism by measurements of vaginal length or {{the distance between}} the anus and vulva unreliable.

5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} similar {{reproductive}} strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated {{by a single}} ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round. Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months. However, there are exceptions. For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months. Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and {{a small number of}} the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are <b>freemartins</b> (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).|$|R
5000|$|In most cattle twins, {{the blood}} vessels in the chorions become interconnected, {{creating}} a shared circulation for both twins. If both fetuses are the same sex this is of no significance, but if they are different, male hormones pass from the male twin to the female twin. The male hormones (testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone) then masculinize the female twin, and the result is a <b>freemartin.</b> [...] The degree of masculinization is greater if the fusion occurs earlier in the pregnancy - in about ten percent of cases no fusion takes place and the female remains fertile.|$|E
