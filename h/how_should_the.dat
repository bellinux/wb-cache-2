2500|$|When {{encoding}} {{colors in}} a hue/lightness/chroma or hue/value/chroma model (using the definitions {{from the previous}} two sections) model, not all combinations of lightness (or value) and chroma are meaningful: that is, half of the colors denotable using , , and [...] fall outside the RGB gamut (the gray parts of the slices in figure 14). The creators of these models considered this a problem for some uses. For example, in a color selection interface {{with two of the}} dimensions in a rectangle and the third on a slider, half of that rectangle is made of unused space. Now imagine we have a slider for lightness: the userâ€™s intent when adjusting this slider is potentially ambiguous: <b>how</b> <b>should</b> <b>the</b> software deal with out-of-gamut colors? Or conversely, If the user has selected as colorful as possible a dark purple [...] and then shifts the lightness slider upward, what should be done: would the user prefer to see a lighter purple still as colorful as possible for the given hue and lightness [...] or a lighter purple of exactly the same chroma as the original color ...|$|E
2500|$|Poole {{contended that}} the Hatch Act {{violated}} the Ninth and Tenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Justice Reed also asserted (without explanation) that the Hatch Act implicated rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, and by implication the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment as well. Justice Reed found unpersuasive Poole's claim that off-hours political activity was different from such activity conducted during working hours. [...] "The influence of political activity by government employees, if evil in its effects on the service, the employees or people dealing with them, is hardly less so because that activity takes place after hours." [...] Reed next concluded that no rights guaranteed by the Constitution are absolute, and that all rights [...] "are subject to the elemental need for order without which the guarantees of civil rights to others would be a mockery." [...] But <b>how</b> <b>should</b> <b>the</b> rights of the Ninth and Tenth amendments be balanced against those of the First and Fifth? [...] Justice Reed found the majority's answer {{in the fact that}} the Ninth and Tenth amendments are reserved, rather than enumerated powers, and so carry less weight than enumerated powers.
