5000|$|International freepost also {{exists and}} is known {{variously}} as ‘International <b>Business</b> <b>Reply</b> Service’, ‘International <b>Business</b> <b>Reply</b> Mail’, 'International <b>Business</b> Response Service', 'IBRS' and, in French, [...] "Correspondance Commerciale-Réponse Internationale" [...] (CCRI). Like USPS <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> mail, <b>international</b> <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> mail must conform to certain format requirements, including the prominent notice [...] "REPONSE PAYEE" [...] (French for [...] "reply paid"), and a number indicating the account that {{will pay for the}} postage.International <b>Business</b> <b>Reply</b> <b>Service</b> is a convenient way for international customers to reply to the sender with pre-paid cards and envelopes, at no cost to them.|$|R
40|$|Following {{a number}} of studies on the factors that might affect {{response}} rates in cross-national research, this work examines the types of incentives mentioned by <b>international</b> <b>business</b> scholars in mail surveys as well as how the use of such incentives affects the response rate. This work uses a content analysis of articles published in four leading <b>international</b> <b>business</b> journals in the period of 2000 - 2009. The results show that out of 217 studies under examination only 42 mentioned any type of incentives for enhancing the response rate. The most common incentives used by authors are confidentiality and anonymity, followed by a <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> envelope and a free report. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that studies reporting incentives achieve, on average, a lower response rate from those that do not report them...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the United States Postal Service {{refers to}} freepost as <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> mail. A mailer wishing to receive mail by freepost must obtain a <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> permit and design the envelopes, postcards, or labels {{according}} to the standards specified by the USPS, {{including the use of}} an appropriate FIM B or C code. The address on the envelope, postcard, or label {{is the same as the}} address for regular mail, except that the ZIP+4 code is different. In some large cities, <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> mail has its own five-digit ZIP code or codes (e.g., 20077 and 20078 in Washington, D.C.). The envelope or postcard also includes space for the <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> permit number.|$|R
50|$|FIM C is {{used for}} <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> mail with a {{preprinted}} POSTNET bar code.|$|R
50|$|The FIM {{serves the}} {{following}} purposes. It allows the proper facing of mail for cancellation. It also identifies {{the manner in}} which postage is paid (e.g., <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> mail or Information Based Indicia (IBI) postage) and whether that <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> mail has a POSTNET bar code. If the POSTNET bar code is present, the mail can be sent directly to a barcode sorter.|$|R
50|$|The {{postcode}} {{printed on}} <b>Business</b> <b>Reply</b> envelopes (which {{do not require}} a stamp) often ends with the letters BR.|$|R
50|$|FIM B is {{used for}} <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> mail without a {{preprinted}} ZIP+4 bar code. Because this costs more than barcoded mail, it is rarely used.|$|R

40|$|The {{science and}} {{practice}} of <b>international</b> <b>business</b> is advanced through scholarly contribution to the leading <b>international</b> <b>business</b> journals. Increased competition among academic institutions has led to increased emphasis on publication in the leading <b>international</b> <b>business</b> journals. Yet, little is known as to the answers to questions such as: (1) Who are the most prolific authors in the leading <b>international</b> <b>business</b> journals? and (2) Which educational institutions appear poised to lead <b>international</b> <b>business</b> scholarship? To examine these questions, the study examines scholarly work in <b>international</b> <b>business</b> over the past eleven years in six leading <b>international</b> <b>business</b> journals (i. e., Journal of <b>International</b> <b>Business</b> Studies, Management <b>International</b> Review, Journal of World <b>Business,</b> <b>International</b> Marketing Review, Journal of International Marketing, and <b>International</b> <b>Business</b> Review).

40|$|As <b>international</b> <b>business</b> marks 50 Â years of its {{establishment}} as {{a distinct}} domain of academic research, discussions on both the major contributions {{of the field and}} its future research directions have drawn great interest in the current literature. The arrival at a clear consensus on these issues, however, has been set back by the lack of resolution in the search for a unifying, integrative framework of <b>international</b> <b>business.</b> Drawing on theories of knowledge organisation and on extant reviews of <b>international</b> <b>business</b> research, this paper proposes an emergent <b>international</b> <b>business</b> research framework anchored around four unifying themes expressed as broad <b>international</b> <b>business</b> research questions. A content analysis of 1689 studies in the Journal of <b>International</b> <b>Business</b> Studies (JIBS) from its maiden issue in 1970 to 2008 and studies classified as <b>international</b> <b>business</b> in nature done prior to 1960 confirms the trajectories of <b>international</b> <b>business</b> research along the four themes. It is suggested that these major research themes serve as the main research pillars that define the <b>international</b> <b>business</b> domain, framing research done so far, and driving future research in the field. Areas of research intensity and opportunity are identified along with implications for <b>international</b> <b>business</b> research and theory-building. <b>International</b> <b>business</b> research History of <b>international</b> <b>business</b> thought Content analysis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a five-step procedure for meta-analysis. Especially {{important was the}} contacting of authors of prior papers. This was done primarily to improve {{the accuracy of the}} coding; it also helped to identify unpublished research and to supply missing information. Application of the five-step procedure to the issue of return postage in mail surveys yielded significantly more papers and produced more definitive conclusions than those derived from traditional reviews. This meta-analysis indicated that <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> postage is seldom cost effective because first class postage yields an additional 9 % return. <b>Business</b> <b>reply</b> rates were lower than for other first class postage in each of the 20 comparisons...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by two research questions: (1) Which recent contributions have been driving the research agenda in <b>international</b> <b>business?</b> (2) Which emerging themes in the literature are likely {{to set the stage}} for future work? To examine these questions, the study examined scholarly work in <b>international</b> <b>business</b> over the time period 1996 – 2006 in six leading <b>international</b> <b>business</b> journals (Journal of <b>International</b> <b>Business</b> Studies, Management <b>International</b> Review, Journal of World <b>Business,</b> <b>International</b> Marketing Review, Journal of International Marketing, and <b>International</b> <b>Business</b> Review). Next, a Delphi study of the most prolific authors in these journals over the same time period was conducted to delineate a future research agenda in <b>international</b> <b>business.</b> Addressing these two research questions provides us with a more complete understanding of the progress made to date in <b>international</b> <b>business</b> research, and provides a glimpse of the future.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{extended}} editorial is to elaborate on the possible future trajectories of critical perspectives on <b>international</b> <b>business.</b> In addition, {{the content of the}} current issue is introduced. Design/methodology/approach – This editorial reviews recent reflections on the field of <b>international</b> <b>business</b> to identify the concerns of mainstream scholars and to contrast these with those of central concern to critical scholars of <b>international</b> <b>business.</b> In the light of this, consideration is given to how critical perspectives on <b>international</b> <b>business</b> seeks to facilitate the development of academic debates that continue to question orthodox approaches to <b>international</b> <b>business</b> whilst also offering relevance for all stakeholders in <b>international</b> <b>business</b> activities from managers, shareholders and policy makers to workers, consumers and citizens, including future generations.
