5|$|Two {{or three}} <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> may turn into {{less than a}} foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties to turn over their weapons.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, Sandy {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west, weakening below hurricane force {{by the time it}} reached Pennsylvania. Because the system was non-tropical, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) – known at the time as the Hydrometeorogical Prediction Center (HPC) – took over the responsibility of issuing advisories on the low. The remnants of Sandy brought heavy snow and high winds to the central Appalachian Mountains, resulting in blizzard warnings being issued. The system continued to weaken as it moved across western Pennsylvania, and by 0300UTC on October31, the storm's movement had shifted to the northwest. Blizzard conditions continued in the Appalachians, bringing more snow to the region that had already seen high amounts the day before. By 0900UTC on October31, the circulation degenerated into a trough of low pressure, with no discernible center of low pressure. Later that day, the remnants of Sandy spread into the Great Lakes, and the WPC issued its last advisory. By the time the system had moved out of the region, nearly three <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> had fallen in some areas of West Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, with lesser amounts elsewhere in the region. During the next two days, Sandy's remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over Ontario, before merging with another low pressure area over Eastern Canada, on November 2.|$|E

25|$|The {{vicinity}} of Jacob Lake remained popular despite, {{or perhaps because}} of, its relative inaccessibility.

25|$|The {{blizzard}} {{was part}} of a winter remarkable for its snowstorms in the affected states, where total snowfall for the season ranked in the topten and even higher in some areas. In sections of the coastal northeast, 75inches of total snowfall occurred that year. Some Maryland communities getting more than three <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> in the President's Day blizzard, such as Kingsville and Perry Hall, experienced more than 80inches of snow for the entire winter season.|$|E
25|$|Cape May had {{reported}} nearly 15inches of snow {{after the storm}} had moved out to sea. The town had lesser snow amounts due to {{a break in the}} southern half of the snow bands pivoting toward New Jersey. The snow totals were only expected to reach 10 to 15inches at the highest. Instead, the highest amount was in Brick, New Jersey where 36 inches fell, nearly 3 <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> fell. I-95 Northbound was mostly covered in layers of snow, which was dangerous for some drivers.|$|E

25|$|Franco {{canceled}} the Guadalajara offense on December 23, but the relief force could not begin its attack until December 29. All Franco {{could do was}} send messages to Rey d'Harcourt to hold out at all costs. In the meantime the Republicans pressed home their attack in atrocious weather. The Nationalist counter-attack began on schedule on December 29 with the experienced generals Antonio Aranda and José Enrique Varela in command. The German Condor Legion covered the attack. By New Year's Eve with a supreme effort, the Nationalists were on Teruel's Tooth and actually broke into the town to take the bullring and the railway station. But they could not hold the gains within the town. Then the weather actually turned for the worse with {{the start of a}} four-day blizzard, four <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> falling and temperatures of minus 18 C. Fighting ground to a halt as guns and machines froze, and the troops suffered terribly from frostbite. The Nationalists suffered the most as they did not have warm clothing. Many amputations were performed to remove frozen limbs.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{when war}} was declared, Genghis sent orders for a force already {{out to the}} west to {{immediately}} cross the Tien Shan mountains {{to the south and}} ravage the fertile Ferghana Valley {{in the eastern part of}} the Khwarezm Empire. This smaller detachment, no more than 20-30,000 men, was led by Genghis's son Jochi and his elite general Jebe. The Tien Shan mountain passes were much more treacherous than the Dzungarian Gate, and to make it worse, they attempted the crossing in the middle of winter with 5+ <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> Though the Mongols suffered losses and were exhausted from the crossing, their presence in the Ferghana Valley stunned the Khwarezm leadership and permanently stole the initiative away. This march can be described as the Central Asian equivalent of Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, with the same devastating effects. Because the Shah did not know if this Mongol army was a diversion or their main army, he had to protect one of his most fertile regions with force. Therefore, the Shah dispatched his elite cavalry reserve, which prevented him from effectively marching anywhere else with his main army. Jebe and Jochi seem to have kept their army in good shape while plundering the valley, and they avoided defeat by a much superior force. At this point the Mongols split up and again maneuvered over the mountains: Jebe marched further south deeper into Khwarezm territory, while Jochi took most of the force northwest to attack the exposed cities on the Syr Darya from the east.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} {{moderate}} to intense low pressure systems affected most of eastern North America particularly the Canadian Maritimes with repeated heavy snow, mixed precipitation, rain and wind. The initial storm dumped over a <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> over parts <b>of</b> Newfoundland and Labrador on December 30 while a second storm gave a <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> over Prince Edward Island and several inches <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> across New Brunswick and portions of New England and Ontario on December 30-31 while Nova Scotia received a mix <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> rain and ice pellets.

50|$|Weather {{played a}} {{critical}} role in the lead up to the game and on game day itself. Initial forecasts called for arctic temperatures and more than a <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> falling on January 15. That changed the week of the game, when a warm pacific storm barrled through the northwest and melted nearly a <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> already on the ground in Spokane. To the disappointment of many fans, the temperatures on game-day reached 50-degrees and there was no snow. As if on cue, moments before the puck dropped, the sun tucked behind the clouds and didn't show for the rest of the day, providing near-perfect viewing conditions.|$|R
500|$|The {{result is}} {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "November gale" [...] or [...] "November witch." [...] Such a storm can maintain hurricane-force wind gusts, produce waves over 50feet (15m) high, and dump several inches of rain or <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> Fuelled by the warm lake water, these powerful storms may remain over the Great Lakes for days. Intense winds ravage the lakes and surrounding shores, severely eroding and flooding the shorelines.|$|E

2500|$|The new radar {{sites were}} found to receive from three to four <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> each year.
