5|$|It {{was founded}} as the <b>Disney</b> Brothers Cartoon Studio in 1923 and {{incorporated}} as Walt <b>Disney</b> Productions in 1929. The studio was exclusively dedicated to producing short films until it expanded into feature production in 1934. In 1983, Walt <b>Disney</b> Productions named its live-action film studio Walt <b>Disney</b> Pictures. During a corporate restructuring in 1986, Walt <b>Disney</b> Productions was renamed The Walt <b>Disney</b> Company and the animation division, renamed Walt <b>Disney</b> Feature Animation, became {{a subsidiary of}} its film division, The Walt <b>Disney</b> Studios. In 2007, Walt <b>Disney</b> Feature Animation took on its current name, Walt <b>Disney</b> Animation Studios after Pixar Animation Studios was acquired by <b>Disney</b> in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>Disney</b> {{executives}} who also exercised much influence within the studio were Roy E. <b>Disney</b> (1985–2003, Chairman, Walt <b>Disney</b> Feature Animation), Jeffrey Katzenberg (1984–94, Chairman, The Walt <b>Disney</b> Studios), Michael Eisner (1984–2005, CEO, The Walt <b>Disney</b> Company), and Frank Wells (1984–94, President and COO, The Walt <b>Disney</b> Company). Following Roy Disney's passing in 2009, the WDAS headquarters in Burbank was re-dedicated as The Roy E. <b>Disney</b> Animation Building in May 2010.|$|E

5|$|A <b>Disney</b> Digital 3D {{version of}} the film, the second of a {{traditionally}} animated film, was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} US theatres on February 12, 2010, but the project was postponed. On August 25, 2011, <b>Disney</b> announced that the 3D {{version of the}} film would make its American debut at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre from September 2–15, 2011. <b>Disney</b> spent less than $10 million on the 3D conversion. After the successful 3D re-release of The Lion King, <b>Disney</b> announced a wide 3D re-release of Beauty and the Beast in North America beginning January 13, 2012.|$|E
5|$|A bitter union strike {{began in}} May 1941, which was {{resolved}} without the angered Walt Disney's involvement in July and August of that year. As Walt <b>Disney</b> Productions was {{being set up}} as a union shop, Walt <b>Disney</b> and several studio employees were sent by the US government on a Good Neighbor policy trip to Central and South America. The <b>Disney</b> strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio, from top-level animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their work outside the <b>Disney</b> studio such as Frank Tashlin, Maurice Noble, Walt Kelly, Bill Meléndez, and John Hubley. Hubley, with several other <b>Disney</b> strikers, went on to found the United Productions of America studio, Disney's key animation rival in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} of Pixar's initial seven-film deal with <b>Disney,</b> all {{characters}} created by Pixar for their films were owned by <b>Disney.</b> Furthermore, <b>Disney</b> retained the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film, though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels. In 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Michael Eisner, <b>Disney</b> chairman at the time, put plans in motion to produce Toy Story 3 at a new <b>Disney</b> studio, Circle 7 Animation. Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return, even if Pixar was not on board.|$|E

5|$|Aladdin and The Lion King {{had been}} the highest-grossing films {{worldwide}} in each of their respective release years. Between these in-house productions, <b>Disney</b> diversified in animation methods and produced The Nightmare Before Christmas with former <b>Disney</b> animator Tim Burton. With animation becoming again an increasingly important and lucrative part of Disney's business, the company began to expand its operations. The flagship California studio was split into two units and expanded, and ground was broken on a new <b>Disney</b> Feature Animation building adjacent to the main <b>Disney</b> lot in Burbank, which was dedicated in 1995. The Florida satellite, officially incorporated in 1992, was expanded as well, and one of Disney's television animation studios in the Paris, France suburb of Montreuil– the former Brizzi Brothers studio– became Walt <b>Disney</b> Feature Animation Paris, where A Goofy Movie (1995) and significant parts of later <b>Disney</b> films were produced. Also, <b>Disney</b> began producing lower cost direct to video sequels for its successful animated films using the services of its television animation studios under the name <b>Disney</b> MovieToons. The Return of Jafar (1994), a sequel to Aladdin and a pilot for the Aladdin television show spin-off, {{was the first of}} these productions. Walt <b>Disney</b> Feature Animation was also heavily involved in the adaptations of both Beauty and the Beast in 1994 and The Lion King in 1997 into Broadway musicals.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} deal, John Lasseter, by then Executive Vice President, became Chief Creative Officer (reporting {{directly}} to President and CEO Robert Iger and consulting with <b>Disney</b> Director Roy E. <b>Disney)</b> of both Pixar and Walt <b>Disney</b> Animation Studios (including its division DisneyToon Studios), {{as well as the}} Principal Creative Adviser at Walt <b>Disney</b> Imagineering, which designs and builds the company's theme parks. Catmull retained his position as President of Pixar, while also becoming President of Walt <b>Disney</b> Animation Studios, reporting to Bob Iger and Dick Cook, chairman of The Walt <b>Disney</b> Studios. Steve Jobs' position as Pixar's {{chairman and chief executive officer}} was abolished, and instead, he took a place on the <b>Disney</b> board of directors.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, the <b>Disney</b> short {{subjects}} were no longer being produced on a regular basis, with many of the shorts divisions' personnel either leaving the company or begin reassigned to work on <b>Disney</b> television programs such as The Mickey Mouse Club and Disneyland. While the <b>Disney</b> shorts had dominated the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) during the 1930s, its reign over the award had been ended by MGM's Tom and Jerry cartoons, Warner Bros' Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, and the works of United Productions of America (UPA), whose flat art style and stylized animation techniques were lauded as more modern alternatives to the older <b>Disney</b> style. During the 1950s, only one <b>Disney</b> short, the stylized Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, won the Best Short Subject (Cartoons) Oscar.|$|E

5|$|<b>Disney</b> greenlit Dick Tracy in 1988 {{under the}} {{condition}} that Warren Beatty keep the production budget within $25 million, which began to rise once filming started. It quickly jumped to $30 million and then $47 million as its final production budget. <b>Disney</b> spent an additional $54 million on the marketing campaign, resulting in a total of $101 million spent overall. The financing for Dick Tracy came from <b>Disney</b> and Silver Screen Partners IV, as well as Beatty's own production company, Mulholland Productions. <b>Disney</b> was originally going to release the film under the traditional Walt <b>Disney</b> Pictures banner, but chose instead to release and market the film under the adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures label leading up to the film's theatrical debut, because the studio felt it had too many mature themes for a Disney-branded film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disney</b> had {{originally}} planned to add Giselle to the <b>Disney</b> Princess line-up, as was shown at a 2007 Toy Fair where the Giselle doll was featured with packaging declaring her with <b>Disney</b> Princess status but {{decided against it}} when they realized {{they would have to}} pay for lifelong rights to Amy Adams' image. While Giselle is not being marketed as one of the <b>Disney</b> Princesses, Enchanted merchandise was made available in various outlets with Adams' animated likeness being used on all Giselle merchandise. Giselle led the 2007 Hollywood Holly-Day Parade at Disney's Hollywood Studios. She was also featured in the 2007 Walt <b>Disney</b> World Christmas Day Parade in the Magic Kingdom with the official <b>Disney</b> Princesses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disney</b> {{learns that}} Travers is {{actually}} her pen name, {{taken from her}} father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she's actually Australian, not British.

Arriving unexpectedly at her door, <b>Disney</b> tells her that {{he also had a}} less-than-ideal childhood, but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers to not let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. Travers relents and grants <b>Disney</b> the film rights.|$|E

5|$|Enchanted is a 2007 American musical fantasy {{romantic comedy}} film, {{produced}} by Walt <b>Disney</b> Pictures with New York Academy Barry Sonnenfeld and Josephson Entertainment. Written by Bill Kelly {{and directed by}} Kevin Lima, the film stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, and Susan Sarandon.
