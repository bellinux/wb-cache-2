5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury, curved <b>hard-grass</b> and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
5|$|The shingle ridge {{that protects}} the reserve from the sea and extends to Blakeney Point attracts biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift, bird's foot trefoil and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat. In the damper areas, sea wormwood, sea {{lavender}} and scrubby sea-blite also thrive.

50|$|At {{least two}} rare species are {{associated}} with this community, Curved <b>Hard-grass</b> (Parapholis incurva), and the Rock Sea-lavender (Limonium recurvum). Other members of the Limonium binervosum complex may also occur.|$|E
50|$|Parapholis incurva is {{a species}} of grass native to Europe, Asia and {{northern}} Africa, and widely naturalised elsewhere. Common names include coast barbgrass, curved sea hard grass, curved <b>hard-grass,</b> sicklegrass, curved sicklegrass and curved parapholis.|$|E
50|$|The {{only known}} species is Hainardia cylindrica, known by several common names, {{including}} barbgrass, one-glumed <b>hard-grass,</b> and thintail. It {{is native to}} the Mediterranean and to nearby regions from Madeira and the Canary Islands east to Crimea and Iran. It ia also reportedly naturalized in coastal regions in scattered locales in Australia, New Zealand, the United States (CA OR TX LA SC), Baja California, and temperate South America (Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile).|$|E
50|$|The former creek {{has been}} {{cut off from the}} Crouch Estuary by a seawall, and it has salt marsh plants such as golden {{samphire}} and sea-spurrey. There is a bird hide from which many species of sea birds can be seen. Lower Raypits can be accessed from Lion Creek by the seawall path. It has a variety of pasture, salt marsh and intertidal habitats, with nationally scarce plants such as beaked tasselweed, sea barley, grass vetchling and curved <b>hard-grass.</b> Invertebrates include Roesel's bush-cricket.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinct}} {{habitat is}} provided by the interface between saltmarsh and dune and supports reflexed saltmarsh grass (Puccinellia distans), <b>hard-grass</b> (Parapholis strigosa) and sea-milkwort (Glaux maritima). The dune ridge supports marram (Ammophila arenaria), and lesser meadow-rue (Thalictrum minus) with bloody crane's-bill (Geranium sanguineum) and hound's-tongue (Cynoglossum officinale). Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is found on the lower landward slopes. The site extends to areas of shorter turf, which supports cowslip (Primula veris), early-purple orchid (Orchis mascula), violets (Viola spp.), and yarrow (Achillea millefolium), with widespread early forget-me-not (Myosotis ramosissima), common cornsalad (Valerianella locusta), hairy tare (Vicia hirsuta), and crosswort (Galium cruciata).|$|E
