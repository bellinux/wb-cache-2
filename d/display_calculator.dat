5000|$|The {{adding machine}} range {{began with the}} basic, hand-cranked P100 which was only capable of adding. The design {{included}} some revolutionary features, foremost {{of which was the}} dashpot. The P200 offered a subtraction capability and the P300 provided a means of keeping 2 separate totals. The P400 provided a moveable carriage, and the P600 and top-of-the-range P612 offered some limited programmability based upon the position of the carriage. The range was further extended by the inclusion of the [...] "J" [...] series which provided a single finger calculation facility, and the [...] "c" [...] series of both manual and electrical assisted comptometers. In the late 1960s, the Burroughs sponsored [...] "nixi-tube" [...] provided an electronic <b>display</b> <b>calculator.</b> Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the Sensimatic, which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain ledgers. It could store 9, 18 or 27 balances during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the Sensitronic which could store balances on a magnetic stripe which was part of the ledger card. This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, E2000, E3000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which were computer systems supporting card reader/punches and a line printer.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} an {{examination}} of how the power of visible radiation depends on the temperature. An experiment was carried out to measure {{the relationship between the}} temperature and the emitted radiant power of incandescent tungsten. The experiment enables me to collect data to reach a conclusion between these two variables. Also, bearing in mind that resistor does not obey ohm’s law generally, due to the change of temperature, it is investigated that if the total emitted power would be changed due to this effect. A system was set up to collect data and a “TI- 84 Plus” Graphic <b>Display</b> <b>Calculator</b> was used to calculate quantitative values obtained from the experiment. Also a computer programme (Logger Pro 3. 8) was used to plot graphs which are derived from the data and calculations of the experiment. As a result of the experiment I found that there is a direct correlation between the emitted radiant power and temperature. The results were compared with the law governing the radiant power of an ideal black body, which is called Stefan-Boltzmann Law, to obtain the accuracy of the experimental values. Finally, I evaluated the sources of error and offered reasonable improvements for the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The study {{examined}} classroom instructional practices and teacher's professed conceptions about {{teaching and learning}} college calculus {{in relationship to the}} implementation of scientific-programmable-graphics (SPG) calculators. The study occurred at a university not affiliated with any reform project. The participants were not the catalysts seeking to implement calculus reform, but expressed a willingness to teach the first quarter calculus course with the SPG calculator. The research design was based on qualitative methods using comparative case studies of five teachers. Primary data were collected through pre-school interviews and weekly classroom observations with subsequent interviews. Teachers' profiles were established describing general conceptions of teaching calculus, instructional practices, congruence between conceptions and practice, conceptions about teaching using SPG calculators, instructional practice with SPG calculators, and the relationship of conceptions and practice with SPG calculators. Initially, all the teachers without prior experience using SPG calculators indicated concern and skepticism about the usefulness of the technology in teaching calculus and were uncertain how to utilize the calculator in teaching the calculus concepts. During the study the teachers became less skeptical about the calculator's usefulness and found it effective for illustrating graphs. Some of the teachers' exams included more conceptual and graphically-oriented questions, but were not significantly different from traditional exams. Findings indicated the college teachers' conceptions of teaching calculus were generally consistent with their instructional practice when not constrained by time. The teachers did not perceive a dramatic change in their instructional practices. Rather, the new graphing approach curriculum and technology were assimilated into the teachers' normal teaching practices. No major shifts {{in the role of the}} teachers were detected. Two teachers demonstrated slight differences in their roles when the SPG calculators were used in class. One was a consultant to the students as they used the SPG calculators; the other became a fellow learner as the students presented different features on the calculator. Use of the calculator was influenced by several factors: inexperience with the calculator, time constraints, setting up the classroom <b>display</b> <b>calculator,</b> preferred teaching styles and emphasis, and a willingness to risk experimenting with established teaching practices and habits...|$|E

50|$|Octal became {{widely used}} in {{computing}} when systems such as the PDP-8, ICL 1900 and IBM mainframes employed 12-bit, 24-bit or 36-bit words. Octal was an ideal abbreviation of binary for these machines because their word size is divisible by three (each octal digit represents three binary digits). So four, eight or twelve digits could concisely display an entire machine word. It also cut costs by allowing Nixie tubes, seven-segment <b>displays,</b> and <b>calculators</b> {{to be used for}} the operator consoles, where binary displays were too complex to use, decimal displays needed complex hardware to convert radices, and hexadecimal displays needed to display more numerals.|$|R

A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error.
