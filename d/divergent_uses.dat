40|$|Abstract: The implicit-explicit {{distinction}} {{is applied to}} knowledge representations. Knowledge is taken to be an attitude towards a proposition which is true. The proposition itself predicates a property to some entity. A number {{of ways in which}} knowledge can be implicit or explicit emerge. If a higher aspect is known explicitly then each lower one must also be known explicitly. This partial hierarchy reduces the number of ways in which knowledge can be explicit. In the most important type of implicit knowledge, representations merely reflect the property of objects or events without predicating them of any particular entity. The clearest cases of explicit knowledge of a fact are representations of one’s own attitude of knowing that fact. These distinctions are discussed in their relationship to similar distinctions such as procedural-declarative, conscious-unconscious, verbalizable-nonverbalizable, direct-indirect tests, and automaticvoluntary control. This is followed by an outline of how these distinctions can be used to integrate and relate the often <b>divergent</b> <b>uses</b> of the implicit-explicit distinction in different research areas.

Here, I show that nonhuman reciprocity seems rare mainly because its meaning has changed over time. The original broad concept of reciprocity is well supported by evidence, but subsequent <b>divergent</b> <b>uses</b> of the term have relied on various translations of the strategy ‗tit-for-tat‘ in the repeated Prisoner‘s Dilemma game. This model has resulted in four problematic approaches to defining and testing reciprocity. Authors that deny evidence of nonhuman reciprocity tend to (1) assume that it requires sophisticated cognition, (2) focus exclusively on short-term contingency with a single partner, (3) require paradoxical evidence for a temporary lifetime fitness cost, and (4) assume that responses to investments are fixed. While these restrictions basically define reciprocity out of existence, evidence shows that fungi, plants, fish, birds, rats, and primates enforce mutual benefit by contingently altering their cooperative investments based on the cooperative returns, just as predicted by the original reciprocity theory...|$|E

40|$|Manipulation of {{environmental}} constraints {{has been shown}} to influence the relative amounts of voluntary and involuntary control employed by a person to complete a task, as well as the resulting structure of performance variability. Generally, the voluntary control required when no constraints are present leads to self-similar changes in performance, some constraint provides involuntary control that leads to random fluctuations in performance, and constraint which provides feedback about performance accuracy can result in anti-persistent variability. The current study investigated whether providing two groups of individuals with different intentions for the same task would produce changes in voluntary and involuntary control similar to that observed following the manipulation of task constraints.

Recent studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated that the yeast Sin 3 protein contributes to {{the restoration of the}} repressed chromatin structure at actively transcribed loci. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the restoration of the repressive chromatin structure at transcribed loci and its significance in gene expression have not been investigated in mammals. We report here the identification of a mammalian complex containing the corepressor Sin 3 B, the histone deacetylase HDAC 1, Mrg 15, and the PHD finger-containing Pf 1 and show that this complex plays important roles in regulation of transcription. We demonstrate that this complex localizes at discrete loci approximately 1 kb downstream of the transcription start site of transcribed genes, and this localization requires both Pf 1 's and Mrg 15 's interaction with chromatin. Inactivation of this mammalian complex promotes increased RNAP II progression within transcribed regions and subsequent increased transcription. Our results define a novel mammalian complex that contributes to the regulation of transcription and point to <b>divergent</b> <b>uses</b> of the Sin 3 protein homologues throughout evolution in the modulation of transcription...|$|E

My dissertation studies the life and works of three religious women in their respective communities: Teresa de Cartagena, Sor María de Santo Domingo, and Santa Teresa de Ávila.

I argue that their contact with friends and enemies inside and outside of their order and the church displays a variety of empowerment strategies. To deploy these series of strategies, religious women fashioned images of themselves that prove to diverge from their personal opinions and feelings. My dissertation thus frames the life and works of three early-modern women in the theory of female community developed over the last ten years by critics such as Stephanie Tarbin, Susan Broomhall, Stephanie Kirk, or Melissa Harkider.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{story of}} Miami, Florida {{is written in}} water. While {{the image of the}} city is {{dominated}} by the sea and oceanfront development, there is another body of water that has helped forge Miami into the cosmopolitan city it is today [...] its' river. The Miami river was once a vital corridor connecting diverse landscapes, peoples, and goods. In current times with pressures of urban growth and development the river has been severed, channelized and dredged to serve economic interests. Oceanfront development has established a dangerous precedence of exclusivity by design, further filtering its' already fragmented demographic. These forces have left Miami with a deficit in public space. The goal of this thesis is to re-envision the river corridor from a static economic trade infrastructure into a community infrastructure that would engage ecological processes, foster a sense of community and challenge traditional spatial relationships of river-city-public space. To re-establish the river within Miami's popular imagination, this thesis proposes the `re-wilding' of the riverine terrain to anchor a site specific program combining a community space and after school education. This two-fold approach explores how building and landscape can mediate the amphibious terrain of river and city, community needs for public space, respecting the demands of a "working river" and maritime industries, while instilling an ecological conscious. This thesis re-imagines the Miami riverfront as a richly layered system that is capable of sustaining <b>divergent</b> <b>uses</b> and users...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} ‘international {{comparison of}} performances’ (ICP) bringing together two topics: {{the making of}} ‘knowledge for policy’ and the States’ current trust on international organizations and their technologies for the monitoring of national education systems. The central purpose {{is to examine the}} processes and the meanings that support the production and the transnational circulation of ICP as crucial, and almost naturalized, elements for contemporary policy-making and public debates on educational issues. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), carried out by the OECD, is taken as an example of ICP. This paper brings to the fore two major footprints from studying the production and circulation of PISA. They are related with the discussion of the apparent centrality achieved by ICP in education policy issues. It underlines that <b>divergent</b> <b>uses</b> of data and ideas provided by the Programme go hand-in-hand with convergence towards its regular use in policy-making and in public debates. Like others ICP, PISA is a carrier of guilt and produces guilt. “Norm and standard” tools operate through the culpability and the responsibility that they carry to national spaces and agencies. But their strength rests also on the hope they create. Thus, the uncomfortable numbers that bring “blaming and shaming” to the national policy spheres and actors also convey to them the encouragement of regularly having in hands the ‘need to change’ flag. The actant allows them to legitimise policy problems and solutions with the “independent expert knowledge” marker...|$|E

This can have profound consequences for ecosystem services upon which human welfare depends. Understanding of this behavior is in many aspects still in its infancy. Resilience has been argued to provide insurance against unforeseen ecosystem responses {{in the face of}} environmental change, and has become a prime goal for the management of coral reefs. However, diverse definitions of resilience {{can be found in the}} literature, making its meaning ambiguous. Several studies have used the term as a theoretical framework and concern regarding its practical applicability has been raised. Consequently, operationalizing theory to make resilience observable is an important task, particularly for policy makers and managers dealing with pressing environmental problems. Ultimately this requires some type of empirical assessments, something that has proven difficult due to the multidimensional nature of the concept. Biodiversity, spatial heterogeneity, and connectivity have been proposed as cornerstones of resilience as they may provide insurance against ecological uncertainty. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the <b>divergent</b> <b>uses</b> of the concept and to propose empirical indicators of the cornerstones of coral reef resilience. These indicators include functional group approaches, the ratios of "good" and "bad" colonizers of space, measurements of spatial heterogeneity, and estimates of potential space availability against grazing capacity. The essence of these operational indicators of resilience is to use them as predictive tools to recognize vulnerability before disturbance occurs that may lead to abrupt phase shifts. Moving toward operationalizing resilience theory is imperative to the successful management of coral reefs in an increasingly disturbed and human-dominated environment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{historical}} {{account of the}} emergence and evolution of new Islamic educational institutions in Saudi Arabia {{in the twentieth century}} which came to sit at the heart of migratory circuits of students and scholars from across the globe. It pays special attention to the Islamic University of Medina (IUM), which was launched by the Saudi state in 1961 to offer fully-funded religious instruction to mostly non-Saudi students. Exploring the history of this missionary project provides a point of departure for interrogating the commonplace claim that Saudi actors have taken advantage of wealth derived from oil rents in recent decades to fund the export of Wahhabism. In order to understand the far-reaching cultural, social and political dynamics that have emerged from this nexus between migration, education, material investment and religious mission, this study develops a historiography grounded in a novel conception of transnational religious economies. These are understood to consist in flows – both within and across national borders – of material capital, spiritual capital, religious migrants and social technologies. While Saudi state spending has been crucial for the operation of institutions like the IUM, its missionary project has also drawn on a far wider range of resources within the terms of these economies, including migrant labour, sources of symbolic legitimation and modes of pedagogy appropriated from beyond the Peninsula. The IUM’s syllabuses, whilst firmly rooted in core Wahhabi concerns, have also been shaped by processes of hegemonic engagement with migrant students. Finally, students bearing spiritual capital accumulated on its campus have themselves made <b>divergent</b> <b>uses</b> of these resources in locations around the world. The notion of transnational religious economies developed here shines light on the multiple resources, border crossings, historical contingencies, interests and forms of agency bound up in the articulation of a power-laden, state-led project of “religious expansion”...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to augment {{explanations}} of how newly implemented technologies enable network change within organizations with an understanding of when such change is likely to happen. Drawing on the emerging literature on technology affordances, the paper suggests that informal network change within interdependent organizational groups is unlikely to occur until users converge on a shared appropriation of the new technology’s features such that the affordances the technology enables are jointly realized. In making the argument for the importance of shared affordances, this paper suggests that group-level network change has its most profound implications at the organization level when individuals use the same subset of a new information technology’s features. To explore this tentative theory, we turn to a comparative, multimethod, longitudinal study of computer-based simulation technology use in automotive engineering. The findings of this explanatory case study show that engineers used the new technology for more than three months, during which time neither group experienced changes to their advice networks. Initially, <b>divergent</b> <b>uses</b> of the technology’s features by engineers in both groups precluded them from being able to coordinate their work in ways that allowed them to structure their advice networks differently. Eventually, engineers in only one of the two groups converged on the use of a common set of the technology’s features to enact a shared affordance. This convergence was necessary to turn the technology into a resource that could collectively afford group members the ability to compare their simulation outputs with one another and, in so doing, alter the content and structure of the group’s advice network. The implications of these findings for the literatures on tech-nology feature use, affordances, social networks, and post-adoption behaviors in organizations are discussed...|$|E
