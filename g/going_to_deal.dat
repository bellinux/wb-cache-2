500|$|... "Kidney Now!" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on March 5, 2009; it was filmed on March 16–17, 2009. [...] "He Needs a Kidney", the charity song {{featured}} in this episode, was written by show composer and co-executive producer Jeff Richmond. Richmond is married to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. In discussion {{of the development of}} [...] "Kidney Now!", Richmond said that Carlock and Fey [...] "were trying {{to figure out a way}} to highlight Jack's dad in getting a kidney and how they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with that", and that the two came to the decision to [...] "take advantage of the singing", as they have done so in the past with different 30 Rock episodes, in which the show's characters have sung songs. Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, [...] "We Are the World", [...] as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a kidney donor. [...] "Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but they want to get a kidney. I think we had angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, and we thought 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph.|$|E

But as I pounded away, I felt a jolt of pain shoot through my left arm. Oh damn, the thumb." [...] Joe would say. Joe knew immediately the thumb of his left hand was damaged, though he wasn't sure as to the extent. [...] "In the midst of the fight, with your adrenaline pumping, it's hard to gauge such things. My mind was on more important matters. Like how I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with Yemelyanov {{for the rest of the}} fight." [...] The match ended when the Soviet's handlers threw in the towel at 1:49 in the second round, and the referee raised Joe's injured hand in victory.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2013, Marvel {{announced}} The Fearless Defenders #10 (October 2013) would {{tie into}} the Infinity crossover event. Bunn said, [...] "The main Infinity crossover {{will be in}} Fearless Defenders #10. They're here on Earth facing the threat of Thanos’ forces trying to raze the city of New York... At the same time though, {{not only are they}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>dealing</b> with Thanos’ forces, they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>dealing</b> with the ever-present Caroline Le Fay who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be up to no good during this event and it's all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> center around this new character who'll be surfacing in the issue, a new super-powered individual." [...] Bunn also revealed that The Fearless Defenders #10 will be a dance issue explaining, [...] "I’m not sure how many dance comic books are out there anyway, but definitely not dance super hero comics. I’ve tried to do different things with the book from the beginning and this issue will definitely live up to that ideal." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{next morning}} gay leaders convened in a {{committee}} {{room in the}} Civic Center. Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, along with the more militant gays of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, {{made it clear that}} nobody was to apologize for the riots. Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put up with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|R
6000|$|It is, indeed, so {{difficult}} a thing, that I scarce know what stated rule {{to lay down}} {{for the conduct of}} a tradesman in this case:--A tradesman at a distance is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with another tradesman, my neighbour; and before he comes to bargain, or before he cares to trust him, he goes, weakly enough perhaps, to inquire of him, and of his circumstances, among his neighbours and fellow-tradesmen, perhaps of the same profession or employment, and who, among other things, it may be, are concerned by their interest, that this tradesman's credit should not rise too fast. What must be done in this case? ...|$|E
60|$|But then, in the mid-career of {{that third}} day of the {{geological}} drama, came a frost--a nipping-frost; and slowly but surely the whole arctic and antarctic worlds were chilled and cramped, degree after degree, by the gradual on-coming of the Great Ice Age. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> here with either the causes or the extent of that colossal cataclysm; I shall take all those for granted at present: what we are concerned with now are the results it left behind--the changes which it wrought on fauna and flora and on human society. Especially is it of importance in this connection {{to point out that}} the Glacial epoch is not yet entirely finished--if, indeed, it is ever destined to be finished. We are living still on the fringe of the Ice Age, in a cold and cheerless era, the legacy of the accumulated glaciers of the northern and southern snow-fields.|$|E
6000|$|The {{disadvantage}} of an opening {{like this is}} that it holds the same quality, if not quantity, of disappointment as those other sublime things, and we earnestly entreat the reader to guard himself against expecting anything considerable from it. Probably the inexperienced reader has imagined from our weighty prologue something of signal importance to follow; but the reader who has been our reader through thick and thin for many years will have known from the first that we were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with anything more vital, say, than a few emotions and memories, prompted, one night of the other winter, by hearing one of the old-fashioned Italian operas which a more than commonly inspired management had been purveying to an over-Wagnered public. In fact, we had a sense that this sort of reader was there with us the night we saw [...] "L'Elisir d'Amore," [...] and that it was in his personality we felt and remembered many things which we could have fancied personal only to ourselves.|$|E

60|$|Later, Mr. Camp gave {{me another}} chance. He {{agreed to buy}} our Tennessee land for two hundred {{thousand}} dollars, pay {{a part of the}} amount in cash and give long notes for the rest. His scheme was to import foreigners from grape-growing and wine-making districts in Europe, settle them on the land, {{and turn it into a}} wine-growing country. He knew what Mr. Longworth thought of those Tennessee grapes, and was satisfied. I sent the contracts and things to Orion for his signature, he being one of the three heirs. But they arrived at a bad time--in a doubly bad time, in fact. The temperance virtue was temporarily upon him in strong force, and he wrote and said that he would not be a party to debauching the country with wine. Also he said how could he know whether Mr. Camp was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> fairly and honestly with those poor people from Europe or not?--and so, without waiting to find out, he quashed the whole trade, and there it fell, never to be brought to life again. The land, from being suddenly worth two hundred thousand dollars, became as suddenly worth what it was before--nothing, and taxes to pay. I had paid the taxes and the other expenses for some years, but I dropped the Tennessee land there, and have never taken any interest in it since, pecuniarily or otherwise, until yesterday.|$|E
6000|$|Next I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with another}} question, with which perhaps I {{ought to have}} started. What is literature? It has often been defined. Emerson says it is {{a record of the}} best {{thoughts}}. [...] "By literature," [...] says another author, [...] "we mean the written thoughts and feelings of intelligent men and women arranged in a way that shall give pleasure to the reader." [...] A third account is that [...] "the aim of a student of literature is to know the best that has been thought in the world." [...] Definitions always appear to me in these things to be in the nature of vanity. I feel that the attempt to be compact in the definition of literature ends in something that is rather meagre, partial, starved, and unsatisfactory. I turn to the answer given by a great French writer to a question not quite the same, viz. [...] "What is a classic?" [...] Literature consists of a whole body of classics in the true sense of the word, and a classic, as Sainte-Beuve defines him, is an [...] "author who has enriched the human mind, who has really added to its treasure, who has got it to take a step further; who has discovered some unequivocal moral truth, or penetrated to some eternal passion, in that heart of man where it seemed as though all were known and explored, who has produced his thought, or his observation, or his invention under some form, no matter what, so it be great, large, acute, and reasonable, sane and beautiful in itself; who has spoken to all in a style of his own, yet a style which finds itself the style of everybody,--in a style that Is at once new and antique, and is the contemporary of all the ages." [...] Another Frenchman, Doudan, who died in 1872, has an excellent passage on the same subject:-- ...|$|E
60|$|From {{these various}} excursions, {{and a good}} many others (including one to Manassas), we gained a pretty lively idea {{of what was going}} on; but, after all, if {{compelled}} to pass a rainy day in the hall and parlors of Willard's Hotel, it proved about as profitably spent as if we had floundered through miles of Virginia mud, in quest of interesting matter. This hotel, in fact, may be much more justly called the centre of Washington and the Union than either the Capitol, the White House, or the State Department. Everybody may be seen there. It is the meeting-place of the true representatives of the country,--not such as are chosen blindly and amiss by electors who take a folded ballot from the hand of a local politician, and thrust it into the ballot-box unread, but men who gravitate or are attracted hither by real business, or a native impulse to breathe the intensest atmosphere of the nation's life, or a genuine anxiety to see how this life-and-death struggle is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with us. Nor these only, but all manner of loafers. Never, in any other spot, was there such a miscellany of people. You exchange nods with governors of sovereign States; you elbow illustrious men, and tread on the toes of generals; you hear statesmen and orators speaking in their familiar tones. You are mixed up with office-seekers, wire-pullers, inventors, artists, poets, prosers (including editors, army-correspondents, attaches of foreign journals, and long-winded talkers), clerks, diplomatists, mail-contractors, railway-directors, until your own identity is lost among them. Occasionally you talk with a man whom you have never before heard of, and are struck with the brightness of a thought, and fancy that there is more wisdom hidden among the obscure than is anywhere revealed among the famous. You adopt the universal habit of the place, and call for mint-julep, a whiskey-skin, a gin-cocktail, a brandy smash, or a glass of pure Old Rye; for the conviviality of Washington sets in at an early hour, and, so far as I had opportunity of observing, never terminates at any hour, and all these drinks are continually in request by almost all these people. A constant atmosphere of cigar-smoke, too, envelops the motley crowd, and forms a sympathetic medium, in which men meet more closely and talk more frankly than in any other kind of air. If legislators would smoke in session, they might speak truer words, and fewer of them, and bring about more valuable results.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Bigmouth gigged all over town, {{building}} a substantial following via energetic performances and a self-released CD. They were courted {{by a number of}} major labels, but never quite closed the deal. By 1997, Hicken was disillusioned and decided to call it quits. [...] "I couldn't do it anymore," [...] he recalls. [...] "I was in pieces. I'd show up for rehearsal and have these massive anxiety attacks. I had spent my whole life telling myself I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a rock star, and then I realized it wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. <b>Dealing</b> with that really crushed me.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Sondheim {{has said}} that he {{expected}} backlash from the public due to the content.

Nowadays, virtually everything goes," [...] he told The New York Times.|$|R
50|$|Because {{nanotechnology}} {{in the new}} age is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{most likely}} <b>deal</b> with {{both dry and wet}} in conjunction with each other, there is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to be a change in the way society looks at engineering and manufacturing. People will have to be not only well educated in engineering but also in biology because the integration of the two is how there will be the largest improvements in nanotechnology.|$|R
60|$|You see now {{the scope}} of the claim I am making for the novel; it is to be the social mediator, the vehicle of understanding, the {{instrument}} of self-examination, the parade of morals and the exchange of manners, the factory of customs, the criticism of laws and institutions and of social dogmas and ideas. It is to be the home confessional, the initiator of knowledge, the seed of fruitful self-questioning. Let me be very clear here. I do not mean for a moment that the novelist is going to set up as a teacher, as a sort of priest with a pen, who will make men and women believe and do this and that. The novel is not a new sort of pulpit; humanity is passing out of the phase when men sit under preachers and dogmatic influences. But the novelist {{is going to be the}} most potent of artists, because he is going to present conduct, devise beautiful conduct, discuss conduct analyse conduct, suggest conduct, illuminate it through and through. He will not teach, but discuss, point out, plead, and display. And this being my view you will be prepared for the demand I am now about to make for an absolutely free hand for the novelist in his choice of topic and incident and in his method of treatment; or rather, if I may presume to speak for other novelists, I would say it is not so much a demand we make as an intention we proclaim. We are going to write, subject only to our limitations, about the whole of human life. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with political questions and religious questions and social questions. We cannot present people unless we have this free hand, this unrestricted field. What is the good of telling stories about people's lives if one may not deal freely with the religious beliefs and organisations that have controlled or failed to control them? What is the good of pretending to write about love, and the loyalties and treacheries and quarrels of men and women, if one must not glance at those varieties of physical temperament and organic quality, those deeply passionate needs and distresses from which half the storms of human life are brewed? We mean to deal with all these things, and it will need very much more than the disapproval of provincial librarians, the hostility of a few influential people in London, the scurrility of one paper, and the deep and obstinate silences of another, to stop the incoming tide of aggressive novel-writing. We are going to write about it all. We are going to write about business and finance and politics and precedence and pretentiousness and decorum and indecorum, until a thousand pretences and ten thousand impostures shrivel in the cold, clear air of our elucidations. We are going to write of wasted opportunities and latent beauties until a thousand new ways of living open to men and women. We are going to appeal to the young and the hopeful and the curious, against the established, the dignified, and defensive. Before we have done, we will have all life within {{the scope of}} the novel.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{reception}} from adult critics, the series established its young stars, particularly Matthew Laborteaux and Todd Porter, as popular teen idols of the mid-1980s, with pinups and articles appearing in numerous teen magazines, including 16 magazine, Bop and Teen Beat, among others. [...] While Laborteaux had already garnered notoriety among teen audiences {{for his role}} as Albert Ingalls on the long-running NBC family frontier drama, Little House on the Prairie, Whiz Kids launched Porter as a new fixture in the various teen magazines of the era.

500|$|Comparing it to {{the more}} subdued {{palettes}} of his prior Radiohead artworks, Donwood described the cover's bright, [...] "pleasing" [...] colours as [...] "ominous because all these colours that I've used are derived from the petrol-chemical industry...

[...] Essayist Amy Britton interpreted the artwork as an allusion to the Bush administration's [...] "road map for peace" [...] plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Joseph Tate, likening the art to the paintings of French artist Jean Dubuffet, found it depicted a [...] "homogenized and heavily regimented" [...] portrayal of [...] "capitalism's glaring visual presence: an oppressive sameness of style and color that mirrors globalization's reduction of difference." [...] Other artworks included with the album refer to cities including New York, London, Grozny, and Baghdad. Early editions contained a fold-out road map of the cover.|$|R
