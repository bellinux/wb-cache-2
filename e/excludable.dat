2500|$|Social {{goods are}} defined as public goods that could be {{delivered}} as private goods, but are usually delivered by the government for various reasons, including social policy, and funded via public funds like taxes. Note that some writers have used the term [...] "public good" [...] to refer only to non-excludable [...] "pure public goods" [...] and refer to <b>excludable</b> public goods as [...] "club goods".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the inefficiencies and inequities of club goods {{exclusions}} sometimes cause potentially <b>excludable</b> club goods {{to be treated}} as public goods, and their production financed by some other mechanism. [...] Examples of such [...] "natural" [...] club goods include natural monopolies with very high fixed costs, private golf courses, cinemas, cable television and social clubs. [...] This explains why many such goods are often provided or subsidized by governments, co-operatives or volunteer associations, rather than being left to be supplied by profit-minded entrepreneurs. [...] These goods are often known as social goods.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definition}} of non-excludability {{states that it}} is impossible to exclude individuals from consumption. [...] Technology now allows radio or TV broadcasts to be encrypted such that persons without a special decoder are excluded from the broadcast. Many forms of information goods have characteristics of public goods. For example, a poem can be read by many people without reducing the consumption of that good by others; in this sense, it is non-rivalrous. Similarly, the information in most patents can be used by any party without reducing consumption of that good by others. Official statistics provide a clear example of information goods that are public goods, since they are created to be non-excludable. [...] Creative works may be <b>excludable</b> in some circumstances, however: the individual who wrote the poem may decline to share it with others by not publishing it. Copyrights and patents both encourage the creation of such non-rival goods by providing temporary monopolies, or, in the terminology of public goods, providing a legal mechanism to enforce excludability for a limited period of time. For public goods, the [...] "lost revenue" [...] of the producer of the good is not part of the definition: a public good is a good whose consumption does not reduce any other's consumption of that good.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} an <b>excludable</b> good could be a magazine; {{people who do not}} pay for the {{subscription}} are mostly excluded from obtaining a copy directly from the publisher. Another case is a pay television subscription, which is <b>excludable</b> but non-rivalrous.|$|E

5000|$|The Court {{acknowledged}} {{that under the}} statutory definition of §61(a), [...] gross income includes compensation for services amongst all other income from whatever source derived. Section 1.61-2(d)(10 of Treasury Regulations states, [...] "If services are paid for other than in money, the fair {{market value of the}} property or services taken in payment must be included in income." [...] The Court presumed that if the lodging furnished to plaintiff was compensation to him, the fair rental value of the lodging would be includable in his gross income unless <b>excludable</b> under another provision of the Code. So, because of Section 119, the fair rental value of the residence supplied to plaintiffs by Sekiyu in 1970 and 1971 is <b>excludable</b> from his gross income.|$|E

Jesse Helms, Washington D.C. in 1989 In 1987, Helms added {{an amendment to the}} Supplemental Appropriations Act, which directed the president to use executive authority to add HIV infection to the list of <b>excludable</b> diseases which prevent both travel and immigration to the United States. [...] The action was opposed by the U.S. Public Health Service. Congress restored the executive authority to remove HIV from the list of <b>excludable</b> conditions in the 1990 Immigration Reform Act, and in January 1991, Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan announced he would delete HIV from the list of <b>excludable</b> conditions. A letter-writing campaign headed by Helms ultimately convinced President Bush not to lift the ban, and left the United States the only industrialized nation in the world to prohibit travel based on HIV status. The travel ban was also responsible for the cancellation of the 1992 International AIDS Conference in Boston. On January 5, 2010, the 22-year-old ban was lifted after having been signed by President Barack Obama on October 30, 2009.|$|E
