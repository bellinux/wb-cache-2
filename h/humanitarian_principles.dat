5|$|On {{behalf of}} Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither {{the common law}} of England, nor any law made by Parliament {{recognised}} the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal. Moreover, English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person's consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than <b>humanitarian</b> <b>principles.</b> A law passed in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown, which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery. When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract {{for the sale of}} a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.|$|E

Churches attempting to respect impartiality while implementing a food aid project for Syrian refugees have sought to mitigate potential problems through relationship-building and promotion of human dignity in order to ensure needs-responsiveness.

25|$|The {{success of}} {{humanitarian}} intervention {{in international affairs}} is varied. As discussed above, humanitarian intervention is a contentious issue. Examples of humanitarian intervention illustrate, {{that in some cases}} intervention can lead to disastrous results, as in Srebrenica and Somalia. In other cases, a lack of clarity as to the rules of when intervention can occur has resulted in tragic inaction, as was witnessed during the Rwandan genocide. One example is of a successful humanitarian intervention and also of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>principles</b> being applied is East Timor which, prior to its independence, was plagued with massive human rights abuses by pro-Indonesian militias and an insurgency war led by indigenous East Timorese against Indonesian forces. A peacekeeping mission was deployed to safeguard the move to independence and the UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This not only dealt with traditional security priorities, but also helped in nation building projects, coordinated humanitarian aid and civil rehabilitation, illustrating not only a successful humanitarian intervention but also an effective application of human security principles.|$|E

For missions that require criminal investigation, the organisation incorporates a network of undercover agents headed by English aristocrat Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward and her butler Aloysius Parker. Based at Creighton-Ward Mansion in Kent, Penelope and Parker's primary mode of transport is FAB 1, a specially-modified Rolls-Royce. The most persistent of IR's adversaries is the criminal known only as the [...] "Hood". Operating from a temple in the Malaysian jungle, and possessing abilities of hypnosis and dark magic, he exerts a powerful telepathic control over Kyrano, his estranged half-brother, and manipulates the Tracys into missions that unfold according to his nefarious designs. This allows him to spy on the Thunderbird machines and, by selling their secrets, make himself rich.|$|E
500|$|Darwin's {{views on}} social and {{political}} issues reflected his time and social position. He {{grew up in a}} family of Whig reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported electoral reform and the emancipation of slaves. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave John Edmonstone, who he long recalled as [...] "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the Beagle voyage. These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century, but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against [...] "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people. He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his <b>humanitarian</b> <b>principles.</b>|$|E

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} the complex relationships between conflict, displacement, aid, and economics. Providing {{a brief overview}} of the context of civil war in Syria and an analysis of development literature on micro- and macroeconomic consequences of conflict and displacement, it critically {{analyzes the}} role of emergency humanitarian aid in contribution to the persisting conflict in Syria. It then discusses relationships of humanitarian aid and conflict through past cases of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Rwanda. These two case studies have been chosen in order to demonstrate how aid can inadvertently become contributive to funding war economies, and also how the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>principle</b> of neutrality may render aid implementation and civilian safety vulnerable to manipulation. Finally, this report offers implications to consider for the current conflict economy in Syria, suggesting that it is imperative for humanitarian donors and practitioners to more responsibly allocate aid and resources.

From this perspective, the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>principle</b> is drawn and subsequently applied to the current EU and Czech asylum policy. The hypothesis is {{that it is possible to}} adopt a more flexible and open asylum policy in the EU and Czech Republic, with very limited impact on the national and supranational expenditures.

2500|$|Despite {{the sense}} of a natural fit between human {{security}} concepts and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>principles</b> they have enjoyed a difficult relationship. Human security perspectives have the potential to interfere with the traditionally apolitical nature of humanitarianism in conflict situations, leading to a blurring of the boundaries between politico-military interventions and those designed primarily to reduce suffering. In another sense the emphasis on human security has legitimised the idea of armed international intervention as a [...] "moral duty" [...] if states are deemed incapable or unwilling of protecting their citizens.

40|$|Recognising {{increased}} vulnerabilities {{because of}} ongoing urbanisation, the Philippine Red Cross {{has embarked on}} a five-year programme to strengthen the resilience of poor settlements in the National Capital city of Valenzuela. The programme expands the organisation’s traditional response orientation to also address underlying causes of structural vulnerability, and as such puts the organisation ahead of many other Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. While this engagement fits the organisation because of its mandate, strategies and reach, the traditional strengths of the organisation increasingly emerge as challenging factors. Applying a ‘resilience approach’, particularly in Manila’s urban humanitarian arena, also puts pressure on how the Philippine Red Cross is able to be guided by its Fundamental Principles, especially in relation to donor obligations, working with non-Red Cross organisations, engaging with communities and taking a more critical role towards the government. The approach requires a transformation in mind set and activities that requires time to achieve.

2500|$|NATO {{published}} {{a statement on}} the war in Donbass and the Crimean Crisis in August 2014. It attempted to debunk the Russian government's accusations against the Ukrainian government, and also other statements made by Russia to justify its presence in Ukraine. According to the statement, Russia attempted to [...] "divert attention away from its actions" [...] and [...] "levelled a series of accusations against NATO which are based on misrepresentations of the facts". It also said that Russia [...] "made baseless attacks on the legitimacy of the Ukrainian authorities and has used force to seize part of Ukraine's territory". In response to the unauthorised entry of the Russian humanitarian convoy on 22 August, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that this incident could [...] "only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel. The disregard of international <b>humanitarian</b> <b>principles</b> raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists". Late in August, NATO generals met and revised their assessment of the military situation in Donbass. They said that, from the Ukrainian government's point of view, the war is already lost. It was anticipated that the late-August offensive in southern Donetsk Oblast could be used to create a Russian land corridor to Crimea, consolidating the illegal annexation of the peninsula. NATO general Philip Breedlove said on 20 September that the ceasefire implemented as part of the Minsk Protocol was [...] "a ceasefire in name only", and criticised Russia for allowing men and equipment to flow freely across its border into Donbass.|$|E
