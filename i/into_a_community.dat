5|$|As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was {{instrumental}} in turning French policy away from the Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar.

Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states (international democracy), not the power politics of domination.|$|E

25|$|Although {{most of the}} Jewish {{people during}} this period, {{especially}} the wealthy families, were {{to be found in}} Babylonia, the existence they led there, under the successive rulers of the Achaemenids, the Seleucids, the Parthians, and the Sassanians, was obscure and devoid of political influence. The poorest but most fervent of the exiles returned to Judah / the Land of Israel during the reign of the Achaemenids (c. 550–330 BCE). There, with the reconstructed Temple in Jerusalem as their center, they organized themselves <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>community,</b> animated by a remarkable religious ardor and a tenacious attachment to the Torah as the focus of its identity. As this little nucleus increased in numbers with the accession of recruits from various quarters, it awoke to a consciousness of itself, and strove once again for national independence and political enfranchisement and sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, the school parking lot and land were used {{for a number of}} uses, {{including}} a parking lot for city vehicles.

In 1999, the Accucrete construction company offered to buy the property, but the city could not work out a deal and the offer was withdrawn in 2001. The Crummell School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The Washington Animal Rescue League offered to lease the school for use as an animal shelter in early 2004, but this proposal was not accepted. Community residents long pressed the city to turn the school <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> center, but city officials said the structure needed at least $7 million in renovations (but was only worth $1.65 million).|$|E
