5|$|Larger drugs (>500 Da) can {{provoke a}} {{neutralizing}} immune response, {{particularly if the}} drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not <b>immunogenic,</b> but may be co-administered with an <b>immunogenic</b> compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods {{have been developed to}} predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.|$|E
5|$|Their sting {{generally}} only {{causes a}} mild local reaction in humans; however, {{it is one}} of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia. The ant venom is particularly <b>immunogenic</b> for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant allergies. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from anaphylactic reactions (increased heart rate, falling blood pressure, and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, there were four deaths due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E
25|$|There is {{a working}} {{therapeutic}} HPV vaccine. It {{has gone through}} 3 clinical trials. The vaccine is officially called the MEL-1 vaccine but {{also known as the}} MVA-E2 vaccine. In a study {{it has been suggested that}} an <b>immunogenic</b> peptide pool containing epitopes that can be effective against all the high-risk HPV strains circulating globally and 14 conserved <b>immunogenic</b> peptide fragments from 4 early proteins (E1, E2, E6 and E7) of 16 high-risk HPV types providing CD8+ responses.|$|E
25|$|Another {{way to make}} wheat less <b>immunogenic</b> is {{to insert}} {{proteolytic}} sites in the longer motifs (25-mer and 33-mer), facilitating more complete digestion.|$|E
25|$|A {{biopharmaceutical}} {{company called}} Soligenix, Inc. has licensed an anti-ricin vaccine called RiVax™ from Vitetta et al. at UT Southwestern. The vaccine {{is safe and}} <b>immunogenic</b> in mice, rabbits, and humans. It has completed two successful clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Conjugate– certain {{bacteria}} have polysaccharide outer coats {{that are}} poorly <b>immunogenic.</b> By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g., toxins), {{the immune system}} can be led to recognize the polysaccharide {{as if it were}} a protein antigen. This approach is used in the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{regarding}} the immunogenicity of IPS cells arose in 2011 when Zhou et al. performed a study involving a teratomaformation assay and demonstrated that IPS cells produced an immune response {{strong enough to}} cause rejection of the cells. When a similar procedure was performed on genetically equivalent ES cells however, Zhou et al. found teratomas, which indicated that the cells were tolerated by the immune system. In 2013, Araki et al. attempted to reproduce the conclusion obtained by Zhou et al. using a different procedure. They took cells from a chimera that had been grown from IPSC clones and a mouse embryo, this tissue was then transplanted into syngenic mice. They conducted a similar trial using ES cells instead of IPSC clone and compared the results. Findings indicate {{that there was no}} significant difference in the <b>immunogenic</b> response produced by the IPS cells and the ES cells. Furthermore, Araki et al. reported little or no <b>immunogenic</b> response for both cell lines. Thus, Araki et al. was unable to come to the same conclusion as Zhou et al.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{inducing}} dendritic cells to present tumor antigens is by vaccination with autologous tumor lysates or short peptides (small parts of protein {{that correspond to}} the protein antigens on cancer cells). These peptides are often given in combination with adjuvants (highly <b>immunogenic</b> substances) to increase the immune and anti-tumor responses. Other adjuvants include proteins or other chemicals that attract and/or activate dendritic cells, such as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).|$|E
25|$|Tetanus can be {{prevented}} through the highly effective tetanus vaccine, which is a tetanus toxin inactivated with formaldehyde to be <b>immunogenic</b> but not pathogenic. The vaccine can be formulated as simple or adsorbed tetanus vaccine, combined tetanus and killed polio vaccine, or the older (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) (DPT) vaccine. Side effects are rare, {{but if they do}} occur, include fever, pain (sometimes long lasting) at the injection site, unexplained crying in infants, and irritability in older children or adults.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} predisposing lung diseases—such as {{persistent}} asthma or cystic fibrosis (or rarer {{diseases such as}} chronic granulomatous disease or Hyper-IgE syndrome)—several factors lead to {{an increased risk of}} ABPA. These include immune factors (such as atopy or <b>immunogenic</b> HLA-restricted phenotypes), as well as genetic factors (such as CFTR gene mutations in both asthmatics and cystic fibrosis patients). By allowing Aspergillus spores to persist in pulmonary tissues, it permits successful germination which leads to hyphae growing in mucus plugs.|$|E
25|$|To reduce murine {{antibody}} immunogenicity (attacks by {{the immune}} system against the antibody), murine molecules were engineered to remove <b>immunogenic</b> content and to increase immunologic efficiency. This was initially achieved by the production of chimeric (suffix -ximab) and humanized antibodies (suffix -zumab). Chimeric antibodies are composed of murine variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Taking human gene sequences from the kappa light chain and the IgG1 heavy chain results in antibodies that are approximately 65% human. This reduces immunogenicity, and thus increases serum half-life.|$|E
25|$|There are high-risk HPV types, {{that are}} not {{affected}} by available vaccines. Ongoing research {{is focused on the}} development of HPV vaccines that will offer protection against a broader range of HPV types. One such method is a vaccine based on the minor capsid protein L2, which is highly conserved across HPV genotypes. Efforts for this have included boosting the immunogenicity of L2 by linking together short amino acid sequences of L2 from different oncogenic HPV types or by displaying L2 peptides on a more <b>immunogenic</b> carrier.|$|E
25|$|S. pneumoniae {{is part of}} {{the normal}} upper {{respiratory}} tract flora. As with many natural flora it can become pathogenic under the right conditions, typically when the immune system of the host is suppressed. Invasins, such as pneumolysin, an anti-phagocytic capsule, various adhesins, and <b>immunogenic</b> cell wall components are all major virulence factors. After S. pneumoniae colonizes the air sacs of the lungs, the body responds by stimulating the inflammatory response causing plasma, blood, and white blood cells to fill the alveoli. This condition is called pneumonia. It is susceptible to clindamycin.|$|E
25|$|The {{tonsillar}} epithelia (palatine and lingual) {{share similar}} nonkeratinization characteristics with the cervix, where HPV infection plays the {{major role in}} cases of cervical cancer. Also E6 and E7 may make HPV+OPC more <b>immunogenic</b> than HPV-OPC, since anti-E6 and E7 antibodies may be detected in these patients. This in turn could restrict the malignant behaviour of HPV+OPC {{and the presence of}} antibodies has been associated with a better prognosis, while treatment may enhance the immunogenicity of the tumour, and hence improve response, although to what extent is not clear. Outcomes are also associated with improved adaptive immunity.|$|E
25|$|Because of AAV's {{specialized}} {{gene therapy}} advantages, researchers {{have created an}} altered version of AAV termed self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV). Whereas AAV packages a single strand of DNA and must wait for its second strand to be synthesized, scAAV packages two shorter strands that are complementary to each other. By avoiding second-strand synthesis, scAAV can express more quickly, although as a caveat, scAAV can only encode half of the already limited capacity of AAV. Recent reports suggest that scAAV vectors are more <b>immunogenic</b> than single stranded adenovirus vectors, inducing a stronger activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is the choice}} of promoter. The SV40 promoter was conventionally used until research showed that vectors driven by the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) promoter had much higher expression rates. More recently, expression rates have been further increased {{by the use of}} the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. Inclusion of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPV)-CTE with/without rev increased envelope expression. Furthermore, the CTE+rev construct was significantly more <b>immunogenic</b> than CTE-alone vector. Additional modifications to improve expression rates include the insertion of enhancer sequences, synthetic introns, adenovirus tripartite leader (TPL) sequences and modifications to the polyadenylation and transcriptional termination sequences. An example of DNA vaccine plasmid is pVAC, which uses SV40 promoter.|$|E
25|$|Necroptosis is a {{programmed}} form of necrosis, or {{inflammatory cell}} death. Conventionally, necrosis {{is associated with}} unprogrammed cell death resulting from cellular damage or infiltration by pathogens, in contrast to orderly, programmed cell death via apoptosis. The discovery of necroptosis showed that cells can execute necrosis in a programmed fashion and that apoptosis is not always preferable to necrotic cell death. Furthermore, the <b>immunogenic</b> nature of necroptosis favors its use in certain circumstances, such as aiding targeting of pathogens by the immune system. Necroptosis is well defined as a viral defense mechanism, allowing the cell to undergo “cellular suicide” in a caspase-independent fashion {{in the presence of}} viral caspase inhibitors. In addition to being a response to disease, necroptosis has also been characterized as a component of inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|Prediction and {{validation}} of the immunodominant epitope/s of HSP90 beta protein has been demonstrated using sera from infertile women having anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The decapeptide EP6 (380-389)is a major <b>immunogenic</b> epitope of HSP90 followed by EP1 (1-12) and EP8 (488-498). Knowledge of binding epitopes on the autoantigen is necessary to understand the subsequent pathologic events. Predicted 3D structures of these peptides demonstrated that they exist in the loop conformation, {{which is the most}} mobile part of the protein. Also, analysis of the sequences of HSP90 beta across several species reveals that EP6 peptide forms a part of a well-conserved motif. A polyclonal antibody generated to the immunodominant epitope- EP6 confirms similar biochemical and cellular immunoreactivity as seen with the patients' sera with anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The study might generate new tools for the detection of disease-inducing epitopes and a possible therapeutic intervention.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{release of}} nuclear {{proteins}} and chromatin, antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, display these antigens to T helper cells. Although {{the details of}} this process are still controversial, evidence shows that to produce an immune response, DNA must activate an antigen presenting cell to produce type 1 interferons. This cytokine serves to induce maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) so that they can display their antigens to T helper cells. The mechanism in which eukaryotic DNA activates these cells is still as yet unclear; however, <b>immunogenic</b> CpG sequences have been found to either activate PDCs or act as adjuvant in the response to eukaryotic DNA. CpG motif DNA acts via the pattern recognition receptor, toll-like receptor 9, found highly expressed in PDCs and B cells. The T helper cells then activate B cells, which are also in the presence of these antigens, causing the production of autoantibodies.|$|E
25|$|The gene {{silencing}} effects of transfected designed siRNA are generally transient, but this difficulty {{can be overcome}} through an RNAi approach. Delivering this siRNA from DNA templates can be done through several recombinant viral vectors based on retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, adenovirus, and lentivirus. The latter is the most efficient virus that stably delivers siRNA to target cells as it can transduce nondividing cells as well as directly target the nucleus. These specific viral vectors have been synthesized to effectively facilitate siRNA that is not viable for transfection into cells. Another aspect is {{that in some cases}} synthetic viral vectors can integrate shRNA into the cell genome which allows for stable expression of siRNA and long-term gene knockdown. This technique is advantageous because it is in vivo and effective for difficult to transfect cell. However problems arise because it can trigger antiviral responses in some cell types leading to mutagenic and <b>immunogenic</b> effects.|$|E
25|$|They used {{spider silk}} fibers {{to create a}} nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in {{a short amount of}} time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow in vivo after PNS injury. Spider silk has not been used in tissue {{engineering}} until now because of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less <b>immunogenic</b> than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel. Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition for weeks {{and the fact that it}} does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit in vitro and in vivo.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to different B cells reacting to different epitopes {{on the same}} antigen, B cells belonging to different clones may {{also be able to}} react to the same epitope. [...] An epitope that can be attacked by many different B cells is said to be highly <b>immunogenic.</b> [...] In these cases, the binding affinities for respective epitope-paratope pairs vary, with some B cell clones producing antibodies that bind strongly to the epitope, and others producing antibodies that bind weakly.|$|E

2500|$|In theory, the {{genome-wide}} {{specificity of}} engineered TALEN fusions allows for {{correction of errors}} at individual genetic loci via homology-directed repair from a correct exogenous template. [...] In reality, however, the in situ application of TALEN is currently limited {{by the lack of}} an efficient delivery mechanism, unknown <b>immunogenic</b> factors, and uncertainty in the specificity of TALEN binding.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{contemporary}} approach for [...] "boosting" [...] the immune response to simpler <b>immunogenic</b> molecules (known as antigens) is to conjugate the antigens. Conjugation is the {{attachment to the}} antigen of another substance which also generates an immune response, thus amplifying the overall response and causing a more robust immune memory to the antigen. For example, a toxoid might be attached to a polysaccharide from the capsule of the bacteria responsible for most lobar pneumonia.|$|E

2500|$|Mutations in genes {{employed}} in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) cause a high mutation rate. [...] In tumors, such frequent subsequent mutations often generate “non-self” <b>immunogenic</b> antigens. [...] A human Phase II clinical trial, with 41 patients, evaluated one synthetic lethal approach for tumors {{with or without}} MMR defects. [...] The product of gene PD-1 ordinarily represses cytotoxic immune responses. [...] Inhibition of this gene allows a greater immune response. [...] When cancer patients with a defect in MMR in their tumors were exposed to an inhibitor of PD-1, 67% - 78% of patients experienced immune-related progression-free survival. [...] In contrast, for patients without defective MMR, addition of PD-1 inhibitor generated only 11% of patients with immune-related progression-free survival. [...] Thus inhibition of PD-1 is primarily synthetically lethal with MMR defects.|$|E
2500|$|The outer {{membrane}} of Leptospira, {{like those}} of most other Gram-negative bacteria, contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS). [...] Differences in the highly <b>immunogenic</b> LPS structure account for the numerous serovars of Leptospira. [...] Consequently, immunity is serovar specific; current leptospiral vaccines, which consist of one or several serovars of Leptospira endemic in the population to be immunized, protect only against the serovars contained in the vaccine preparation. [...] Leptospiral LPS has low endotoxin activity. [...] An unusual feature of leptospiral LPS is that it activates host cells via TLR2 rather than TLR4. [...] The unique structure of the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule may account for this observation. [...] Finally, the LPS O antigen content of L. interrogans differs in an acutely infected versus a chronically infected animal. [...] The role of O antigen changes in the establishment or maintenance of acute or chronic infection, if any, is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|New <b>immunogenic</b> motifs {{appear in}} the {{literature}} almost monthly and new gliadin and Triticeae protein sequences appear that contain these motifs. The HLA DQ2.5 restricted peptide [...] "I I Q P Q Q P A Q" [...] produced approximately 50 hits of identical sequences in NCBI-Blast search {{is one of a}} several dozen known motifs whereas {{only a small fraction of}} Triticeae gluten variants have been examined. For this reason the immunochemistry is best discussed at the level of Triticeae, because it is clear that the special immunological properties of the proteins appear to have basal affinities to this taxa, appearing concentrated in wheat as a result of its three various genomes. Some current studies claim that removing the toxicity of gliadins from wheat as plausible, but, as the above illustrates, the problem is monumental. There are many gluten proteins, three genomes with many genes each for alpha, gamma, and omega gliadins. For each motif many genome-loci are present, and there are many motifs, some still not known.|$|E
2500|$|RNA viruses such as {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) evolve at an extremely rapid rate, orders of magnitude faster than mammals or birds. For these organisms, ancestral reconstruction can be applied on a much shorter time scale; for example, in order to reconstruct the global or regional progenitor of an epidemic that has spanned decades rather than millions of years. [...] A team around Brian Gaschen proposed that such reconstructed strains be used as targets for vaccine design efforts, as opposed to sequences isolated from patients in the present day. Because HIV is extremely diverse, a vaccine designed to work on one patient's viral population might not work for a different patient, because the evolutionary distance between these two viruses may be large. However, their most recent common ancestor is closer {{to each of the}} two viruses than they are to each other. Thus, a vaccine designed for a common ancestor could {{have a better chance of}} being effective for a larger proportion of circulating strains. Another team took this idea further by developing a center-of-tree reconstruction method to produce a sequence whose total evolutionary distance to contemporary strains is as small as possible. Strictly speaking, this method was not ancestral reconstruction, as the center-of-tree (COT) sequence does not necessarily represent a sequence that has ever existed in the evolutionary history of the virus. However, Rolland and colleagues did find that, in the case of HIV, the COT virus was functional when synthesized. Similar experiments with synthetic ancestral sequences obtained by maximum likelihood reconstruction have likewise shown that these ancestors are both functional and <b>immunogenic,</b> lending some credibility to these methods. [...] Furthermore, ancestral reconstruction can potentially be used to infer the genetic sequence of the transmitted HIV variants that have gone on to establish the next infection, with the objective of identifying distinguishing characteristics of these variants (as a non-random selection of the transmitted population of viruses) that may be targeted for vaccine design.|$|E
