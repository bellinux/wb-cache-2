25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, <b>dill</b> <b>weed,</b> mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
500|$|Fats and {{proteins}} {{reduce the}} perception of tannins on the palate. When Cabernet Sauvignon is paired with steak or dishes with a heavy butter cream sauce, the tannins are neutralized, allowing {{the fruits of the}} wine to be more noticeable. In contrast, starches such as pastas and rice will have little effect on tannins. The bitterness of the tannins can also be counterbalanced by the use of bitter foods, such as radicchio and [...] endive, or with cooking methods that involve charring like grilling. As the wine ages and the tannins lessen, more subtle and less bitter dishes will pair better with Cabernet Sauvignon. The oak influences of the wine can be matched with cooking methods that have similar influences on the food-such as grilling, smoking and plank roasting. Dishes that include oak-influenced flavors and aromas normally found in Cabernet Sauvignon—such as <b>dill</b> <b>weed,</b> brown sugar, nutmeg and vanilla—can also pair well.|$|E
50|$|In a Thai-style tom kha kai, <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> is not used, {{whereas in}} a Lao-style tom kha kai, <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> (phak si, ຜັກຊີ) is used. <b>Dill</b> <b>weed</b> {{is a common}} herb which is used in Lao cuisine. The Thais' answer to <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> (known in Thailand as phak chi Lao (ผักชีลาว), since it is known locally as a Lao herb) in Thai tom kha is {{coriander}} or cilantro (phak chi, ผักชี).|$|E

50|$|In Thailand, most tom kha kai recipes {{typically}} include coconut milk, galangal, {{kaffir lime}} leaves, lemongrass, Thai chili peppers, coriander (or <b>dill</b> <b>weed),</b> straw mushrooms (or shiitake or other mushrooms), chicken, fish sauce, and lime juice. Fried chilies are sometimes added.|$|E
50|$|Dillapiole is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} compound and essential oil commonly extracted from <b>dill</b> <b>weed,</b> {{though it can}} be found in a variety of other plants such as fennel root. This compound is closely related to apiole, having a methoxy group positioned differently on the benzene ring.|$|E
50|$|Dill seed, {{having a}} flavor similar to caraway but also {{resembling}} that of fresh or dried <b>dill</b> <b>weed,</b> {{is used as}} a spice. Dill oil is extracted from the leaves, stems and seeds of the plant. The oil from the seeds is distilled and used in the manufacturing of soaps.|$|E
50|$|Herbs can be {{perennials}} such as thyme or lavender, biennials such as parsley, or annuals like basil. Perennial herbs can be shrubs such as rosemary, Rosmarinus officinalis, or trees such as bay laurel, Laurus nobilis - this {{contrasts with}} botanical herbs, which by definition cannot be woody plants. Some plants {{are used as}} both herbs and spices, such as <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> and dill seed or coriander leaves and seeds. Also, there are some herbs {{such as those in}} the mint family that are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes.|$|E

40|$|Sprout {{control is}} {{essential}} for successful management of stored potatoes. This study examined the effect of <b>dill</b> <b>weed,</b> spearmint and clove essential oils on sprouting of potatoes. Extracts of steam distilled <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> whole plants containing 41. 5 - 42. 7 % of S-(+) -carvone and spearmint foliage extracts containing 97. 2 - 97. 6 % of R-(-) -carvone, were applied to tubers {{in a series of}} experiments using either 1 -L glass jars or 63 -L steel drums. The composition of the essential oils was consistent between years but evaporation rate varied among the oils as <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> extract evaporated the fastest while clove oil evaporated the slowest under the same conditions. After exposure to essential oil treatments, tuber sprout number and weight were assessed and compared to untreated control and tubers treated with commercially marketed clove oil product (Biox-CTM, containing 78. 5 - 82. 3 % eugenol). Applications of 32. 5 and 47. 6 mg L- 1 headspace of <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> oil and 21. 5 and 22. 3 mg L- 1 headspace of spearmint oil achieved 50 % reduction in 'Russet Burbank' sprout weight and sprout number respectively, 30 days after the initial treatment. Tubers stored in environments with 60 - 240 mg L- 1 headspace of <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> or spearmint oils suppressed sprouting at least 5 weeks longer than that of the controls. In 63 -L steel drums, repeated dill and spearmint oil vapor treatments effectively and consistently suppressed sprouting of 'Russet Norkotah' and 'Piccolo' tubers for 7 - 8 months when doses were 25 mg L- 1 headspace or higher and when treatments were repeated at least every four weeks. Within this range, sprout suppression was not sensitive to treatment variations, and, therefore, an optimal treatment level could not be determined. Clove oil was less effective in suppressing sprouting, likely due to its slower vaporization compared to dill and spearmint oils. Essential oil treatment effects on seed tuber viability were evaluated on 'Piccolo'. Tubers were planted after exposure to dill or spearmint oil vapor environments ranging from 15 - 240 mg L- 1 headspace for seven days. There were no adverse effects on seed viability at doses less than 120 mg L- 1 headspace. Although environments wit...|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{management}} {{remains the}} most critical factor for controlling mold growth on wood and wood products during storage, construction, and while in service. When moisture management practices fail to adequately control moisture, plant extracts demonstrating antifungal properties may provide protection for these applications. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the antifungal properties of natural plant extracts, such as essential oils, for use on wood. Seven essential oils were evaluated for their ability to inhibit growth of Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma viride, and Penicillium chrysogenum on southern yellow pine (SYP) stakes that were either dip treated or exposed to vapors of the test oils. Thyme and Egyptian geranium oil inhibited growth of all test fungi for 20 weeks. Likewise, <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> oil vapors inhibited all test fungi for at least 20 weeks. Comparison of two mold test apparatuses—Petri dish test and tank test chambers—gave similar results for thyme oil. These findings support the application of essential oils for surface treatment or vapor exposure of wood to prevent mold infestation...|$|E
40|$|Genuine dill pickles are {{the product}} {{resulting}} from the fermentation, predominantly lactic, of cucumbers immersed in a brine containing 3 to 4 per cent salt. The brine also contains <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> and may contain spices and garlic or extracts of their essential oils. Genuine dill tomatoes are manufactured from green tomatoes by a fermentation {{similar to that used}} for pickles (Fabian and Wadsworth, 1944). Lactobacillus plantarum is commonly associated with the fermentation of pickles (Pederson, 1936), although other lactobacilli and some yeasts undoubtedly play a role. A survery of the literature failed to uncover any reports concerning the microbial flora of fermenting dill tomatoes. Pederson (1936), however, mentions that L. plantarum has been found in fermenting and spoiled tomato products. The formation of white pustules on fermented olives has been investigated by Vaughn et al. (1953). These workers found that the pustules were actually massive, subepidermal growths of L. plantarum. They also noted, but did not investigate, the presence of such pustules on fermented Italian peppers and pickled green tomatoes. We have noted the presence of white pustules on commercially packed dill tomatoes and pickles and on sweet pickles prepared from salt stock. This report deals with microbiological and histological studies of pustules on dill tomatoes and pickles...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{damage and}} {{potential}} health risks caused by wood decay and mold fungi in residential structures {{have been a}} major concern for homeowners, building contractors and insurance companies alike. The combined damage from decay fungi and mold claims exceeds several billion US dollars annually. Protection against decay and mold growth on wood is a critical economic concern for the building industry. An ideal compound for wood protection for interior applications must be nontoxic, hypoallergenic and able to provide long-term efficacy under high humidity. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the inhibitory effects of natural plant extracts, such as essential oils, on wood. Seven essential oils were evaluated for their ability to inhibit weight loss by brown-rot and white-rot fungi on southern pine in soil block tests. No weight loss occurred in specimens dip-treated with undiluted test oils. Essential oils were also evaluated for inhibition of mold growth in laboratory tests by two methods. Specimens dip-treated with thyme or geranium Egyptian oil inhibited growth of test mold fungi up to 22 weeks and specimens exposed to vapors of <b>dill</b> <b>weed</b> or rosemary oil also inhibited mold growth under laboratory conditions. We did not observe correlation between surface and vapor treatment for mold inhibition. These findings support the potential use of essential oils for natural wood protection against decay fungi or mold infestation for surface-treatment or fumigation of wood products...|$|E
