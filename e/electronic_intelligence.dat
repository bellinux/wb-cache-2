25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the mammoth Convair B-36, the B-29 was {{reclassified}} as a medium bomber by the Air Force.

25|$|In 1965, the first-generation Atlas {{intercontinental}} {{ballistic missile}} was taken off alert and its subordinate wings were inactivated. It was briefly assigned some KC-135A Tankers and EC-135 <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> aircraft after the 98th Bombardment Wing was inactivated at Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebraska afterwards, however the 13th Strategic Missile Division was itself inactivated in July 1966, its mission being {{taken over by the}} 821st Strategic Aerospace Division in a SAC reorganization.|$|E

25|$|The EA-3B variant was {{modified}} for <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> against the Warsaw Pact. Missions were flown {{around the globe}} beginning in 1956, with the U.S. Air Force EB-47 Stratojet flying a similar mission. The EA-3B carried a crew of seven, with flight crew of three in the cockpit and an Electronic Warfare Officer and three electronic systems operators/evaluators in the converted weapons bay. It offered unique electronic reconnaissance capabilities in numerous Cold War-era conflicts and the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the three Maritime Reconnaissance variants, two further Nimrod types were developed. The RAF operated {{a small number of}} the Nimrod R1, an <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> gathering (ELINT) variant. A dedicated airborne early warning platform, the Nimrod AEW3 was in development from late 1970s to the mid-1980s; however, much like the MRA4, considerable problems were encountered in development and thus the project was cancelled in 1986 in favour of an off-the-shelf solution in the Boeing E-3 Sentry. All Nimrod variants had been retired by mid-2011.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Cold War, some of the most {{important}} strategic reconnaissance was carried out by Strategic Air Command units deployed to Ladd Army Airfield, near Fairbanks, Alaska Territory. One of the SAC's initial missions was to plan strategic aerial reconnaissance on a global scale. The first efforts were in photo-reconnaissance and mapping. Along with the photo-reconnaissance mission, a small <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) cadre was operating. Weather reconnaissance was part of the effort, as was Long Range Detection, the search for Soviet atomic explosions.|$|E

Terrorist attacks claimed far too many. Combat and battle claimed even more. Every day the losses mounted. Humanity made the decision to increase its numbers artificially, not with the <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligences</b> that were now the enemy but with In Vitroes who could become highly skilled soldiers. Governments and industry worked together to build a multitude of In Vitro facilities around the world, facilities where these soldiers could be grown and trained.|$|R

25|$|Virtually none {{of these}} {{objectives}} were met. Allied fire support was grossly inadequate and the raiding force was largely trapped on the beach by obstacles and German fire. Less than 10 hours after the first landings, the last Allied troops had all been either killed, evacuated, or left behind to be captured by the Germans. Instead of a demonstration of resolve, the bloody fiasco showed {{the world that the}} Allies could not hope to invade France for a long time.

25|$|The Daily Star {{reported}} in November 2011 that SIS helped capture Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The top-secret mission, dubbed Operation X to disguise its purpose, used modern <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) technologies to bug him {{along with his}} friends and family. Gaddafi had been hiding {{out in the desert}} for a month but the breakthrough came when he made two phone calls, one after the other, to say he was safe. It allowed the joint British and French bugging operation to pinpoint his location. SIS agents using the £25million top-secret equipment closed in on him before calling in the Libyan snatch squad to apprehend him.|$|E

In the late 1940s, strategic intelligence on Soviet capabilities and intentions was scarce. Before the development of the Lockheed U-2 high altitude spy plane and orbital reconnaissance satellites Corona, technology and politics limited American reconnaissance efforts to the borders, and not the heartland, of the Soviet Union.|$|E
