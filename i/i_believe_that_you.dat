You will either take your place as providers of care, or your numbers will dwindle as most dispensing activities are replaced by robotics and pharmacy technicians. I am a physician, and I say our profession and the patients that we serve need you 'on the team' as clinical pharmacist practitioners. But, will you truly join us?" ...|$|E
500|$|There was no {{nationwide}} {{election day}} in 1840, and many states, {{by the time}} they held the presidential vote, had already conducted balloting in local races and for the House of Representatives. One state, South Carolina, did not have a popular vote for president, with electors chosen by the legislature. These state and federal elections, from March to October 1840, led to Whig victories in all but a few states, mainly Democratic strongholds like New Hampshire. Among the victories was that of Whig Governor-elect Corwin in Ohio. The first presidential balloting began on October 29, in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the polls ended with Rhode Island on November 23. Monday, November 2 was the largest polling day, as 12 states, including New York, voted. As those states compiled the vote, citizens scanned partisan and unreliable newspapers, trying to discern a trend. Even though Harrison led in 10 of the first 11 states to report, former president Jackson wrote to Van Buren, [...] "do not believe a word of it. Nor will <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not elected until I see all the official returns." [...] But when the Whigs took New York by 13,000 votes, it was clear that Harrison and Tyler had won the election.|$|E

"I was {{wondering}} {{why it is}} that I want to tell you the thing that I have not dared tell even to my husband. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would understand, and that you could tell me the right course to follow. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would not judge me too harshly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must have}} been so before you could have spoken of me as you did. And I was deceived, cruelly deceived. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought well of me; <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> esteemed me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, first, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was Lieutenant Poinsett. Because, secondly, <b>I</b> did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> knew <b>that</b> Arthur Poinsett and Philip Ashley {{were one}} and the same person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a {{time when}} <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had," [...] he {{reminded}} her. [...] "I didn't behave like a pedagogic upholder of {{the letter of the law}} then, did I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Accustomed to such divagations, Hilary answered: [...] "I don't {{know whether}} you would be justifed, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would strike him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will {{certainly}} have 'The Seraphim' this week. Do macadamise the frown from your brow {{in order to}} receive them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it {{possible}} {{that they are going}} to abandon the attack?" [...] cried De Catinat joyously. [...] "Amos, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have saved us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{then have}} I made you happy? Will you not answer me? I took <b>you</b> because <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would trust me, and always speak openly from your heart, and hide nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were getting}} {{the better of}} him up to that point," [...] Francis said. [...] "I was close at hand, in {{readiness}} to strike in should I see that my aid was wanted, but up to the moment <b>you</b> slipped, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would have avenged your wrongs yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hel√®ne," [...] he said, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> meant--that {{you could}} {{possibly}} mean--what you have this moment said, I would tear my compact in two, throw this box amongst the flames, and make my bow to my life's work. But you do not mean it. You will change your mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{a miracle}} {{is not what}} you call logical proof, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did see the Moa, and a still more {{extraordinary}} bird, Te-iki-pa.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} save your breath {{instead of talking}} nonsense, Hans," [...] I said, [...] "since <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have a long way}} to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{certainly}} not. You will hope {{enough for}} anything you really desire without my telling you. But I will not joke, as <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are serious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{am going}} to explain," [...] she said. [...] "You see, Douglas, when {{you asked me to}} be your wife <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cared for me, well--altogether--and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wanted it very much indeed. If I had known then what your letter has since told me, what do <b>you</b> think <b>that</b> I should have said to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think thee {{must buy}} some short cigars," [...] she said, just putting her head inside the door, [...] "to smoke after dinner. If large ones are necessary, {{they can be}} smoked after I go to bed. I am getting very impatient; for now that Mr. Randolph is here, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>thee</b> {{is going to be}} unusually interesting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] he answered, [...] "I {{have spoken}} of him. Let {{me tell you}} this, young man. If <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were a {{creature}} of his breed, if <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> a drop of his black blood ran in your veins, I would take you by the neck now and throw you into the nearest creek where the water was deep enough to drown." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still--it is a {{magnificent}} gift," [...] he declared. [...] "We can open all our relief stations again. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are a little}} prejudiced against Lord Arranmore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is the trouble!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "That is the {{greatest}} trouble. I believe you would. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think that the life would just suit you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed. If I thought so, I {{should not}} be {{here to tell you}} what I thought. It is because <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are injured that I am here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sophia," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{keeping a}} great secret {{from you and}} I can do it no longer. When you speak to me of your husband you drive me mad. If <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really loved him, I would go away and leave it to chance {{whether or not you}} ever {{discovered}} the truth. As it is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said you}} were a {{dangerous}} woman to marry," [...] he went on deliberately. [...] "I said it because I thought it. I gave Gordon an opinion about you--it was a very unfavorable one. I could n't make you out--I thought you were playing a double part. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were ready to marry him, and yet I saw--I thought I saw--" [...] and Bernard paused again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be, {{but there}} is a mystery about him; and I have a vague dislike to him in spite of all that has passed. But, darling, are you sure he does not care for you? I fancied I read a {{different}} story in his face, and when you begged to leave town so suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had seen this also, and kindly wished to spare him any pain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very curious," [...] I said. [...] "I {{have never}} {{understood}} your warning. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were in earnest. Was {{it that you}} believed me incapable or untrustworthy, or--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Talk or be silent," [...] he {{answered}} softly. [...] "Myself <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are in need}} of silence. To be silent together is a proof of great friendship, is it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{intend to}} do so. I {{intend to do}} that also. But I know that a wife ought to have {{influence}} over her husband, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have influence over yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the same, Terence," [...] O'Grady said, doggedly, [...] "to {{the end of}} me life <b>I</b> {{will always}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{had a hand in}} the matter. There is no one else that I know of except you and Ryan who would have had the cheek to do such a thing, and <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can deny it yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was right}} after all. You know, Adrian, I always stood up for you, {{notwithstanding}} your temper and queer ways. No, <b>I</b> never would <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were a villain, but neither could <b>I</b> ever have <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were quite such an ass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have stood}} the fiery ordeal well,' said Louis; 'and <b>I</b> verily <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will soon {{find that it}} was only an ordeal.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "it {{is just as}} you described. Oh! at last I {{have found}} what I have been seeking for years. Godfrey, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have the true gift." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you wouldn't. I don't {{believe that}} he has ever been untrue to me. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and your father have planned to make me believe it and to keep us apart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me," [...] I {{said to her}} in a low tone, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are in trouble. Can I help you? Don't be afraid to tell me if I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can have}} wanted to, at any rate; <b>that's</b> something. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>you</b> came from America for," [...] the Countess {{suddenly}} added.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a good idea," [...] said Geoffrey. [...] "I will {{telegraph}} to {{the lawyers}} at once. <b>I</b> certainly <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have got the clue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{have been}} so silly!" [...] she confessed. [...] "There were times when <b>I</b> couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were my Everard--mine! And now I know." ...|$|R
