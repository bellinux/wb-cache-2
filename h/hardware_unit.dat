25|$|An {{audiometer}} is {{a machine}} used for evaluating hearing loss. Audiometers are standard equipment at ENT clinics and in audiology centers. They usually consist of an embedded <b>hardware</b> <b>unit</b> {{connected to a}} pair of headphones and a feedback button, sometimes controlled by a standard PC. The invention of this machine is generally credited to Dr. Harvey Fletcher of Brigham Young University who invented the first audiometer in 1922.|$|E
25|$|A {{dedicated}} electronic <b>hardware</b> <b>unit</b> or audio {{software that}} applies compression {{is called a}} compressor. In the 2000s, compressors became available as software plugins that run in digital audio workstation software. In recorded and live music, compression parameters may be adjusted {{to change the way}} they affect sounds. Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A limiter is a compressor with a high ratio and, generally, a fast attack time.|$|E
25|$|The TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry fully {{associative}} with replacement done by microcode/firmware. The V80 {{in contrast}} has a 64-entry 2-way set associative TLB with replacement done in hardware. TLB replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page {{was in the}} same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement <b>hardware</b> <b>unit</b> which operated in parallel {{to the rest of the}} processor.|$|E

25|$|The Adapter was {{developed}} by Mad Catz by experimenting with all legacy Xbox 360 controllers they wanted to support and verifying what inputs they sent via wireless connection. They also worked with a former Microsoft employee that had experience with the Xbox 360's wireless features for additional insight. Existing USB microphones remain compatible with Rock Band 4. Harmonix was also working to get backward compatibility for the Stage Kit, an add-on <b>hardware</b> <b>unit</b> for Xbox 360 owners that allowed for a smoke machine and light show display {{in time with the}} song. Owing to the game's focus on core gameplay, and concerns that consumers may be unwilling to buy additional hardware for specific games early in a console generation's lifecycle, Rock Band 4 did not feature additional accessories. At retail, the game is available in a band bundle, with a guitar, drum, and microphone, and a guitar-only bundle.|$|E

500|$|Steam's [...] "Big Picture" [...] mode was {{announced}} in 2011; public betas started in September 2012 and were integrated into the software in December 2012. Big Picture mode is a 10-foot user interface, which optimizes the Steam display to work on high-definition televisions, allowing the user to control Steam with a gamepad or with a keyboard and mouse. Newell stated that Big Picture mode was a step towards a dedicated Steam entertainment <b>hardware</b> <b>unit.</b> SteamVR, a virtual reality (VR) Big Picture interface, was introduced in beta in January 2014. The SteamVR mode enables the user to operate the Big Picture mode and play any game in their Steam library with a virtual theater displayed through the VR headset, the equivalent of looking at a 225-inch television screen, according to Valve. The mode was first introduced in beta for the Oculus Rift headset and later expanded in March 2015 to support the HTC Vive, a VR unit developed jointly with Valve, with the feature to be publicly released shortly after the Vive's public launch in April 2016. In-Home Streaming was introduced in May 2014; this allows users to stream games installed on one computer to anotherregardless of platformon the same home network.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{the golden}} age, pinball {{machines}} were more popular than video games. The pinball industry reached a peak of 200,000 machine sales and $2.3 billion revenue in 1979, which had declined to 33,000 machines and $464 million in 1982. In comparison, the best-selling arcade games of the golden age, Space Invaders and Pac-Man, had each sold over 360,000 and 400,000 cabinets, respectively, with each machine costing between $2000 and $3000 (specifically $2400 in Pac-Man's case). In addition, Space Invaders had grossed $2billion in quarters by 1982, while Pac-Man had grossed over $1billion by 1981 and $2.5billion by the late 1990s. In 1982, Space Invaders was considered the highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, with comparisons made to the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486million, while Pac-Man is today considered the highest-grossing arcade game of all time. Many other arcade games during the golden age also had <b>hardware</b> <b>unit</b> sales {{at least in the}} tens of thousands, including Ms. Pac-Man with over 115,000 units, Asteroids with 70,000, Donkey Kong with over 60,000, Defender with 55,000, Galaxian with 40,000, Donkey Kong Junior with 35,000, Mr. Do! with 30,000, ...|$|E
40|$|Soft-core {{programmable}} processors on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can be custom synthesized {{to instantiate}} only those <b>hardware</b> <b>units,</b> such as multipliers and floating-point units, that an application requires to meet performance demands, thus minimizing soft-core size on the FPGA. Conjoining processors, meaning to share <b>hardware</b> <b>units</b> among {{two or more}} processors, can further reduce soft-core size, leaving more resources for other circuits such as custom coprocessors. Using Xilinx MicroBlaze coprocessors and standard embedded system benchmarks, we show that conjoining two processors can provide 16 % processor size reductions on average, with less than 1 % cycle count overhead. We introduce an efficient dynamic-programming-based exploration method {{to find the best}} custom instantiation of <b>hardware</b> <b>units,</b> considering both standalone and conjoined options, for soft-core processors.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} the ARISE {{framework for the}} systematic extension of typical processors with the necessary infrastructure to support arbitrary number and type of reconfigurable <b>hardware</b> <b>units.</b> ARISE extends the microarchitecture of the processor with an interface to allow the coupling of the <b>hardware</b> <b>units.</b> Furthermore, the instruction set of the processor is extended with instructions which expose to the programmer/compiler the full control of the interface. This control includes the configuration of operations on the <b>hardware</b> <b>units,</b> execution of these operations, and communication of data between the processor and the units. The new instructions are incorporated without the need to redesign the processor instruction set architecture. To evaluate our proposal a model of an ARISE extended MIPS processor has been designed. Using a turbodecoder algorithm as benchmarking application a simulation of the ARISE model has been performed. Performance results show impressive application speedups up to x 7. 5. I...|$|R

2500|$|March 2012 – The Debian port is {{initiated}} by Mike Thompson, former CTO of Atomz. The effort was largely {{carried out by}} Thompson and Peter Green, a volunteer Debian developer, with some support from the Foundation, who tested the resulting binaries that the two produced {{during the early stages}} (neither Thompson nor Green had physical access to the hardware, as boards were not widely accessible at the time due to demand). While the preliminary proof of concept image distributed by the Foundation before launch was also Debian-based, it differed from Thompson and Green's Raspbian effort in a couple of ways. The POC image was based on then-stable Debian Squeeze, while Raspbian aimed to track then-upcoming Debian Wheezy packages. Aside from the updated packages that would come with the new release, Wheezy was also set to introduce the armhf architecture, which became the [...] for the Raspbian effort. The Squeeze-based POC image was limited to the armel architecture, which was, at the time of Squeeze's release, the latest attempt by the Debian project to have Debian run on the newest ARM embedded-application binary interface (EABI). The armhf architecture in Wheezy intended to make Debian run on the ARM VFP hardware floating-point unit, while armel was limited to emulating floating point operations in software. Since the Raspberry Pi included a VFP, being able {{to make use of the}} <b>hardware</b> <b>unit</b> would result in performance gains and reduced power use for floating point operations. The armhf effort in mainline Debian, however, was orthogonal to the work surrounding the Pi and only intended to allow Debian to run on ARMv7 at a minimum, which would mean the Pi, an ARMv6 device, would not benefit. As a result, Thompson and Green set out to build the 19,000 Debian packages for the device using a custom build cluster.|$|E
