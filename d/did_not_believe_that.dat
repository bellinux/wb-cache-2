5|$|Edgar Murray finds Threni less {{expressive}} {{than the}} Krenek, {{and more like}} the Lamentationes of Thomas Tallis. Stravinsky, however, while acknowledging that he had studied the Tallis settings and works by William Byrd and Palestrina, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they had influenced his music.|$|E
5|$|The music video's crew <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Minogue {{could work}} with the python, but she said {{that it did not}} bother her at all. The music video was {{released}} commercially on The Hits & Beyond special edition companion DVD, released in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|A Nosek family {{representative}} {{said that}} based on the witness testimonies, the family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Blythe was solely responsible. He continued {{that he would not}} be substantiating the requested amount, as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work.|$|E
5000|$|It is not {{absurd to}} assert the second- or third-person {{counterparts}} to Moore's sentences, e.g. [...] "It is raining, but you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it is raining," [...] or [...] "Michael is dead, but they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he is." ...|$|R
5000|$|St. Augustine had a {{very deep}} sense of the {{difficulty}} of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question [...] "I Am" [...] what? From John 8, 24: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am, you will die in your sins." [...] But Augustine asked, [...] "si non credideritis quia ego sum?" [...] (I Am What?) There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing. [...] "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing." [...] Augustine: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Christ; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Son of God; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Word of the Father; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the author of the world; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am that, you will die in your sins. This I Am, He says He Is, is embarrassing. Even if Moses could understand this, how could the people to whom he was being sent understand it? In point of fact, he did add: 'I Am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Exodus 3, 13-15)(Augustine on the Gospel of St. John) (Gilson, p. 85) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may say so in a {{very special}} and {{emphatic}} sense," [...] said Turnbull. [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in nature, just as I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in Odin. She is a myth. It is not merely <b>that</b> I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> nature can guide us. It is <b>that</b> I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> nature exists." ...|$|R
5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> performance was {{vital to the}} plays, nor did he ever acknowledge {{the presence of an}} audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|Born in Burntwood, Staffordshire, Sutton {{performed}} well at school, but withdrew his applications to university in 2012 after his terminal prognosis for colorectal cancer. His father had fought the disease twice, {{and both were}} predisposed to it through Lynch syndrome. Sutton had struggled to get a diagnosis as doctors <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> colorectal cancer could occur in a teenager.|$|E
5|$|He {{retired from}} his {{university}} posts in 2004, but continued working on Time Team until 2011 and in 2006 commenced writing regular articles for British Archaeology magazine until his death. Although Aston <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{he would leave}} a significant legacy behind him, after his death various archaeologists claimed {{that he had a}} major impact in helping to popularise the discipline among the British public.|$|E
6000|$|... "Louis," [...] said I, [...] "why not {{be honest}} with me? I am {{certainly}} not a person to be afraid of. I am very largely in your hands over the Tapilow affair, and, as you know, I have seen {{too much of the}} world to consider trifles. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Delora came to London to sell his crop of coffee. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you are ignorant of his affairs. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his disappearance is so much a mystery to you as it is to the rest of us--say to me and to mademoiselle his niece." ...|$|R
50|$|However, Mary <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Pluto is Neptune, a paradox.|$|R
5000|$|Purism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{returning}} to nature signifies the copying of nature.|$|R
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|Because Corman <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> The Little Shop of Horrors {{had much}} {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, {{he did not}} bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E

25|$|The CPUSA <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the threat}} of {{terrorism}} can be resolved through war.|$|R
5000|$|Among Muslim intellectuals, Islamic scholar Imran N. Hosein <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was genocide.|$|R
5|$|Bolt {{announced}} that he would double-up with the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the Beijing Summer Olympics, and the new 100 m world-record holder was the favourite to win both. Michael Johnson, the 200 m and 400 m record holder, personally backed the sprinter, saying that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a lack of experience would work against him. Bolt qualified for the 100 m final with times of 9.92 s and 9.85 s in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Lamarck {{proposed}} the transmutation of species ("transformisme"), but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{all living things}} shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity similar to the mediaeval great chain of being.|$|E
5|$|Once the Thrud strip had run {{its course}} in White Dwarf, Critchlow worked on other comics {{including}} the Judge Dredd/Batman crossover story The Ultimate Riddle, first published in 1995. His work on this story was fully painted, and while considered impressive was also criticised as being forced, confused and muddy. Critchlow was developing a new style based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be able}} to interest anyone in this very different style.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Power whose {{intervention}} he relies so much upon is England. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{my country}} would risk {{so much to}} gain so little. We are on excellent terms with France as it is. Secret negotiations with Mr. de Valentin would be unpardonable chicanery on our part, and I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think that our ministers would lend themselves to it." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E
5|$|Under the new Royalist regime, the Champollion {{brothers}} invested much {{of their}} time and efforts in establishing Lancaster schools, in an effort to provide the general population with education. This was considered a revolutionary undertaking by the Ultra-royalists, who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> education should be made accessible for the lower classes. In 1821 Champollion even led an uprising, in which he and a band of Grenobleans stormed the citadel and hoisted the tricolore instead of the Bourbon Royalist flag. He was charged with treason and went into hiding, but was eventually pardoned.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{said they}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Sander's {{involvement}} in porn was connected with her disappearance.|$|R

5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Norbert Wiener {{approached}} Bush with {{a proposal}} to build a digital computer. Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it {{on the grounds that}} he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it could be completed {{before the end of the}} war. The supporters of digital computers were disappointed at the decision, which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology. In June 1943, the Army provided $500,000 to build the computer, which became ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Having delayed its funding, Bush's prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945, after the war had ended. His critics saw his attitude as a failure of vision.|$|E
