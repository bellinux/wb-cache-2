5|$|The Osiris myth {{reached its}} basic form in or before the 24th century BCE. Many of its {{elements}} originated in religious ideas, but {{the struggle between}} Horus and Set may have been partly inspired by a regional conflict in Egypt's early <b>history</b> <b>or</b> prehistory. Scholars have tried to discern {{the exact nature of}} the events that gave rise to the story, but they have reached no definitive conclusions.|$|E
5|$|The shared {{repetitive}} {{nature of}} the phrasing of the texts, apart from Gv and I, suggests to Pozdniakov {{that they are not}} integral texts, and cannot contain the varied contents which would be expected for <b>history</b> <b>or</b> mythology. In the following table of characters in the Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov inventory, ordered by descending frequency, the first two rows of 26 characters account for 86% of the entire corpus.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier <b>history,</b> <b>or</b> indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E

5|$|Etty did not base The Combat on {{any single}} {{incident}} from <b>history</b> <b>or</b> literature, or on any existing artwork, {{but on his}} own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature or religion. He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been very impressed by him; The Combat is clearly influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, {{rather than as a}} group.|$|E
5|$|Fossils now {{attributed}} to Dimetrodon were first studied by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in the 1870s. Cope had obtained the fossils {{along with those}} of many other Permian tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) from several collectors who had been exploring a group of rocks in Texas called the Red Beds. Among these collectors were Swiss naturalist Jacob Boll, Texas geologist W. F. Cummins, and amateur paleontologist Charles Hazelius Sternberg. Most of Cope's specimens went to the American Museum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>or</b> to the University of Chicago's Walker Museum (most of the Walker fossil collection is now housed in the Field Museum of Natural History).|$|E
5|$|Gowing {{attempted}} to negotiate better {{conditions at the}} University of Kent that would allow more {{time to work on}} the books, but this was denied. She applied for a vacant chair in the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970, without success. Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair in the history of science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not have a degree in <b>history</b> <b>or</b> science.|$|E

5|$|On July 22, 1847, {{the first}} party of Mormon pioneers {{arrived in the}} Salt Lake Valley, where they founded Salt Lake City, the first European {{settlement}} in Utah. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah. Initial colonization along the Wasatch Front was mostly made by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with no direct involvement from it. Outside the Wasatch Front, most settlements were directed, planned, organized, and dispatched by leaders of the LDS Church. Settlements were also founded by the railroads, mining companies and non-Mormons. Many settlements were named after leaders, <b>history</b> <b>or</b> from scriptures of the LDS Church. Natural features of the region, including rivers, mountains, lakes and flora, are also commonly used for names.|$|E

It {{is a product of}} much and highly intelligent labor, and were Christian Scientists open to argument or amenable to reason the wretched cult would not have survived its publication for a single month. It is unanswerable and conclusive, and nobody who has not read it can be considered well-informed as to the <b>history</b> <b>or</b> nature of Eddyism.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian <b>history</b> <b>or</b> civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E

Recollections have been recorded since 1989, and include the experiences of authorities, staff, volunteer visitors, and prisoners. The Fremantle Prison records and collections, including archaeological, provide a substantial resource for researchers.|$|E
5|$|The Masonic Lodge is {{the basic}} {{organisational}} unit of Freemasonry. The Lodge meets regularly to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.). In addition to business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a Masonic degree or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic <b>history</b> <b>or</b> ritual. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, the Lodge might adjourn for a formal dinner, or festive board, sometimes involving toasting and song.|$|E
5|$|The Seal of Dartmouth College is the {{official}} insignia of Dartmouth College, an Ivy League university located in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Anglo-American law generally requires a corporate body to seek official government sanction, usually {{in the form of}} a charter, in order to operate. Such chartered bodies normally authenticate their official acts by marking them with a distinctive seal. The seal's design is usually complicated to avoid counterfeiting, but it can also express something about the institution's <b>history</b> <b>or</b> mission. Dartmouth College is one such chartered body, and it obtained its official seal in 1773.|$|E

5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its <b>history</b> <b>or</b> underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E

Since it combines {{many forms of}} entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it provides {{a good example of the}} various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.|$|E
