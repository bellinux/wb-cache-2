30|$|The {{analysis}} {{model was}} applied to the passenger door unit of a fleet of 38 Class 380 trains operating on Scotland’s railway network. The data required for the analysis were collected from the literature, the company’s maintenance management software system called EQUINOX, the UK’s railway performance management software DATASYS BUGLE and the UK’s train movements monitoring system called TRUST. The five why’s technique was used to identify the potential failure modes of door unit components and their root causes, including the defects in relation to pushbuttons, door control unit (DCU), mechanical failures, light barrier, door <b>drive,</b> <b>guard</b> operating panel (GOP), limit switches, loose plugs, obstructions, door roller and lubrication. The results of the risk evaluation showed that the nine failure modes (12  % {{of the total number of}} failure modes identified) are “high critical” to door system functionality. The results of this study were used not only for assessing the performance of current maintenance practices, but also to plan a cost-effective preventive maintenance (PM) programme for different components of rolling stock. To avoid the recurrence of the failure modes, a new mileage-based preventive maintenance (PM) programme including 14 tasks was proposed.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{guard cell}} {{promoters}} {{have been examined}} {{in only a few}} species, primarily annual dicots. A partial segment of the potato (Solanum tuberosum) KST 1 promoter (KST 1 partial promoter, KST 1 ppro) has previously been shown to confer guard cell expression in potato, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), citrus [Troyer citrange (C. sinensis×Poncirus trifoliata) ], and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we describe an extensive analysis of the expression pattern of KST 1 ppro in eight (previously reported, as well as new) species from five different angiosperm families, including the Solanaceae and the Cucurbitaceae, Arabidopsis, the monocot barley (Hordeum vulgare), and two perennial species: grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and citrus. Using confocal imaging and three-dimensional movies, we demonstrate that KST 1 ppro <b>drives</b> <b>guard</b> cell expression in all of these species, making it the first dicot-originated guard cell promoter shown to be active in a monocot and the first promoter reported to confer guard cell expression in barley and cucumber (Cucumis sativus). The results presented here indicate that KST 1 ppro can be used to <b>drive</b> constitutive <b>guard</b> cell expression in monocots and dicots and in both annual and perennial plants. In addition, we show that the KST 1 ppro is active in guard cells shortly after the symmetric division of the guard mother cell and generates stable expression in mature guard cells. This allows us to follow the spatial and temporal distribution of stomata in cotyledons and true leaves...|$|R

It has been suggested by many researchers previously to use guard electrode in ECT sensors.

The design of these electrode guards is vital to reduce crosstalk (undesired signals) between the adjacent electrodes (positioned at {{the outside of the}} measured pipe) since the crucial signals are only inside the pipe. There are three types of electrode guards designed by various researchers which are radial guard, axial guard with end <b>guard</b> and <b>driven</b> <b>guard.</b> The configuration and the effectiveness of each designed electrode are discussed.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper on a {{displacement}} current sensor for contactless detection of bio-activity related signals [1], it was stated that “A potential means for human presence detection…is via sensing…human biopotentials” [because] “physiological events {{associated with the}} biological functions of many human organs produce electric fields,” and that “the ECG is relatively easier to measure compared to other biopotentials and, hence, can potentially provide an important [underscore added] means of detection of human presence. ” Contactless biopotential measurement using off-body electrodes has attracted many authors that have proposed various solutions, {{some of which are}} far more expensive than that devised in [1]. Usually, one or two aluminium discs at a few centimetres from the chest are connected to a high-impedance voltage amplifier and the large impedance between these electrodes and ground makes the circuit very susceptible to capacitive (electric-field) interference hence it requires electric shields or <b>driven</b> <b>guards.</b> Measuring displacement current instead of electrode voltage in contactless biopotential measurements, as proposed in [1], avoids high impedance nodes hence measurements should be far less susceptible to electric field interference. Consequently, it is stated in [1] that “[Contactless] capacitive sensors therefore can be used to sense the displacement current induced by the time-varying electric fields associated with various human biopotentials. ” This is in principle an interesting approach worth being considered and the authors deserve praise for that.

The new approach of this sensing module contains the integration intelligent electrode sensing circuit on every each of electrode sensors.

Assays in epidermal peels showed that knockout Arabidopsis thaliana plants lacking the Plasma membrane Intrinsic Protein 2; 1 (PIP 2; 1) aquaporin have a defect in stomatal closure, specifically in response to abscisic acid (ABA). ABA induced a 2 -fold increase in osmotic water permeability (Pf) of guard cell protoplasts and an accumulation of reactive oxygen species in guard cells, which were both abrogated in pip 2; 1 plants. Open stomata 1 (OST 1) /Snf 1 -related protein kinase 2. 6 (SnRK 2. 6), a protein kinase involved in guard cell ABA signaling, was able to phosphorylate a cytosolic PIP 2; 1 peptide at Ser- 121.

40|$|Stomata {{are small}} pores in the epidermes of leaves that {{open and close}} in {{response}} to a variety of environmental signals including carbon dioxide (CO₂). In wild type plants, high levels of CO₂ cause stomata to close, as well as cause a decrease in stomatal density. However, the CO₂- binding proteins that control these responses remain unknown. Through guard cell and mesophyll cell specific microarrays, two highly expressed [Beta]-carbonic anhydrase genes, CA 1 and CA 4, were identified. Arabidopsis thaliana ca 1 ca 4 double knockout mutants exhibit an insensitive stomatal closure response to 800 ppm CO₂ and exhibit a higher stomatal density than wild type. To determine which gene, CA 1 and/or CA 4, is responsible for the CO₂ phenotype, the genomic DNA with native promoter of CA 1 and CA 4 and the cDNAs of CA 1 and CA 4 <b>driven</b> by a <b>guard</b> cell promoter were transformed into ca 1 ca 4 double mutant plants. In these CA-expressing transgenic lines, stomatal density and CO₂ response recovered to wild type phenotypes, suggesting that the CA 1 and CA 4 genes are indeed responsible for the stomatal CO₂ insensitive response {{as well as for the}} high stomatal density of the ca 1 ca 4 double mutant. To determine whether CA homologues from other species could complement the ca 1 ca 4 phenotypes, the structurally unrelated Human CAII controlled by a guard cell promoter was also transformed into ca 1 ca 4 plants. The HmCAII was able to restore the mutant phenotype of CO₂- induced stomatal closure as well as stomatal density. These results show that CA 1 and CA 4 function within the CO₂ signaling mechanisms that mediate CO₂ control of stomatal movements and developmen...|$|R
60|$|When he got {{out into}} the street it was dark and there was still {{standing}} the faithful cab. But he felt that at the present moment {{it would be impossible to}} sit still, and he dismissed the equipage. He walked rapidly along Brook Street into Park Lane, and from thence to the park, hardly knowing whither he went in the enthusiasm of the moment. He walked back to the Marble Arch, and thence round by the <b>drive</b> to the <b>Guard</b> House and the bridge over the Serpentine, by the Knightsbridge Barracks to Hyde Park Corner. Though he should give up everything and go and live in her own country with her, he would marry her. His politics, his hunting, his address to the Queen, his horses, his guns, his father's wealth, and his own rank,--what were they all to Isabel Boncassen? In meeting her he had met the one human being in all the world who could really be anything to him either in friendship or in love. When she had told him what she would do for him to make his home happy, it had seemed to him that all other delights must fade away from him for ever. How odious were Tifto and his racehorses, how unmeaning the noise of his club, how terrible the tedium of those parliamentary benches! He could not tell his love as she had told hers! He acknowledged to himself that his words could not be as her words,--nor his intellect as hers. But his heart could be as true. She had spoken to him of his name, his rank, and all his outside world around him. He would make her understand at last that they were nothing to him in comparison with her. When he had got round to Hyde Park Corner, he felt that he was almost compelled to go back again to Brook Street. In no other place could there be anything to interest him;--nowhere else could there be light, or warmth, or joy! But what would she think of him? To go back hot, and soiled with mud, in order that he might say one more adieu,--that possibly he might ravish one more kiss,--would hardly be manly. He must postpone all that for the morrow. On the morrow of course he would be there.|$|R
