40|$|Oral {{route is}} the most {{convenient}} route for drug administration due to the highest component of compliance mainly the pediatrics and geriatrics. It {{is regarded as the}} most economical and safest method of drug delivery. Formulation of a orally <b>disintegrating</b> dosage form is beneficial for patients suffering from motion sickness, repeated emesis, mental disorder and dysphasia because they cannot swallow large quantity of water and it is easy to administer. The unique property of orally <b>disintegrating</b> dosage form is that they are readily <b>disintegrating</b> and dissolves in saliva and avoids the requirement of water which is the major benefit over conventional dosage form. Further, drug having the satisfactory absorption from the oral mucosa can be formulated in such type of dosage form.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{efficiency}} of powdered corncob as a tablet <b>disintegrating</b> agent {{was compared to}} that of a number of wood products and to starch, the most popular agent used today.

The optimum particle size, at which powdered corncob produced its best <b>disintegrating</b> activity, was found to be about No. 40 mesh size U. S. P. The tablet <b>disintegrating</b> action of corn- cob and starch in tablets containing some partially or fully insoluble materials such as acetysalicylic acid, calcium carbonate, and sulfadiazine was tested. Corncob proved to be superior to starch in all these tests. The three layers of corncob were separated and tested individually for their tablet <b>disintegrating</b> action. The pith portion showed superior results over the other two layers. The possible role of starch and/or cellulose in the tablet <b>disintegrating</b> activity of corncob was examined.

40|$|Kinematic {{studies of}} the Hipparcos {{catalogue}} have revealed associations that are best explained as <b>disintegrating</b> multiple systems, presumably resulting from a dynamical encounter between single/multiple systems in the field (Li et al. 2009).

We will present here the methods/techniques {{that can be used}} to search for and identify <b>disintegrating</b> benchmark systems in three database/catalogues: Dwarf Archive, the Hipparcos Main Catalogue, and the Gliese-Jahreiß Catalogue. Placing distance constraints on objects with parallax or colour-magnitude information from spectrophotometry allowed us to identify common distance associations. Proper motion measurements allowed us to separate common proper motion multiples from our sample of <b>disintegrating</b> candidates. Moreover, proper motion and positional information allowed us to select candidate systems based on relative component positions that were tracked back and projected forward through time. Using this method we identified one candidate <b>disintegrating</b> quadruple association, and two candidate <b>disintegrating</b> binaries, all of them containing one ultra-cool dwarf.

A statistical design of experiments was used to study the effect of filler, binder, <b>disintegrating</b> agent, and tablet hardness on the disintegration and dissolution of verapamil hydrochloride tablets. All formulation variables, i. e., filler, binder, and <b>disintegrating</b> agent, were found to influence tablet dissolution and disintegration, with the filler and <b>disintegrating</b> agent exerting the most significant influence. Slower dissolution was observed with increasing disintegration time when either the filler or the <b>disintegrating</b> agent was kept constant. However, no direct corelationship was observed between the disintegration and dissolution across all formulations due to the interactions between different formulation components. Although all tablets containing sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as the <b>disintegrating</b> agent, <b>disintegrated</b> in less than 3  min, half of them failed to meet the US Pharmacopeia 30 dissolution criteria for the verapamil hydrochloride tablets highlighting the dependence of dissolution process on the formulation components other than the <b>disintegrating</b> agent.
