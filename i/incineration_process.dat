30|$|Air {{pollution}} is currently {{one of the}} major problems worldwide, resulting that more rigorous environmental laws are introduced. The main source of air {{pollution is}} the combustion process of fossil fuels used in power plants, vehicles, ships and other <b>incineration</b> <b>processes</b> (Skalska et al. 2010). Sulfur oxides (principally SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) are the key combustion-generated air contaminants. Since NOx have been implicated in a variety of environmental effects such as acid rain, photochemical smog, tropospheric ozone layer depletion and even global warming, they are considered as the primary pollutants of the atmosphere (Wei et al. 2009 a).|$|R

40|$|The {{emission}} of heavy metals {{can be controlled}} by adding solid sorbents into the combustion chamber during <b>incineration</b> <b>processes.</b> The objective of this work was to experimentally study the adsorption efficiency of different sorbents for heavy metals under various incineration conditions. Each sorbent has its optimum operating temperature. Kaolinite and aluminum oxide have the best adsorption efficiency at 800 degrees C, and bauxite is at 700 degrees C. The adsorption efficiencies of the three sorbents for the four heavy metals ail follow the sequence of Pb > Cu > Cr >Cd. The presence of inorganic chloride (NaCl) and sulfate (Na 2 SO 4) increases the adsorption efficiency of the sorbents, but organic chloride PVC decreases the adsorption efficiency.

50|$|Improvements {{and changes}} {{have been made to}} nearly all {{industrial}} sources to reduce PCDD/F production. In waste incineration, large amounts of publicity and concern surrounded dioxin-like compounds during the 1980s-1990s continues to pervade the public consciousness, especially when new incineration and waste-to-energy facilities are proposed. As a result of these concerns, incineration processes have been improved with increased combustion temperatures (over 1000 °C), better furnace control, and sufficient residence time allotted to ensure complete oxidation of organic compounds. Ideally, an <b>incineration</b> <b>process</b> oxidizes all carbon to CO2 and converts all chlorine to HCl or inorganic chlorides prior to the gases passing through the temperature window of 700-400 °C where PCDD/F formation is possible. These substances cannot easily form organic compounds, and HCl is easily and safely neutralized in the scrubber while CO2 is vented to the atmosphere. Inorganic chlorides are incorporated into the ash.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of {{waste in the}} environment has frequently been indicated as a significant risk to human health. Therefore, landfill sites and the disposal of urban solid and non-hazardous waste by incineration are subject to much environmental monitoring, {{in addition to the}} regulations already in place. However, little action has been taken, and consequently no specific legislation exists, in relation to the assessment of the real biological risk of various substances, including chemical mixtures and ashes, derived from the <b>incineration</b> <b>processes.</b> This study assessed the cytotoxic potential of humid lightweight coal ash (LA) derived from <b>incineration</b> <b>processes</b> and waste management, on two cell lines: NCTC 2544 normal human keratinocytes and HECV endothelial cells. To reach this goal and to assess more-realistic methods for animal replacement, we employed different in vitro experimental approaches: acute and longer exposure to LA, by direct and indirect contact (0 – 2 mg/ml and 16 mg, respectively), both in 2 -D and 3 -D cultures. In 2 -D HECV cultures, we observed a decrease in the viability index, but only during direct contact with LA doses higher than 0. 1 mg/ml. Moreover, some striking differences in cytotoxicity were observed between the 2 -D and 3 -D models. Taken together, these observations indicate that, for studying pollutant toxicity during longer exposure times, 3 -D cultures in direct contact with the pollutant seem to offer a more suitable approach — they mimic the in vivo behaviour of cells more realistically and under strictly controlled conditions. Thus, in readiness for possible forthcoming European regulations, we believe that the proposed study, even in its preliminary phase, can provide new advice on the assessment of the toxic and biological potential of particular chemical compounds derived from waste management processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{benefits}} attainable by replacing atmospheric air with oxygen enriched air in waste <b>incineration</b> <b>processes</b> are examined. Technical, economical and environmental aspects are all discussed {{on the basis}} of the results of process simulations performed by using the PRO/II-Provision v. 7. 01 flowsheeting simulator (SimSci-Esscor).

The study is parameterized varying the thermal input to the plant (waste flow rate), the temperature set in the combustion chamber, the grade of enrichment in oxygen of the oxidizer and the price of the generated electric power. Results show that higher heat recovery efficiencies, lower fixed costs and decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants are obtained when enriched air is utilized...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, waste {{management}} {{systems have been}} evaluated using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. A main shortcoming of prior studies was the focus on a mixture of waste with different characteristics. The estimation of emissions and consumptions associated with each waste fraction in these studies presented allocation problems. Waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration is a clear example in which municipal solid waste (MSW), comprising many types of materials, is processed to produce several outputs. This paper investigates an approach to better understand <b>incineration</b> <b>processes</b> in Spain and Portugal by applying a multi-input/output allocation model.

40|$|Abstract. A {{feasibility}} {{study on the}} use of a thermal plasma process for the destruction of HFC- 23 is carried out in comparison with an <b>incineration</b> <b>process.</b> The material and energy balances for both processes are calculated using the commercial simulator, Pro/II (ver. 8. 0). Based on the computational analysis, the volume of the plasma process and NOx and CO 2 emissions in the plasma process are 25, 10 and 40 % of those in the <b>incineration</b> <b>process,</b> respectively. Therefore, more compact units can be employed in the plasma process.

40|$|International audienceDepending {{on their}} origins, {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are characterized by different chemical properties. Petrogenic PAH (e. g. from fossil fuels) and pyrolytic PAH (e. g. those produced by <b>incineration</b> <b>processes)</b> are therefore expected to affect organisms differently. The impact of trophic exposure to these PAH was investigated on swimming and metabolic performance of zebrafish Danio rerio. Two-month-old juveniles and six-month-old adults were individually challenged following a swimming step protocol. While pyrolytic exposure did not affect fish whatever the duration of exposure, it appeared that petrogenic PAH impaired adults’ performance. Indeed, the active metabolic rate in petrogenic PAH-contaminated adults was significantly reduced by 35 %, and critical swimming speed by 26. 5 %. This was associated with cardiac abnormalities, which are expected {{to contribute to the}} reduction of oxygen transport, particularly during intensive effort. These results {{may be due to the}} different composition and toxicity of PAH mixtures...|$|R
30|$|The {{situation}} {{in developing countries}} is different. While PCDD/Fs are considered {{within the framework of}} the Stockholm Convention and PCDD/F inventories have been developed in most developing countries, the release of PCDD/Fs has not been reduced due to the lack of improved waste management measures as well as the lack of capacity and funding to implement best available techniques and best environmental practice (BAT/BEP) in industries. A range of updated PCDD/F inventories in developing countries even show an increase in PCDD/F release due to increased consumption and release in uncontrolled <b>incineration</b> <b>processes</b> such as open waste burning [291, 296]. In addition to landfill fires, waste is often burned in backyards and along streets where chicken, goats and cattle forage for food, leading to exposures. Large areas are at risk of becoming contaminated over time leading to exposure, similar to the Campania region in Italy [239].|$|R
