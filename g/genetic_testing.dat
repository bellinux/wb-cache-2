40|$|The use of {{predictive}} <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> {{is expanding}} rapidly. Given limited health care budgets and few national coverage decisions specifically for <b>genetic</b> <b>tests,</b> evidence of benefits and harms {{is a key}} requirement in decision making; however, assessing the {{benefits and harms of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> raises a number of challenging issues. Frequently, evidence of medical benefits and harms is limited due to practical and ethical limitations of conducting meaningful clinical trials. Also, clinical endpoints frequently do not capture the benefit appropriately because the main purpose of many <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> is personal utility of knowing the test results, and costs of the tests and counseling can be insufficient indicators of the total costs of care. This study provides an overview of points to consider for the assessment of benefits and harms from <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> in an ethically and economically reflected manner.

5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. <b>Genetic</b> <b>testing</b> {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Genetic</b> <b>tests</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly available for clinical decision making, ushering {{in the era of}} personalized medicine. However, their implementation in clinical practice must be underpinned by a rigorous evaluation of their actual benefits. For this purpose, several evaluation tools have been developed. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify and compare the existing tools for assessments of <b>genetic</b> <b>tests,</b> taking into account their methodology and evaluation criteria. Methods A systematic review of the literature has been carried out through PUBMED, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Knowledge, Google and grey literature sources using the following inclusion criteria: research articles, systematic reviews, documents of eminent scientific societies, government agencies and research organizations focused on evaluation tools for <b>genetic</b> <b>test.</b> A DELPHI survey, undertaken with international experts in Public Health Genomics, will be performed to reach consensus on data extraction. Results Preliminary results consist of 19 tools published between 2000 and 2012 (10 in USA, three in Canada, six in Europe), mostly based on the ACCE model (n. 10 tools) and on the HTA model (n. 5 tools). Sixteen tools address all types of <b>genetic</b> <b>test,</b> while the others take into account a specific type of <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> (newborn screening, predictive <b>genetic</b> <b>tests,</b> <b>genetic</b> susceptibility <b>tests).</b> The evaluation criteria adopted by the vast majority of the tools (n. 16 tools) are analytic and clinical validity, clinical utility, ethical legal and social issues. At a glance, the evaluation of the economic aspects seems insufficient. Conclusions The comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the retrieved evaluation tools will be the basis for the choice of the most appropriate process of <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> evaluation that should take into account national and local contexts. Key messages Our preliminary search has retrieved 19 tools for the evaluation of <b>genetic</b> <b>tests,</b> developed in the last fifteen years This systematic review will provide the basis for adapting comprehensive and appropriate processes of <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> evaluation to the different national and local context...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{technology}} have enabled research to link many genetic markers to specific disease risk. This {{has led to}} the commercialization of <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> across a wide range of medical disorders. Public interest in one's own future health and an increasing desire for autonomy over one's health care have facilitated a large and growing market for such <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> to be sold direct to the consumer (DTC). Amidst a plethora of tests for a broad range of medical conditions, DTC <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> currently include a number of tests related to risk for various psychiatric illnesses including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and also for prediction of individual response to psychotropic medication. Although a large number of studies show that there is strong public interest in <b>genetic</b> susceptibility <b>testing</b> for psychiatric disorders, {{little is known about the}} impact on individuals of receiving the results of <b>genetic</b> <b>tests.</b> Moreover, the low predictive power and uncertain clinical validity and utility of DTC <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> for psychiatric disorders have led to both controversy and difficulties of interpretation of results. This review summarizes the rationale for using <b>genetic</b> risk <b>tests</b> in psychiatry, as an intervention for protective cognitive and behavioral change, and to predict medication response, with a focus on MDD. Since genetic risk information has the potential to influence major life-changing health decisions, there is an imperative to ensure that there is an appropriate evidence base to support the use of such <b>genetic</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive condition {{due to a}} mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent.

5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. <b>Genetic</b> <b>testing</b> is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E

In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. <b>Genetic</b> <b>testing</b> can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{advent of}} commercially {{available}} <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> for {{the diagnosis of}} several mental illnesses has led to intense controversy amongst the psychiatric research community. In this article the authors review these developments, and contrast these with the growing evidence from genomewide association studies that highly heritable psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia are due to the contributions and interaction of multiple allelic variants, each of small effect size. There is also evidence for the contribution of some highly penetrant rare de novo copy number variants, though the lack of disease specificity for these is of concern. This article outlines the prerequisites for predictive and diagnostic <b>genetic</b> <b>tests,</b> such as clinical validity and utility, and reviews the opportunity that <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> for mental illnesses present. As the scientific discourse on <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> for complex disorders {{is not limited to}} psychiatry, the authors outline current thoughts on the significance of genome-wide association studies across health, and the phenomenon of direct-to-consumer tests in medicine. The attitudes and understanding of patients, families, and clinicians about the future (currently hypothetical) scenario of psychiatric <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> are discussed, as is the potential for such testing to increase, rather than diminish stigma.

5|$|The Dales pony is one {{of three}} breeds known to be a carrier of the fatal genetic disease foal {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (FIS). FIS is a recessive disease; affected foals are born when they inherit the gene from both parents. Foals with FIS appear normal when born, but have a compromised immune system and anemia, leading to untreatable infections and death within three months. Following the development of a genetic test in 2010, 12% of Dales ponies tested in the UK were found to be carriers. The use of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> has allowed breeders to avoid mating two carrier animals, so that the disease is avoided in foals.|$|E

It also examined the reasons for differences across providers using a randomised experimental telephone survey of 1000 Australians.

5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.

5|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>testing</b> results {{published}} in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses {{are one of}} the most isolated horse populations in the world, with the second-lowest genetic variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses, the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.|$|E
