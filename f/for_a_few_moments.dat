5|$|As {{the aliens}} finally {{emerge from the}} mothership, they select Roy to join them on their travels. As Roy enters the mothership, one of the aliens pauses <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that {{correspond}} to the five-note alien tonal phrase. The alien replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which ascends into space, as Barry bids Roy goodbye.|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was carried}} back to Chinon on a litter, {{where he was}} {{informed}} that John had publicly sided with Richard in the conflict. This desertion proved the final shock and he finally collapsed into a fever, only coming to <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> during which he gave confession. Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the King had wished to be interred at Grandmont Abbey in the Limousin, but the hot weather made transporting his body impractical and he was instead buried at the nearby Fontevraud Abbey.|$|E
60|$|Lady Mary was staggered. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moment</b> {{she seemed}} {{struggling}} to rearrange her thoughts.|$|R

5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E
5|$|The ant {{who lost}} the ritual fight will lower its body, and lean {{sideways}} from the victorious ant. The victorious ant will remain raised upward and reach {{down to the}} worker and open its mandibles wider, grasping on the opponent's mandibles, and then tug and shake its head slightly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> However, the fight may continue if neither worker backs down, and will commence a side to side posture. Both ants circle each other and present their gasters directed to their opponent, and on some occasions, either {{one or both of}} the ants would kick outward using their legs at each other. Eventually, they will break contact and groom once appeasement has been reached and continue to search for another ant.|$|E
25|$|Under {{cloudless}} conditions, {{more interesting}} than the sunset itself is the view of the progression of the mountain's shadow across the California Central Valley to the distant Sierra Nevada, finally appearing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> above the horizon as a shadow in the post-sunset sky glow.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} one {{dimensional}} time dependent Schrödinger equation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> potential step with E < V_ 0. We obtain the wave is not instantaneously reflected, but <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moment</b> {{of time the}} wave packet penetrate into inaccessible classically region and then reflected. So it is shown that one can write the peneterated wave paket as superposition of incident and reflected wave packets like. Comment: 9 pages, latex, no figure...|$|R

6000|$|... "Tio Pancho," [...] she said, with {{a charming}} smile, [...] "may I trouble {{you to ask}} Mr. Merriam to come out <b>for</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> that I may speak with him?" ...|$|R
25|$|Monk was {{renowned for}} his {{distinctive}} style in suits, hats, and sunglasses. He was also noted for an idiosyncratic habit observed at times during performances: {{while the other}} musicians in the band continued playing, he would stop, stand up from the keyboard, and dance <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> {{before returning to the}} piano.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. 35th Infantry {{border post}} had about 15–18 men and {{requested}} reinforcements from their garrison. When they arrived they requested the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry. The 10th, commanded by Frederick Herman, {{came to their}} aid from their camp outside of town. After observing the situation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> Lt Colonel Herman ordered {{an attack on the}} Mexican and German held hilltops overlooking the border town. Defensive trenches and machine gun placements had been seen being dug there in the previous weeks. Herman wanted Americans there before Mexican reinforcements got there.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{also note}} that Robert Young, the {{traveling}} companion with whom victim Russell Nelson was visiting Chicago {{at the time of}} his disappearance in October 1977, gave differing accounts of the youth's disappearance to both Nelson's family and investigators. To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his (Young's) attention was diverted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> Nelson simply disappeared. Investigators contend this could not have happened without his traveling companion noticing.|$|E
60|$|They hurriedly {{stripped}} the canvas covering from the half-conscious man, and, taking a small bottle from his vest pocket, gave him <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drops of the liquid. It took effect, <b>for</b> in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> Clay feebly raised himself.|$|R
60|$|He spoke concisely, {{with a clean}} English intonation, and, as usual, betrayed no impatience; but Slavin fancied he was by {{no means}} pleased at the fact that a band of miners with grievances should presume to keep him waiting <b>for</b> even <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{would seem}} that his search was fruitless; <b>for</b> after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> of {{indolent}} and listless examination, he suffered his huge frame to descend the gentle declivity, in the same sluggish manner that an over fatted beast would have yielded to the downward pressure.|$|R
25|$|When {{one image}} is {{presented}} to one eye and a very different image {{is presented to}} the other (also known as dichoptic presentation), instead of the two images being seen superimposed, one image is seen <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> then the other, then the first, and so on, randomly {{for as long as}} one cares to look. For example, if a set of vertical lines is presented to one eye, and a set of horizontal lines to the same region of the retina of the other, sometimes the vertical lines are seen with no trace of the horizontal lines, and sometimes the horizontal lines are seen with no trace of the vertical lines.|$|E
25|$|When {{the police}} left without their prisoners, the {{fighting}} stopped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> The truce lasted {{only an hour}} or two as fighting resumed near The Tombs, supposedly brought about by a group of women from the Five Points who had provoked the Dead Rabbits into attacking the Bowery gangs. Bringing reinforcements, the participants were estimated at between 800 and 1000, armed with bludgeons, paving stones, brick bats, axes, pitchforks, and other weapons. Several hundred other criminals also arrived in the area, mostly burglars and thieves, who were not affiliated with either side and simply took the opportunity for looting. Residents and store owners all along the Bowery were forced to barricade their buildings and protect themselves with pistols and muskets.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
6000|$|... (Sadly.) Almost--and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> wild <b>moments,</b> quite. There {{are all the}} children. Did I {{ever tell}} you of the {{tenement}} child, who when asked how he knew when spring came, answered: When he saw the saloons put up their swing doors.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take in the topsails!" [...] roared the captain. But {{his voice}} was drowned in the shriek of the gale. The men were saved the risk of going out on the yards, however, <b>for</b> in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> more all the sails, except the storm-try-sail, were burst and blown to ribbons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so!" [...] the orator {{replied with}} an air of relief. [...] "I thank you! Ars est celare Naturam but that isn't it." [...] And, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{peaceful}} <b>moments,</b> the orator brooded, frowningly, over the quotation. The welcome opportunity was seized, and another voice struck into the silence.|$|R
25|$|On 6 May 1990, 3801 was {{involved}} in the Cowan rail disaster. 3801 was struggling to climb the Cowan Bank (on the Sydney side of the Hawkesbury River) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a CityRail Interurban passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V Set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that night}} in Callahan's office, the interns {{celebrate}} Elle's skill. Warner finds problems with calling a finely tuned awareness of homosexuality a legal victory. Callahan, annoyed with Warner's behavior, sends Warner {{out of the room}} to fetch a coffee. Callahan dismisses Emmett and the other interns but requests Elle to remain <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Callahan forcibly kisses Elle, who slaps him. In turn, Callahan fires her. Warner and Vivienne both see the kiss through the door of the room. Warner turns away in anger, leaving Vivienne to be the only one to witness the slap. After Callahan leaves, Warner re-enters the office and mocks Elle, but Vivienne tells him to shut up and they both leave. A defeated Elle prepares to go home, despite Emmett asking her to stay, finally realizing that he is in love with her ("Legally Blonde").|$|E
25|$|With the {{addition}} of the server browser and custom server options in the February 2017, many of the Control maps can also be set to be played in casual game modes as Capture the Flag. Both teams have a flag they must defend from the opposing team. To pick up the opponent's flag, the player must keep their character close to the flag and not take damage <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Once they have the flag, they must race back to their home base to earn the capture point. If the character is killed, the flag is dropped and either the capturing team must follow similar rules to pick it up, or if the owning team stays near the flag, it is automatically returned. A team can capture the opposing flag even if their flag has been taken. The match is over after one team obtains 3 captures or 5 minutes has expired, whichever comes first.|$|E
60|$|It {{was evident}} that {{something}} unusual had occurred, <b>for</b> after chatting <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> the three men withdrew into the magazine room and conversed in low, earnest tones.|$|R
60|$|Dick was perplexed by the {{behavior}} of these two strangers. He failed utterly to understand why they should have anything of such a private nature to discuss {{that it was necessary}} to move aside from him; <b>for</b> in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> they would be alone on the desert, after he had gone his way.|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{philosophy}} and a strength of reasoning about this reply, which Mr. Pickwick {{was not prepared}} <b>for.</b> He paused <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> and added, less firmly than before-- ...|$|R
25|$|On July 18, 2006, Varitek {{played his}} 991st game at catcher for the Boston Red Sox, {{breaking}} Carlton Fisk's club record. That game was a home game vs. Kansas City, during which Varitek's achievement was recognized before {{the bottom of}} the 5th inning (after the game was official and couldn't be cancelled due to weather). Varitek received a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at Fenway Park <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> before play resumed. On July 31, 2006, Varitek was injured rounding the bases in a 9–8 victory over the Cleveland Indians (his 1000th career game as catcher), but said he believed the initial injury to the knee occurred while he was blocking home plate to make the tag against the Angels Mike Napoli on July 29, 2006. He had surgery on August 3, 2006, to repair torn cartilage in his left knee. Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup on September 4, following a short rehabilitation assignment in Pawtucket.|$|E
25|$|Dayan {{suggested}} options at {{the beginning}} of the war, including a plan to withdraw to the Mitleh Mountains in Sinai and a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights to carry the battle over the Jordan, abandoning the core strategic principles of Israeli war doctrine, which says that war must be taken into enemy territory as soon as possible. Chief of Staff David Elazar objected to these plans and was proved correct. Israel broke through the Egyptian lines on the Sinai front, crossed the Suez canal, and encircled the 3rd Egyptian Army. Israel also counterattacked on the Syrian front, repelling the Jordanian and Iraqi expeditionary forces and shelling the outskirts of Damascus. During the war, Dayan was in contact with Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, who urged him to allow Israeli forces to enter Damascus, even <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Such a move, argued Schneerson, would provide Israel with a decisive victory. The war ended in a ceasefire and stalemate, but the Arab attack destroyed the image of Israeli invincibility and eventually led to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and the subsequent withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Egyptian territory.|$|E
500|$|The Olympic Flag {{was carried}} by eight people chosen {{from around the}} world to embody the Olympic values: Ban Ki-moon (as UN general secretary), Sally Becker (for courage), Doreen Lawrence (chosen for her [...] "tireless thirst for justice"), Haile Gebrselassie (for his [...] "fight against poverty"), Leymah Gbowee (as [...] "a great peacemaker"), Shami Chakrabarti (for [...] "her integrity"), Daniel Barenboim (for {{bringing}} [...] "harmony in place of discord"), and Marina Silva (as UN Champion of the Earth). [...] The flag paused in front of Muhammad Ali (invited to represent 'respect, confidence, conviction, dedication, generosity and spiritual strength'), who held it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Ali, who had lit the flame at the 1996 Atlanta Games, was accompanied by his wife Lonnie and appeared frail. The flag was received by a colour guard of Her Majesty's Armed Forces and hoisted to the Olympic Hymn, performed by the LSO and the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. The Olympic Oaths were taken by taekwondo athlete Sarah Stevenson on behalf of the athletes, by British AIBA Referee Mik Basi on behalf of the officials, and by Eric Farrell on behalf of the coaches.|$|E
60|$|Later, when Paula {{had played}} {{sufficient}} Debussy to equip Terrence and Aaron for fresh war, Graham {{talked with her}} about music <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> vivid <b>moments.</b> So well did she prove herself aware of the philosophy of music, that, ere he knew it, he was seduced into voicing his own pet theory.|$|R
5000|$|Pierre Berton {{said that}} in good weather, some 300 {{visitors}} a day {{found their way to}} the cat sanctuary. Journalists arrived, some {{from as far away as}} Venezuela, [...] "and television crews turn up to record the political cat phenomenon, if not for posterity, at least <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> fleeting <b>moments</b> on the tube".|$|R
6000|$|Apparently the {{peculiar}} unfitness of simultaneous mastication and speech struck him, <b>for</b> he paused <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> then continued,--"Yes, fitness. Supplies {{for the table}} absolutely needed. Healthy exercise a consequence. Result, felicity!" ...|$|R
