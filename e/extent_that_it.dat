5|$|The painting's dreamlike and {{haunting}} erotic {{evocation of}} infatuation and obsession {{was a huge}} popular success. After its first exhibition, at the 1782 Royal Academy of London, critics and patrons reäcted with horrified fascination and the work became widely popular, to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was parodied in political satire and an engraved version was widely distributed. In response, Fuseli produced {{at least three other}} versions.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could affect their health.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear weapons {{manufacture}} and other nuclear physics applications {{are a major}} source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers.

5|$|On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747-200 {{registration}} G-BDXH, {{flew through}} {{a cloud of}} volcanic ash and dust from the eruption of Mount Galunggung. The ash and dust caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines. The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had {{to be shut down}} again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched to such an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was difficult for the pilots to see out of the plane.

5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing {{has been limited}} to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from {{the large number of}} walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1966, air-pollution control {{had largely}} been the {{responsibility}} of states and political subdivisions of states like counties and municipalities (cities and towns). The federal government played little role in air-pollution control, and to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did, its actions supported the efforts of states and local governments. For example, federal law provided resources like research, training, grants to improve state and local programs, and a conference procedure to convene agencies and polluters {{under the guidance of}} the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Direct regulations—such as, for example, setting emissions standards—were left to states.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low to an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not react with phosphoramidites under {{the conditions of the}} coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
5|$|Around 90% of the {{turquoise}} parrot population resides in New South Wales. The species is not listed as threatened on the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, though a status of near threatened was proposed by Stephen Garnett and Gabriel Crowley in their 2000 work The Action Plan for Australian Birds {{on account of}} the significant reduction in distribution. Its population and range have varied wildly; widely distributed across eastern Australia from Mackay to Melbourne up to the 1880s, it vanished from much of its range to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was presumed extinct in 1915. It was not recorded from Queensland between 1923 and 1950, and Victoria between the mid-1880s and 1949.
