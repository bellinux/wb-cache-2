For smooth sinter plants operation, changes to the operating conditions should be few and precise. This paper explains <b>advisory</b> <b>platforms</b> that supply control strategies and sinter quality estimations to the plant operators, developing mathematical model, which are able to advise them about the necessary decisions to improve sinter quality. These models, based on Fuzzy Logic sets, {{have been developed to}} supply control strategies and sinter quality estimations to the plant operators at a Spanish factory. © 2006 ISIJ.

40|$|In the post-liberalisation area, utility {{companies}} {{operate in a}} context of multilevel regulation, involving a wide set of authorities with general or sector-based competencies. Such a specialisation in the regulatory arrangements may generate fragmentation and lack of effectiveness. This paper tempers these predictions and shows that coordination mechanisms drastically limit fragmentation in multi-level regulatory arrangements. In other terms, specialisation is not synonymous of fragmentation as coordination mechanisms compensate the dispersion of competencies between multiple levels and authorities. Using a typology of coordination instruments, the aim is to identify which instruments contribute to avoid fragmentation in the regulatory arrangements. The empirical analysis is based on a comparison of two utility sectors, energy and telecommunications, from a single-country perspective. Although the number of regulatory actors involved in each sector is quite substantial, arising coordination needs are dealt with by a range of procedural and structural coordination mechanisms. A multitude of coordination instruments are used in regulatory arrangements, notably <b>advisory</b> <b>platforms</b> in vertical coordination and non-binding advices in horizontal coordination. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} flooding {{patterns in}} the urbanised city-state of Singapore through a multimethod approach combining station precipitation data with archival newspaper and governmental records; changes in flash floods frequencies or reported impacts of floods towards Singapore society were documented. We subsequently discussed potential flooding impacts {{in the context of}} urban vulnerability, based on future urbanisation and forecasted precipitation projections for Singapore. We find that, despite effective flood management, (i) significant increases in reported flash flood frequency occurred in contemporary (post- 2000) relative to preceding (1984 – 1999) periods, (ii) these flash floods coincide with more localised, “patchy” storm events, (iii) storms in recent years are also more intense and frequent, and (iv) floods result in low human casualties but have high economic costs via insurance damage claims. We assess that Singapore presently has low vulnerability to floods vis-à-vis other regional cities largely due to holistic flood management via consistent and successful infrastructural development, widespread flood monitoring, and effective <b>advisory</b> <b>platforms.</b> We conclude, however, that future vulnerabilities may increase from stresses arising from physical exposure to climate change and from demographic sensitivity via rapid population growth. Anticipating these changes is potentially useful in maintaining the high resilience of Singapore towards this hydrometeorological hazard...|$|R
40|$|The DMPTool and DMPonline were {{developed}} to meet an emerging need arising from the advent of open data policies and each is now well established as the resource for researchers seeking guidance in creating data management plans (DMPs) in the US and UK respectively. Both services, and their sponsoring organizations, the California Digital Library (CDL) and the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), have succeeded in enabling researchers to comply with funder requirements in producing DMPs. However, {{this is just one}} step along the road to advancing open science. We see an opportunity to further leverage DMPs to support open science by integrating them into the broader ecosystem of data management infrastructure. In order to achieve this goal, we must redefine success to include not just adoption of our services by institutions but also widespread adoption by individual researchers, disciplinary communities, and funders. Working together with all stakeholders to make DMPs an essential, open part of the research lifecycle, and {{not just a matter of}} compliance, is the next step toward effectively managing and sharing research data. We propose to join forces and build a new, global data management <b>advisory</b> <b>platform</b> that links DMPs to other components of the research lifecycle. The biomedical research community provides an opportunity to adapt the infrastructure and associated educational resources to one specific disciplinary community and plug into new initiatives. We will reposition DMPs as living documents useful for structuring the course of biomedical research activities and integrating with related data management systems to lower the barriers for implementation and promote culture change. Consolidating around a single platform for DMPs extends our reach, keeps costs down, and moves best practices forward, allowing us to participate in a truly global open science ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Education {{has never}} been so {{important}} in the lifetime of an individual {{as it has been}} today. Education is regarded as a necessity in an individual’s life. It is the fact that, in modern societies the perception of education has been undergoing significant changes. Education that is assumed to be under the responsibility of family in traditional societies is within the scope of interests of the state and international institutions in modern social structure. Nation states in the world are paying too much effort in developing their educational systems to educate individuals capable of adaptation to the changes in the process of globalization. The aim {{of this study was to}} focus on the educational policy of European Union (EU) which has the target of maintaining collaboration and integration among the members of the union within the framework of common cultural values, and also to evaluate of Turkey’s adaptation process to these policies. Issue of Education in EU is rather crucial for Turkey to advance in her candidacy progress and elevate her global competition power. The EU holds the nature of a forum where, rather than setting one politics in the field of education, opinion exchanges across countries take place. The EU provides opportunities such as international education, vocational training and youth partnerships, exchange programs and education abroad, innovative training and education programs, application of new technologies in education, collective recognition of diplomas, web of academicians and professional expertise and <b>advisory</b> <b>platforms</b> aiming comparison and policy making. Educational policy of EU covers all stages of education (private schools, universities, professional associations etc.) and components of education (student, teacher, parent, director etc.) as well as complementing the programs of member states. Life-long learning has become the main point in EU’s educational strategy. This concept includes in itself all the stages and forms of education and besides combines them. Currently, what is expected from modern education systems is to be structured in a model that allows life-long learning. ‚Independent learning‛ and ‚learning to learn‛ have gained importance more than anything else. The individual is supposed to achieve self-improvement and conduct innovative and cooperative tasks. As a candidate of EU, Turkey has internalized the educational reforms that were stated as in Lisbon Strategy, and aimed at applying them. Thus, the process of Turkey’s future membership of EU maybe considered to be a perfect occasion and an impulsive power. In the globalizing world, Turkey should be having these educational reforms in practice urgently to be a developed nation and to stay alive...|$|R
