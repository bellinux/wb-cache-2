40|$|The {{transport}} of protons across liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine {{in response to}} <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> or pH gradients has been investigated. The results support three major conclusions. The first of these concerns the need for reliable measurements of <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> and pH gradients. It is shown that the potential probe tetraphenylphosphonium and the pH probe methylamine provide accurate and self consistent measures of <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> and pH gradients respectively in these systems. Second, it is shown by two independent techniques that the pH gradients induced in response to valinomycin and potassium dependent <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> are significantly smaller than would be expected for electrochemical equilibrium. The pH gradients observed are stable over an 8 h time course and {{are sensitive to the}} ionic composition of the buffers employed, where the presence of external sodium results in the smallest induced pH gradients. These results are discussed in terms of current models of proton conductance across membranes. In a final area of investigation, it is shown that valinomycin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) can transport sodium ions in a synergistic manner...|$|R

25|$|Strictly speaking, {{the terms}} {{grounding}} or earthing {{are meant to}} refer to an electrical connection to ground/earth. Bonding is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting metallic items not designed to carry electricity.

25|$|A {{hypervelocity}} railgun {{works very}} much like a particle accelerator insofar as it converts <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> energy into kinetic energy imparted to the projectile. A conductive pellet (the projectile) is attracted down the rails by electric current flowing through a rail.

Surface <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> decreased cooperatively in a limited region on the upper side within only 0. 5 to 2 min. This is the earliest event found so far to follow gravistimulation of intact epicotyls.
