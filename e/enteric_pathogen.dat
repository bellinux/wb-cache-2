50|$|EAEC is now {{recognized}} as an emerging <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogen.</b> In particular, EAEC are reported as {{the second most common}} cause of travelers diarrhea, second only to Enterotoxigenic E. coli, and a common cause of diarrhea amongst pediatric populations. It has also been associated with chronic infections in the latter, as well as in immunocompromised hosts, such as HIV-infected individuals. Awareness of EAEC was increased by a serious outbreak in Germany during 2011, causing over 5000 cases and at least 50 fatalities. The pathogen responsible was found to be an EAEC O104:H4 strain which was lysogenized by a Shiga toxin encoding phage (typically associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, which often encode the adhesin intimin).

40|$|Background Acute {{diarrhea}} {{is currently}} {{one of the}} major causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. A wide range of <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens,</b> including bacteria, is responsible for the pathogenesis of acute infectious diarrhea. Recent studies have shown an increase in acute phase proteins, such as serum interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) levels, in patients with acute bacterial gastroenteritis. Thus, IL- 6 may be a useful marker to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Objective To assess for a correlation between bacterial <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> and serum IL- 6 levels in children with acute diarrhea. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study from November 2013 to March 2014 in two hospitals in Manado. Subjects were children aged 1 - 5 years with acute diarrhea and good nutritional status. Subjects’ provided stool samples for bacterial culture and microscopic examination, as well as blood specimens for serum IL- 6 measurements. Data was analyzed by linear regression and Pearson’s correlation tests for a correlation between bacterial <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> and serum IL- 6 levels. Results In children with acute diarrhea, those with bacterial <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> had significantly higher mean serum IL- 6 than those with non-bacterial <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> (r = 0. 938; P < 0. 001). Conclusion Serum IL- 6 levels are significantly more elevated in children with acute diarrhea and bacterial <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Therefore, serum IL- 6 may be a useful marker for early identification of bacterial gastroenteritis in children aged 1 - 5 years.

30|$|At {{impacted}} sites, {{the density}} of thermotolerant coliforms {{was associated with the}} presence of <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens.</b> At least one pathogen was detected at every location in every water sample that contained levels of thermotolerant coliforms exceeding WHO water quality standards. This study demonstrates that collected water, soil and vegetables samples contained cultivable <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> potentially capable of causing gastrointestinal illness. At the region, farmer communities continuously use river water and sludge to increase food crop production. Therefore, vegetables may be contaminated with <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> while growing or upon harvesting. The fact that a high percentage of soil (10 / 12) and vegetables (8 / 12) samples were polluted with <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens,</b> suggests that urban river pollution, predominantly from human sources contaminates agricultural fields. However, untreated manure and wild and domestic animals may also contribute to the pathogen load.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) enteric medium for isolation and direct identification of <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> was evaluated. Six different biochemical reactions can be read by using the SSI enteric medium, allowing direct identification {{of a range of}} <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens.</b> All 248 gram-negative bacterial species that were tested grew on the SSI enteric medium. Only 10 of 248 bacteria (4 %) showed discrepant results in the biochemical reactions, and none of these were <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Forty-three of 47 <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> (92 %) produced identical rates of semiquantitative growth on the SSI enteric medium and 5 % blood agar, whereas three Vibrio spp. and one Aeromonas spp. showed reduced growth. Gram-positive bacteria did not grow on the SSI enteric medium. Most <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> had a detection limit of 50 bacteria per ml of feces, but higher numbers of Vibrio spp. and some Shigella spp. were required for detection. The growth rates of 125 <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> and 12 Yersinia spp. on the SSI enteric medium, xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD), Hektoen enteric (HE), Salmonella-Shigella (SS), and cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar were compared. Detection rates after application of 200 CFU were 99 % for SSI enteric medium, 92 % for XLD, 88 % for HE, and 82 % for SS agar. The 12 Yersinia spp. grew excellently on both the SSI enteric medium and CIN agar. We conclude that the performance of the SSI enteric medium compares favorably to those of other media tested. Its ability to detect Yersinia spp. may limit the number of media needed in the typical laboratory. The direct identification of <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> on the medium may also provide a more rapid diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Infectious {{diarrhea}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent diseases among children, especially in developing countries. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the etiological agents and drug resistance patterns of common <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> isolated in an Iranian 1000 -bed tertiary care hospital [...] Patients and Methods: In a retrospective study, we analyzed the etiology and drug resistance patterns of <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> associated with diarrheal cases. The study was carried out in the Milad hospital of Tehran over two years, from April of 2012 to January of 2014. Stool specimens from patients with diarrhea (n = 7321) were examined for <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> using routine microbiological culture methods. Strains of Salmonella, Shigella, and enteric pathogenic E. coli (EPEC) were serotyped and their susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was determined by a disk diffusion method, as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results: <b>Enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> were isolated from 310 (4. 23 %) of the patients. The most frequently isolated microorganisms included enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Salmonella, and Shigella spp. The majority of the isolates of EPEC were resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin (85. 61 %), cefixime (79. 41 %), and nalidixic acid. Resistance among other <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> was also prevalent. About 45. 70 % of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, and 87. 95 % were resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Resistance of the Shigella isolates to nalidixic acid in comparison to the resistance recorded in previous studies was higher. Conclusions: The results show that enteric bacteria, including EPEC, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. are the major causative agents of diarrhea in the hospital. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance among <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> is an important problem for public health. Considering the threat of emerging antimicrobial resistance among <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens,</b> a better surveillance system is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Three {{hundred and}} seven colonies {{believed}} to be <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> were selected from primary plates of MacConkey, xylose desoxycholate, or salmonella-shigella agar for inoculation to lactose-sucrose broth, urea- 41 motility medium, modified Andrade glucose broth with inverted Durham tube, pregrowth broth, triple sugar iron agar, lysine iron agar (LIA), and Christensen urea agar. The rapid screen consisted of interpreting the lactose-sucrose, urea- 41 motility, and modified Andrade glucose broth gas reactions after 4 to 6 h at 35 °C. These rapid screening biochemicals plus LIA were incubated for 24 h if further interpretation was required. Reference biochemicals (triple sugar iron, LIA, and Christensen urea agars) were interpreted at 24 h. Of 307 isolates, 49 (16 %) were reported as negative for <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> after 4 to 6 h because their biochemical profiles were not compatible with those for <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens.</b> A total of 87 (28. 3 %) isolates produced biochemical profiles at 4 to 6 h that were presumptive for <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens.</b> The 87 presumptive pathogens were inoculated into the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Negative General Susceptibility Card and the AutoMicrobic system Enterobacteriaceae-Plus Biochemical Card (AMS-EBC+) after 4 to 6 h of growth in pregrowth broth. Of these isolates, 63 were confirmed to be <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens,</b> of which 61 (96. 8 %) were correctly identified by the AMS-EBC+. One isolate was identified as Shigella dysenteriae by AMS-EBC+ but confirmed as Shigella flexneri biotype 6 by a reference laboratory.

40|$|Diarrhea is a {{frequently}} encountered {{problem in}} hospitalized patients. Since nosocomial spread of routine <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> such as Salmonella species, Shigella species, Campylobacter species and Escherichia coli O: 157 H: 7 seldom occurs, testing for these organisms in patients hospitalized {{for longer than}} three days has been questioned. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the length of hospitalization preceding detection of routine <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> and Clostridium difficile cytotoxin, and to develop guidelines for enteric cultures from hospitalized patients. The <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> detected in 1991 were C difficile toxin B(+), 77 %; Campylobacter species, 10 %; Salmonella species, 9 %; E coli O: 157 H: 7, 3 %; and Shigella species, 1 %. For 1992, these numbers were 86 %, 9 %, 3 %, 2 % and 0 %, respectively. None of the routine <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> isolated in 1991 or 1992 was detected in patients after their second day of hospitalization. Routine cultures for <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> on hospitalized patients were eliminated in February 1993, and physician ordering practices were monitored. With the exception of one campylobacter isolate per year, all routine <b>enteric</b> <b>pathogens</b> isolated in 1993 and 1994 were detected by the second day of hospitalization. Compliance with the changed protocol was 76 % measured over a four-month period in 1993 and 74 % over the year 1994. Savings of $ 3, 648. 10 were associated with rejecting 191 ‘inappropriate’ specimens in 1994.
