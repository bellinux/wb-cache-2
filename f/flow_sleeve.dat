50|$|Sleeve valves {{can operate}} {{for long periods}} of time over a high {{differential}} pressure across the valve. When a cavitation condition does exist the cavitation takes place surrounded by water. Unlike other valves, air is not necessary to control or suppress the cavitation. Because of this a single sleeve valve can replace several standard valves used in series.Sleeve valves can control flow and/or pressure over the entire stroke of the valve. Conventional control valves can typically control flow or pressure in the 20% to 80% range. Additionally, unlike conventional control valves the sleeve valve increases flow incrementally, i.e. 10% increase in stroke leads to a 10% increase in <b>flow.</b> <b>Sleeve</b> valves are adaptive to system or consumer requirements. The sleeve valve is designed to meet the requirements and allow for a wide range of variability of function. Most conventional control valves are designed to a specific set of conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wear is {{the main}} problem in gas turbine {{combustor}} components. The mating surfaces experience surface degradation affected by wear damage. The main mechanisms of wear occurred on combustor components could be adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and fretting wear. Wear resistant materials such as Haynes 25 (L 605) and Stelitte 6 were selected {{to be used in}} reducing wear damage especially on bull horn, transition piece and <b>flow</b> <b>sleeve</b> of combustor components. The reduction of wear on combustor components can be described as the extension of combustion inspection interval of a gas turbine. It is concluded that wear on combustor components can be reduced by the applications of wear resistant materials on the components...|$|E

To nerve himself for the deadly work before him, he began thinking of a lady whom he had once met--the lovely Donna Lavaca, beloved of El Toro-blanco. Having thus wrought up his Castilian soul to a high pitch of jealously, he felt quite irresistible, and advanced towards the two ruffians with his poniard deftly latent in his <b>flowing</b> <b>sleeve.</b> His mien was hostile, his stride puissant, his nose tip-tilted--not to put too fine a point upon it, petallic.

60|$|This valley may, {{in natural}} and {{political}} features, {{be taken as}} typical of the Afghan valleys. Seven separate castles formed the strongholds of seven separate khans. Some of these potentates had been implicated in {{the attack on the}} Malakand, and our visit to their fastnesses was not wholly of an amicable nature. They had all four days before been bound by the most sacred oaths to fight to the death. The great tribal combination had, however, broken up, and at the last moment they had decided upon peace. But the Pathan does nothing by halves. No black looks, no sullen reserve, marred the geniality of their welcome. As we approached the first fortified village the sovereign and his army rode out to meet us, and with many protestations of fidelity, expressed his joy at our safe arrival. He was a fine-looking man and sat well on a stamping roan stallion. His dress was imposing. A waistcoat of gorgeous crimson, thickly covered with gold lace, displayed <b>flowing</b> <b>sleeves</b> of white linen, buttoned at the wrist. Long, loose, baggy, linen trousers, also fastened above the ankle, and curiously pointed shoes clothed his nether limbs. This striking costume was completed by a small skull-cap, richly embroidered, and an ornamental sabre.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water <b>sleeves,</b> long <b>flowing</b> <b>sleeves</b> that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|R
50|$|A {{sleeve valve}} is a device {{typically}} {{used in a}} water supply or distribution system {{when there is a}} need to reduce high pressure or throttle <b>flow.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> valve consists of a cylindrical gate (tube) which slides over an inner sleeve. The inner sleeve consists of a series of nozzles specifically sized and arranged to provide a solution to cavitation issues frequently encountered in throttling applications with other valve types. Because of its design, it minimizes cavitation. Cavitation that does occur in severe throttling conditions is directed from the valve down to center of the valve or pipe so that no erosion damage to the piping can take place.|$|R

The immigration department blocked his entry into the U.S.A. on the grounds that he was not allowed to polygyny in an effort to stop him to preach in America. He faced situation with courage and patience and filed an appeal to the Department of Justice in Washington for entry. Mufti Muhammad Sadiq made a distinction between commandments and permissions in Islam. He stated that all Muslims must follow the commandments of their religion, but may avoid the permissions. Polygyny is permitted only in countries whose laws sanction its practice. In countries that prohibit polygyny, permission for its practice is disallowed under the commandment that all Muslims must obey the laws of the country in which they live.A dark skinned man with a heavy gray beard, wearing a bright green turban and a gray coat with <b>flowing</b> <b>sleeves,</b> Dr. Sadiq presented quite a striking picture to the American public.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my design {{was to create}} the perfect garment that a woman on-the-go could wear, from running errands to a spring walk in the park. The touches of gold in the sleeves and pant cuffs {{represent}} stars peeking out of the night sky, which is also mirrored {{in the depths of}} the blue bodice and black pants. During the creation process, I started with a pair of capris pants. For the top, I wanted something that would have some flow as the model walked. I decided to have <b>flowing</b> <b>sleeves.</b> After I made the sleeves gold, I thought it would also be a nice coordinating touch to add the same gold fabric on the cuff of the pants. The bodice was created by draping muslin on a dress form, then making patterns from the completed draping. The pants were made by flat-patterning, a process involving taking the model’s specific leg measurements, completing specific mathematical calculations, and precisely drawing out the pant pattern directly on paper. After all the patterns were made, samples were created and fit on my model. Adjustments were made from the fitting and the final garments were constructed. The bodice is fully lined with an invisible zipper, and the pants include a facing along the top and an invisible zipper. The conservative neckline and pant length makes it perfect for a wide variety of body types. The coordinating gold fabric for the sleeves and pant cuffs makes the garments perfect to be worn together, but also separates that could be worn with other garments, making them very versatile. The materials are polyester fabric, invisible zippers, polyester thread.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the validity of the Reynolds equation in spool valve analysis under cavitation. This study is carried out for a laminar and isothermal <b>flow</b> between a <b>sleeve</b> and spool with grooves. The pressure and lateral force obtained from the Reynolds equation and the Navier-Stokes equation are compared with variations of aspect ratio, cross sectional area, and number of grooves. The cavitation phenomenon is considered by using a cavitation model in the Navier-Stokes equation and the Reynolds cavitation boundary condition in the Reynolds equation. A large difference of more than 20 % is found between the equations for a lateral force of spool valve with many grooves. It was found that the Reynolds equation is not suitable for calculation of a lateral force of the spool valve with multiple-grooves of which the width and depth are even larger than the clearance under cavitation.|$|R
