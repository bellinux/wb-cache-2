40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{friction}} {{characteristics of the}} instrument-trocar interface in laparoscopic surgery for varying linear instrument velocities, trocar seal design and material, and trocar tilt. Furthermore, the effect of applying lubrication at the instrument-trocar seal interface on friction was studied. A friction testing apparatus was designed and built to characterise the resistance force at the instrument-trocar interface {{as a function of}} the instrument's linear movement in the 12 -mm trocar (at constant velocity) for different design, seal material, and angle of tilt. The resistance force depended on the trocar seal design and material properties, specifically surface roughness, elasticity, hardness, the direction of movement, and the instrument linear velocity, and varied between 0. 25 and 8 N. Lubricating the shaft with silicone oil reduced the peak resistance force by 75 % for all trocars and eliminated the stick-slip phenomenon evident in non-lubricated cases. The magnitude of fluctuation in resistance force depends on the trocar design and is attributed to stick-slip of the sealing mechanism and is generally higher during retraction in comparison to insertion. Trocars that have an <b>inlet</b> <b>seal</b> made of rubber/polyurethane showed higher resistance forces during retraction. Use of a lubricant significantly reduced frictional effects. Comparisons of the investigated trocars indicate that a low friction port, providing the surgeon with improved haptic feedback, can be designed by improving the tribological properties of the trocar seal interface...|$|E

Seal power loss is not strongly affected by <b>inlet</b> temperature. <b>Seal</b> power loss increases with increasing surface speed, seal pressure differential, mass flow rate or flow factor, and radial clearance.

40|$|The ACES Program {{began the}} {{investigation}} of regeneratively cooled ramjet engines for propelling aircraft at Mach 6 to 8 flight regimes while collecting and processing air for later use as oxidizer in rocket propulsion into an orbit flight mode. The Marquardt Company had as its prime task the design and demonstration of a ramjet capable of steady state operating using hydrogen as the regenerative coolant and with fuel flow limited to a theta = 1. Marquardt progressed from shell type combustors to advanced tubular combustion chambers in direct connect test rigs. The first tests were made with water cooled center bodies and plug nozzles using a pebble bed air heater to simulate flight air temperature. Later tests were made on completely H 2 cooled flight weight V/G assemblies direct connected to a SUE burner heater. Design studies were also conducted on integrated systems for take-off capability using offset turbojets connected to 2 -D or axisymmetric inlets. An 18 inch hypersonic ramjet evaluation scale model was designed based on the hot test results using a fully V/G inlet and exit nozzle. This thruster would provide 25000 lbs. of thrust with an estimated weight of 250 lbs. A V/G inlet would also incorporate an <b>inlet</b> <b>seal</b> for possible take-off thrust by rocket operation.

40|$|HPOTP and HPFTP {{vibration}} test results have exhibited transient and steady characteristics {{which may be}} due to impeller leakage path (ILP) related forces. For example, an axial shift in the rotor could suddenly change the ILP clearances and lengths yielding dynamic coefficient and subsequent vibration changes. ILP models are more complicated than conventional-single component-annular seal models due to their radial flow component (coriolis and centrifugal acceleration), complex geometry (axial/radial clearance coupling), internal boundary (transition) flow conditions between mechanical components along the ILP and longer length, requiring moment as well as force coefficients. Flow coupling between mechanical components results from mass and energy conservation applied at their interfaces. Typical components along the ILP include an <b>inlet</b> <b>seal,</b> curved shroud, and an exit seal, which may be a stepped labyrinth type. Von Pragenau (MSFC) has modeled labyrinth seals as a series of plain annular seals for leakage and dynamic coefficient prediction. These multi-tooth components increase the total number of 'flow coupled' components in the ILP. Childs developed an analysis for an ILP consisting of a single, constant clearance shroud with an exit seal represented by a lumped flow-loss coefficient. This same geometry was later extended to include compressible flow. The objective of the current work is to: supply ILP leakage-force impedance-dynamic coefficient modeling software to MSFC engineers, base on incompressible/compressible bulk flow theory; design the software to model a generic geometry ILP described by a series of components lying along an arbitrarily directed path; validate the software by comparison to available test data, CFD and bulk models; and develop a hybrid CFD-bulk flow model of an ILP to improve modeling accuracy within practical run time constraints...|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{parametric}} {{studies were}} performed to better understand seal-inlet rotordynamics. A CFD-perturbation model was employed to compute the seal-inlet flow disturbance quantities. <b>Seal</b> <b>inlet</b> disturbance boundary condition correlations were proposed from the computed seal-inlet quantities using the important parameters. It {{was found that the}} cosine component of the seal-inlet swirl velocity disturbance W 1 C has a substantial impact on the cross-coupled stiffness, and that the correlations for W 1 C and W 1 S should be used to replace the historical guess that <b>seal</b> <b>inlet</b> W 1 C = 0 and W 1 S = 0. Also, an extremely precise relationship was found between the swirl disturbance W 1 C and the seal-inlet swirl velocity (????Rsh ?????? ????W 0). Thus, the number of experiments or computer runs needed to determine the effect of spin speed, shaft radius and/or inlet swirl velocity on the cross-coupled stiffness is greatly reduced by plotting the simplified relationship of the cross-coupled stiffness against the swirl slip velocity. The benefits of using the new seal-inlet boundary condition correlations were assessed by implementing them into a CFD-perturbation model. Consistently improved agreement with measurements was obtained for both liquid annular seals and gas labyrinth seals. Further, the well-established CFD-perturbation model with new boundary condition correlations was employed to investigate the rotordynamics of two off-design situations.

Swirl brakes are well-known devices to reduce the swirl of the leakage at <b>seal</b> <b>inlet,</b> or preswirl. Their effectiveness is function of several geometrical parameters (swirl brake vane dimensions and shape, clearance gap between rotor and stator, seal diameter) and operating parameters (such as rotating speed, gas pressure, temperature, molecular weight, gas swirl upstream of the seal).

The seal has an outer diameter of 164 mm, is 33. 5 mm long and has a clearance of 1. 27 mm. The eccentricity ratios of the annular and labyrinth seals were 0. 10 and 0. 50 respectively. The whirl ratio for both seals were 1. 00. For both seals the maximum axial velocity is not located at the maximum clearance over the length of the seals as would be expected. Instead the maximum a) axial velocities are seen on the pressure side of the <b>seals</b> at the <b>inlet</b> but migrates to the suction side of the seal at the exit. The magnitude of this migration is dependent upon the seal eccentricity. The labyrinth seal exhibits an axial recirculation zone at the <b>seal</b> <b>inlet</b> due to its larger eccentricity. The radial velocity profiles are generally dependent on the seal eccentricity as well. Tangential velocities are seen to develop in inverse proportion to the axial velocity. For the annular seal the flow exhibits an uniform tangential velocity distribution by a location of ZAL = 0. 10. The labyrinth seal displays a similarly uniform distribution for the tangential component by the third cavity(Z/L = 0. 36). The exit magnitudes of the azimuthal velocity is about 0. 4 WSh indicating that the azimuthal velocity is not significantly altered by altering the whirl ratio. Turbulence generation is dominant over the first third of the seal after which there is a sharp decrease in the turbulence levels...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 46 - 59 The current {{centrifugal}} compressor {{design for the}} Oil & Gas market {{is more and more}} challenging since the cost requirements and the presence of many competitors is pushing towards casing size reduction and rotational speed increase. The first requirement basically leads {{to increase the number of}} wheels per rotor and the second to cross more critical speeds requiring the proper degree of damping. The two consequences together lead also to increase the rotor flexibility ratio (defined as the ratio between the Maximum Continuous Speed and the first critical speed as per the Fulton diagram and API 617 7 th ed. [1 - 2]) and finally the rotordynamic stability is very much challenged. The {{centrifugal compressor}}s rotordynamic stability is then strictly related to the internal seals? dynamic behaviour and for this reason the authors? Company decided several years ago to develop internally a High Pressure Seal Test Rig to measure seals? stiffness and damping. The rig is now in operation. This paper aims to describe the main test rig capabilities, the applied identification procedures and the preliminary test results on a long labyrinth seal (smooth rotor - straight toothed stator). Due to the pressure level (500 bar design pressure), the test rig plant appears like a high-pressure industrial plant equipped with the testing cell (a 1 : 1 scale high pressure compressor) and all the relevant auxiliaries: a 400 kW electric motor (driven by a VFD), a speed increaser gear box, a high pressure reservoir (6 m 3) with a volumetric compressor to fill it, high pressure pipes and valves. The testing cell is composed of a high-pressure compressor casing with stator parts capable to regulate the <b>seal</b> <b>inlet</b> swirl and a rotor running on Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs), which serve as exciters (5 kN MAX Force over a 0 - 330 Hz frequency range per axis) and displacement transducers. Special instrumentation is installed into the testing cell in order to measure the main test parameters: seal upstream/downstream gas pressure, upstream temperature and swirl and mass flow. Industrial high-pressure instrumentation is installed on the plant for regulation and monitoring purpose. Maximum test pressure is 350 bar and maximum rotational speed is 15000 rpm. Test gas is nitrogen. The AMBs control-system capabilities have been tuned to define several alternative excitation patterns and the relevant state of the art identification techniques have been applied. The first seal tested is a long labyrinth seal to simulate a centrifugal compressor balance piston seal. Test results and comparison with a commercial bulk flow code predictions will be fully described. Finally, the future test program will be showed...|$|R
40|$|In {{centrifugal}} pumps the leakage and dynamic characteristics of annular seals are important factors for pump performance. Both seal leakage and dynamics are greatly {{affected by the}} relationship between fluid flow and wall friction. In this thesis explicit friction factors were developed which relate the turbulent fluid flow in the seal to wall friction for seals with rectangular grooves. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to study a range of groove width to depth ratios between 1 and 16 and groove depth to clearance ratios between 0. 2 and 25. 8. In this range an optimal groove geometry for leakage reduction was found which may increase the volumetric effciency of pumps considerably. Based on a similarity assumption for grooves and hole patterns a friction factor was proposed for hole pattern seals. Based on the developed friction factors extensions were made to a theory for predicting dynamic characteristics of plain seals to deal with grooved and hole-patterned seals {{or a combination of}} both. The method does not require calibration to experiments in order to give useful results. A parameter study indicated that for certain stator hole patterns the cross-coupled stiffness could be greatly reduced compared to that of a smooth seal. This means that self excited vibrations from the seal may be prevented and the range of stable operation of the pump may be increased. Another extension of the theory accounts for angular stiffness, damping, and added mass moment of inertia for tapered seals. A previously published isotropic friction factor based on pipe flow in the transition between laminar and fully turbulent flow was also invluded in the theory for predicting dynamic coefficients. Results compared well to previously published theoretical results, however, comparisons to experimental results indicate that this friction factor is of limited use for <b>seals.</b> <b>Inlet</b> and exit conditions of seals affect both seal leakage and rotordynamic coefficients to some extent. An experimental study of inlet and exit losses for seals with sharp, chamfer, and protruding edge inlet and exit geometrics was carried out for a range of axial and tangential flow veloocities. The inlet loss was sensitive to geometry changes, while the exit loss was not. The commonly used assumptions of no rotational speed dependency for entrance and exit losses holds well when the average tangential flow is {{less than or equal to}} the axial flow. However, as the tangential flow became much alrger than the axial flow this assumption did not hold well. In the same study leakage for seals with shallow grooves was studied. Experimental leakage results for shallow grooves on the rotor corresponded well with theoretical predictions based on the friction factor developed in this thesis. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
