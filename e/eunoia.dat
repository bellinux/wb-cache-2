50|$|Park's work explores {{visualizing}} emotive {{states and}} the subconscious. In <b>Eunoia</b> and <b>Eunoia</b> II, she controlled pools of water with her brain-waves. This was accomplished by having electroencephalography (E.E.G.) data to create sound-waves which were pushed through pools of water, causing them to ripple. Park sat {{in the center of}} the pools as this occurred. For <b>Eunoia,</b> Park separated the E.E.G. data into five emotions, each of which fed into one of five pools of water. For <b>Eunoia</b> II, she expanded her conception of brain activity to cover forty-eight pools of water, matching the forty-eight emotions described by philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Also, while Park strove to control her emotions in <b>Eunoia</b> in order to keep the pools of water still, she changed her approach in <b>Eunoia</b> II to focus on expressing emotions.|$|E
