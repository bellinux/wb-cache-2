5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a <b>heavy</b> <b>concrete</b> support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the <b>heavy</b> <b>concrete</b> floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E
25|$|Unifying {{the long}} {{approaches}} and the distinctive central span are <b>heavy</b> <b>concrete</b> railings, originally topped with decorative street lamps. These pierced handrails were {{designed as a}} kind of visual shutter (stroboscopic effect), so that at a speed of 50km/h motorists would see through them with an uninterrupted view of the harbour. The effect works at speeds from about 40 to 64km/h.|$|E
40|$|Shielding of a reactor is {{required}} for protection of people and environment during normal operation and accidental situations. In the present paper we investigated the shielding parameters viz. mass attenuation coefficients, linear attenuation coefficients, tenth-value layer, effective atomic numbers, kerma relative to air and exposure buildup factors for gamma-ray for ordinary, heavy, and super <b>heavy</b> <b>concretes.</b> Macroscopic effective removal cross-sections for fast neutron had also been calculated. Ordinary concrete is economically suitable for mixture high energy gamma-ray and neutron as it has large weight fraction of low-Z as compared with super <b>heavy</b> <b>concretes</b> {{to slow down the}} neutron. Super <b>heavy</b> <b>concretes</b> are superior shielding for both reactor operation and accident situations. The study is useful for optimizing for shielding design and radiation protection in the reactors...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of small-sized metal fillers (SMF) provides {{a combination of}} high bulk density, increased durability and ferromagnetic properties of composite materials on the cement basis. However, the total strength of the composite can be compromised by poor adhesion of metal particles with the cement matrix. The use of versatile additives like microsilica and metakaolin is able to improve the structural integrity and mechanical properties of <b>heavy</b> <b>concretes.</b> The paper considers {{the results of a}} study using specimens of <b>heavy</b> <b>concretes</b> with SMF aiming to estimate its strength, structural features and ultrasonic parameters. It was found that the contact of SMF particles with the cement was not perfect, since the voids appeared between them and the cement matrix during the cement hydration process (exothermal reaction). Due to the border porosity, the specimens with the metal fillers have lower compressive strength, lower ultrasound velocity and increased frequency slope of attenuation. Microsilica and metakaolin additives facilitate better contact zone between the cement matrix and metal fillers...|$|R
25|$|In 1932 Tottenham Urban District Council {{purchased}} Broadwater Farm. The western {{half was}} drained and converted for recreational use as Lordship Recreation Ground, while {{the eastern half}} was kept vacant for prospective development and used as allotments. <b>Heavy</b> <b>concrete</b> dikes were built to reduce flooding of the Moselle in Lordship Recreation Ground, whilst on {{the eastern half of}} the farm the river was covered to run in culvert as far as Tottenham Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The 240mm {{howitzer}} M1 {{was designed}} {{together with the}} longer ranged 8-inch Gun M1, and they both shared a related carriage. While use of the 8-inch gun was limited due to excessive bore wear and poor accuracy, the howitzer saw considerable action during World War II in Europe due to its effectiveness against difficult targets such as <b>heavy</b> <b>concrete</b> fortifications. It was also used in the Pacific campaign, notably in the Battle of Manila, but few targets there were heavily fortified enough to justify its use.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of dual carriageway roads now have barriers. Some are <b>heavy</b> <b>concrete</b> obstructions which can bounce a vehicle {{back into the}} path of other traffic; others are made from steel ropes mounted on moderately weak posts, where the rope cuts into the vehicle body to slow the vehicle while keeping it against the barrier until it has stopped. Often on urban dual carriageways where the road has been converted from a four-lane single carriageway the central reservation will not be substantial: often just a small steel divider to save space.|$|E

2500|$|The {{anti-tank}} {{gate was}} a rolling barrier which slid from a slot in a fortified concrete housing {{along the side}} of the road, forming a barrier some meters from the post's blockhouse. The road and post occupied a narrow shelf between a cliff and a steep slope to the sea. The gate housing included two small arms ports, while the blockhouse could cover the gate and the road beyond with its guns firing through embrasures in the <b>heavy</b> <b>concrete</b> guardpost. [...] Tunnels in the cliff wall behind the post contained a magazine, living quarters, and an escape tunnel, like a Maginot ouvrage on a much smaller scale.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, the United States Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management {{initiated}} {{investigation into the}} potential use of depleted uranium in <b>heavy</b> <b>concretes.</b> The aim {{of this investigation was}} to simultaneously find an application for depleted uranium and to create a new and more efficient method for the storage and transportation of spent nuclear fuels. The material was first conceived at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) by W. Quapp and P.

50|$|The first {{bridge at}} this location, {{replacing}} a hand-pulled ferry, {{was built in}} 1907 and financed by local landowners. It was a rather <b>heavy</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge with a five metres wide roadway flanked by two 0,5 metres thick edges.|$|E
40|$|Time {{dependent}} deformations in concrete, both creep and shrinkage, play {{a critical}} role in prestressed concrete structures, such as bridge girders, nuclear containment vessels, etc. These strains result in lossess, through release of prestress, and thereby influence the safety of these structures. The present study comprises of an experimental and analytical program to assess the levels of creep and shrinkage in normal and <b>heavy</b> density <b>concrete.</b> The experimental program includes tests on creep using standard cylinder specimen, while shrinkage studies have been conducted using prism specimen, both under controlled environmental conditions. The experimental results suggest that creep and shrinkage strains are higher in <b>heavy</b> density <b>concrete</b> than in normal concrete. This may be attributed to the relatively smaller pore structure of <b>heavy</b> density <b>concrete,</b> that results in larger availability of free water and a relatively slower hydration process in comparison to normal concrete. While there is some scatter in the results, creep strains decrease with age of loading and both creep and shrinkage strains are smaller when the relative humidity is higher. Statistical model reported in the literature for normal concrete is able to predict the test results for both normal and <b>heavy</b> density <b>concrete</b> quite well. Long term predictions of creep and shrinkage using this model, accounting for uncertainties, is also projected and shown to predict some long term measured results not used in the model calibration. The long term predictions are sensitive to the initial data used in model calibration...|$|R

40|$|A drop weight rig, somentimes also {{referred}} to as drop hammer, is a heavy-duty testing machine to perform tests as the drop weight tearing tests (DWTT) for diverse steel materials (including plank, section bar, cast steel and forged steel). These tests allow the evaluation of the material ductility by observing the fracture pattern and its temperature dependency, according to diverse testing standards. The machine makes use of the gracity force, where a mass, restrained by vertical guides, is lifted and then released. Here, the design of a drop weight tester for scientific applications is described. The rig is designed to achieve an energy capacity of 42 kJ, hence involving the construction of a tougher metallic supporting structure, a <b>heavier</b> <b>concrete</b> foundation and steel anvil as a larger lifting mass. All these machine components were properly designed, as here presented, together with some comments on data acquisition system for scientific applications. FINEPFAPES...|$|R
