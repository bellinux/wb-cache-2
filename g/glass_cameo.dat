5000|$|Thomas Webb & Sons was an English glass company, {{founded in}} 1837 by Thomas Webb (1804-1869) near Stourbridge, England. The name T. Webb & Co. was adopted in 1842, {{and later became}} Thomas Webb & Sons. Webb {{operated}} the Platts glasshouse from 1837 to 1856 and then the Dennis glassworks from 1855 to 1990. [...] The company, known originally as the [...] "Crystal King of England," [...] was noted for the high quality of its Cameo <b>glass.</b> <b>Cameo</b> glass is created by a process of etching and carving through a layer of opaque white glass, leaving a white relief design on a darker colored glass body. Some pieces used two layers of etched glass to create a three-color Cameo glass product. In the 1870s John Norwood produced the first pieces, inspired by the Portland Vase. George Woodall would produce the most distinguished Webb Cameo work {{towards the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
40|$|Underwater {{excavations}} of a submerged {{site in the}} bay of Abuqir {{have yielded}} small finds that indicate workshop activity: short pieces of gold wire, gold splinters, an undrilled bead, copper ingots and coloured raw glass {{for the production of}} beads and cameos. In addition, a few pieces of jewellery and accessories were probably made at the site, for instance a <b>glass</b> <b>cameo</b> consisting of the same material as some pieces of raw glass and a finger ring with a bezel in the shape of an oil lamp. For various reasons, the excavated site may have belonged to the pilgrimage shrine of SS Cyrus and John at Menouthis, and oil lamps played an important part at liturgies and healings that were conducted at the shrine. An older account in the 9 th-century Coptic miracles of St. Menas refers to a gold workshop of the Holy Apa Apakyri and, therefore, probably to the gold workshop attached to the shrine. The site was active until the early 8 th century...|$|E
40|$|U rimskoj su provinciji Dalmaciji od 1. do 3. st. značajnog traga ostavili staklari kojima znamo ime, bilo da su njihove posude uvezene, bilo da su ovdje proizvedene. U Augusteumu u Naroni (Vid kod Metkovića) te u Tiluriju (Gardun) nađeni su ulomci čaša koje su načinili, i to potpisali, Ennion i Aristeas. U naronskom Augusteumu nađen je skyphos, djelo jednog od šest Sidonaca. U istom je hramu nađena staklena kameja, možda rad jednog od trojice Dioskuridovih sinova. U Saloni su djelovala dva staklara, Paschazije, ili Pascazije, te vjerojatno Miscenije Ampliat. Uz Asseriju (Podgrađe kod Benkovca) vezuje se rad staklarâ Trellusa i Athenija. Dodajmo tome mogućnost da su osobna imena na dnu staklenih balzamarija i boca imena staklara, pa uz Argyruntum (Starigrad), Iader (Zadar), Asseriju, Volceru (Bakar) i Zaton vezujemo sljedeća imena: Rufinius, A(ntonius) Volumnius Ianuarius, Q. Dani Euhelpisti, L. Aemilius Blasius, C. Salvius Gratus, Cn. Pompeius Cassianus. Ako je riječ o staklarima, njihove su boce uvezene u Dalmaciju iz sjeverne Italije. Uz to valja napomenuti kako postoji hipoteza o Blasijevoj i Pompejevoj dalmatinskoj podružnici. In {{the last}} decade in Dalmatia the {{fragments}} of three cups attributed to the famous 1 st century glassblowers Ennion and Aristeas were found. Dalmatian Ennion’s cups come from the military camp in Tilurium (Gardun near Trilj) and from the Augusteum in Narona (Vid). The Naronitan vessel is the forth or fifth such vessel found on the route to Tremithus in Cyprus - Narona - Cavárzere near Adria - Romula - possibly Tarragona. Similar fragments are known from Mogador in Morocco as well as aforementioned fragment from Gardun in Croatia, which {{is too small to}} be attributed to some of Ennion’s cups with one or two handles. Aristeas, Ennion’s follower, as a Cypriote signed the Naronitan cup from Augusteum and the cup in the Constable-Maxwell collection, and without the toponymic mark the cup in olive-green glass in the Strada Collection, Pavia. The inscriptions on the flat horizontal tongues of two handles of scyphus from the Augusteum in Narona are worn and illegible so we don’t know who of Sidonians signed it in the 1 st century AD. The Naronitan <b>glass</b> <b>cameo</b> of Livia with the youthful appearance and hairstyle with nodus certainly originated in Rome during the period of Tiberius, and is possibly a work of one of Dioskourides’ sons: Eutyches, Hyllos or Herophilos. Only Salona in Dalmatia is proved to have been a glassworks centre not only by the remains of a glass furnace, but with certain epigraphic evidence - a sarcophagus fragment with the inscription of glassmaker Paschasius or Pascasius, and a marble mould for glass bottles with the inscription of glassmaker Miscenius Ampliatus. Depictions of closed glass furnaces, and glassblowing scenes are preserved on three clay lamps from the 3 rd quarter of 1 st century AD, consistent with the spread of glassblowing technique, one from Prati di Monestirolo (Ferrara region, Italy), the one from Školarice (Slovenia: Regio X) and another from Asseria (Dalmatia). On the lamp from Asseria the names of two depicted glassblowers, freedmen are inscribed: [Tre]llus and Athenio, his assistant whose name suggests Athenian origin, his or his ancestor’s. There is a possibility that the personal names on the bottoms of glass unguentaria and bottles are the names of glassmakers, so we relate the following names Rufinius, A(ntonius) Volumnius Ianuarius, Q. Dani Euhelpisti, L. Aemilius Blasius, C. Salvius Gratus, Cn. Pompeius Cassianus to Argyruntum (Starigrad), Iader (Zadar), Asseria (Podgrađe near Benkovac), Volcera (Bakar) and Zaton. If they were glassmakers, their bottles were imported in Dalmatia from north Italy; note that there is a hypothesis about Blasius’ and Pompeius’ Dalmatian branch glass shop...|$|E

50|$|During the Roman {{period the}} cameo {{technique}} was used on glass blanks, {{in imitation of}} objects being produced in agate or sardonyx. <b>Cameo</b> <b>glass</b> objects were produced in two periods; between around 25 BC and 50/60 AD, and in the later Empire around the mid-third and mid-fourth century. Roman <b>glass</b> <b>cameos</b> are rare objects, with only around two hundred fragments and sixteen complete pieces known, only one of which dates from the later period. During the early period they usually consisted of a blue glass base with a white overlying layer, but those made during the later period usually have a colourless background covered with a translucent coloured layer. Blanks could be produced by fusing two separately cast sheets of glass, or by dipping the base glass into a crucible of molten overlay glass during blowing. The most famous example of a cameo from the early period is the Portland Vase.|$|R

40|$|Research on {{the visual}} {{language}} of Augustan Rome is mainly focused on Greek influences, but Egypt likewise {{played an important}} role in Augustus' propaganda programme and subsequently in the development of material culture in both the public and private spheres of the city of Rome. Roman <b>cameo</b> <b>glass</b> constitutes an interesting and so far underexplored example of this process. By examining two case studies of <b>cameo</b> <b>glass</b> with Egyptian decorative elements from the collection of The British Museum, this paper explores how Egyptian elements were incorporated in and became an integral part of the material culture of Augustan Rome. The first case study looks at one specific <b>cameo</b> <b>glass</b> fragment; here Egypt is evoked through the fusion of Egyptian stylistic and thematic elements with Greek stylistic components and Roman materials, and seems intended to convey a certain concept of Egypt that could be recognised as such within its Roman context. The second case study explores how the arrival of an obelisk from Egypt in Rome initiated the proliferation of different visual concepts of that Egyptian monument throughout the material culture of Augustan Rome, varying from actual copies of the monolith to its portrayal as part of the Circus Maximus on gemstones and <b>cameo</b> <b>glass</b> vessels of Roman manufacture...|$|R

2500|$|Like the British Museum's other {{spectacular}} work in Roman <b>glass,</b> the <b>cameo</b> <b>glass</b> Portland Vase, the cup represents to {{some extent}} the extension of skills developed by cutters of engraved gems, or the larger hardstone carving of vessels in semi-precious stones, which were luxury arts with enormous prestige in ancient Rome. [...] No carved gemstone vessels directly comparable to either work are known, but the general taste behind these extreme exhibitions of glass-making skill is one formed by objects in natural stones like the Coupe des Ptolémées or the Rubens Vase.
