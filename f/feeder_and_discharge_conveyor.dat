40|$|The {{traditional}} straightline intermittent reciprocator {{has only}} one motion curve. By applying the TRIZ contradiction table to select proper innovative principles, we design a straightline intermittent reciprocator with a polytropic motion curve that possesses the function of variable velocity power source, under the condition of fixed velocity power source. With the Scotch-Yoke as the original mechanism, by modifying its slider and adopting the method of applying the rocker axis of rotation {{in a set of}} crank rocker four-link mechanism, we design a straightline reciprocator that possesses such variable motion curves as the variable straightline reciprocating motion, the straightline one-way variable intermittent reciprocating motion, and the straightline two-way variable intermittent reciprocating motion. In addition, by applying the BASIC program language to develop the mechanism design software, we quickly obtain the optimal design plan of the straightline intermittent reciprocator, and by means of the instance design and prototype manufacturing, proves that the achievements of our research may not only provide reference for the design of such mechanisms as the bias cutter, the surface glue cutter, and the punch fast <b>feeder</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharger</b> for the rubber industry, but also be used as the teaching materials and aid for the mechanism creative design...|$|R

50|$|Crushing at {{the actual}} {{construction}} site using portable crushers reduces construction {{costs and the}} pollution generated when compared with transporting material to and from a quarry. Large road-portable plants can crush concrete and asphalt rubble at 600 tons per hour or more. These systems normally consist of a rubble crusher, side <b>discharge</b> <b>conveyor,</b> screening plant, <b>and</b> a return conveyor from the screen to the crusher inlet for reprocessing oversize materials. Compact, self-contained mini-crushers are also available that can handle up to 150 tons per hour and fit into tighter areas. With the advent of crusher attachments - those connected to various construction equipment, such as excavators - the trend towards recycling on-site with smaller volumes of material is growing rapidly. These attachments encompass volumes of 100 tons/hour and less.|$|R

40|$|The work {{includes}} the mechanical analysis of mechanical <b>feeders</b> <b>and</b> batchers that find application in various technological processes <b>and</b> industrial fields. <b>Feeders</b> are usually classified {{according to their}} design features into two groups: conveyor-type <b>feeders</b> <b>and</b> non-conveyor <b>feeders.</b> Batchers are used to batch solid bulk materials. Less frequently, they are used for liquids. In terms of a batching method, they are divided into volumetric and weighting batchers. Weighting batchers do not provide for sufficient batching accuracy. Automatic weighting batchers include a mass controlling sensor and systems for automatic material feed <b>and</b> automatic mass <b>discharge</b> control. In terms of operating principle, batchers are divided into gravitational batchers and batchers with forced feed of material using conveyors and pumps. Improved consumption of raw materials, decreased loss of materials, ease of use in automatic control systems of industrial facilities allows increasing the quality of technological processes and improve labor conditions. The batch feeder suggested by the authors is a volumetric batcher that has no comparable counterparts among conveyor-type <b>feeders</b> <b>and</b> allows solving the problem of targeted feeding of bulk material batches increasing reliability and hermeticity of the device...|$|R

These symptoms cause house finch populations to decline due to increased predation and susceptibility to trauma from impaired vision. House finch conjunctivitis is most frequent during colder months when birds are using bird <b>feeders</b> <b>and</b> can cause birds to be reluctant to leave the feeders. Birds have been seen rubbing their eyes on branches or on bird feeders, which can help spread the disease.|$|R
