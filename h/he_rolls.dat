25|$|Elijah, {{in company}} with Elisha, {{approaches}} the Jordan. <b>He</b> <b>rolls</b> up his mantle and strikes the water. The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot {{of fire and}} horses of fire appear and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle {{falls to the ground}} and Elisha picks it up.|$|E
25|$|In the 1986 film The Money Pit, {{the lead}} character, Walter Fielding, played by Tom Hanks, accidentally falls in a {{construction}} area where workers are renovating his home. In a sequence {{reminiscent of a}} Rube Goldberg machine, he stumbles through a window, across the roof, down a scaffold, finally into a wheeled bin in which <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> down a hill and is dumped into a fountain resting directly under {{a replica of the}} Manneken Pis.|$|E

500|$|The player {{controls}} the Prince as <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> the katamari around houses, gardens, and towns {{in order to}} meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos. [...] The player uses the two analog sticks on the DualShock controller {{in a manner similar to}} the classic arcade game Battlezone to control the direction the katamari rolls. [...] Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more.|$|E
500|$|III.1 {{opens with}} the Four Masters' ass narrating how he thought, {{as he was}} [...] "dropping asleep", he had heard and seen an {{apparition}} of Shaun the Post. As a result, Shaun re-awakens, and, floating down the Liffey in a barrel, is posed fourteen questions concerning the significance {{and content of the}} letter he is carrying. Shaun, [...] "apprehensive about being slighted, is on his guard, and the placating narrators never get a straight answer out of him." [...] Shaun's answers focus on his own boastful personality and his admonishment of the letter's author – his artist brother Shem. After the inquisition Shaun loses his balance and the barrel in which he has been floating careens over and <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> backwards out of the narrator's earshot, before disappearing completely from view.|$|E
500|$|... "Barbette," [...] writes Cocteau, [...] "transforms {{effortlessly}} {{back and}} forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. <b>He</b> <b>rolls</b> his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E

2500|$|Players {{take turns}} in order, {{with the initial}} player {{determined}} by chance before the game. A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing a piece clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares. If a player rolls doubles, <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> again after completing his turn. [...] A player who rolls three consecutive sets of doubles on one turn has been [...] "caught speeding" [...] and is immediately sent to jail instead of moving the amount shown on the dice for the third roll.|$|E
2500|$|On May 17, 2007, Method Man was {{captured}} in New York City for marijuana allegations. His SUV was pulled over near the Battery Tunnel toll booths for having an expired inspection sticker. An unidentified source said, [...] "It was {{like something out of}} Cheech & Chong. <b>He</b> <b>rolls</b> down the window and the smoke would choke a horse." [...] The arresting officer noticed two blunts and a plastic bag containing marijuana in plain view. Upon further inspection more marijuana was found under the driver's seat. Method Man was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, criminal possession of marijuana, DWI, and driving an uninspected motor vehicle. He reached a plea agreement to perform community service including rapping to young kids about the dangers of drugs.|$|E
