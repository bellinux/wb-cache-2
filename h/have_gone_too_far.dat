5|$|At Cranbrook, Romney helped {{manage the}} ice hockey team, {{and he joined}} the pep squad. During his senior year, he joined the cross country running team. He belonged to eleven school {{organizations}} and school clubs overall, including the Blue Key Club, a booster group that he had started. During his final year there, his academic record improved but fell short of excellence. Romney was involved in several pranks while attending Cranbrook. He has since apologized for those, stating {{that some of the}} pranks may <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far.</b> In March of his senior year, he began dating Ann Davies; she attended the private Kingswood School, the sister school to Cranbrook. The two became informally engaged around the time of his June 1965 graduation.|$|E
25|$|In English Canada, {{there is}} some {{regional}} variation in attitudes towards federal bilingualism policy, but it is relatively modest {{when compared to the}} divergence between the views expressed by Quebecers and those expressed {{in the rest of the}} country. For example, in a poll conducted in 2000, only 22% of Quebecers agreed with the statement, “We <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in pushing bilingualism,” while positive response rates in English Canada ranged from a low of 50% in the Atlantic to a high of 65% in the Prairies.|$|E
500|$|Nando Di Fino of Mediaite also {{complained that}} the episode may <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> and {{compared}} it to previous episodes in the series that had been banned from airing on television, noting, [...] "The show has dipped into sensitive material before, and Fox has actually refused to air two episodes — one dealing with abortion, the other with heavy Jewish themes. Sunday night's episode, if reaction to {{it can be used}} as a good measure, may have been better joining those two episodes in exile." [...] Whitney Jefferson of Jezebel, a website centered on women's issues, also strongly criticized the episode for its storyline involving Brenda and her boyfriend, Jeff: [...] "Personally, I'm way beyond being offended by the show — I've long been numbed to shock-value offensiveness — and had stopped watching years ago anyhow. But being a sucker for a Halloween-themed episodes, I tuned in to Fox's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] comedy block last night. What I saw was seriously awful." [...] Jefferson ended her review of the episode by stating that the show was [...] "Definitely the scariest Halloween special we've ever seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest {{activity}} saw {{a number}} of changes to how law enforcement deals with protest activities. [...] "The [...] Guild, which has a 35-year history of monitoring First Amendment activity, has witnessed a notable change in police treatment of political protesters since the November 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. At subsequent gatherings in Washington, D.C., Detroit, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and Portland a pattern of behavior that stifles First Amendment rights has emerged". In a subsequent lawsuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that [...] "It was lawful {{for the city of}} Seattle to deem part of downtown off-limits... But the court also said that police enforcing the rule may <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> by targeting only those opposed to the WTO, in violation of their First Amendment rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1910, Stieglitz led {{an effort}} to create a major {{exhibition}} of the Photo-Secession artists at what was then called the Albright Gallery in Buffalo, New York (now known as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery). While this effort was announced as a group activity of the Photo-Secession, Stieglitz refused to allow any others to have input or make decision about who would be included in the exhibition and how it would be displayed. Stieglitz, who was already known for his domineering ways and dogmatic approach to photography, took his self-assigned, unilateral authority even beyond his past actions; in this case he proved to <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for several people who had been closely aligned with him. First Käsebier, then White and finally Steichen broke off their relationship with Stieglitz, each citing Stieglitz's overbearing ego, his refusal to consider other's viewpoints and his repeated actions on behalf of the Photo-Secession without consulting any of the so-called [...] "members" [...] of the group.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1982 when the Compact Disc was being introduced, Blyth {{researched}} {{the possibilities of}} creating a digital mixing console. He told Billboard magazine that Soundcraft would not be [...] "leaping into digital {{in the way that}} Neve has done. I think they <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> too quickly.... We are looking at the digital control of analog functions as the first step in that direction." [...] Picking up the pace in the 2000s, Blyth, together with Product Manager Andy Brown, created the Soundcraft Vi6, a digital mixer intended for sound reinforcement applications, released mid-2006. Its interface was a development of Vistonics, a broadcast and studio mixing concept from Harman-owned Studer combined with a digital effects package from Lexicon. Regarding digital audio equipment, Blyth is of the opinion that [...] "companies that take great care over their analog stages, use the best internal digital format and write the best DSP code end up with the best sounding product." [...] He said that he has [...] "strong views on the whole subject of digital consoles, which could fill an article with mostly purple prose", but he notes that [...] "best-in-class analog product these days is truly excellent, but so is digital." [...] Blyth continues today as technical director at Soundcraft Studer's design offices at Potters Bar, [...] north of London.|$|E
