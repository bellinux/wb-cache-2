5|$|While a {{graduate}} student and member of TMRC, Dennis introduced his students to the TX-0 on loan to MIT indefinitely from Lincoln Laboratory. In the spring of 1959, McCarthy taught the first course in programming that MIT offered to freshmen. Outside classes, Kotok, David Gross, Peter Samson, Robert A. Saunders and Robert A. Wagner, all friends from TMRC, reserved time on the TX-0. They {{were able to use}} the TX-0 as a personal, single-user tool rather than a batch processing system, thanks to Dennis, faculty advisors and <b>John</b> <b>McKenzie,</b> the operations manager.|$|E

25|$|While {{the first}} two full seasons in Hartford were not {{glittering}} (the Whalers recorded losing records both years), the final two WHA seasons saw more success. They went to the finals again in 1978, with a veteran team spearheaded by the Howes–50-year-old Gordie led the team in scoring—future NHL stars Gordie Roberts and Mike Rogers, All-Star defenseman Ron Plumb, and forwards <b>John</b> <b>McKenzie,</b> Dave Keon and Mike Antonovich, and possessed of the league's best defense. The next season was not so fine, however, but while age {{finally caught up with}} Gordie Howe, the slack was picked up by Andre Lacroix, the WHA's all-time leading scorer, acquired from the Aeros.|$|E

2500|$|The Mungaroa Contract for the {{construction}} of the Wairarapa Line between Upper Hutt and the Pakuratahi Valley included a station near the terminus of the contract, originally called Pakuratahi Station. [...] The contractor for this section was Charles McKirdy, who was to have completed the contract between 3 June 1874 and 3 March 1876 but, as was common with contracts for {{the construction}} of the Wairarapa Line, work was not completed on time. [...] Having run out of money with two months of work left to complete, the contract was picked up by McKirdy’s guarantors, Walter Turnbull and <b>John</b> <b>McKenzie.</b> [...] They applied for and received further funds to continue the work, which was completed on 16 December 1877.|$|E
2500|$|The Bruins then {{obtained}} young forwards Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield from Chicago {{in a deal}} {{celebrated as}} one of the most one-sided in hockey history. Hodge and Stanfield became key elements of the Bruins' success, and Esposito, who centered a line with Hodge and Wayne Cashman, became the league's top goal-scorer and the first NHL player to break the 100-point mark, setting many goal- and point-scoring records. Esposito remains one of four players to win the Art Ross Trophy four consecutive seasons (the other three are Jaromir Jagr, Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe). With other stars like forwards Bucyk, <b>John</b> <b>McKenzie,</b> Derek Sanderson, and Hodge, steady defenders like Dallas Smith and goaltender Gerry Cheevers, the [...] "Big Bad Bruins" [...] became one of the league's top teams from the late 1960s into the 1980s.|$|E
