In Conway's studies, he discovers the physical, emotional, and {{psychological}} <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> faced with the double burden in Canada. In these studies {{it was found that}} women who are raising children and are in the workforce are more prone to have anxiety and many other stress related effects than the women who are just faced with one of the two burdens.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} the <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> {{as much as}} she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue {{in such a way that}} it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{there was}} {{widespread}} reaction against the accepted North American and European conventions {{of male and}} female dress. This unisex fashion movement aimed to eliminate the sartorial <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> In practice, it usually meant that women would wear male dress, i.e., shirts and trousers. Men rarely went as far in the adoption of traditionally female dress modes. The furthest that most men went in the 1960s in this regard were velvet trousers, flowered or frilled shirts and ties, and long hair.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentalist {{scholars}} {{justify the}} different religious laws {{for men and}} women by referring to the biological and sociological <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> For example, regarding the inheritance law which states that women’s share of inheritance is half that of men, Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi quotes the Imam Ali ibn Musa Al-reza who reasons {{that at the time of}} marriage man has to pay something to woman and woman receives something, and that men are responsible for both their wives' and their own expenses but women have no responsibility thereof. Women, however, make up 27% of the Iranian labor force, and the percentage of all Iranian women who are economically active has more than doubled from 6.1% in 1986 to 13.7% in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Sociobiologists have a {{different}} theory to Harris. Indeed, his theory and interest in the topic of infanticide is born of his more generalised opposition to the sociobiological hypothesis of the procreative imperative. According to this theory of imperative, based on the 19th-century vogue for explanations rooted in evolution and its premise of natural selection, the biological <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> meant that many more children could be gained among the elites through support for male offspring, whose fecundity was naturally much greater: the line would spread and grow more extensively. Harris believes {{this to be a}} fallacious explanation because the elites had sufficient wealth easily to support both male and female children. Thus, Harris and others, such as William Divale, see female infanticide as a way to restrict population growth, while sociobiologists such as Mildred Dickemann view the same practice as a means of expanding it.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{norms and}} {{practices}} {{are two of}} the main reasons why gender disparities in health exist and continue to persist. These cultural norms and practices often influence the roles and behaviors that men and women adopt in society. It is these gender <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> which are regarded and valued differently, that give rise to gender inequalities as they work to systematically empower one group and oppress the other. Both gender differences and gender inequalities can lead to disparities in health outcomes and access to health care. Some of the examples provided by the World Health Organization of how cultural norms can result in gender disparities in health include a woman's inability to travel alone, which can prevent them from receiving the necessary health care that they need. Another societal standard is a woman's inability to insist on condom use by her spouse or sex partners, leading to a higher risk of contracting HIV.|$|E
25|$|Masters and Johnson argue that, {{despite some}} minor differences, sexual {{responses}} in {{both men and}} women are fundamentally similar. However, researchers have argued that there are many <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> in terms of their response. First, Masters and Johnson put forth one model for men, but three different models for women. They stated that men's sexual response only differs in terms of duration; showing different models would, thus, be repetitive. Women, on the other hand, they state can have responses that differ in both intensity and duration. These variations can pose problems because psychologists have argued that not everyone fits this model; for example, most women do not orgasm during penetrative sexual intercourse. Masters and Johnson also equate a man's erection with a woman's vaginal lubrication during the excitement phase; Roy Levin states that this observation is false. A woman's clitoris is the anatomical parallel to a man's penis. As a result, clitoral swelling would be the equivalent of a man's erection.|$|E

25|$|Morphine can {{be taken}} orally, sublingually, bucally, rectally, subcutaneously, intranasally, intravenously, intrathecally or epidurally and inhaled via a nebulizer. As a {{recreational}} drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("Chasing the Dragon"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection {{is the most common}} method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30min. Morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 72h of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) via glucuronidation by phase II metabolism enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7 (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6% to 10% is converted to M6G. Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo opioid receptor binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans. Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of normorphine, codeine, and hydromorphone. Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination half-life of morphine is approximately 120min, though there may be slight <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the blood–brain barrier, but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily. Diacetylmorphine, which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.|$|E

2500|$|Nonsubordination theory, {{sometimes}} called dominance theory, {{is an area}} of feminist legal theory that focuses on the power differential between men and women. [...] Nonsubordination theory takes the position that society, and more especially men in society, use sex <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> to perpetuate this power imbalance. [...] Unlike other topics within feminist legal theory, nonsubordination theory focuses specifically on certain sexual behaviors, including control of women’s sexuality, sexual harassment, pornography, and violence against women generally. [...] Catharine MacKinnon argues that nonsubordination theory best addresses these particular issues because they affect “almost exclusively” women. [...] MacKinnon advocates for nonsubordination theory over other theories, like formal equality, substantive equality, and difference theory, because sexual violence and other forms of violence against women are not a question of “sameness and difference,” but rather are best viewed as “more central inequalities” for women. [...] Though nonsubordination theory has been discussed at great length in evaluating various forms of sexual violence against women, it also serves as a basis for understanding domestic violence and why it occurs. [...] Nonsubordination theory tackles the issue of domestic violence as a subset of the broader problem of violence against women because domestic violence victims are overwhelmingly female.|$|E
