In this paper, we report on simulations showing an enhancement to plasma wakefield self-compression of femtosecond laser pulses due to an <b>ionization</b> <b>gradient</b> at {{the leading edge of the}} pulse. By operating in a regime where wakefield generation is driven by moderately relativistic (similar to 10 (18) W cm(- 2)) laser pulses and proper choice of gas species, the ionization front of the pulse can lead to a frequency shift that enhances the ponderomotive force and therefore both the wakefield generation and subsequent pulse compression...|$|E

30|$|Since the Esb {{layer is}} a sheet-like {{ionization}} layer with sharp gradients {{and a small}} vertical thickness, this layer provides a perfect geometrical configuration of a well-defined <b>ionization</b> <b>gradient</b> located in magnetic fields at the magnetic dip equator.

Therefore, the region {{in the vicinity of the}} EEJ appears to be an ideal “laboratory” to conduct such experiments. The dominant driver of electron drift there is the same as that of the EEJ, the vertical Ep, and indications are that the presence of Esb in that vicinity is controlled by a balance in horizontal transport of Esb, between the EEJ electric field and the neutral wind, as described in a model by Tsunoda (2008). Hence, we can now say that the GDI would seem to be the source of scintillation during daytime, particularly in the vicinity of dip equator.|$|E

Here, Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations are performed to synthesise X-ray spectra from models of such flows. It is found that simple, parametric bi-conical outflow models with plausible choices for the wind parameters predict spectra that are in good qualitative agreement with observations in the 2 - 10 keV band. The influence on the spectrum of both the mass-loss rate and opening angle of the flow are considered: the latter is important since photon leakage {{plays a significant role}} in establishing an <b>ionization</b> <b>gradient</b> within the flow, a useful discriminant between spherical and conical outflow for this and other applications.

40|$|The {{absence of}} broad [O III] λλ 4959, 5007 {{forbidden}} emission lines {{is one of}} the key arguments cited in the published literature for the gas density exceeding the critical density; 7 × 10 ^ 5 cm^- 3, in the broad line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei. However, for NGC 3227, an equally valid alternative explanation is that O^ 2 + is progressively ionized to O^ 3 + as the central UV-X-ray source is approached. Observational evidence for such an <b>ionization</b> <b>gradient</b> is provided by spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. Modeling the rich UV-visible spectrum of NGC 3227 with the photoionization code Cloudy supports the interpretation that the absence of broad [O III] forbidden emission lines is due to ionization, rather than high gas density, and further suggests that what we perceive as the BLR in NGC 3227 is just the illuminated portion of a much larger inflow.

Using the nonlinear optics of plasma may {{be a way to}} circumvent these limits. Here, we present a new self-compression mechanism for high-power, femtosecond laser pulses based on geometrical focusing and three dimensional spatiotemporal reshaping in an ionizing plasma. By propagating tightly focused, 10 -mJ femtosecond laser pulses through a 100 -mu m gas jet, the interplay between <b>ionization</b> <b>gradients,</b> focusing, and diffraction of the light pulse leads to stable and uniform self-compression of the pulse, while maintaining a high-energy throughput and excellent refocusability. Self-compression down to 16 fs from an original 36 -fs pulse is measured using second-harmonic-generation frequency-resolved optical gating.

Well established ground based and innovative space based GNSS measurements offer a unique chance for a permanent monitoring of the electron density structure of the global ionosphere-plasmasphere system under perturbed conditions. The analyzed storms propagate primarily from high towards low latitudes at the European sector. Analysis of GPS measurements reveals different perturbation types such as large scale ionization fronts, wavelike Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) and small scale irregularities producing radio scintillations.

The relative displacement of the piston is monitored by a mechanical distance travel indicator with a precision on the order of 0. 002 mm. Irradiations were carried out with cobalt- 60 gamma. rays, x-ray beams ranging from 4 to 18 MV, and electron beams between 6 and 22 MeV.

We used dereddened line ratios to determine line-of-sight average values for (1) He^(++) and He^+ ionization fractions from He II λ 4686 and He I λ 5876; (2) electron density from both [S II] (λ 6716 /λ 6731) and [Ar IV] (λ 4711 /λ 4740); and (3) temperature from [O III] (λ 4959 + λ 5007) /λ 4363. The He^(++) /H^+ ratio varies across the nebula, with values up to 0. 06 over the central parts, falling off to 0. 03 at offsets of 5 "- 6 " from the central star.

40|$|X-ray {{reflection}} spectra from photoionized accretion discs {{in active}} galaxies are presented {{for a wide}} range of illumination conditions. The energy, equivalent width (EW) and flux of the Fe K line are shown to depend strongly on the ratio of illuminating flux to disc flux, Fx/Fdisc, the photon index of the irradiating power-law, Γ, and the incidence angle of the radiation, i. When Fx/Fdisc ≤ 2 a neutral Fe K line is prominent for all but the largest values of Γ. At higher illuminating fluxes a He-like Fe K line at 6. 7 keV dominates the line complex. With a high-energy cutoff of 100 keV, the thermal ionization instability seems to suppress the ionized Fe K line when Γ≤ 1. 6. The Fe K line flux correlates with Fx/Fdisc, but the dependence weakens as iron becomes fully ionized. The EW is roughly constant when Fx/Fdisc is low and a neutral line dominates, but then declines as the line progresses through higher ionization stages. There is a strong positive correlation between the Fe K EW and Γ when the line energy is at 6. 7 keV, and a slight negative one when it is at 6. 4 keV. This is a potential observational diagnostic of the ionization state of the disc. Observations of the broad Fe K line which take into account any narrow component would be able to test these predictions. Ionized Fe K lines at 6. 7 keV are predicted to be common in a simple magnetic flare geometry. A model which includes multiple <b>ionization</b> <b>gradients</b> on the disc is postulated to reconcile the results with observations. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures. Fig. 10 on page 9 in colour.

We have tested for correlations of Mg ii, C iv, Si iv, N v, and O vi equivalent widths with the galaxy properties and Mg ii gas kinematics. The results are suggestive of multi–phase halos with little to no global <b>ionization</b> <b>gradient</b> with impact parameter. C iv may arise in both the Mg ii–Lyα clouds and a high ionization “halo ” traced by O vi. We also report on an unbiased survey for weak Mg ii systems using HIRES/Keck spectra.

40|$|General {{relativistic}} {{ray tracing}} simulations of the time-averaged spectrum and energy-dependent time delays in AGN are presented. We model the lamp-post geometry {{in which the}} accreting gas is illuminated by an X-ray source located on the rotation axis of the black hole. The spectroscopic features imprinted in the reflection component are modelled using REFLIONX. The associated time delays after the direct continuum, known as reverberation lags, are computed including the full effects of dilution and ionization gradients on the disc. We perform, for the first time, simultaneous fitting of the time-averaged and lag-energy spectra in three AGN: Mrk 335, IRAS 13224 - 3809 and Ark 564 observed with XMM-Newton. The best fitting source height and central mass of each AGN partly agree with those previously reported. We find that including the <b>ionization</b> <b>gradient</b> in the model naturally explains lag-energy observations in which the 3 keV and 7 - 10 keV bands precede other bands. To obtain the clear 3 keV and 7 - 10 keV dips in the lag-energy profile, the model requires either a source height > 5 $r_g$, or a disc that is highly ionized at small radii and is colder further out. We also show that fitting the lag or the mean spectra alone can lead to different results and interpretations. This is therefore important to combine the spectral and timing data {{in order to find}} the plausible but self-consistent fits which is achievable with our model.

40|$|For {{the first}} time it was {{possible}} to observe regular quasiperiodic scintillations (QPS) in VHF radio-satellite transmissions from orbiting satellites simultaneously at short (2. 1 km) and long (121 km) meridional baselines in the vicinity of a typical mid-latitude station (Brisbane; 27. 5 degreesS and 152. 9 degreesE geog. and 35. 6 degrees invar. lat.), using three sites (St. Lucia-S, Taringa-T in Brisbane and Boreen Pt. -B, north of Brisbane). A few pronounced quasiperiodic (QP) events were recorded showing unambiguous regular structures at the sites which made it possible to deduce a time displacement of the regular fading minimum at S, T and B. The QP structure is highly dependent on the geometry of the ray-path from a satellite to the observer which is manifested as a change of a QP event from symmetrical to non-symmetrical for stations separated by 2. 1 km, and to a radical change {{in the structure of the}} event over a distance of 121 km. It is suggested the short-duration intense QP events are due to a Fresnel diffraction (or a reflection mechanism) of radio-satellite signals by a single ionospheric irregularity in a form of an ellipsoid with a large <b>ionization</b> <b>gradient</b> along the major axis. The structure of a QP event depends on the angle of viewing of the irregular blob from a radio-satellite. In view of this it is suggested that the reported variety of the ionization formation, responsible for different types of QPS, is only apparent but not real. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Modeling of flare associated amplitude and phase enhancements of NWC (3. 6 dB, 223 °) and NPM (5 dB, 153 °) using Long-Wave Propagation Capability code shows reduction in the D region reflection height (H′) by 11. 1 km and 9. 4 km, and enhancement in <b>ionization</b> <b>gradients</b> described by increases in the exponential sharpness factor (β) by 0. 122 and 0. 126 km� 1, for the NWC and NPM paths, respectively. During the storm the daytime signal strengths of the NWC and NPM signals were reduced by 3. 2 dB on 15 and 16 December (for about 46 h) and recovered by 17 December. Modeling for the NWC path shows that storm time values of H′ and β were reduced by 1. 2 km and 0. 06 km� 1, respectively. Morlet wavelet analysis of signal amplitudes shows no clearly strong signatures of gravity wave propagation to low latitudes during the main and recovery phases. The reduction in VLF signal strength is due to increased signal attenuation and absorption by the Earth-ionosphere waveguide due to storm-induced D region ionization changes and hence changes in D region parameters. The long duration of the storm effect results from the slow diffusion of changed composition/ionization at D region altitudes compared with higher altitudes in the ionosphere...|$|R

The spatially resolved spectral data cube {{was used in}} the kinematic, morphological and abundance analysis of the ejecta. The line maps show a very clumpy shell with two main symmetric structures. The first one is the outer part of the shell seen in H-alpha, that forms two rings projected in the sky plane. These ring structures correspond to a closed hourglass shape, first proposed by Harman and O'Brien (2003). The equatorial emission enhancement is caused by the superimposed hourglass structures in the line of sight. The second structure seen only in the [OIII] and [NII] maps is located along the polar directions inside the hourglass structure. Abundances gradients between the polar caps and equatorial region were not found. However, the outer part of the shell seems to be less abundant in Oxygen and Nitrogen than the inner regions. Detailed 2. 5 D photoionization modeling of the 3 D shell was performed using the mass distribution inferred from the observations and the presence of mass clumps. The resulting model grids are used to constrain the physical properties of the shell as well as the central ionizing source. A sequence of 3 D clumpy models including a disk shaped ionization source is able to reproduce the <b>ionization</b> <b>gradients</b> between polar and equatorial regions of the shell. Differences between shell axial ratios in different lines can also be explained by aspherical illumination. A total shell mass of 9 x 10 - 4 Msun is derived from these models.

The transmitting antenna is considered in detail, and the electronics system is briefly described. Some of the general features of the earth's atmosphere and the ionosphere are presented. The magneto-ionic theory is developed, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in an ionized atmosphere is discussed. This material is presented in order that the 50 -kc/s ionospheric data may be properly interpreted. The applicability of the quasi-homogeneous, magneto-ionic theory to low-frequency-propagation problems is considered. The virtual height of the E-layer was found to change by approximately 7. 5 km during the sunrise and sunset periods. Rapid fluctuations in the virtual height and reflection coefficients of the E-layer are attributed to (1) strong magneto-ionic splitting, (2) fluctuating <b>ionization</b> <b>gradients</b> in the lower nighttime E-region, (3) interference effects due to the presence of two or more partially reflecting layers (i. e. the fine structure of the E-layer), and (4) interference effects due to the interaction of the two magneto-ionic components.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of the spatial {{analysis}} of deep ROSAT HRI observations, optical imaging and spectroscopy, and high-resolution VLA H I and continuum imaging of NGC 1961 and NGC 2276. These spirals were selected as showing some previous evidence for interaction with a surrounding (hot) diffuse medium. Our results favor most aspects of these galaxies as being shaped by gravitational interactions with companions, rather than the asymmetric pressure from motion through an external medium. The old stars follow the asymmetric structures of young stars and ionized gas, which suggests a tidal origin for the lopsided appearance of these galaxies. In NGC 2276, the H I and star-forming regions are strongly concentrated along {{the western edge of the}} disk. In this case, the ROSAT HRI detects the brightest star-forming regions as well as the diffuse disk emission, the most distant galaxy with such a detection. An asymmetric <b>ionization</b> <b>gradient</b> in the H II regions suggests radial movement of gas, which might have occurred in either tidal or wind scenarios. The X-ray emission from NGC 1961 is dominated by a point source near the nucleus of the galaxy but extended emission is seen out to a radius of ~ 0. 8 '. Previous studies of the enrichment of the intragroup medium in the NGC 2300 group indicates that stripping may be important in this system, but the density of the IGM is much too tenuous to effectively strip the gas from the galaxy. However, we propose that gravitational interactions in the group environment may enhance stripping.

We analyze a PdBI map of the H 13 CO+ J= 1 - 0 line, complemented with IRAM- 30 m H 13 CO+ and DCO+ higher-J line maps and new HOC+ and CO+ observations. We compare self-consistently the observed spatial distribution and line intensities with detailed depth-dependent predictions of a PDR model coupled with a nonlocal radiative transfer calculation. The chemical network includes deuterated species, 13 C fractionation reactions and HCO+/HOC+ isomerization reactions. The role of neutral and charged PAHs in the cloud chemistry and ionization balance is investigated. The detection of HOC+ reactive ion towards the Horsehead PDR proves the high ionization fraction of the outer UV irradiated regions, where we derive a low [HCO+]/[HOC+]~ 75 - 200 abundance ratio. In the absence of PAHs, we reproduce the observations with gas-phase metal abundances, [Fe+Mg+ [...] . ], lower than 4 x 10 (- 9) (with respect to H) and a cosmic-rays ionization rate of zeta=(5 +/- 3) x 10 (- 17) s(- 1). The inclusion of PAHs modifies the <b>ionization</b> fraction <b>gradient</b> and increases the required metal abundance. The ionization fraction in the Horsehead edge follows a steep gradient, with a scale length of ~ 0. 05 pc (or ~ 25 ''), from [e-]~ 10 (- 4) (or n_e ~ 1 - 5 cm(- 3)) in the PDR to a few times ~ 10 (- 9) in the core. PAH^- anions play a role in the charge balance of the cold and neutral gas if substantial amounts of free PAHs are present ([PAH] > 10 (- 8)). Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables.

40|$|International audienceThe day-to-day {{variability}} in the occurrence of ionospheric scintillations, which are of serious concern in the trans-ionospheric communications, makes their prediction still a challenging problem. This paper reports on a systematic study in quantitatively identifying the precursors responsible, such as pre-reversal E × B drift velocity, geo-magnetic activity index (K p) and the Equatorial <b>Ionization</b> Anomaly (EIA) <b>gradient,</b> for the onset of VHF scintillations over a low-latitude station, Waltair (20 ° N dip), during high (2001) and low (2004) sunspot activity years. The percentage of occurrences of VHF scintillations over Waltair show a good correlation with the monthly mean post-sunset vertical drift velocities at the equator, during both {{the high and low}} sunspot activity years. During the days on which intense (> 10 dB) scintillations occur, the <b>ionization</b> anomaly <b>gradient</b> (dN/dL), measured from ionosonde data of an equatorial (Trivandrum, 0. 9 ° N dip) and an off-equatorial station (Waltair, 20 ° N dip) shows an enhancement in the gradient prior to the onset of the scintillations. However, this enhancement is not seen on days when the scintillations are weak (E × B drift is found to decrease with increasing K p -index and this decrease is more prominent in the equinoxes, less in winter and insignificant in the summer months. On a day-to-day basis, it is found that the value of the upward drift velocity at the equator should be ? 30 m/s for the onset of strong scintillations over Waltair for magnetically quiet days with average K p ? 2 (6 h prior to the local sunset) during the high sunspot year, 2001. This threshold value of the upward drift reduces to 20 m/s with the decrease in the sunspot activity during 2004. Further, these conditions for the onset of intense scintillations is well defined in equinoxes, less in winter and least in the summer solstices...|$|R

Aims: We study the H 13 CO^+, DCO+ and HOC+ line emission towards the Horsehead, from the shielded core to the UV irradiated cloud edge, i. e., the photodissociation region (PDR), as a template to investigate the <b>ionization</b> fraction <b>gradient</b> in molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze an IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer map of the H 13 CO+ J= 1 - 0 line at a 6. 8 ''× 4. 7 '' resolution, complemented with IRAM- 30 m H 13 CO+ and DCO+ higher-J line maps and new HOC+ and CO+ observations. We compare self-consistently the observed spatial distribution and line intensities with detailed depth-dependent predictions of a PDR model coupled with a nonlocal radiative transfer calculation. The chemical network includes deuterated species, 13 C fractionation reactions and HCO^+/HOC+ isomerization reactions. The role of neutral and charged PAHs in the cloud chemistry and ionization balance is investigated. Results: The detection of the HOC+ reactive ion towards the Horsehead PDR proves the high ionization fraction of the outer UV irradiated regions, where we derive a low [HCO^+] /[HOC^+] ≃ 75 - 200 abundance ratio. In the absence of PAHs, we reproduce the observations with gas-phase metal abundances, [Fe+Mg+ [...] . ], lower than 4 × 10 - 9 (with respect to H), and a cosmic-ray ionization rate of ζ=(5 ± 3) × 10 - 17 s- 1. The inclusion of PAHs modifies the <b>ionization</b> fraction <b>gradient</b> and increases the required metal abundance. Conclusions: The ionization fraction in the Horsehead edge follows a steep gradient, with a scale length of ~ 0. 05 pc (or ~ 25 ''), from [e^-] ≃ 10 - 4 (or n_e~˜ 1 - 5 cm- 3) in the PDR to a few times ~ 10 - 9 in the core.

40|$|Dust is a {{critical}} component of the universe, affecting energy flow and the dynamics of star and planetary disk evolution. The light we measure when observing the universe is absorbed and scattered (extinguished) by dust. Studies indicate that active formation of high mass stars modifies the ultraviolet (UV) dust extinction curve, removing the characteristic bump at 2175 Å. For a half century, the source of this bump has not been positively identified. Dust grain models suggest that a leading contender is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The spiral galaxy M 101 is an ideal laboratory, with many HII regions, plus steep metallicity and <b>ionization</b> <b>gradients.</b> The role of environment in this enigmatic "bump-less'' extinction was investigated in M 101 with observations from both a sounding rocket mission and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The Interstellar Absorption Gradient Experiment Rocket (IMAGER) mission was designed to probe the correlations between dust extinction and environment through photometric observations of the apparent strengths of the 2175 Å bump and UV continuum in M 101. IMAGER flew and collected data on November 21, 2012. Although in-flight anomalies caused significant cross-talk, the mission demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneous imaging in three medium-width UV bands. With angular resolution poorer than one arcminute in all bands, and inadequate signal in the field-of-view, these data proved unsuitable for aperture photometry. This analysis method cannot be used with these data to draw conclusions about the correlations between environment and ultraviolet extinction. Spectroscopic observations were performed with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument aboard the HST. With additional data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and radiative transfer and stellar evolution models, the correlation between the bump and the aromatic features was probed across HII regions spanning wide ranges of metallicity and radiation field hardness. A correlation between the strengths of the aromatic features and the 2175 Å feature was not found [...] the statistics preclude a definitive statement regarding the origin of the bump. Many models of dust extinction are consistent with the data, implying a need for more observations of the feature and possibly a significant modification of the source of 2175 Å extinction in dust models...|$|R

This paper describes {{a method that}} uses liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze sugars and sugar polyols in atmospheric aerosols, ranging from C- 3 sugar alcohols to trisaccharides. Postcolumn addition of chloroform in acetonitrile was found to greatly enhance ionization of these compounds by forming chloride adduct ions in the negative-ion mode using electrospray <b>ionization.</b> A <b>gradient</b> elution program starting at 5 %: 95 % H 2 O/acetonitrile and ending at 30 %: 70 % H 2 O/acetonitrile provides baseline separations of the sugars and sugar polyols on an amino-based carbohydrate column. The detection limits based on quantification of [M + Cl- 35](-) adduct ions {{were in the order}} of 0. 1 mu M. By eliminating the need for derivatization, this LC-MS based method provides a simpler alternative method to the commonly used and more laborious gas-chromatography based methods. It also has an additional advantage of being able to quantify trisaccharide sugars. The method was applied to analyze 30 ambient samples of fine particulate matter collected at a site away from urban centers in Hong Kong. The sugar compounds positively identified and detected in the ambient samples included four sugar alcohols (glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, and mannitol), three monosacchride sugars (xylose, fructose, and glucose), two disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose), two trisaccharides (melezitose, raffinose), and one anhydrosugar (levoglucosan). The sum of these sugar and sugar polyol compounds ranged from 38 to 1316 ng m(- 3), accounting for an average of 1. 3 % organic carbon mass. Through the use of a principal component analysis of the ambient measurements, the mono- to trisaccharide sugars and C- 3 -C- 5 sugar polyols were identified to be mainly associated with soil/soil microbiota while the anhydrosugar (levoglucosan) was associated with biomass burning...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{models that}} predict the dynamic evolution and infrared (IR) emission of grains behind nonradiative shock waves. We present a self-consistent {{treatment of the}} effect of grain destruction and heating on the ionization structure and X-ray emission of the postshock gas. Incorporating thermal sputtering, collisional heating, and deceleration of grains in the postshock flow, we predict the IR and X-ray fluxes from the dusty plasma as a function of swept-up column density. Heavy elements such as C, O, Mg, S, Si and Fe are initially depleted from the gas phase but are gradually returned as the grains are destroyed. The injected neutral atoms require some time to 'catch up' with the ionization state of the ambient gas. The nonequilibrium <b>ionization</b> state and <b>gradient</b> in elemental abundances in the postshock flow produces characteristic X-ray signatures that can be related to the age of the shock and amount of grain destruction. We study the effects of preshock density and shock velocity on the X-ray and IR emission from the shock. We show that the effects of graindestruction on the X-ray spectra of shock waves are substantial. In particular, temperatures derived from X-ray spectra of middle-aged remnants are likely to be overestimated by approximately 15 % if cosmic abundances are assumed. Due to the long timescales for grain destruction in X-ray gases over a wide range of temperatures, we suggest that future X-ray spectra studies of supernova remnants be based on depleted abundances instead of cosmic abundances. Our model predictions agree reasonably well with IRAS and Einstein IPC observations of the Cygnus Loop...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study in detail the Terlevich & Melnick starburst-warmers {{scenario}} for type 2 Seyferts and LINERs, which postulates a young cluster containing stars with temperatures about 150 000 K as the heating source in these objects. A numerical code was developed to compute the total spectrum of a star cluster given its age and initial mass function. The ionizing spectra so obtained were used in the photoionization code AANGABA to calculate the nebular ernission-line spectra for a grid of cloud parameters covering different densities (and <b>gradients),</b> <b>ionization</b> parameters and metallicities. The evolution of the system was followed on classical diagnostic diagrams and a very good agreement with Terlevich & Melnick's results was found. We conclude that warmers can indeed be the ionizing source in many narrow-line AGN, although the coverage of AGN areas on diagnostic diagrams is not complete. We find the warmers model successful within a metallicity range between ~~ 0. 5 and 2 Z̛. The upper limit is set by the strong cloud cooling by forbidden lines. On the other hand, at Z<~ 0. 5 Z̛ fewer stars would be thrown into 'warmer' phases due to the smaller mass-loss rates, and even if warmers occur the ernission-line spectrum would correspond to an H II galaxy rather than to an AGN. The chernical pollution of the gas by the strongly processed stellar winds of massive stars is also studied. Our results suggest that the nitrogen overabundance of AGN frequently claimed in the literature arises quite naturally in this scenario...|$|R

Supplemental Na I, Ca II, and H I data are also presented for comparison with the UV lines. Our analysis centers on converting the observed absoprtion-line data into measures of the apparent column density per unit velocity. N(sub a) (v), over the velocity range - 25 less than or = v(sub lsr) less than 30 km/s for each species observed. We use these N(sub a) (v) profiles to construct logarithmic abundance ratios of Mg II, Si II, Cr II, Fe II, and Ca II relative to Zn II, normalized to solar abundances, as a function of velocity. Compared to Zn, these species show an underabundance relative to their solar values, with the largest underabundances occurring in the v(sub lsr) approximately equals 5 km/s component(s), for which we find logarithmic abundances A(sub Si/Zn) greater than - 0. 38, A(Mg/Zn) = - 0. 82, A(sub Cr/Zn) = - 1. 18, and A(sub Fe/Zn) greater than 1. 40 dex. We show that <b>ionization</b> effects, abundance <b>gradients,</b> or intrinsic abundance variability cannot be significant sources for the underabundances observed. The most likely explanation is gas phase depletion of elements onto dust grains.
