5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal <b>encounters</b> <b>a</b> discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance.

5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever.

Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
