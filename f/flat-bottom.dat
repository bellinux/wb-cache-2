5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide <b>flat-bottom</b> and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, {{was believed to be}} derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old. Women govern the family, because men were usually away from home fishing.|$|E

50|$|In Britain {{they came}} to popular notice during the planned French {{invasion}} of Britain in 1759, when a large-number of flat-bottomed boats were prepared by the French to ferry their invasion force across the channel and a number were destroyed during the British Raid on Le Havre.

40|$|In a {{previous}} note on “Americanites” (Martin, 1934) from Colombia and Peru, the writer {{came to the}} conclusion, on the basis solely of published data, {{that it was very}} likely that these so-called tectites are in reality obsidian of terrestrial origin. He stated, however, that “before it is possible to separate the americanites definitely from the tectites, a detailed field examination is required and also a minute determination of the chemical composition of the americanites and of the indubitable volcanic rocks from the neighbourhood. ” A generous contribution from the Molengraaff-Fonds enabled the writer in the summer of 1934 to make a special study of tectites, in the course of which he visited the Mineralogical Institute at Jena, (Germany, where he had occasion to study the Paucartambo (Peru) “tectite” {{and a few of the}} “tectites” from Colombia. This short investigation showed already that the <b>flat-bottommed</b> surface observed on the ""tectite"" from Paucartambo and on some obsidian spheres from Cali (Colombia) is not a part of the original surface of the “teetite” body but a subsequently developed fracture surface of slightly conchoidal shape, and should consequently not be explained as a flattening of the “tectite” due to falling from the heavens in a semi-plastic condition. The long paragraph dedicated to the explanation of this phenomenon in the former publication (p. 129) can therefore be stricken from the evidence presented in connection with the problem of the origin of these bodies...|$|R

25|$|Sampan {{is a type}} of <b>flat-bottom</b> boat {{frequently}} seen in {{the shores}} of South China Sea, used by Cantonese, Hoklo, Vietnamese, and many other Southeast Asian ethnic groups. They are usually three to four meters in length and have small shelters on broad. This makes it possible for fishermen to live on their own sampans. In major Cantonese cities such as Gwongzau and Hong Kong, it is a common sight to see crowds of sampans docked at the harbor. Thus, the image of sampan-filled harbor is strongly associated with Lingnan. Sampans also regularly show up in films and songs made by Cantonese.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of P. verrucosum and ochratoxin A (OTA) were surveyed for 3 and 4 years, respectively. A total of 250 samples was collected {{from an average}} of 30 farms during the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 winter seasons. Most storage bins surveyed were typically 11 m high round bins made of corrugated, galvanized steel, with <b>flat-bottoms</b> and conical roofs. Samples of clumped grain contained the most P. verrucosum (p< 0. 05, n = 10) followed by samples taken from the first load (n = 24, mean = 147 ± 87 CFU/g) and last load (n = 17, mean = 101 ± 77 CFU/g). Five grain samples (2. 2 %) tested positive for OTA, citrinin and OTB at concentrations of 14. 7 ± 7. 9, 4. 9 ± 1. 9 and 1. 2 ± 0. 7 ng/g, with only three samples exceeding 5 ng/g. Grain samples positive for OTA were related to moisture resulting from either condensation or migrating moist warm air in the bin or areas where precipitation including snow entered the bin. Bins containing grain and clumps contaminated with OTA were studied in detail. A number of statistically-significant risk factors for OTA contamination were identified. These included 1) grain clumps accumulated around or directly under manhole openings, 2) debris and residue of old grain or grain clumps collected from the bin walls or left on storage floor and augers and 3) grain clumps accumulated around side doors. Even when grain enters storage below the 14. 5 % threshold of moisture, condensation and moisture migration occurs in hotspots in modern corrugated steel storage bins. Hot spots of OTA contamination were most often in areas affected by moisture migration due to inadequate aeration and exposure to moisture from precipitation or condensation. Further, we found that the nature of the condensation affects the nature and distribution of small and isolated areas with high incidence of toxin contamination and/or P. verrucosum prevalence in the grain bins examined...|$|R
6000|$|As we plodded along, {{either by}} {{the edge of the}} ocean, where the sand was rapidly {{drinking}} up the last wave that wet it, or over the sand-hills of the bank, the mackerel fleet continued to pour round the Cape north of us, ten or fifteen miles distant, in countless numbers, schooner after schooner, till they made a city on the water. They were so thick that many appeared to be afoul of one another; now all standing on this tack, now on that. We saw how well the New-Englanders had followed up Captain John Smith's suggestions with regard to the fisheries, made in 1616,--to what a pitch they had carried [...] "this contemptible trade of fish," [...] as he significantly styles it, and were now equal to the Hollanders whose example he holds up for the English to emulate; notwithstanding that [...] "in this faculty," [...] as he says, [...] "the former are so naturalized, and of their vents so certainly acquainted, as there is no likelihood they will ever be paralleled, having two or three thousand busses, <b>flat-bottoms,</b> sword-pinks, todes, and such like, that breeds them sailors, mariners, soldiers, and merchants, never to be wrought out of that trade and fit for any other." [...] We thought that it would take all these names and more to describe the numerous craft which we saw. Even then, some years before our [...] "renowned sires" [...] with their [...] "peerless dames" [...] stepped on Plymouth Rock, he wrote, [...] "Newfoundland doth yearly freight neir eight hundred sail of ships with a silly, lean, skinny, poor-john, and cor fish," [...] though all their supplies must be annually transported from Europe.

25|$|Hagood {{had burned}} the only bridge across Town Creek {{to slow down}} Cox and entrenched {{on the north side}} of the river. Cox was eager to attempt his {{encircling}} plan that, due to Hagood's retreat at Fort Anderson, the Federals had been unable to complete. The creek was not fordable, so on February 20 Cox's troops found a single <b>flat-bottom</b> boat in the river and used it to ferry three brigades across the creek while the fourth brigade skirmished with Hagood as a diversion. Hagood discovered the flanking movement and decided, since his position was now untenable, to retreat back to Wilmington; he left two regiments to cover his retreat. The Federals then waded through the swamp and attacked the Confederate flank, routing the two regiments, and taking 375 prisoners along with two pieces of artillery. The next day Cox rebuilt the destroyed bridge and Schofield's artillery crossed and along with Porter's gunboats both were within range of the city itself. General Bragg saw the hopelessness of the situation and ordered the city abandoned. On February 21 Cox's division continued its march toward the city but was delayed by the destroyed bridges across the Brunswick River and by Confederate cavalry, while Hoke's division continued to hold off Terry's command. Bragg used the 21st to evacuate Union prisoners located there, while evacuating anything of military value; he also ordered bales of cotton and tobacco burned so that they would not fall into Union hands, along with storehouses, foundries, shipyards, and ships. Bragg retreated with his forces at 1 a.m. on the 22nd; Cox's corps entered the city after 8 a.m., with Terry's forces entering an hour later.|$|E

Loaded with crude oil, the steamer immediately burst into flames, killing eight of her 26 crewmen and wounding her captain Herbert McCall. Oranjestad then began to lift anchor and steam away but she was too late and was hit by a second torpedo fired from U-156. She too burst into flames and sunk an hour later in about [...] of water.

6000|$|My {{next step}} was to ascend the [...] "Olo' Mpongwe," [...] or Gaboon River, which Bowdich ("Sketch of Gaboon") calls Oroöngo, and its main point Ohlombopolo. The object was to visit the Fán, of whose {{cannibalism}} such curious tales had been told. It was not easy to find a conveyance. The factory greatly wanted a <b>flat-bottom</b> iron steamer, a stern-wheeler, with sliding keel, and furnaces fit for burning half-dried wood--a craft of fourteen tons, costing perhaps £14 per ton, would be ample in point of size, and would save not a little money to the trader. I was at last fortunate in securing the [...] "Eliza," [...] belonging to Messrs. Hatton and Cookson. She was a fore-and-aft schooner of twenty tons, measuring 42 feet 6 inches over all and put up at Bonny Town by Captain Birkett. She had two masts, and oars in case of calms; her crew was of six hands, including one Fernando, a Congoese, who could actually box the compass. No outfit was this time necessary, beyond a letter to Mr. Tippet, who had charge of the highest establishments up stream. His business consisted chiefly of importing arms, ammunition, and beads of different sorts, especially the red porcelain, locally called Loangos.|$|E
60|$|Before {{we began}} to fall on, the king ordered to view the river, {{to see if it}} was nowhere passable, or any boat to be had; but the river being not fordable, and the boats all secured on the other side, the attack was {{resolved}} on, and the dragoons fell on with extraordinary bravery. The foot defended themselves obstinately, and beat off our dragoons twice, and though Bennet was killed upon the spot, and after him his lieutenant, yet their officers relieving them with fresh men, they would certainly have beat us all off, had not a venturous fellow, one of our dragoons, thrown himself into the river, swam over, and, in the midst of a shower of musket-bullets, cut the rope which tied a great <b>flat-bottom</b> boat, and brought her over. With the help of this boat, I got over 100 troopers first, and then their horses, and then 200 more without their horses; and with this party fell in with one of the small bodies of foot that were posted on that side, and having routed them, and after them the reserve which stood on the road, I made up to the other party. They stood their ground, and having rallied the runaways of both the other parties, charged me with their pikes, and brought me to a retreat; but by this time the king had sent over 300 men more, and they coming up to me, the foot retreated. Those on the bridge finding how 'twas, and having no supplies sent them, as before, fainted, and fled; and the dragoons rushing forward, most of them were killed; about 150 of the enemy were killed, of which all the officers at the bridge, the rest run away.|$|E
