5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and <b>inner</b> <b>bark</b> of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E

The white soft <b>inner</b> <b>bark</b> (cambial layer) was carefully separated from the hard, dark brown bark and dried.

40|$|Physical {{properties}} of importance in drying processes have been compiled for bark, including spruce, pine, and birch in Sweden. Water vapor sorption isotherms were determined for {{the bark of}} these trees. At 95 % relative humidity and 25 degrees C, outer birch bark reached a moisture ratio (kg water/kg dry mass) of 5 %, whereas <b>inner</b> birch <b>bark,</b> spruce bark, and pine bark reached moisture ratios of 21, 28, and 25 %, respectively. The transverse water vapor diffusivity in samples of spruce <b>bark,</b> pine <b>bark,</b> <b>inner</b> birch <b>bark,</b> and outer birch bark were determined to be 1. 1 - 1. 710 (- 6), 2. 2 - 9. 210 (- 7), 1. 5 - 2. 610 (- 6), and 4. 3 - 1310 (- 8) m(2) /s, respectively. The in-plane diffusivity was of the same magnitude as the transverse diffusivity in <b>inner</b> birch <b>bark,</b> whereas in outer birch bark the in-plane diffusivity was several {{times higher than the}} transverse diffusivity.

Of their conduct in battle, fiercer than that of Baresarks, where was there ever seen the parallel?

25|$|Coast redwoods are {{resistant}} to insect attack, fungal infection, and rot. These properties are conferred by concentrations of terpenoids and tannic acid in redwood leaves, roots, bark, and wood. Despite these chemical defenses, redwoods are still subject to insect infestations; none, however, are capable of killing a healthy tree. Redwoods also face predation from mammals: black bears are reported to consume the <b>inner</b> <b>bark</b> of small redwoods, and black-tailed deer are known to eat redwood sprouts.|$|E
25|$|Wood, in {{the strict}} sense, is yielded by trees, which {{increase}} in diameter by the formation, between the existing wood and the <b>inner</b> <b>bark,</b> of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots.

40|$|Abstract ? The {{objective}} of this work was to study the influence of cyanogenesis on the onset of irreversible tapping panel dryness (TPD) and the physiological and histological aspects of secondary phloem in the trunk (tapping panel) of rubber trees (Hevea spp.). Two cyanogenic compounds, linamarin and KCN, were applied separately on the trunk bark of healthy mature trees belonging to two Brazilian clones (Fx 4098 and Fx 3899). Changes in histology, latex pressure potential (YP) and cyanogenic potential (HCNP) were followed in the trunk <b>inner</b> <b>barks.</b> In addition, the HCNp levels were determined in TPD-affected plants of both clones. The applications of linamarin or KCN in healthy plants decreased latex YP, and formed tylosoids associated with in situ coagulation of latex. The clone Fx 4098 had the higher HCNp and showed the quicker and stronger responses to the cyanogenic compounds. Plants with TPD syntoms had a higher HCNp than the untreated healthy ones. Since histological changes are also structural markers of early TPD, it can be inferred that excessive release of cyanide can induce it in sensitive rubber clones. 201...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to screen the {{endophytic}} fungi having antitumor or antifungal activity, which were isolated from the <b>inner</b> <b>barks</b> of three kinds of pharmaceutical plants, Taxus mairei, Cephalataxus fortunei and Torreya grandis, collected from Fujian province, China. Antitumor activity was studied by the MTT assay and antifungal activity was determined by observing fungal growth inhibition. 13. 4 % of endophytic fungi fermentation broths displayed cytotoxic activity on HL- 60 cells at and below a dilution of 1 : 50, and 6. 4 % on KB cells. 52. 3 % of endophytic fungi fermentation broths displayed growth inhibition {{on at least one}} pathogenic fungi, such as Neurospora sp., Trichoderma sp. and Fusarium sp. Among all endophytic, fungi isolated, the genus Paecilomyces sp. has the highest positive rate of antitumor and antifungal activity. These results indicate that endophytic fungi could be a promising source for antitumor and antifungal bioactive agents. (C) 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

25|$|While {{there have}} been some minor innovations, amate paper is still made using the same basic process that was used in the pre Hispanic period. The process begins with obtaining the bark for its fiber. Traditionally, these are from trees of the fig (Ficus) family as this bark is the easiest to process. Some large Ficus trees are {{considered}} sacred and can be found surrounded with candles and offering of cut amate paper. Primary species used include F. cotinifolia, F. padifolia and F. petiolaris, the classic amate tree, along with several non-ficus species such as Morus celtidifolia, Citrus anurantifolia and Heliocarpos Donnell-Smithii Rose. However, the taxonomical identification of trees used for amate paper production is not exact, leading estimates of wild supplies inaccurate. The softer <b>inner</b> <b>bark</b> is preferred but other parts are used as well. Outer bark and bark from ficus trees tend to make darker paper and <b>inner</b> <b>bark</b> and mulberry bark tends to make lighter paper. Bark is best cut in the spring when it is new, which does less damage. It also is less damaging to take bark from older ficus trees as this bark tends to peel off more easily. The commercialization of the product has meant that a wider range of area needs to be searched for appropriate trees. This has specialized the harvesting of bark to mostly people from outside San Pablito, with only a few paper makers harvesting their own bark. These bark collectors generally come to the village {{at the end of the}} week, but numbers of harvesters and amount of bark can vary greatly, depending on the time of year and other factors. The paper makers generally buy the bark fresh then dry it for storage. After drying, the bark can be conserved for about a year.|$|E
