5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for this is the {{extensive}} freeway system in the city, due to the majority of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985.

5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university <b>funding,</b> <b>is</b> expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E
5|$|Health care in Scotland {{is mainly}} {{provided}} by NHS Scotland, Scotland's public health care system.

He could meet civilian needs in nondestructive testing and also military ones. A possible continuation of the project could be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same mobile platform for the lower parts, and a drone for the upper parts.

5|$|In the Lillehammer {{bid for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics, the {{agreement}} between Lillehammer Municipality and the state specified that the municipality was responsible for financing all necessary sports venues. However, after the games were awarded the responsibility {{was taken over by}} Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) and the town's five venues were ultimately funded through state grants. To allow for post-Olympic use, a fund was created by the state, of which Lillehammer Olympiapark received 146 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Unlike the Hamar venues, which survive on their fund's yield, the Lillehammer venues have used up their capital. From 2014 the post-Olympic use fund will be depleted and alternative organization and <b>funding</b> <b>is</b> being looked into. A leading proposal is that the bobsleigh and luge track be taken over by the state, while the remaining venues be retained by the company and jointly funded by the municipality and Oppland County Municipality.|$|E
5|$|SR 11 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1994. Four years later, several parties, {{including}} District 11 of Caltrans, the City and County of San Diego, the San Diego Association of Governments, and Tijuana were signatories to a Letter of Intent to build the border crossing. The route {{was added to}} the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1999. In 2009, Senate Bill 1486 was passed, and the presidential permit in 2008 allowed for the border crossing to be constructed. By one year later, several alternatives were considered, in terms of constructing some or even none of the interchanges, or removing the proposed toll on the route. State <b>funding</b> <b>is</b> allocated to cover much of the $400 million cost, which does not include the port of entry at another $350 million.

5|$|The WHT is {{operated}} by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING), together with the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope and 1.0m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope.

Telescope time is distributed in proportion to this funding, although Spain receives an additional 20% allocation in return {{for use of the}} observatory site. Five percent of observing time is further reserved for astronomers of other nationalities. As a competitive research telescope, the WHT is heavily oversubscribed, typically receiving applications for three to four times as much observing time as is actually available.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} process, the Proprietors leased {{the canal}} to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to {{withdraw}} from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council. Following the re-organisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009. It is a limited company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax {{does not have to be}} paid. The company will be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal once it is re-opened. The Department for Transport is in the process of reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed, and this has enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £1.5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board. This is to fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge. A second application for £650,000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created.
