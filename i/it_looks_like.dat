5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a palm tree. Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily grown from fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.|$|E
5|$|Now {{imagine a}} stack of {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of the}} universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1950s {{the cult}} of Kataragama has taken a nationalistic tone amongst the Sinhalese people. People visit the shrine year long, and during the annual festival <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a carnival. People get into trance and indulge in ecstatic rituals {{formerly}} associated with Hindus such as fire walking, Kavadi and even body piercing or hook swinging. These ecstatic rituals have carried through the island and are widely practiced. Prominent Sinhalese politicians such as Dudley Senanayake and Ranasinghe Premadasa have associated with the temple upkeep by building, renovation and cleaning projects.|$|E

5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E

25|$|The Chamber of Columns is {{a unique}} feature {{in the world of}} caves. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a wide passage leaving the Web before {{sweeping}} back to the river about 100 m downstream.

The upper half (0_ to 7_) is for bytes used only in single-byte codes, so <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a normal code page; {{the lower half}} is for continuation bytes (8_ to B_) and (possible) leading bytes (C_ to F_), and is explained further in the legend below.|$|E
25|$|Pillar Rock {{is a large}} {{rocky outcrop}} {{surrounded}} by cliffs on the northern side of Pillar, well below the summit. When seen from Ennerdale <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a tall and thin column, hence its name. In the early 19th century it became widely {{known as one of}} the wonders of the Lake District, chiefly due to its featuring in William Wordsworth's poem The Brothers.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{periodic}} tiling by unit squares (<b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> infinite graph paper). Now cut one square into two rectangles. The tiling obtained {{in this way}} is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. But clearly this example is much less interesting than the Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an aperiodic tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrary large periodic parts.|$|E

25|$|The most shocking, frightening, and {{fascinating}} image in {{rock in the}} last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive... When some male performers do it, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known piece is the {{so-called}} Montezuma's headdress. Despite its name, research has proven {{that it was not}} worn by the Aztec emperor. It was most likely made for an image as <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> the one for Quetzalcoatl depicted in the Codex Magliabechiano. The original is in the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna. A replica made with authentic techniques was made for the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|The grain {{direction}} {{can be determined}} {{by looking at the}} edge or side of the work piece. Wood fibers can be seen running out to the surface that is being planed. When the fibers meet the work surface <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> the point of an arrow that indicates the direction. With some very figured and difficult woods, the grain runs in many directions and therefore working against the grain is inevitable. In this case, a very sharp and finely-set blade is required.|$|E
