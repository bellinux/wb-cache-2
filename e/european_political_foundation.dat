Ganley attempted to get EU recognition and funding of €111,000 for the Libertas Foundation in February 2009, but the attempt was rejected because its board members were all from one member state and the foundation name was the same as the aspirant Europarty also founded by Ganley. The same meeting of the Bureau of the European Parliament that rejected the Libertas foundation but (momentarily) recognised the Libertas party also defunded the Alliance of Independent Democrats in Europe (AIDE).|$|E

40|$|Although much {{progress}} has been achieved in the last sixty years, the European Union still lacks a unique electoral system and a proper party system.

More could be done. National democracies can become sources of inspiration for new proposals. Some suggestions may require new formal regulations.

40|$|International audienceThis article aims to {{contribute}} to bridging {{the gap between the}} analysis of networks in European politics and policy-making. Recently, the European Commission took significant steps towards the recognition of <b>political</b> party <b>foundations</b> at EU level. Firstly, it has agreed to recognize them as actors of European development policies. Secondly, it has launched a proposal leading to the creation of <b>political</b> <b>foundations</b> at EU level, linked to the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. This article analyses the reasons, modalities and potential impact of this process, which signifies a breakthrough in comparison with the Commission’s previous attitude towards party affiliated organisations. For the foundations network-building turns out to have been a crucial means to attain legitimacy and access to the European institutions: firstly, through the mobilisation of political entrepreneurs in the European Parliament lobbying the Commission and Council representatives; and secondly, by linking the future role of non-state actors like <b>political</b> <b>foundations</b> to the reconsideration of the EU’s communication policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to define the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The thesis has been divided into five chapters, which are further subdivided. The reason why I have chosen this topic is quite simple - to analyse {{the current status of}} the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties and {{introduce}} them to wider audience not to be confused anymore with political groups in the European Parliament. In the first chapter the thesis brings a brief definition of the legal constitution of political groups in the European Parliament. For many years there has been confusion between the concept of a <b>European</b> <b>political</b> party and political group, so the thesis defines the political groups and its position in the European Parliament {{in order to create a}} basis for their differentiation from the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The second chapter is devoted to create a definition of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> party and to bring the legal regulation of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The thesis focuses also on the variability of their legal base in the treaties of the European Union (legal base before the Treaty of Lisbon, legal base in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and legal base in the Treaty of Lisbon). The third chapter is dedicated to legal issues of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. Emphasis was put on [...] ...|$|R
