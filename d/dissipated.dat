The energy dissipation system <b>dissipates</b> energy transferred to it by the incremental and progressive rupturing at an approximately constant force of strategically placed sacrificial stitching applied {{to a number of}} high strength straps, such as an aromatic polyimide fiber of extremely high tensile strength.

On a typical ASIC {{in a modern}} 90 nanometer process, switching the output might take 120 picoseconds, and happens once every ten nanoseconds. NMOS logic <b>dissipates</b> power whenever the transistor is on, {{because there is a}} current path from Vdd to Vss through the load resistor and the n-type network.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. In an environment of cool ocean temperatures and stable air, the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest. Associated deep convection <b>dissipated,</b> leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 0000UTC on September20. Performing a slow counter-clockwise loop, the remnant low <b>dissipated</b> five days later.|$|E

5|$|After Prapiroon <b>dissipated,</b> the {{regional}} Disease Prevention and Control Center of Guangxi Autonomous Region sent out eight teams of health workers to help avoid epidemics in affected areas. Despite the {{damage in the}} wake of the typhoon, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs did not activate any emergency response plans. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought for $4,825,791 (2006USD) in funds to assist 240,000 people who were affected over a 12-month span. Reconstruction in the areas devastated by Prapiroon began shortly after the typhoon <b>dissipated.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} the Philippines, the tropical depression <b>dissipated</b> in the South China Sea, although it reformed on August15. It moved northwestward, strengthening into Tropical Storm Vongfong. It brushed eastern Hainan before making landfall on August19 in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. Soon after it <b>dissipated,</b> the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the region, causing one traffic accident in Hong Kong and killing twelve people due to landslides. The storm destroyed 6,000houses, mostly in Guangdong, and {{damage in the}} country totaled at least $86million.|$|E
5|$|Two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Research planes {{conducted}} experiments into Caroline.

5|$|Although {{the system}} had a {{partially}} exposed low-level circulation center, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as the depression {{was likely to}} intensify as it was situated over high sea surface temperatures and in a favorable environment. However, by September4, wind shear quickly increased and dislocated all of the convection associated with the depression {{from the center of}} circulation. This led to the JTWC canceling their TCFA as the environment was no longer favorable for development. The following day, the JTWC declared that the system had <b>dissipated</b> and was no longer a suspect area for tropical cyclone development as the system was virtually stationary off the coast of Vietnam. The JMA, on the other hand, continued to monitor the cyclone as a tropical depression. Although previously declaring that the system <b>dissipated</b> early on September6, the JTWC began monitoring the re-developing system later that day. Convective banding had reformed, wind shear had decreased and the cyclone had less interaction with land as it slowly moved further into the South China Sea. However, late on September8, both agencies declared that the depression had <b>dissipated</b> off the coast of Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Dolores {{continued}} to intensify and it reached a peak windspeed of , a strong Category 1 hurricane, two days later. Meanwhile, Dolores {{became the first}} hurricane in over two years to cross longitude 125°W. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane started losing strength as it moved over cooler waters. The eye <b>dissipated</b> from satellite imagery while the associated thunderstorm activity became sheared. Dolores weakened back into a tropical storm on July 10 and a tropical depression the next day. The cyclone then crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (west of longitude 140°W) while producing minimal shower activity. It <b>dissipated</b> on July 12. The hurricane was {{not a threat to}} any land.|$|E
5|$|Early on July8, another brief {{burst in}} {{convection}} {{near the center}} of Blanca occurred. In this area, satellites found sustained winds around 40mph (65km/h). However, the convection quickly <b>dissipated</b> and the winds were not considered to be representative of the storm's true intensity. By later that day, convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and Blanca degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system, corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Blanca maintained a well-defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July11, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. The following day, the remnants of Blanca <b>dissipated</b> over open waters.|$|E
