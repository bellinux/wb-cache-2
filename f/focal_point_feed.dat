40|$|Antenna systems {{capable of}} {{operating}} with a multichannel microwave radiometer intended for mapping severe storm activity over patches {{on the surface}} of the earth 750 km square were compared. These systems included a paraboloidal reflector with an offset <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>feed,</b> and a symmetrical Cassegrain reflector system. Both systems are acceptable from the point of view of beam efficiency, however, from the point of view of maintaining the required positional accuracies and surface tolerances, as well as from the point of view of manufacturability, cost effectiveness, and technical risk, the symmetrical Casegrain was selected as the preferred configuration. Performance characteristics were calculated and a mechanical design study was conducted to provide estimates of the technical risk, costs, and development time required for the construction of such an antenna system...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of removal investigations, parameters for the optimal removal of PMMA bone cement were set. These describe {{the correlation between the}} laser and process parameters and the removal rate and quality. CO 2 and excimer lasers have proved to be suitable laser sources, wheras the excimer laser could achieve the best removal quality. However, the achievable removal rates were too low to be relevant for medicinal applications. Holmium and Nd:YAG lasers are not suitable for the removal of PMMA cement. Following this, emission measurements were made at various points. These show that methylmethacrylate, formaldehyd, ozone and dust were the main components of the removed material. For both PMMA and PMMA bone cement, nearly the same emission components are released; however, the concentrations differ. Methylmethacrylate and formaldehyde concentrations exceed the threshold levels. Due to manual beam guidance in medicine, during which the <b>focal</b> <b>point,</b> <b>feed</b> rate and working angle of the laser can differ reatly, the removal of PMMA bone cement could, up to now, only be carried out as an uncontrolled thermal process. For this reason, further investigations concerning the development of guidance and control strategies during the removal of bone cement were carried out, {{in order to make a}} controlled process with reduced emissions possible, despite manual guidance. The results show that process controls can be used to achieve laser output regulation, to avoid overheating the material, causing smoke and soot. The plasma radiation is used as a process signal, which can be measured using a foto diode, and subsequently evaluated via computer technology. (orig.)

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaInternational Solar Polar Mission (ISPM) is a dual-spacecraft mission {{sponsored}} {{jointly by}} NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) to gather scientific information for further {{understanding of the}} sun and predicting its influence on the Earth’s weather and climate. Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology has selected TRW to buiId U. S. spacecraft for the joint mission. The dual spacecraft will fly to Jupiter and use that planet’s greater gravitational field to achieve a near 90 degree orbit change, placing the two spacecraft on separate trajectories to the North and South poles of the Sun from a high heliographic vantage point. The antenna subsystem of the ISPM spacecraft consists of S-/X band high gain, S-band broad coverage, and X-Band medium gain antenna. Command and ranging signals are received by the S-band high-gain and broad-coverage antennas. Scientific and engineering data are transmitted by these two antennas and the X-band high-gain antenna. Conscan acquisition is by the two S-band antennas. Emergency transmissions are by the S-band broad coverage and X-band medium-gain antennas. The S-/X-band HGA is a 1. 9 meter (78 inches) diameter dual reflector Cassegrain design with a dichroic subreflector. The Cassegrain mode is excited by an efficient dual mode conical horn whose dimensions have been optimized to provide high-gain performance for X-Band. The S-band feed, located directly behind the frequency selective subreflector, illuminates the parabolic reflector as a <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>feed,</b> laterally displaced by 2. 29 cm (0. 9 inch) to provide conscan signals with a 1 dB crossover level. The selected configuration permits the use of a common antenna for both X- and S-band functions and utilizes previously developed TRW hardware. The selected design represents the largest non-deployable antenna that could be accommodated by shuttle/IUS and spacecraft physical interfaces. An x-ray XUV telescope (CXX) is located on the center of the spacecraf t which is despun about the spacecraft +Z axis. The ends of the coronograph cast shadows onto the edge of the reflector up to 9. 72 cm (3. 83 inches) inside the reflector. The shadowing effects from the coronograph have been analyzed and subsequently verified by antenna range testing. The performance of each antenna is substantiated by analyses and test data and pertinent design and analysis results are presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{reflector}} on {{an impulse}} radiating antennas (IRAs) is normally {{designed to be}} paraboloidal in shape, and are oriented so that the electrical <b>feed</b> <b>point</b> of the TEM feed line coincides with the <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> of the paraboloid. In many practical cases, the <b>feed</b> <b>point</b> and <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> are not exactly aligned, producing some defocus of the reflector. There {{are two types of}} defocus that can be analyzed exactly in the geometric optics approximation: converting the paraboloid into either a hyperboloid or a prolate spheroidal (elliptical cross-section) reflector. The paraboloidal reflector converts the spherical wave emanating from the <b>feed</b> <b>point</b> into a plane wave (i. e. a spherical wave focused at∞). The hyperboloid converts the expanding spherical wave into a second expanding wave which appears to emanate from the second <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> of the hyperboloid (which is behind the reflector); the prolate spheroid converts the expanding spherical wave into a second spherical wave that converges on the second <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> of the spheroid (which is in front of the reflector). The two cases are roughly equivalent to moving the electrical feed closer to the reflector (hyperboloid) or further from the reflector (prolate spheroid). In this paper, we examine the effect of hyperboloidal defocus. Previously [1], we derived the E- and H-plane responses from an in-focus IRA, and demonstrated that these responses are symmetric with respect {{to the center of the}} response. The results shown here demonstrate that the defocusing causes these responses to become asymmetric. These results explain the responses that have been measured from supposedly in-focus IRAs in the past...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the roles of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> and turning points in negotiation. Both concern impasses in negotiation, and negotiators can exploit them to move past impasses. Each term uses the word "point" differently, however. A <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> refers to a single salient {{coordinating}} concept shared by the parties. A turning point is a departure that takes place {{during the course of}} a negotiation, when the course seems to change. Precipitants precede turning points and consequences follow them. In this article, we focus on the relationship of these two negotiation concepts. We raise the following questions: Does the development of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> precipitate departures, and, if so, how? Do departures lead to the development of <b>focal</b> <b>points,</b> and, if so, how? Are there circumstances in which <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> do not precipitate turning points and vice versa? Do negotiations that feature <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> create more or less durable agreements? Do negotiations that include turning points create more or less durable agreements? To help answer these questions, we have analyzed four cases. In the German Foundation Agreement negotiation, the development of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> precipitated turning points. In the South African Interim Constitution negotiations, turning point departures precipitated the development of <b>focal</b> <b>points.</b> And in the negotiations to end the Burundi civil war and to reach the Nouméa Accord between France and New Caledonia, parties shared <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> that did not precipitate turning points.
