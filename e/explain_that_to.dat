2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But it can't be postponed," [...] he answered. [...] "If I {{could see}} you alone I could soon <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> you. There are certain reasons why I must speak now." ...|$|E

5000|$|Later in {{his life}} Ben-Gurion is said <b>to</b> have <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> him, [...] "Rock of Israel" [...] meant [...] "the Old Testament with its history and traditions" [...] or [...] "Tzahal" [...] (the Israeli army).|$|R
6000|$|... "There be {{one without}} whose right {{it be to}} <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> thee," [...] replied the chirurgeon, [...] "and when thou be clothed, if rise thou wilt, thou mayst see her, My Lord." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Ruxton {{glanced at}} him curiously. [...] "You must come and <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a {{fascinating}} theory," [...] she murmured, as she swept out of the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "In Thrums," [...] replied McQueen, [...] "a minister's {{business}} is everybody's business. I have often wondered who {{helped her to}} escape from the soldiers that night. Did she offer to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make {{a little}} fire now," [...] he said, to the Englishman. [...] "But {{be very careful}} that the forest does not catch." [...] And then he <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> allow the forest to burn in Norway was a prison offence.|$|R
5|$|Quoting the Jewish rabbi and scholar Jacob Neusner, Pope Benedict XVI <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> Israel, {{keeping this}} commandment {{was more than}} ritual; {{it was a way}} to imitate God, who rested on the seventh day after the creation. It also {{constituted}} the core of the social order.|$|R
5000|$|The study <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> {{arrive at}} these numbers, they had {{adjusted}} the underlying incident {{reports from the}} field by reducing each count by anywhere from 20% to 60%, {{based on their own}} reliability assessments, in order to [...] "control for casualty inflation - a prevalent form of bias." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, do {{you think}} it was teasing? I did, at first, and then again it seemed to me that I came out with the word because it seemed the right one. I presume I couldn't <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You'll have to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the {{inspector}} presently, my man,' was Constable McNaught's quiet comment, and, still vigorously protesting his innocence, the accused {{allowed himself to}} be led away, and the body was conveyed to the station, pending fuller identification.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{not here}} when I {{told her to}} stay," [...] {{retorted}} Marilla. [...] "I reckon she'll {{find it hard to}} <b>explain</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>to</b> my satisfaction. Of course I knew you'd take her part, Matthew. But I'm bringing her up, not you." ...|$|E

40|$|Simon Schaffer <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> {{produce an}} {{effective}} steam engine {{you do not}} just need specific inventions, such as the separate condenser of James Watt, but also skills from clockworking, distillation, metal working and so on. Then the steam power itself improved the metal boring which fed back into better steam engines...|$|R
2500|$|... "Ament <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> demand China {{entering}} upon {{a course}} of reform at the direction and practically {{under the direction of}} foreign powers would certainly be most irritating and militate ultimately against the constantly essential doctrine of preserving the integrity of the empire. China must be left to work out her own salvation by her own method." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{ought to}} {{remember}} that people make a use of coming here," [...] said Rattler. She was, of course, the Duchess. [...] "It's not like a private house. And whatever influence outsiders get by coming, so much she loses. Somebody ought to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Sabin {{contemplated}} {{it himself}} thoughtfully. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I rather {{thought that you}} might be able to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> me. I have an idea that there is a society in Europe--sort of aristocratic odd-fellows, you know--who had adopted it for their crest. Am I not right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's {{probably}} {{fortunate that}} I'm not busy at all," [...] he said. [...] "In fact, I'm quite prepared {{to stay here}} until this evening; and since {{there seems to be}} only one door to the place it will perhaps save Mr. Merril inconvenience if he sees me now. You can <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|E
50|$|In which context, Swami Swahananda <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> {{speak of}} 'difference' from a thing {{which does not}} exist conveys no meaning. The world is not really real so it cannot stand on the same footing. Bheda means 'difference', or 'not itself or the same but another'. Pratiyogitvam, a {{technical}} term, means recognizing 'difference' by noting the 'otherness' in another thing.|$|R
50|$|Indica's {{music and}} lyrics are {{written by the}} band's singer Jonsu, who started her composer's career even {{before she went to}} school, writing little 'symphonies' two bars long. Jonsu has <b>explained</b> <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> her, the biggest {{inspirational}} source for writing music is the music from movies. The lyrics stem from her own life, the lives of her friends, and also from dreams.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2012, the Conference of European Rabbis {{appealed to}} Apple Inc to stop selling an Arabic-language version of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion which was being sold via iTunes. Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> [...] "disseminate such hateful invective as a mobile app is {{dangerous}} and inexcusable." [...] Yuli Edelstein, Israel's Minister of Public Information and Diaspora Affairs, supported the appeal, <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> [...] "they wouldn't allow pedophilia and pornography on their networks. They shouldn't allow xenophobia, anti-Semitism or racism." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{be present}} at the hotel was in accord with Mr. Gingham's general {{conception}} of his business. No man had ever grasped the true principles of undertaking more thoroughly than Mr. Gingham.

6000|$|Wallenstein.

[...] 90 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what must seem strange, that when it's over you feel so {{extraordinarily}} pure. You feel like a disembodied spirit, immaterial; and {{you seem to be}} able to touch beauty as though it were a palpable thing; and you feel an intimate communion with the breeze, and with the trees breaking into leaf, and with the iridescence of the river. You feel like God. Can you <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Rozz Williams' {{favorite}} subjet matter {{revolved around}} death, religion and violence. Regarding the latter, the singer {{was obsessed with}} serial killers - especially Charles Manson - and dedicated a song ("Still Born/Still Life") to Jeffrey Dahmer. He <b>explained</b> <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> him, [...] "they've crossed a barrier that... well, obviously, you're not supposed to and you're not allowed to, supposedly. It's kind of a fascination with that".|$|R
6000|$|... "Not all of it, certainly," [...] he assented. [...] "Mr. C. <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> me. What I want is an {{opportunity}} to discriminate. Some would be very useful to me--the majority, of course, worse than useless. The particular information which I want concerns the structural defects in some of the new battleships. It would save an immense amount of time to get this succinctly." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Are you there, Ada?' he called. 'I am {{slipping}} a note {{beneath the}} door; just draw back the mat; that's it. Take it at once, please, to Mr. Critchett's, {{and be sure}} to wait for an answer. Then come back direct to me, up here. I don't think, Ada, your mistress believes much in Critchett; but I have fully explained what I want. He has made me up many prescriptions. <b>Explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> his assistant if he is not there. Go at once, and you will be back before she is. I should be so very much obliged, tell him. [...] "Mr Arthur Lawford."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I perceive--a deplorable {{condition}} of ignorance! Well I cannot enter into details just now: {{but it is}} necessary to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> embalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process. I use the word 'animal' in its widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process. To be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present." ...|$|E
60|$|It wanted {{nine days}} {{to the end of}} the month, and end of the year. The Post-office packet for the United States was to depart from Liverpool, weather permitting, on the first of the ensuing month, and I had the {{intervening}} time on my hands. I had taken this into consideration, and had resolved to make a visit to a certain spot (which I need not name) on the farther borders of Yorkshire. It was endeared to me by my having first seen Angela at a farmhouse in that place, and my melancholy was gratified by the idea of taking a wintry leave of it before my expatriation. I ought to <b>explain,</b> <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> avoid being sought out before my resolution should have been rendered irrevocable by being carried into full effect, I had written to Angela overnight, in my usual manner, lamenting that urgent business, of which she should know all particulars by-and-by--took me unexpectedly away from her for a week or ten days.|$|E
