40|$|Flavomycin is {{a commercially}} {{available}} antimicrobial growth promoter and an authorized additive <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs</b> in the EU {{and in the}} USA. As most antibiotically active products biosynthesized by microorganisms, it contains not only a single active compound but is a complex mixture of structurally closely related substances. Multistage matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-ion trap/reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-IT/RTOF-MS) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-IT-MS) were utilized for {{a detailed analysis of}} the constituents of the Flavomycin complex based on low-energy collision induced dissociation (CID). An optimal sample preparation for negative ion vacuum MALDI-MS for this compound class was developed. The MALDI-IT/RTOF-MS 2 and -MS 3 analysis starting with the precursor [M - H]- ions of these interesting phosphoglycolipids, named moenomycins, yielded a large variety of product ions that facilitated the structural characterization of this class of compounds. Based on the derived CID fragmentation pathway of the five known major constituents, namely moenomycin A, moenomycin A 12, moenomycin C 4, moenomycin C 3. and moenomycin C 1, four not yet described moenomycin-type constituents could be characterized. They were assigned as 4 F-demethyl- 6 E-O-de-ß-D-glucopyranosyl-moenomycin A, 6 B-N-de(2 -hydroxy- 5 -oxo- 1 -cyclopenten- 1 -yl) -moenomycin A, 6 B-hydroxy- 6 B-de[N-(2 -hydroxy- 5 -oxo- 1 -cyclopenten- 1 -yl) amino]-moenomycin A, and 6 C-hydroxy-moenomycin A. In addition, a moenomycin A carrying an oxygen in the moenocinol-group was found, which is most probably a chemical degradation product. These new compounds were verified by LC-ESI-IT-MS.  2006 American Society for Mass Spectrometry...|$|E

The experiment was laid in a {{randomised complete block design}} with four replications. The plant samples were taken at days 90 and 160 after emergence. The plant materials were used for the determinations of dry matter yield per plant, extractable juice concentration, crude protein (CP), neutral and acid detergent fibre contents (NDF and ADF) and dry matter degradability (DMD). The results showed that with the first cutting, the first three highest dry matter yield were with Rio, IS 23585, and E 35 - 1 whilst Suphan Buri 1, UT 470 - 2 and U-Thong 1 gave the highest extractable juice concentration.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of composition {{in terms of}} ingredients is important for detecting economic fraud and <b>for</b> monitoring <b>feed</b> safety. Composition analysis and label control of feed is regulated in Regulation (EC) 767 / 2009. In a broader view, composition analysis in the entire food chain can improve the effect of monitoring actions. The new legislation on food labelling (Regulation (EC) 1169 / 2011), effective from December 13 th 2014, obliges to provide more detailed information to customers on composition and related topics. A ring test was organized for the microscopic determination of botanic composition in animal feed {{in the framework of}} the annual ring tests of the IAG - International Association <b>for</b> <b>Feeding</b> <b>stuff</b> Analysis, Section <b>Feeding</b> <b>stuff</b> Microscopy. The organizer of the ring test was RIKILT - Wageningen UR, The Netherlands. The aim of the ring study was to provide the participants information on the performance of the local implementation of the method for composition {{analysis of}} feed. The sample was based on an artificially produced feed mimicking a ruminant feed, and distributed without label information. The participants were requested to produce a correct declaration of the ingredients of the sample. The results were analysed using the IAG model for uncertainty limits. Shares of ingredients in the feed formulation outside the limits of the model were indicated as underor over-estimations. A total of 25 sets of results was returned. The percentage of under- or over-estimations was 28. 6 % for the seven main ingredients. In the overview of results, the two declared wheat ingredients and the two declared corn products were pooled to one ingredient each. This was necessary since some participants declared a general ingredient (“wheat” and “corn”) and others a specific type (gluten or bran). The use of the original declarations would result in an extra number of non-matching estimations without precise justification. The share of the citrus pulp, in the presence of an equal amount of beet pulp, was underestimated or not detected in 44 % of the results. Citrus pulp as such is recognisable as feed ingredient. Still almost three quarter of all estimations appeared to be correct in the ranges of the uncertainty model. This means that visual inspection of the composition of a sample can be used for label control and this method can support traceability of ingredients in case of an incidence. The current results indicate that specific formulations can influence the precision of the estimation of the composition of the feed. The current lack of a complementary system for (chemical) proximate analysis could be a drawback for the overall approach of supporting traceability, necessary for fighting food fraud and <b>for</b> supporting <b>feed</b> safety. Besides a proper method description and up-to-date descriptions of ingredients, well developed skills of technicians are vital for a good performance...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of the project were to assess heavy metal flows on livestock farms {{and to develop a}} strategy to reduce heavy metal inputs into animal manures. For the experiments 20 farms with animal husbandry in various regions of Germany were selected. On the farms the inputs and outputs of the elements copper and zinc, as well as lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel were balanced at the stable level. The effect of abatement measures was evaluated using a calculation tool for stable balances. It is shown, the main input pathways for heavy metals into animal manures are, apart from copper disinfectants, <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs</b> and <b>feed</b> supplements. Home grown feeds are the major source of heavy metal input into the stable because they are fed in large quantities. However, the heavy metal content of the home grown feeds in particular of roughages for ruminants is low. Purchased <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> (supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs</b> and complete <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs)</b> were found to have a higher content of heavy metals (due to supplementation with trace elements) compared to home grown feeds. Thus, pig and poultry husbandry rather than ruminant husbandry is susceptible to heavy metal accumulation of manures. Heavy metals are cycling within the farm which is of importance when discussing the environmental impact. The turnover within the farm can hardly be controlled by the farmer. Thus, effective strategies have to be targeted at the inputs, e. g. the purchased <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs.</b> A main option to reduce the heavy metal input is to lower the trace element concentrations in supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> either by legislation of maximum threshold values (e. g. EG 1334 / 2003) or by volunteer agreements of the feed industry and agriculture. In addition, the absorption of copper and zinc by the animals should be improved using better absorbable trace element compounds and phytase. (orig.)

40|$|Grasslands are an {{important}} land use in Europe with essential functions <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> and ecosystem service supply. Impact assessment modelling of European agriculture and the environment needs to consider grasslands and requires spatially explicit information on grassland distribution and productivity, which is not available. This paper presents and analyses spatially explicit data of grassland productivity and land use across regions in Europe. Data are extracted from various regional, national and international census statistics for Europe, extending eastwards to the Ural Mountains. Regional differences in grassland productivity are analysed considering selected climatic and agronomic parameters and are compared with the remotely sensed {{normalised difference vegetation index}} (NDVI) and simulations from two impact assessment models. Temporal productivity changes are investigated for selected regions. As grassland is mainly used <b>for</b> animal <b>feed</b> <b>stuff,</b> the spatial distribution of milk productivity is also analyzed. Results show large regional differences in grassland productivity and land use in Europe. Grassland productivity is highly correlated with annual precipitation and less with annual temperature sum and growing season length. The correlation with NDVI is low. Comparison with large-scale simulations from two different models reveal that simulated spatial patterns of grassland productivity differ from the data obtained in this study, which may be attributable to the under-representation of management effects in these models. Grassland productivity has increased in recent decades, but the average annual genetic gain is different between temporary (0. 5 %) and permanent grassland (0. 25 %). The spatial pattern of milk productivity across Europe is similar to the productivity of grassland, suggesting that grassland productivity {{plays a major role in}} the distribution of milk productivity. The dataset described in this paper extends the present understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal changes in grassland productivity and land use in Europe. The dataset forms a suitable basis for evaluating large-scale (grassland) productivity models, for which observed data are scarce. However, the definition of grasslands and the collection of data across European countries need to be more consistent and standardised to improve the quality of European grassland productivity and land use data.

The results showed that DM and OM intakes were significantly influenced by <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> origin ranged from the lowest (Gli) of 29. 55 g DMI/kg 0. 75 to the highest (CS) of 94. 88 g/kg 0. 75. OM intake of buffaloes was higher than that of ongole cattle supported by organic matter (OM) digestibility data (61. 51 vs 59. 51). The digestibility of nutrient was significantly influenced by <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> origin. OM digestibility of SS were lowest while the highest were CST of 54. 56 and 71. 66 % respectively. Digestibility of CP was also significantly influenced by <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> origin. The lowest Digestible Crude Protein was CST and the highest was PH of 44. 10 and 67. 99 % respectively. The digestibility of NDF and ADF were significantly influenced by <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs.</b> The lowest NDF and ADF digestibilities were Cal of 40. 84 and 33. 19 % and the highest digestibility of NDF and ADF were CST of 68. 53 and 63. 57 %. It can be concluded that there were an important variation of feed compositions and digestibility of fibrous feeds. Buffalo were better than cattle on capacity of ingestion and utilization of fibrous feed.
