40|$|The design {{requirements}} and initial design concept for the AXAF-I Science Instrument Module (SIM) were reviewed at Ball on September 29, 1993. The concept design SIM focus mechanism utilizes a planetary gearset, with redundant motors, {{to drive a}} large ring (called 'main housing bearing') via a spur gearset. This large <b>drive</b> <b>ring</b> actuates three tangent bar links (called 'push rods'), which in turn actuate three levers (called 'pin levers'). Each of the three pin levers rotates an 'eccentric pin,' which in turn moves {{the base of a}} bipod flexure in both the radial (normal to optical axis) and axial (focus along optical axis) directions. Three bipod flexures are employed, equally spaced at 120 degrees apart, the base of each being translated in the two directions as described above. A focus adjustment is made by rotating the <b>drive</b> <b>ring,</b> which drives the push rods and therefore the pin levers, which in turn rotate the eccentric pins, finally imparting the two motions to the base of each of the bipod flexures. The axial translation (focus adjustment) of the focused structure is the sum of the direct axial motion plus axial motion which comes from uniformly squeezing the three bipod bases radially inward. SAO documented the following concerns regarding the focus mechanism in memo WAP-FY 94 - 001, dated October 7, 1993 : (1) The focus adjustment depends, in large part, on the structural properties (stiffnesses and end fixities) of the bipod flexures, push rods, pin levers and eccentric pins. If these properties are not matched very well, then lateral translations as well as unwanted rotations of the focussed structure will accompany focus motion. In addition, the stackup of linkage tolerances and any nonuniform wear in the linkages will result in the same unwanted motions. Thermal gradients will also affect these motions. At the review Ball did not present supporting analyses to support their choice of this design concept. (2) The proposed 'primary' method of measuring focus is by counting motor steps. The 'backup' method is by a pot mounted on the <b>drive</b> <b>ring.</b> Neither method provides for a direct measurement of the quantity desired (focus position). This is of concern because of the long and indirect relationship between focus and the sensed quantity (<b>drive</b> <b>ring</b> rotation). There are three sinusoidal relationships and structural stiffness in the path, and the resulting calibration is likely to be highly nonlinear. These methods would require an accurate ground calibration. (3) Ground calibration (and verification) of focus vs. drive position must be done in 1 -g on the ground. This calibration will be complicated by both the structural characteristics of the bipods {{and the fact that the}} CG of the translating portion of the SIM is not on the optical axis (thereby causing unwated rotations and changing the focus position vs. motor step and pot readout relationships). The SIM translating weight could be offloaded, but the calibration then becomes sensitive to any errors in offloading (both magnitude and direction). There are concerns as to whether a calibration to the required accuracy can be accomplished on the ground. (4) The choice of a potentiometer as the focus position sensor is questionable in terms of reliability for a five year mission. The results of SAO's study of items 1, 2 and 3 described above are presented in this report...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring fission yeast cytokinesis, actin {{filaments}} nucleated by cortical formin Cdc 12 {{are captured}} by myosin motors bound to {{a band of}} cortical nodes and bundled by cross-linking proteins. The myosin motors exert forces on the actin filaments, resulting in a net pulling of the nodes into a contractile ring, while cross-linking interactions help align actin filaments and nodes into a single bundle. We used these mechanisms in a three-dimensional computational model of contractile ring assembly, with semiflexible actin filaments growing from formins at cortical nodes, capturing of filaments by neighboring nodes, and cross-linking among filaments through attractive interactions. The model was used to predict profiles of actin filament density at the cell cortex, morphologies of condensing node-filament networks, and regimes of cortical tension by varying the node pulling force and strength of cross-linking among actin filaments. Results show that cross-linking interactions can lead to confinement of actin filaments at the simulated cortical boundary. We show that the ring-formation region in parameter space lies close to regions leading to clumps, meshworks or double rings, and stars/cables. Since boundaries between regions are not sharp, transient structures that resemble clumps, stars, and meshworks can appear {{in the process of}} ring assembly. These results are consistent with prior experiments with mutations in actin-filament turnover regulators, myosin motor activity, and changes in the concentration of cross-linkers that alter the morphology of the condensing network. Transient star shapes appear in some simulations, and these morphologies offer an explanation for star structures observed in prior experimental images. Finally, we quantify tension along actin filaments and forces on nodes during ring assembly and show that the mechanisms describing ring assembly can also <b>drive</b> <b>ring</b> constriction once the ring is formed...|$|E

Due to process of accretion some of this clouds became compact objects. Initially accretion is spherical, but then take {{the shape of the}} disk, and this 2 D disk collect matter more efficient than 3 D sphere. Accretion disks provide the mechanism of redistribution of angular moment and extraction of potential energy,leads to occurrence of compact objects from gas clouds. To fall moving along a spiral trajectory on the central gravitating body, a particle rotation around must reduce angular moment and energy. Outward of angular moment and movement of gas particles in the opposite direction (to the central body) happens due to of viscose friction. We can think that the disc is composed of multiple adjacent rings friction each other, each inner ring has a large angular velocity to the adjacent outer ring and thus friction of the <b>drive</b> <b>ring</b> decreased the rate of internal. The occurrence of intense dissipation in accretion flows is among the long-standing unsolved problems in astrophysics. Revealing how the magnetized turbulence creates shear stress tensor is of primary importance to understand the heating mechanism and the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks. The transport of angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates is important for the main problem of cosmogony, that is understanding the dynamics of creation of compact astrophysical objects. Without a theory explaining the enhanced energy dissipation in accretion flows of turbulent magnetized plasma we would have no clear picture of how our solar system has been created, why the angular momentum of the Sun is only 2 % of the angular momentum of solar system, while carrying 99 % of the solar system's mass.

40|$|The goal {{of current}} {{work is to}} design, develop and {{understand}} a catalytic system for the dehydration of 1, 2, 6 hexanetriol, optimising the selective removal of the secondary hydroxyl group. The nature of biorenewable resources, in particular the existence of multiple functional groups poses a huge challenge for their catalytic upgrading to useful commodity chemicals. We have successfully demonstrated copper modified silica alumina as well as copper modified silica catalysts as viable catalysts for this reaction. In {{order to understand the}} catalytic conversion of biorenewable feedstocks, 1, 2, 6 hexanetriol has been selected as the platform molecule and the catalytic routes to known commodity chemicals over copper based catalysts have been investigated. A collection of these catalytic rules can in future be used {{in the development of a}} catalytic toolbox which will provide some insights into the general catalytic conversion of biorenewables. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive catalytic toolbox that will facilitate the logical design of catalytic systems from given starting biorenewable platforms to desired commodity end product. Despite the fair amount of research that has been done on the catalytic dehydration of diols and mono-ols not much work has been done on dehydration of triols. There is therefore a lack of kinetic, mechanistic and active site identification work in the catalytic dehydration of higher order polyols reported in literature. This work investigates the role of the metal functionality in copper based composites for the dehydration of 1, 2, 6 hexanetriol. We found that the copper catalysts that were active in flows of H 2 were virtually inactive in flows of inert gas, a discovery that led us to the proposal of 3 hypotheses based on the experimental data. We propose that the copper metal surface facilitates the dissociative adsorption of H 2 followed on by some events (extensively discussed in chapters 3 and 4), which ultimately result in the production of protonic active sites which participate in the catalytic reaction. A second hypothesis was proposed concurrently with the first one, stating that the H 2 played the role of keeping the copper metal in its reduced state, as Cu 0 and we proposed that Cu 0 was the active site for the reactions proceeding. Correlations between catalyst specific activity and Cu 0 surface concentrations revealed a strong dependency between the two variables suggestive of the fact that Cu 0 was indeed the active site for the reactions proceeding. Lastly, we propose that H 2 is preventing the catalysts from coking, by working together with the copper metal to remove product from the catalyst surface, thus preventing product polymerization which leads to coke formation. We established that copper metals supported on high acid strength materials had the propensity to <b>drive</b> <b>ring</b> closing reactions, thereby increasing selectivity toward pyranic and cyclohexyl products under those conditions. On the other hand, copper catalysts supported on moderate to low acid strength materials yielded higher selectivities toward linear products such as 1, 6 hexanediol and its precursors. Higher H 2 partial pressures produced increases in catalytic activity and these conditions steered selectivities towards 1, 6 hexanediol and its precursors. Strong synergic effects between Cu 0, acid support and choice of carrier gas were exhibited by all catalysts; therefore experimental work is mostly focused on decoupling the effects of the variables so as to determine the individual roles played by each component in the system.

The obtained data and calculations of the balance equations for possible reactions demonstrate that the negative ion production is realized in two stages. First, the hydrogen and deuterium molecules are excited in collisions with the plasma electrons to high-laying Rydberg or vibrational levels in the plasma volume. The second stage leads to the negative ion production {{through the process of}} dissociative attachment of low energy electrons. The low energy electrons are originated due to a bombardment of the plasma electrode by ions of one of the <b>driven</b> <b>rings</b> and thermoemission from heated tungsten filaments.
