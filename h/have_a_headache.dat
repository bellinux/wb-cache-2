25|$|About half {{of adults}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> {{in a given}} year. Tension {{headaches}} are the most common, affecting about 1.6billion people (21.8% of the population) followed by migraine headaches which affect about 848 million (11.7%).|$|E
25|$|Approximately 64–77% {{of people}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> {{at some point}} in their lives. During each year, on average, 46–53% of people have {{headaches}}. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. Only approximately 1–5% of people who seek emergency treatment for headaches have a serious underlying cause.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{children}} {{suffer from}} {{the same types of}} headaches as adults do, but their symptoms may be slightly different. The diagnostic approach to headache in children {{is similar to that of}} adults. However, young children may not be able to verbalize pain well. If a young child is fussy, they may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>headache.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{minimum height}} {{requirement}} for Mission: Space is 44inches (112cm). Spiels and warnings throughout the attraction caution {{that people who}} do not like enclosed dark spaces, simulators, spinning, or are prone to motion sickness should not ride. Signs also warn that the ride may cause nausea, headache, dizziness, or disorientation, and that people prone to motion sickness, or who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> or an inner ear problem, or who have a history of migraines, vertigo, or elevated anxiety also should not ride. These signs are similar to those present at considerably less-intense rides in the same park, such as Soarin'. There are also signs which instruct the rider to keep their head flat against the headrest, stating that if one ignores this, the centrifugal motion acting on one's head can cause undesirable effects such as dizziness and/or headaches, or possibly even more serious effects.|$|E
500|$|Jack McGee {{was cast}} as Bob Damfuse—referred to colloquially as [...] "Angry Bob"—the {{father of the}} half-sisters with a severe anger issue. During rehearsals for his scene, McGee {{purposely}} kept his voice down to prevent a severe headache. He recalled, [...] "I remember the director , {{he wanted me to}} scream during rehearsal, and I was, like, 'Look, you don’t understand: If I do this, I’m gonna <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> in 30 fucking seconds.'" [...] The scenes were rehearsed about five or six times before the actual scene was filmed.|$|E
500|$|A {{person with}} a {{moderate}} or severe TBI may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> that does not go away, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions, an inability to awaken, dilation of one or both pupils, slurred speech, aphasia (word-finding difficulties), dysarthria (muscle weakness that causes disordered speech), weakness or numbness in the limbs, loss of coordination, confusion, restlessness, or agitation. [...] Common long-term symptoms of moderate to severe TBI are changes in appropriate social behavior, deficits in social judgment, and cognitive changes, especially problems with sustained attention, processing speed, and executive functioning. Alexithymia, a deficiency in identifying, understanding, processing, and describing emotions occurs in 60.9% of individuals with TBI. Cognitive and social deficits have long-term consequences for {{the daily lives of}} people with moderate to severe TBI, but can be improved with appropriate rehabilitation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{medicines}} {{used to treat}} chronic (daily) headaches are called prophylactic medicines, which are used to prevent headaches. Such preventative medication is taken on a daily basis, even when a person may not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>headache.</b> Prophylactic medicines are recommended for chronic headache patients because varied experiments prove that the medications [...] "reduce the frequency, severity, and disability associated with daily headaches". A majority of the prophylactic medications work by inhibiting or increasing neurotransmissions in the brain, often preventing the brain from interpreting pain signals.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1991, Dahmer {{observed}} a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter {{standing at a}} bus stop near Marquette University. According to Dahmer, he lured Straughter into his apartment with an offer of money for posing for nude photos, with the added incentive of sexual intercourse. Dahmer drugged and strangled Straughter with a leather strap, then dismembered him, with Dahmer retaining the youth's skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process. Less than two months later, on April 7, Dahmer encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey walking to get a key cut. Lindsey was a heterosexual. Dahmer lured Lindsey to his apartment, where he drugged him, drilled a hole in his skull and poured hydrochloric acid into it. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which Dahmer had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>headache.</b> What time is it?" [...] In response to this, Dahmer again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull; he then flayed Lindsey's body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, Dahmer disposed of Lindsey's skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.|$|E
