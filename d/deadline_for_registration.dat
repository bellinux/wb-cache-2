On the 12th May 1954, students from the Chinese Middle Schools still did not register themselves for National Service. In light of the impending <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> and withrequests from the Chinese students, Chief Secretary William Goode would later meet representatives from the affected student body in the government house on 13 May 1954 (Thum, 2012).|$|E

After the announcement was made regarding the National Service draft, personnel involved were to register for the call-up from 8 April - 12 May 1954. By 12 May 1954, students from the Chinese Middle Schools still did not register themselves for National Service (NS) (Thum, 2012). In light of the impending <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> and with requests from the Chinese students, Chief Secretary William Goode would later meet representatives from the affected student body in the government house on 13 May 1954. This day however, resulted in a clash between Chinese Middle School students and riot squads. More than 2 dozen were reportedly injured and nearly 50 students were arrested. Of those arrested, 7 were convicted of obstructing the police (Quee, Tan, & Hong, 2011). Following the riot, students re-assembled in Chung Cheng High School and only dispersed in the afternoon on 14 May 1954 (Lee, 1996).|$|E

40|$|We discuss Canada's {{universal}} gun registration legislation (Bill C- 68), {{passed in}} December 1995. It {{has been plagued}} by a variety of problems: delays in coming into force, huge cost overruns, need to cut fees to encourage compliance, massive problems with its computer systems, stubborn resistance by anti-control groups, and the fact that eight of 10 provinces refused to participate in administering the new law. To hide the overruns, the federal government resorted to "back door" financing. While the latest <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> of all long guns and hand guns was July 1, 2003, {{it is not clear that}} universality was achieved. For one thing, the official estimate of the stock of guns is almost far below the actual number of guns in private hands. We explain that, like almost all previous gun control legislation in Canada, Bill C- 68 reflects a persistent kultur kampf and opportunistic behaviour by politicians.

40|$|WPCF 2013 IX Workshop on Particle Correlations and Femtoscopy We {{are pleased}} to {{announce}} the upcoming IX Workshop on Particle Correlations and Femtoscopy, WPCF 2013. The workshop {{will be held in}} the Sicilian town of Acireale (Italy), near Catania, on Nov 5 - 8, 2013. The meeting is organized by the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Sezione di Catania and Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (LNS) and by the Dipartimento di Fisica ed Astronomia of the University of Catania. Scientific information and topics This event follows the tradition of previous editions by bringing together experts and other interested researchers in the field of particle-particle correlations and femtoscopy in nuclear and particle physics. The topics covered by the WPCF workshop concern dynamical and thermo-dynamical properties of emitting sources produced in heavy-ion collisions, including links to phase transitions and equation of state properties. Moreover, two- and multi-particle correlation measurements provide tools to reveal the existence of new resonances (both at high and at low energies) and phenomena such as nuclear clusters and molecules and spectroscopic properties of unbound states. The scope of the meeting will include correlation and femtoscopy research at RHIC/LHC energies and at low and intermediate energies as well. Topics: 	 		Femtoscopy at RHIC and LHC: links to QGP physics 	 		Femtoscopy in A+A, p+p, p+A and e+-e- collisions at relativistic energies 	 		Femtoscopy at intermediate energies: links to the EoS of asymmetry nuclear matter 	 		Charge fluctuations and correlations 	 		Fluctuation in initial conditions 	 		Collective flow and correlations 	 		Resonance decays at RHIC and LHC 	 		Resonance decay spectroscopy in low and intermediate energy reactions 	 		Correlations, cluster states, nuclear molecules and production of boson condensates in nuclei 	 		New methods and facilities These topics will be covered with invited and contributed talks, selected from received abstracts. Participation and abstract submission by students and postdocs are strongly encouraged.
