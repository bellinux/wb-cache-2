5|$|Harold Lee George (July 19, 1893 – February 24, 1986) was an American {{aviation}} pioneer who <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> {{and promote}} the concept of daylight precision bombing. An outspoken proponent of the industrial web theory, George taught at the Air Corps Tactical School and influenced a significant group of airmen passing through the school, ones who had powerful influence during and after World War II. He {{has been described as}} the leader of the Bomber Mafia, the men who advocated an independent military arm composed of heavy bombers. George <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> America's bomber strategy for the war by assisting Air War Plans Division with the development of a complete aircraft production and bombing strategy.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 20 {{years of}} {{foundational}} {{work by the}} bomber mafia resulted in {{the separation of the}} United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm. The bomber mafia's strategic doctrine, changed by war and experience, <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the mission of the new Air Force and its Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reich's {{precarious}} mental health, {{his work}} on character {{and the idea of}} muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, gave rise to body psychotherapy, and <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich's student Alexander Lowen, and the primal therapy of Arthur Janov.|$|E

5|$|Moorfields {{remained}} largely open until 1812, and the longstanding presence of that open space separating the emerging East End {{from the western}} urban expansion of London must have <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the varying economic character of the two parts and perceptions of their distinct identity (see map below).|$|E
5|$|Prominent alumni in {{the field}} of science include Douglas L. Coleman, who {{discovered}} leptin, Richard Bader, noted for his work on the atoms in molecules theory, Harold E. Johns, who pioneered the use of cobalt-60 in the treatment of cancer, Karl Clark, who pioneered the separation method to extract bitumen from the oil sands, and Steve Mann, a researcher and inventor {{in the field}} of computational photography. Notable faculty members include chemist Ronald Gillespie, who <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> VSEPR theory, as well as David Sackett and Gordon Guyatt, whose research team was largely credited for largely establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. Prominent alumni {{in the field of}} social sciences was Harold Innis, who <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> communication theory and the staples thesis, and sociologist Henry Giroux, one of the founding theorists of critical pedagogy.|$|E

5|$|Wollstonecraft later repudiated Mary, {{writing that}} it was laughable. However, {{scholars}} have argued that, despite its faults, the novel's representation of an energetic, unconventional, opinionated, rational, female genius (the {{first of its kind}} in English literature) within a new kind of romance is an important development {{in the history of the}} novel because it <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> an emerging feminist discourse.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the Solar System. The orbits {{of most of}} the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Science Council of Canada during the 1970s, Franklin chaired an {{influential}} study on conserving resources and protecting nature. The study's 1977 report, Canada as a Conserver Society, recommended a wide range of steps aimed at reducing wasteful consumption and the environmental degradation that goes with it. The work on that study <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> Franklin's ideas about the complexities of modern technological society.|$|E

5|$|Protestant writers at {{the time}} took a highly {{negative}} view. By the 17th century, Mary's persecution of Protestants had led to her sobriquet Bloody Mary. John Knox attacked her in his First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women (1558), and she was prominently vilified in Actes and Monuments (1563), by John Foxe. Subsequent editions of Foxe's book remained popular with Protestants throughout the following centuries and <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has been}} the home of many famous inventors and engineers, {{including}} Hans Geiger, {{the creator of the}} Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first fully automatic digital computer. Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Otto Lilienthal, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> modern automotive and air transportation technology. German institutions like the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA. Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication.|$|E
5|$|In 1903–04 Vaughan Williams started {{collecting}} folk-songs. He {{had always}} been interested in them, and now followed the example of a recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> his compositional style {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

5|$|The king soon revoked the {{charters}} {{of freedom}} and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued {{in other parts of}} the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the cavalry's {{contribution to}} the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E
5|$|The {{route is}} officially {{known as the}} Jacob Dekema Freeway after Jacob Dekema, a {{pioneering}} force from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) who <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the San Diego freeway system. It {{is also part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System and the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2013, I-805 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 41,500 at the southern terminus, and 262,000 between Bonita Road and SR 54, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.|$|E

5|$|William Lloyd Oakley {{was born}} on February 27, 1966 in Westminster, Maryland and raised {{on a farm in}} Union Bridge, Maryland. He was a fan of Mad {{magazine}} from an early age, which <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> his comic sensibility. He attended St. Albans High School in Washington D.C., where he met and became best friends with Josh Weinstein in the eighth grade. The two created the school humor magazine The Alban Antic in 1983. Such would be the length of their partnership; the two often finish each other's sentences. Oakley later attended Harvard University, where he wrote for and served as Vice President of the Harvard Lampoon, working on the famous 1986 USA Today parody issue. He graduated in 1988 after studying American history.|$|E
5|$|Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) chose Sringeri in Karnataka to {{establish}} {{the first of his}} four mathas (monastery). Madhvacharya (1238–1317) was the chief proponent of Tattvavada (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy— one of the three most influential Vedanta philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya {{is believed to be the}} third incarnation of Vayu (Mukhyaprana), after Hanuman and Bhima. The Haridasa devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the culture, philosophy and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{beginning}} of the incursion of Europeans into the area, {{the members of the}} Confederacy <b>helped</b> <b>shape</b> the development of North America throughout the 18th century, becoming a centre of trade and culture. Great Britain supported this strengthening of the tribes in the area as a set of allies against the French and the Iroqouis. The people of the Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven Years' War and only made peace with Great Britain after the Treaty of Fort Niagara in 1764. It also fought {{on the side of the}} British during the War of 1812. The Three Fires Confederacy also broke several treaties with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the United States. The Grand Council survived intact until the middle to late 19th century, when more modern political systems began to evolve.|$|E
