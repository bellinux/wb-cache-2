5|$|Although Edna Diefenbaker {{had been}} devoted to {{advancing}} her husband's career, in the mid-1940s she began to suffer mental illness, and {{was placed in a}} private mental hospital for a time. She later fell ill from leukemia, and died in 1951. In 1953, Diefenbaker married Olive Palmer (formerly Olive Freeman), whom he had courted while living in Wakaw. Olive Diefenbaker became a <b>great</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> strength to her husband. There were no children born of either marriage.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became a <b>great</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but {{can be used for}} coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and a <b>great</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> pride for the white community, {{as well as for}} some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E

25|$|Strauss married soprano Pauline de Ahna on 10 September 1894.

Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final Four Last Songs of 1948, he preferred the soprano voice to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles.|$|E

25|$|Beveridge's {{arguments}} were widely accepted. He appealed to conservatives and other sceptics {{by arguing that}} welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions out of corporate ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would {{also serve as a}} <b>great</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> demand for British goods.|$|E
25|$|In November 1769, the Portolá {{expedition}} discovered San Francisco Bay {{before returning}} to San Diego.

Although Gálvez — in arguing for his plan to expand into San Diego and Monterey — had projected that Alta California would eventually prove a <b>great</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> revenue for the Spanish crown, the region wound up running an annual deficit during most of its years under Spanish rule.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} few centuries of the Christian era, Egypt was the {{ultimate}} source of {{a great deal of}} ascetic literature in the Coptic language.

In 970, al-Azhar University was founded in Cairo, which to this day remains the most important center of Sunni Islamic learning.

In 2009 he was chosen as the greatest Scot by the Scottish public in a vote run by Scottish television channel STV.|$|E

25|$|After the {{establishment}} of Hampshire County Council, following the act in 1888, Southampton became a county borough within the county of Hampshire, which meant that it had many features of a county, but governance was now shared between the Corporation in Southampton and the new county council. There is a <b>great</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> confusion {{in the fact that}} the ancient shire county, along with its associated assizes, was known as the County of Southampton or Southamptonshire. This was officially changed to Hampshire in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries. Southampton became a non-metropolitan district in 1974.|$|E

25|$|The guidon is a <b>great</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{pride for}} the unit, and several {{military}} traditions have developed around it, stemming back from ancient times. Any sort of disgrace toward the guidon {{is considered a}} dishonor of the unit as a whole, and punishment is typical. For example, should the guidon bearer drop the guidon, they must fall with it and perform punishment, often {{in the form of}} push-ups. Other units may attempt to steal the guidon to demoralize or antagonize the unit. Veteran soldiers know not to give up the guidon to anyone outside their unit, but new recruits may be tempted into relinquishing it by a superior, especially during a unit run.|$|E
