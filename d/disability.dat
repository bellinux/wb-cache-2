The descriptions of people with <b>disabilities</b> in textbooks would influence students’ attitude to people with <b>disabilities.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze people with <b>disabilities</b> described in Chinese-language elementary school textbooks, including the prevalence of categories of <b>disabilities,</b> the development of their character, significant others and inclusive education. The results of study include: (1) People with <b>disabilities</b> are significantly underrepresented in Chinese-language elementary school textbooks. The most prevalent <b>disabilities</b> found in textbooks focused on physical <b>disabilities</b> in nature. Four categories of <b>disabilities</b> neglected in textbooks including hearing impairment, autism, emotional <b>disabilities,</b> and developmental retardation. (2) Textbooks tended to emphasize the character development of well-known people with <b>disabilities.</b> (3) Significant others for people with <b>disabilities</b> including parents, teachers, and their peers.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} (1) associations among teachers’ experiences regarding children with <b>disabilities</b> (i. e., education, specialized training, {{years of work}} experience), their attitudes toward <b>disabilities,</b> and their classroom practices in relation to inclusion and (2) associations among children’s attitudes toward peers with <b>disabilities</b> and child and teacher factors. Ninety-one 4 - and 5 -year-old children participated in an interview, and their teachers completed a survey. Teachers’ specialized training and bachelor’s degree in early childhood education (ECE) were positively associated with their inclusive practices in the classroom; teachers’ bachelor’s degree in ECE and experiences working with children with <b>disabilities</b> were positively associated with their attitudes toward <b>disabilities</b> and inclusion; and children’s perceived contact {{with people who have}} <b>disabilities</b> was positively associated their attitudes toward peers with <b>disabilities.</b> However, none of the teacher factors predicted children’s attitudes toward peers with <b>disabilities.</b> Early childhood teachers need more training opportunities to learn about <b>disabilities</b> to develop positive attitudes toward <b>disabilities</b> and inclusion.

5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} <b>disability</b> grouped {{into one of}} five <b>disability</b> categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical <b>disability</b> that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the <b>disability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the <b>disability</b> of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest <b>disability</b> would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a <b>disability.</b>|$|E

40|$|Students with <b>disabilities</b> {{are often}} framed as “the problem” and have limited {{opportunities}} {{to engage in}} standards based mathematics, leading to persistent underachievement. In this paper, we investigate a research divide between mathematics educational research for {{students with and without}} <b>disabilities,</b> a divide with significant differences in the theoretical orientations and research methodologies used to understand learners. Based on an analysis of 149 mathematics educational research articles published between 2013 and 2015, we found significant differences between articles focused on learners with and without <b>disabilities.</b> For those with <b>disabilities,</b> mathematical problem solving was understood primarily from behavioral and information processing theoretical perspectives, while for those without <b>disabilities,</b> problem solving was understood primarily through constructivist and sociocultural perspectives. While 86 % of research on problem-solving including students with <b>disabilities</b> was quantitative, only 35 % of research on students without <b>disabilities</b> was quantitative. Fifty percent of problem-solving research on students without <b>disabilities</b> was qualitative, compared to only 6 % of research on students with <b>disabilities.</b> Problem solving, then, is studied in very different ways for learners with and without <b>disabilities.</b> Students without <b>disabilities</b> are studied through close analysis of learning, often individual. Students with <b>disabilities</b> are most often studied quantitatively, in groups, with little analysis of individual thinking.

40|$|Accessible summary Both {{good and}} bad things can happen when people use the Internet, and people with {{learning}} <b>disabilities</b> are not using the Internet as much as other people. Worry about the bad {{things that can happen}} online might be one reason people with learning <b>disabilities</b> are not supported to access the Internet as much as other people. We wanted to find out what people without learning <b>disabilities</b> believe about these {{good and bad}} things for people with learning <b>disabilities.</b> We wanted to find this out because the way people without <b>disabilities</b> think about the good and bad things online might affect how people with learning <b>disabilities</b> are treated. We found out that people without learning <b>disabilities</b> think that both the good and bad things are more likely to happen to people with learning <b>disabilities</b> when they use the Internet. Abstract Background: Information and communication technologies, with the Internet at the forefront, have the potential to enhance the knowledge, service, employment, development and social interactional opportunities available to people with intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Despite this, people with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> are not accessing the Internet to the same degree as people without intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Issues of safety, risk and protection online for people with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> have yet to be adequately investigated, and these currently serve as reasons given for hindering people from gaining online access. Materials and Method: This survey aimed to gauge the views people without intellectual <b>disabilities</b> have of risks and benefits of using the Internet for themselves and for people with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> and to compare self-ratings of risk and benefits to ratings for people with intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Results: The survey findings indicate that, with {{only a small number of}} exceptions, both the risks and benefits of being online were believed to be greater for people with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> compared with those without intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Greater use of the Internet was associated with increased perception of benefits to being online for both people with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> and for participants. Conclusions: Perceptions of increased benefits suggest more needs to be performed to improve online access whilst a perception of increased risk may help to explain the reduced inclusion of people with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> in the online world...|$|R

40|$|Background: Transition to {{adulthood}} {{may be a}} period of vulnerability for health for individuals with intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> No large-scale studies have compared the health of individuals with and without intellectual <b>disabilities</b> undergoing transition. The aims {{of this study were}} (1) to compare health during transition for individuals with and without intellectual <b>disabilities</b> across a whole country population and (2) to establish whether transition is associated with health in the population with intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Methods: Data were drawn from Scotland's Census, 2011. Frequency data were calculated for young people with and without intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Logistic regressions were used {{to determine the extent to}} which intellectual <b>disabilities</b> account for seven health outcomes (general health, mental health, physical <b>disabilities,</b> hearing impairment, visual impairment, long-term illness and day-to-day activity limitations), adjusted for age and gender. Within the intellectual <b>disabilities</b> population, logistic regressions were then used to determine whether age group (13 – 18 or 19 – 24 years) is associated with the seven health outcomes, adjusted by gender. Results: A total of 5556 / 815 889 young people aged 13 – 24 years had intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Those with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> were 9. 6 – 125. 0 times more likely to have poor health on the seven outcomes. Within the population with intellectual <b>disabilities,</b> the 19 - to 24 -year-olds with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> were more likely to have mental health problems than the 13 - to 18 -year-olds, but did not have poorer health on the other outcomes. The difference between age groups for mental health problems was greater for young people who did not have intellectual <b>disabilities,</b> but their overall level of mental health problems was substantially lower than for the young people with intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Conclusions: This largest-to-date study quantifies the extent of the substantial health disparities experienced by young people with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> compared with people without intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> The young population with intellectual <b>disabilities</b> have substantial health problems; therefore, transition between child and adult services must be carefully planned in order to ensure that existing health conditions are managed and emerging problems minimised...|$|R
