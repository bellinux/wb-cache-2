25|$|There is {{a theory}} that vinyl records can audibly {{represent}} higher frequencies than compact discs. According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has a frequency response of 20Hz up to 22,050Hz, and most CD players measure flat within {{a fraction of a}} decibel from at least 20Hz to 20kHz at full output. Turntable rumble obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30kHz, with gentle roll-off. Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30kHz {{to be out of the}} range of human hearing. The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20Hz to a maximum of around 20,000Hz. The upper and lower frequency limits of human hearing vary per person. High <b>frequency</b> <b>sensitivity</b> decreases as a person ages, a process called presbycusis. By contrast, hearing damage from loud noise exposure typically makes it more difficult to hear lower frequencies, such as three kHz through six kHz.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility study on locating damage in circular cylindrical fiber-reinforced composite shells based on natural frequencies and mode shape information at specific locations. The axial {{position of the}} damage is located by comparing the measured and the predicted frequency changes due to introducing damage. The theoretical frequency changes are approximated by <b>frequency</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> The advantage is that a damaged shell model is not required, as <b>frequency</b> <b>sensitivities</b> are readily obtained from a defect-free finite element model. As the shells are axisymmetric, additional information on mode shape is employed to locate the exact damage position. Results from simulations showed that the proposed detection scheme can easily locate damage in free-free and simply-supported shells. For a clamped-free shell, a successful detection scheme is secured by excluding those vibration modes with a highly nonlinear response to the severity of damage. The robustness of the proposed method {{in the presence of}} both modelling and measurement errors is demonstrated by simulation. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

500|$|Water has {{different}} acoustic properties {{from those of}} air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction. Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. [...] Human hearing underwater, {{in cases where the}} diver’s ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. <b>Frequency</b> <b>sensitivity</b> underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. [...] The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and additive effect.|$|E

Asymmetrical ear placement also causes IID for high frequencies (between 4 kHz and 8 kHz) to vary systematically with elevation, converting IID into a map of elevation. Thus, {{it is essential for}} an owl {{to have the ability to}} hear high frequencies. Many birds have the neurophysiological machinery to process both ITD and IID, but because they have small heads and low <b>frequency</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> they use both parameters only for localization in the azimuth. Through evolution, the ability to hear frequencies higher than 3 kHz, the highest frequency of owl flight noise, enabled owls to exploit elevational IIDs, produced by small ear asymmetries that arose by chance, and began the evolution of more elaborate forms of ear asymmetry.|$|E
