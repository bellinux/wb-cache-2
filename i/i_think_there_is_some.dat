60|$|In {{regard to}} the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand {{substantially}} as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe that the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing there, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> force in that view.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Hastings, {{with this}} great body of bribery against him, was providentially freed from Nundcomar, {{one of his}} accusers, and, as good events do not come alone, (<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> such proverb,) it did so happen that all the rest, or {{a great many of}} them, ran away. But, however, the {{recorded}} evidence of the former charges continued; no new evidence came in; and Mr. Hastings enjoyed that happy repose which branded peculation, fixed and eternized upon the records of the Company, must leave upon a mind conscious of its own integrity.|$|E

6000|$|Britt persisted. [...] "I {{was merely}} {{going to say}} that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> basis for all this humbuggery. These mediums don't start from nothing. They nearly all begin with some abnormality. Some {{submerged}} power rises to the surface of their minds like a sea-serpent, and that distinguishes them as seers. Curious friends crowd around, then the lying begins. It's going to be worth while to take the subject up, by-and-by. I'd do it myself if I could live in New York City." [...] He rose. [...] "Well, I don't blame you for not going into this case--I wish I were clear of it myself--but I was hoping you'd had some experience that would help me."

I think that the experiment might have been far better tried in the Orange River Colony. It is quite true that in that Colony there is an enormous majority of the Dutch or Boer population. But they have shown by long experience that they are most capable and moderate administrators--under the admirable rule of President Brand they set an example to the whole of South Africa; and although <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> danger in this experiment, it is in the Orange River Colony that I myself would have been inclined, in the first instance, to take the risk." ...|$|E
60|$|Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels {{from between}} all the {{domestic}} breeds of pigeons are perfectly fertile. I can state this {{from my own}} observations, purposely made on the most distinct breeds. Now, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two animals CLEARLY DISTINCT being themselves perfectly fertile. Some authors believe that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility: {{from the history of}} the dog <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> probability in this hypothesis, if applied to species closely related together, though it is unsupported by a single experiment. But to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers, pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, inter se, seems to me rash in the extreme.|$|E
6000|$|I {{get along}} with my papers for Scribner not fast, nor so far {{specially}} well; only this last, the fourth one (which makes a third part of my whole task), I do believe is pulled off after a fashion.

Pulvis et Umbra, I call it; I might have called it a Darwinian Sermon, if I had wanted. Its sentiments, although parsonic, will not offend even you, I believe. The other three papers, I fear, bear many traces of effort, and the ungenuine inspiration of an income at so much per essay, and the honest desire of the incomer to give good measure for his money.

6000|$|Dear Sir,--I {{intended}} to have written you long ere now, and, as I told you, I had gotten three stanzas {{on my way}} in a poetic epistle to you; but that old enemy of all good works, the Devil, threw me into a prosaic mire, and {{for the soul of}} me I cannot get out of it. I dare not write you a long letter, as I am going to intrude on your time with a long ballad. I have, as you will shortly see, finished [...] "The Kirk's Alarm;" [...] but now that it is done, and that I have laughed once or twice at the conceits in some of the stanzas, I am determined not to let it get into the public; so I send you this copy, the first that I have sent to Ayrshire, except some few of the stanzas, which I wrote off in embryo for Gavin Hamilton, under the express provision and request that you will only read it to a few of us, and do not on any account give, or permit to be taken, any copy of the ballad. If I could be of any service to Dr. M'Gill, I would do it, though it should be at a much greater expense than irritating a few bigoted priests, but I am afraid serving him in his present embarras is a task too hard for me. I have enemies enow, God knows, though I do not wantonly add to the number. Still, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> merit in two or three of the thoughts, I send it to you as a small, but sincere testimony how much, and with what respectful esteem, I am, dear Sir, your obliged humble servant ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{the year}} 1888, {{part of which}} was spent by Stevenson at Saranac Lake in the Adirondacks he {{published}} one article every month in Scribner's Magazine. Pulvis et Umbra appeared in the April number, and was later included in the volume Across the Plains (1892). He wrote this particular essay with intense feeling. Writing to Sidney Colvin in December 1887, he said, [...] "I get along with my papers for Scribner not fast, nor so far specially well; only this last, the fourth one.... I do believe is pulled off after a fashion. It is a mere sermon: ... but it is true, and I find it touching and beneficial, to me at least; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> fine writing in it, some very apt and pregnant phrases. Pulvis et Umbra, I call it; I might have called it a Darwinian Sermon, if I had wanted. Its sentiments, although parsonic, will not offend even you, I believe." [...] (Letters, II, 100.) Writing to Miss Adelaide Boodle in April 1888, he said, [...] "I wrote a paper the other day--Pulvis et Umbra;--I wrote it with great feeling and conviction: to me it seemed bracing and healthful, it is in such a world (so seen by me), that I am very glad to fight out my battle, and see some fine sunsets, and hear some excellent jests between whiles round the camp fire. But I find that to some people this vision of mine is a nightmare, and extinguishes all ground of faith in God or pleasure in man. Truth I think not so much of; for I do not know it. And I could wish {{in my heart that}} I had not published this paper, if it troubles folk too much: all have not the same digestion nor the same sight of things.... Well, I cannot take back what I have said; but yet I may add this. If my view be everything but the nonsense that it may be--to me it seems self-evident and blinding truth--surely of all things it makes this world holier. There is nothing in it but the moral side--but the great battle and the breathing times with their refreshments. I see no more and no less. And if you look again, it is not ugly, and it is filled with promise." [...] (Letters, II, 123.) The words Pulvis et Umbra mean literally [...] "dust and shadow": the phrase, however, is quoted from Horace [...] "pulvis et umbra sumus"--we are dust and ashes. It forms the text of one of Stevenson's familiar discourses on Death, like Aes Triplex.|$|E
6000|$|I {{begin to}} ask myself, Do I feel any {{symptoms}} of getting better from the climate?--which is delicious,--and I cannot reply {{with the least}} consciousness of certainty; I cannot in reason expect it should be otherwise: the failure of my limbs has been gradual, and it cannot be expected that an infirmity which at least a year's bad weather gradually brought on should diminish before a few mild and serene days, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> change to the better; I certainly write easier and my spirits are better. The officers compliment me on this, and I think justly. The difficulty will be to abstain from working hard, but we will try. I wrote to Mr. Cadell to-day, and will send my letter ashore {{to be put into}} Gibraltar with the officer who leaves us at that garrison. In the evening we saw the celebrated fortress, which we had heard of all our lives, and which there is no possibility of describing well in words, though the idea I had formed of it from prints, panoramas, and so forth, proved not very inaccurate. Gibraltar, then, is a peninsula having a tremendous precipice on the Spanish side--that is, upon the north, where it is united to the mainland by a low slip of land called the neutral ground. The fortifications which rise on the rock are innumerable, and support each other in a manner accounted a model of modern art; the northern face of the rock itself is hewn into tremendous subterranean batteries called the hall of Saint George, and so forth, mounted with guns of a large calibre. But I have heard {{it would be difficult to}} use them, from the effect of the report on the artillerymen. The west side of the fortress is not so precipitous as the north, and it is on this it has been usually assailed. It bristles with guns and batteries, and has at its northern extremity the town of Gibraltar, which seems from the sea a thriving place, and from thence declines gradually to Cape Europa, where there is a great number of remains of old caverns and towers, formerly the habitation or refuge of the Moors. At a distance, and curving into a bay, lie Algeciras, and the little Spanish town of Saint Roque, where the Spanish lines were planted during the siege.[485] From Europa Point the eastern frontier of Gibraltar runs pretty close to the sea, and arises in a perpendicular face, and it is called the back of the rock. No thought could be entertained of attacking it, although every means were used to make the assault as general as possible. The efforts sustained by such extraordinary means as the floating batteries were entirely directed against the defences on the west side, which, if they could have been continued for a few days with the same fury with which they commenced, must have worn out the force of the garrison. The assault had continued for several hours without success on either side, when a private man of the artillery, his eye on the floating batteries, suddenly called with ecstasy, [...] "She burns, by G----!";[486] and first that vessel and then others were visibly discovered to be on fire, and the besiegers' game was decidedly up.|$|E

5000|$|The {{deportation}} {{policy which}} I have just mentioned relates to evacuees {{who came to}} Australia during the war. This Chinese {{is said to have}} been here for twenty years, and obviously, therefore, is not a wartime evacuee. Speaking generally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> claim for him to be regarded as a resident of Australia, and I have no doubt his certificate can be extended from time to time as it has been extended in the past. An error may have been made in his case. The gentleman's name is Wong. There are many Wongs in the Chinese community, but I have to say — and I am sure that the Honourable Member for Balaclava will not mind me doing so — that [...] "two Wongs do not make a White".|$|E
40|$|I {{would like}} {{to follow up on}} the last {{sentence}} of the excellent presentation by Joel Cohen. It is indeed true that the lag between new methodological developments and their actual implementation by statistical agencies is regrettably long, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> hope that the speed of applying innovations has been accelerating over this century. This is the case in many other areas, and it would be surprising if it were not the case in the field of population forecasting. I would assess with a probability of well above 90 percent {{that by the end of}} this century, institutional procedures for projecting population will include probabilistic elements. In the following, I {{would like to}} mention three additional aspects complementing the important remarks made by Cohen. NEW METHODS Actually, things are evolving rapidly with respect to the application of new forecasting methods. A recent issue of the international scientific journal Nature features an article, “The End of World Population Growth, ” that presents a new method of probabilistic population projections (Lutz, Sanderson, and Scherbov 2001). This method represents a possible synthesis of several competing approaches to dealing with the issue of uncertainty in future population trends. I will quickly describe the alternative methods and present some results from the synthesis approach that underlies the Nature article...|$|E
40|$|The {{discussion}} of strategic alliances {{in this setting}} {{at this time in}} the cattle numbers and price cycle is extremely appropriate. I am honored to have been selected to speak for commercial producers regarding what we expect of strategic alliances. While some may have a fairly concise, narrowly defined idea of what a strategic alliance is, I would prefer a less structured view. A strategic alliance could be any long-term win/win relationship between two or more independent businesses. When this happens the businesses become inter-dependent. This makes the quality and structure of the alliance very important to all parties. A strategic alliance for the purpose of producing, adding value to and marketing cattle or beef represents a huge investment of time, negotiation, emotion and money. Such investment requires long term benefit and commitment. To make such a commitment a commercial cattle producer is going to want reasonable assurance that certain expectations will be met. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> danger that in ten years or so, when the next down-turn in the price cycle comes, it may be difficult for those not involved in alliances to sell feeder cattle. I hope a sense of this kind of future market place doesn 2 ̆ 7 t cause us to rush into alliances without insuring that most of our expectations will be met...|$|E

40|$|It is {{that time}} of year again: Time to trade in beach bags for backpacks and ride-all-day passes for student ids.

Perhaps that is just so that I can bear buying pencils and preparing binders, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> truth to it. For all of the freshmen just getting started, this is your chance to build a strong foundation {{for the rest of your}} studies, and this is also time to enjoy Pitt. Many new friends and discoveries about your path in college await you. Oh, and appreciate those intro or general courses because trust me, it does not get any easier. For all of my fellow seniors, we must do our best to fend off senioritis so that we take advantage of this: our last chance to dodge the real world and focus on bettering ourselves. Also, take this time to enjoy the friends and memories you have made here. I know I will. Of course, I have not forgotten about the juniors and sophomores. For you, this is another chance to shine. Give your best effort this year because along the lines of what someone once told me, the contrary may be true, but I have never regretted doing my best. So, I guess this really is a chance for all of us … a chance to have a great semester. In addition to these thoughts, I would like to offer all of you an invitation to join us in the ACS student affiliate...|$|E
