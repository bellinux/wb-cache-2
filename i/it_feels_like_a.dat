In October 2007, Fox Atomic pre-emptively purchased {{the rights to}} Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, {{who at the time}} oversaw Fox Searchlight and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film Juno. Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight. Reitman commented, [...] "We want to make unusual films, and anything that turns a genre on its ear interests Dan and I." [...] Karyn Kusama was announced as director in January 2008. Kusama said she signed on to the project because of the script. [...] "I was blessed to read this script at a moment where the producers were meeting with directors and it just knocked me out.

500|$|The {{critical}} reception to {{the album}} was generally favourable. Based on 40 reviews, review aggregate website Metacritic reported a rating of 78 out of 100. There were mixed comments about the ballads; two reviewers noted a disparity between {{the energy of the}} ballads to different songs. Drowned in Sound commented that, [...] "ballads remain a strong suit, particularly the easy grace of the title track, {{but more often than not}} sit awkwardly next to the more toothsome numbers and feel under-produced by comparison" [...] with similar comments from AllMusic who said, [...] "Made in the Darks main weakness might be its ballads, but that may just be in comparison to its many energetic moments, which are so addictive that <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> forced come-down whenever the band slows things down." [...] However, The Observer gave a positive evaluation of the ballads; [...] "Hot Chip have had a happy way with a subliminal power ballad. And Made in the Dark can boast four of the best." [...] Pitchfork rated the album as 7/10 with a mixed review, describing it as a [...] "patchy, turbulent record" [...] due to the use of many different individual components and also said that it was a [...] "good record but not a great one".

Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house for as long as I have been alive.

[...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people.

On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches.

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode 5/10, noting [...] "Overall, this episode {{attempted}} to make a mundane murder case interesting by forcing the agents to interact with an 'alien' culture. Unfortunately, {{the structure of the}} episode gave the audience answers long before the agents discovered them, making the bulk of the episode an exercise. By not taking the theme far enough or deepening the mystery, the writers ultimately fail to reach their goals." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the entry a C+ and wrote that the episode [...] "was also fairly bold for its time, providing a whole subplot that's mostly told through subtitles [...] <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> series of shocks that are strung together along a pretty standard story setup." [...] Ultimately, VanDerWerff concluded that, [...] "the major problem with 'Hell Money' is that it feels, at times, like a backdoor pilot for a new series starring B.D. Wong as corrupt detective Glen Chao." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She critiqued the fact that the episode lacked a paranormal mystery, noting that the theme of the episode [...] "would fit nicely into any other police drama". Vitaris described the [...] "three actors in the black suits and ghost masks" [...] as [...] "not very convincing." ...|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} legacy {{aspects of the}} film for Scorsese and {{compared}} Scorsese to such established directors as Ingmar Bergman. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said, [...] "The movie's being promoted as the third in the director's unofficial trilogy of faith, after The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Kundun (1997), and <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> self-conscious masterpiece, a summing-up from a filmmaker who, at 74, may be thinking of his legacy." [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out London gave the film five stars out of five, saying, [...] "Scorsese has hit the rare heights of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even the strongest in tatters, compromised and broken." [...] Emma Green of The Atlantic gave the film high praise, stating, [...] "This is what makes Scorsese's film so radical and so unlike many movies about religion: It's actually art." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film five stars out of five, stating, [...] "Scorsese's brutal spiritual epic will scald, and succor, your soul." [...] Collin further added, [...] "It's {{the kind of work}} a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime's accrued expertise behind him". Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 stars and a half out of four, stating, [...] "With the religious historical drama Silence, Martin Scorsese proves he’s as masterful a filmmaker with men of God as he is with gangsters." [...] Truitt also argued that the film [...] "marks one of the deeper and most thoughtful projects in Scorsese’s career." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for USA Today, Brian Mansfield complimented {{the optimistic}} and [...] "self-assured" [...] {{nature of the}} song, adding that [...] "it's the sort of {{determined}} dance anthem Madonna does so well". The Dallas Morning News Hunter Hauk described the song as a [...] "solid melding" [...] of different club musics and appreciated the dance break, and Madonna's singing attitude, calling it [...] "less prickly or defiant than we see on Instagram these days". Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News compared [...] "Living for Love" [...] to earlier club anthems, songs which had become commercial success for Madonna. Writing for i-D, Nick Levine described the song as a [...] "perfectly-pitched comeback single: rather than returning with a cheap EDM banger... When she sings 'I picked up my crown, {{put it back on}} my head', <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> statement of intent." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy listed it {{as one of the top}} ten tracks of the week, adding that the composition made it [...] "an euphoric first cut from... Rebel Heart". Jed Gottlieb from Boston Herald described the track's beats as contemporary, while found the chorus and the hooks to be reminiscent of [...] "old school" [...] Top 40 songs. [...] "True Blue fans will hear a joy and nostalgia in [...] ". Jon Pareles from The New York Times commended [...] "Living for Love"'s ability to transform [...] "the breakup emotions into an uplifting redemption".

His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I.

Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months.
