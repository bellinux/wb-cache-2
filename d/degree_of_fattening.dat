40|$|Crabs of {{the genus}} Uca Leach, 1814 are widely {{distributed}} along the Brazilian coast and play an important ecological role in the estuarine ecosystem in soil bioturbation, nutrient cycling and by serving as a food source for other organisms. This study analyzed the relationship of wet weight/carapace width and the temporal dynamics of the condition factor of the crab Uca mordax (Smith, 1870). The crabs were sampled manually {{on the bank of}} the Igaraçu River (02 ° 53 ’ 58 ”S; 41 ° 46 ’ 49 ”W) from September 2009 to June 2011, in the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 602 crabs (449 males and 153 females) were analyzed. The carapace width (CW) and the wet weight (WW) were determined for each individual. The biometric data obtained were submitted to a regression analysis using the power equation (y=axb). The CW/WW relationship for males was expressed by the equation WW= 0. 00011 CW 3. 441, and for females by WW= WW = 0. 00018 CW 3. 211. The condition factor was determined for each month and compared between the sexes. The females showed a 1. 6 higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> than the males. In the rainy season the females showed an isometric increase in weight, while the other relationships (males during the dry and rainy seasons and females in the dry season) showed a positive allometric increase. There was no significant difference in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> between males and females...|$|E

After controlling for {{time of day}} and overall body size, annual variation in body weight was small and generally not statistically significant. However, analysis revealed evidence of significant "winter fattening," comparable in magnitude to other temperate-zone resident species, {{in three of the}} species. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>fattening</b> did not correlate with either the size of the acorn crop (for the Acorn Woodpecker) or latitude, two variables potentially related to predictability of food resources. However, the smaller species exhibited significantly greater winter fattening than the larger species, as predicted by the hypothesis that energy storage should be more important for small-bodied species. Furthermore, the food-storing Acorn Woodpecker exhibited considerably less winter fattening than the nonfood-storing species, supporting the hypothesis that food storage provides an ecological alternative to winter fattening...|$|R

40|$|Cattle {{breeding}} {{is one of}} {{the part}} of traditional Czech agriculture. It is a vital part of economy consisting of two main branches - milk and beef production. Beef {{is one of the}} main products of cattle breeding sometimes provided by <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> heifers, cows and bulls. Producing meat with the highest quality with low costs is the main goal <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> the cattles. I have tested the influence of selected fators on the fattening capacity and carcass values of Czech Fleckvieh bulls in the control station as well as the economic requirements <b>of</b> the <b>fattening</b> period.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to compare productivity traits of two pig genotypes fattened in two different ways, on deep litter and in a conventional way (flat deck), and to determine whether there was microclimatic influence on the productivity traits <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs. The research was carried out on 57 <b>fattening</b> pigs <b>of</b> both sex, divided into two groups by their housing. Each group consisted of pigs of two genotypes, i. e. three-way crossbreeds of Large White and German Landrace (LW x GL) in the dam line, and of German Landrace and 8 Pietrain (P) in the sire line. Pigs were fed ad libitum with isocaloric and isoprotein diets. During the whole experiment, temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and the content of NH 3 and CO 2 were measured in pens. No statistically significant differences were recorded with respect to temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and content of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) in the air in pens with deep litter and without it (P> 0. 05). Pigs housed without deep litter had statistically highly significant (P< 0. 01) higher final weights than pigs kept on deep litter. Pigs crossed with Pietrain as a terminal breed, kept in pens without deep litter, had statistically significantly higher (P< 0. 05) average daily gains than pigs of the same genotype kept on deep litter. In the finishing phase <b>of</b> <b>fattening,</b> group <b>of</b> pigs being kept in pens without deep litter had statistically higher average daily gains than pigs kept on deep litter (P< 0. 05). The way <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> had statistically highly significant (P< 0. 001) influence on live weight of pigs in the first, second and fourth fattening phase.

Bulls were five months old when the research commenced and they were eleven months old when the reserch was terminated. All body dimensions were measured by Litin stick except for breast circuit, metacarpus circuit and body weight. Bulls were tied and remained at the same place during their fattening period staying in ordinary cow-shed made of brick. All height measures increased at the relatively equal pace during the fattening period. Withers height increased most and back height increased the least. Tenderness of the back appeared to be most prominent at the end <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> period. Concerning length dimensions, body length developed quickest, head length slowest. As far as body width of bulls is considered the fastest growth was recorded concerning pelvis breadth; head front breadth increased the least. Breast depth was most notable at the point of bulls entering the category of very good condition during their fattening process. Brest circuit increase, as well as metacarups circuit and body weighat increase, were considerably quicker during the period of bulls going from medium condition category to good condition category then from the middle to the end <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> period. Breathing and body temperature remainer almost the same during the fattening period and the process <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> itself did not influence them. Blood sedimentation of bulls remained approximately the same during periods of medium and good condition state. Blood sedimentation increased constantly after bulls reacshed very good condition state, that is, it increased due to intensive feeding and richer accumulation of fat tissue of simenthaler bulls...|$|R

The steer model is a 4 -level hierarchical Markov process with decisions defined at three levels. Decisions taken in the model include grazing strategy (permanent or ryegrass/clover pasture), feed level in winter (high and low), time for beginning <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> (age 19 - 27 months) and time of slaughter (age 19 - 30 months). Overall optimal strategies at child level 1 with regard to economic output per produced steer were low feeding {{level in the}} winter period, grazing on permanent pastures in the first grazing season, whereas ryegrass/clover pastures gives the optimal net return per steer in the second and third grazing season.

The results of the conducted research show that the decision on buying mercantile maize mainly contributes to improving competitiveness of family farms directed at the final production <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> beef cattle compared with the decision on buying alfalfa hay.

Average value of K for wild BFT was 1. 59 and respectively 2. 43, 2. 32, 2. 15, 1. 61, 1. 79 and 1. 90 for Fattened BFT after 5 - 6 months from 2005 to 2010. Length frequency <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> bluefin showed clearly {{a substantial increase in}} juvenile rate. The percentage which was 21. 4 % in 2005 reached 31. 3 % in 2009. For weight distribution, 73. 3 % of the fish caught in 2001 are below the annual mean (75. 7 kg), while means 71 to 72 % <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> fish were under annual mean weight. Year 2009 is exceptional because only 57 % <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> fish were under the mean weight. This demonstrates that the fish caught are becoming increasingly small. Mean weight for fattening period (77 to 124 kg) are obviously higher than those of the wild fish (75, 7 kg). This study showed an increment in the amount of specimen under first sexual maturity which will not have the chance to spawn...|$|R
