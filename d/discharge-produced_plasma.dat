40|$|An actinic EUV {{microscope}} for defect detection on mask blanks {{for operation}} in dark field using a table-top <b>discharge-produced</b> <b>plasma</b> source has been developed. Several test structures (pits and bumps) on multilayer mirrors were investigated by our Schwarzschild objective-based EUV microscope at 13. 5 -nm wavelength and then characterized with an atomic force microscope. Possible defect-detection limits with large {{field of view}} and moderate magnification are {{discussed in terms of}} required irradiation dose and system performance...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{fabrication}} of large arrays of nano-antennas using extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) illumination. A <b>discharge-produced</b> <b>plasma</b> source generating EUV radiation around 10. 88 nm wavelength {{is used for the}} illumination of a photoresist via a mask in a proximity printing setup. The method of metallic nanoantennas fabrication utilizes a bilayer photoresist and employs a lift-off process. The impact of Fresnel-diffraction of EUV light in the mask on a shape of the nanostructures has been investigated. It is shown how by the use of the same rectangular apertures in the transmission mask, antennas of various shapes can be fabricated. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, spectra of antennas reflectivity were measured and compared to FDTD simulations demonstrating good agreement...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} for <b>discharge-produced</b> <b>plasma</b> (DPP) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources {{based on the}} usage of two liquid metallic alloy jets as discharge electrodes has been proposed and tested. Discharge was ignited using laser ablation {{of one of the}} cathode jets. A system with two jet electrodes was tested at a repetition rate of 1 to 5 kHz with dissipated electrical power up to 20 kW. Radiating spectra, time characteristics, and conversion efficiency are similar to conventional DPP schemes with rotating wheels. In the first experiments, the Ga:Sn eutectic alloy, which is liquid at room temperature, was circulating in a closed loop. The high velocity of the jets (30 [*][*]m/s 30 [*][*]m/s) ensures a renewed electrode surface for every shot, for a repetition rate frequency of up to 30 to 50 kHz, and provides effective heat transportation from the discharge zone. Modeling and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to dissipate up to 200 kW of electrical power without overheating the nozzles and tin surface. It was found that the flexible electrode configuration allows the channeling of essential parts of debris plasma in directions opposite to the EUV collector...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic and spectroscopic {{properties}} of the interhalogens are reviewed, with emphasis on the iodine-monochloride (ICl) and iodine-monofluoride (IF) systems; the latter having produced 140 kW, 30 nsec FWHM pulses at 491 and 485 nm and may be scaled to the tens of millijoules per pulse level. Gain in excess of 1. 0 %/cm was observed across the entire IF blue-green band, demonstrating potentially wide tunability. Although ICl has not yet lased, its peak small-signal gain of 1. 3 %/cm and negligible background absorption in discharge plasmas make it an attractive candidate for a violet amplifier. The formation kinetics of IF- and ICl-excimer lasers in electron beam or <b>discharge-produced</b> <b>plasmas,</b> and the potential and limitations of these molecules as visible lasers or amplifiers are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Parallel to the {{development}} and optimization of high-power EUV sources for lithography, the realization of low-cost EUV sources for at-wavelength metrology is strongly required. These sources are important tools for the characterization of EUV mirrors and masks, for the determination of thin film transmission (EUV filters), for research on resist materials, and for the calibration of EUV detectors. Apart from the very expensive synchrotron facilities, EUV sources for metrology are presently based on laser- or <b>discharge-produced</b> <b>plasmas.</b> Besides a complex setup and high running costs, these sources operate at a relatively low repetition rate, exhibit considerable temporal and spatial fluctuations, and always require techniques for debris mitigation. Usually it is overlooked that one can produce EUV radiation directly from solid targets avoiding all these plasma-related drawbacks. This {{can be done by}} using electron-induced characteristic emission from solids. The electron-based EUV source can be considered as an analog to a conventional x-ray tube [1]. Electron...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} range of extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV or EUV) {{is an active}} area of research incorporating many scientific fields such as microscopy, lithography or reflectometry. During the last decade, {{a lot of effort}} has been put into transferring many of the known techniques developed at linear accelerators into the laboratory using <b>discharge-produced</b> <b>plasmas</b> (DPPs) or laser-produced plasmas (LPPs) as an alternative light source. In particular, the semiconductor industry is in need of on-site tools in the shorter wavelength range for production and inspection of structured surfaces with nanometer resolution. Here traditional charge coupled device (CCD) image sensors are inapplicable as detectors because of the strong absorption of XUV by matter prohibiting any generation of electron-hole pairs inside a deep lying p-n junction. As a solution, two-dimensional backthinned CCDs are available in the market offering high sensitivity to XUV light. Although for many applications a one-dimensional line scanning image sensor would be sufficient, they are non-existent for XUV. It is only lately that manufacturers have started to adopt the principle of backthinning to CCD line sensors to enhance sensitivity in the long wavelength UV range (> 200 nm). Here we show that generally these compact sensors offer good quantum efficiencies in the XUV which make them a candidate for many spectroscopic applications and future industrial inline inspection tools for which costly two-dimensional CCDs are oversized. We have successfully implemented a compact sensor device into a laboratory XUV spectrometer and reflectometer. Our measurements compare the quantum efficiency of a state-of-the-art XUV array CCD to a phosphor-coated line sensor and a new backthinned line sensor. Additionally, we show recorded spectra from a laboratory DPP source to demonstrate the potential {{of a wide range of}} applications...|$|R
40|$|The Intel {{lithography}} roadmap {{calls for}} Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) {{to be used}} for the 32 nm node. With the installation of the EUV Micro-Exposure Tool (MET) complete, Intel now has the world’s first integrated EUVL process line including the first commercial EUV exposure tool. This process line will be used to develop the EUV technology, including mask and resist, and to investigate issues such as defect printability. It also provides a test-bed to discover and resolve problems associated with using this novel technology in a fab (not lab) environment. Over 22, 000 fields have been exposed, the <b>discharge-produced</b> <b>plasma</b> light source has operated for 50, 000, 000 pulses, 8 masks have been fabricated, and 8 resists have been characterized. The MET combines high resolution capability with Intel’s advanced processing facilities to prepare EUVL for high-volume manufacturing (HVM). In this paper we review the MET installation and facilities, novel capabilities of the linked track, data on optics quality and modeled tool capability, and the MET mask fabrication process. We present data on tool performance including printing 45 nm pitch lines with 160 nm depth of focus and 27 nm isolated lines. We show tool accuracy and repeatability data, and discuss issues uncovered during installation and use...|$|E
40|$|High-throughput and -resolution actinic mask {{inspection}} {{tools are}} needed as EUVL begins {{to enter into}} volume production phase. To realize such inspection tools, a high-radiance EUV source is necessary. Ushio’s laser-assisted <b>discharge-produced</b> <b>plasma</b> (LDP) source is able to meet industry’s requirements in radiance, cleanliness, stability and reliability. Ushio’s LDP source has shown the peak radiance at plasma of 180 W/mm 2 /sr and the area-averaged radiance in a 200 -μm-diameter circle behind the debris mitigation system of 120 W/mm 2 /sr. A {{new version of the}} debris mitigation system is in testing phase. Its optical transmission was confirmed to be 73 %, which is 4 % lower than that of the previous version and therefore will be improved. Cleanliness of the system is evaluated by exposing Ru mirrors placed behind the debris mitigation system. Ru sputter rate was proven to be sufficiently low as 3 ~ 5 nm/Gpulse at 7 kHz, whereas frequency-dependent sputter rate was 1 ~ 3 nm/Gpulse at 5 ~ 9 kHz as previously reported. Sn deposition remained very low (< 0. 05 nm) and did not grow over time. A new technique to suppress debris was tested and preliminary results were promising. Time-of-flight signal of fast ions was completely suppressed and Ru sputter rate of exposed mirrors at 3 kHz was approximately 1. 3 nm/Gpulse, whereas the conventional mitigation system (new version) resulted in Ru sputter rate of 0. 7 nm/Gpulse. This new technique also allows increasing the radiance efficiency by 30 %. Stability tests were done at several different discharge frequencies. Pulse energy stability was approximately 10 %. Dose energy stability dropped from approximately 2 % to 0. 1 % when feedback control was activated. EUV emission position stability was studied at 3 kHz. Deviation of the plasma center of gravity was 6 μm, which is 3 % of plasma diameter and therefore considered to be negligible. Reliability tests were performed on both R and D and prototype machines and up to 200 hours of non-interrupted operation was demonstrated...|$|E
