40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comThe validity of the species category (rank) as a distinct level of biological organization has been questioned. Phenetic, cohesion and monophyletic species concepts <b>do</b> not <b>delimit</b> species-level taxa that are qualitatively distinct from lower or higher taxa: all organisms throughout {{the tree of life}} exhibit varying degrees of similarity, cohesion, and monophyly. In contrast, interbreeding concepts delimit species-level taxa characterized by a phenomenon (regular gene flow) not found in higher taxa, making the species category a distinct level of biological organization. Only interbreeding concepts delimit species-level taxa that are all comparable according to a biologically meaningful criterion and qualitatively distinct from entities assigned to other taxonomic categories. Consistent application of interbreeding concepts can result in counterintuitive taxonomies – e. g. many wide polytypic species in plants and narrow cryptic species in animals. However, far from being problematic, such differences are biologically illuminating – reflecting differing barriers to gene flow in different clades. Empirical problems with interbreeding concepts exist, but many of these also apply to other species concepts, whereas others are not as severe as some have argued. A monistic view of species using interbreeding concepts will encounter strong historical inertia, but can save the species category from redundancy with other categories, and thus justify continued recognition of the species category...|$|R

Species are thus expected to show some degree of incongruence among characters; therefore, taxonomic delimitation can benefit from integrative approaches and objec-tive strategies that account for character conflict.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the real}} {{tendency}} in handwriting recognition is oriented towards the analytical approach. For such orientation the letter model learning quality is primordial. Consequently, {{it is needed}} to reduce the human intervention in this processing phase in order to limit the initial bias. Currently, the analytical approaches are divided into two categories depending on the use or not of the segmentation process. The machine power allows them to run the second category of problems. The advantage of working without rather than with segmentation {{is that it allows}} the model to optimally determine the letter position information. The problem posed by this approach has been outlined by Sayre: “to learn letters, it is needed to localize them, and to localize letters it is needed to have learned them”. Additionally, the reading psychology instructs that the reading is operated at the word level: hence, the human <b>does</b> not <b>delimit</b> explicitly the letters. To properly model the writing it is necessary to perform the learning at the word level. Based on this principle, we have studied a learning approach allowing to extract the letter information without segmentation and optimising the learning at the word level.

This approach has been experimented on bank check legal amounts, leading to 84 % for an industrial database.

Prompted by these data and our previous findings of a genetic variation {{in the development of}} TD symptoms, we extended our studies to mice. C 57 BL/ 6, ApoE knockout, and APP YAC transgenic mice received thiamine-deficient diet and pyrithiamine injections. Unlike rats, APP/APLP 2 -immunoreactive neurites in all strains of mice were sparsely scattered within damaged areas and <b>did</b> not <b>delimit</b> the thalamic lesion. In addition, abnormal clusters of intensely immunoreactive neurites occurred only in areas of damage including the thalamus, mammillary body, and inferior colliculus.

For example, we both appear to be allergic to orthodoxy, i. e. gate-keeping that does not let in all “legitimate traders” [4] 1.

And, I assume, we are both committed to contributing towards understandings of professional philosophy that counter this proclivity. 2 There are, however, points where Priest and I part company and these points of divergence are significant. For example and, perhaps, most significantly, Priest and I disagree on how our respective positions impose limitations on actual philosophical engagement. Where Priest’s article, “What is Philosophy?”, is specifically concerned with offering an account of philosophical engagement, my article, “How is this Paper Philosophy?”, is concerned with values that orient the institutionalization of philosophical engagement. There is a fundamental difference between having one’s analysis target the institutionalization of philosophical practice versus philosophical practice as such, a difference Priest acknowledges early in his reply [1].

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Internet and intranets, {{substantial}} interest is being shown in Asian language information retrieval; especially in Chinese, which {{is a good example of}} an Asian ideographic language (other examples include Japanese and Korean). Since, in this type of language, spaces <b>do</b> not <b>delimit</b> words, an important issue is which index terms should be extracted from documents. This issue also has wider implications for indexing other languages such as agglutinating languages (e. g., Finnish and Turkish), archaic ideographic languages like Egyptian hieroglyphs, and other types of information such as data stored in genomic databases. Although comparisons of indexing strategies for Chinese documents have been made, almost all of them are based on a single retrieval model. This article compares the performance of various combinations of indexing strategies (i. e., character, word, short-word, bigram, and Pircs indexing) and retrieval models (i. e., vector space, 2 -Poisson, logistic regression, and Pircs models). We determine which model (and its parameters) achieves the (near) best retrieval effectiveness without relevance feedback, and compare it with the open evaluations (i. e., TREC and NTCIR) for both long and title queries. In addition, we describe a more extensive investigation of retrieval efficiency. In particular, the storage cost of word indexing is only slightly more than character indexing, and bigram indexing is about double the storage cost of other indexing strategies. The retrieval time typically varies linearly with the number of unique terms in the query, which is supported by correlation values above 90 %. The Pircs retrieval system achieves robust and good retrieval performance, but it appears to be the slowest method, whereas vector space models were not very effective in retrieval, but were able to respond quickly. For robust, near-best retrieval effectiveness, without considering storage overhead, the 2 -Poisson model using bigram indexing appears to be a good compromise between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency for both long and title queries.

Cultural traits are also the primitive of mathematical models of cultural transmission inspired by population genetics, imported and refined by economics. Any serious evaluation of the notion of “cultural trait”, however, requires the interrogation of many disciplines, from cultural anthropology to linguistics, from psychology to archaeology to musicology. The very possibility of assuming the existence of cultural traits is not granted. In order to start a wide interdisciplinary confrontation, we need a sufficiently loose definition of a cultural trait as any trait whose production in individuals depends, to some extent, on social learning; and we need a deflationary interpretive horizon where cultural traits are not expected to provide an exhaustive theory of culture and cultural change.

The working {{relationships}} {{based on the}} individual labour contract have an unprecedented aspect in civil law, namely, inequity of parts during {{the performance of the}} contract. This inequity is transposed in theoretical and applicative plan by the existence of the subordination report between the employer and employee.
