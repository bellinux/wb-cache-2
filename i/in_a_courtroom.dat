5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom</b> {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new {{gameplay}} elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5|$|The episode starts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom</b> where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of {{bringing}} devastation upon Springfield {{because of her}} selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E

25|$|South Carolina {{no longer}} {{requires}} attorneys to be licensed separately to plead <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom.</b> Additionally, some state appellate courts require attorneys {{to obtain a}} separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practise before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted {{as a matter of}} course to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located. Some federal courts will grant admission to any attorney licensed in any U.S. jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|If Plato's {{important}} dialogues do {{not refer}} to Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or themes that {{play a part in}} it. Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the Theaetetus (210d) and the Euthyphro (2a–b) Socrates tells people that he is about to face corruption charges. In the Meno (94e–95a), {{one of the men who}} brings legal charges against Socrates, Anytus, warns him about the trouble he may get into if he does not stop criticizing important people. In the Gorgias, Socrates says that his trial will be like a doctor prosecuted by a cook who asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and the cook's tasty treats (521e–522a). In the Republic (7.517e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man (presumably himself) will stumble <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom</b> situation. The Apology is Socrates' defense speech, and the Crito and Phaedo take place in prison after the conviction. In the Protagoras, Socrates is a guest at the home of Callias, son of Hipponicus, a man whom Socrates disparages in the Apology as having wasted a great amount of money on sophists' fees.|$|E

500|$|Night of January 16th is a {{theatrical}} play by Russian-American author Ayn Rand, {{inspired by the}} death of the [...] "Match King", Ivar Kreuger. Set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom</b> during a murder trial, an unusual feature of the play is that members of the audience are chosen to play the jury. The court hears the case of Karen Andre, a former secretary and lover of businessman Bjorn Faulkner, of whose murder she is accused. The play does not directly portray the events leading to Faulkner's death; instead the jury must rely on character testimony to decide whether Andre is guilty. The play's ending depends on the verdict. Rand's intention was to dramatize a conflict between individualism and conformity, with the jury's verdict revealing which viewpoint they preferred.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Jimmy Carter is {{referred}} to as [...] "history's greatest monster".

He correctly notes that the 40,000th digit is the number one. The episode's writers prepared for this scene by asking David H. Bailey of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (now at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) for the number of the 40,000th decimal place of pi. Bailey sent them back a printout of the first 40,000 digits.|$|E

500|$|Firearm {{examiners}} {{have attempted}} to determine the shooter's position by the location of spent bullet casings. The use of ejection pattern studies were originally part of incident reconstruction and methods for determining shooter location continue to be explained in major crime scene examination books. [...] However, the validity of ejection pattern analysis has been brought into question by multiple studies that look at the reproducibility and end determination of shooter position by qualified examiners. Studies have shown that over 25% of spent casings land somewhere other than {{to the right and}} rear of the shooter. This is the most commonly accepted location for where spent cartridge casings should fall, and the large percentage of casings that end up somewhere else raises concerns for the validity of the examination technique. Investigators should only present a location gained from an ejection pattern study as a tentative estimate when using the information <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom</b> setting.|$|E

[...] The New York Times Book Review was critical of Godwin's writing style in the book, and observed, [...] "He writes in a strong, piercing voice that probably does wonders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom,</b> but comes off increasingly shrill over several hundred pages of commentary, and at one point fairly warns his reader, 'Subtlety isn't my strong point.'" [...] The Journal of Information Ethics wrote, [...] "This is less an analytic study than a personal survey of situations or occurrences articulated in an informal, colloquial, and anecdotal fashion. It is not aimed at the intelligentsia or legal profession, although members of these groups would certainly benefit from the details."

500|$|Chris Morran of Consumerist said Philip Morris did a [...] "really {{poor job}} of trying to defend its actions". He wrote, [...] "... this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic {{non-response}} in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth." [...] He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: [...] " [...] {{to be taken seriously}} when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'". Furthermore, Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it [...] " [...] and [...] with thousands of regulations worldwide", writing: ... the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom.</b> Once it loses a battle — or realizes a battle can't be won — then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.|$|E

500|$|According to Lupton, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] is Angelou's {{most famous}} poem. Lupton {{has argued that}} [...] "Angelou's {{ultimate}} greatness will be attributed" [...] to the poem, and that Angelou's [...] "theatrical" [...] performance of it, using skills she learned as an actor and speaker, marked {{a return to the}} African-American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. British reporter Kate Kellaway compared Angelou's appearance as she read the poem at Clinton's inauguration with the eight-year-old child in Caged Bird, noting that the coats she wore in both occasions were similar: [...] "She looked magnificent, sternly theatrical with an unsmiling bow mouth. She wore a coat with brass buttons, a strange reminder of the eight-year-old Maya Angelou who stood <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom,</b> terrified {{at the sight of the}} man who had raped her". Gillespie stated regarding Kellaway's observations: [...] "But standing tall on the steps of the Capitol, she was light-years removed from that terrible time, and America was no longer an 'unfriendly place.' Her poem 'On the Pulse of Morning' was a soaring call for peace, justice, and harmony. Capturing the hope embodied in the human spirit, it was a solemn and joyful reminder that all things are possible. She wished us 'Good morning' in her poem, and one felt as if a new day was truly dawning." ...|$|E

A caption wishes the viewers a happy April Fools' Day. The drama itself opens <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>courtroom</b> in Canada, with Terrance on trial for the murder of a local doctor; Phillip is his lawyer while Terrance and Phillip's sworn nemesis, Scott, who has had a long hatred of the duo's toilet humour, is acting as the prosecutor. Scott uses a group of seemingly airtight exhibits to prove Terrance's guilt, while Terrance's defense consists of nothing but a long string of fart jokes. Ultimately, the jury returns a verdict of not guilty. Angered, Scott promises vengeance. He is ultimately approached by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, proposing a deal: Saddam would assist in getting Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, in exchange for Scott assisting Saddam and his Iraqi associates into Canada. Scott is apprehensive about trusting Saddam, but agrees to the deal. The pair then conspires to kidnap Sally, daughter of Terrance and Celine Dion, and hold her hostage, as bait to lure Terrance and Phillip to Tehran; Saddam's soldiers would then murder Terrance and Phillip on arrival.|$|E

2500|$|In {{return for}} {{becoming}} retainers, the gentry {{would expect to}} rely on their lord's influence in local and national politics. This practice was known as [...] "maintenance".
