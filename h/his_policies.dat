5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter <b>his</b> <b>policies.</b> Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and the introduction of <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream {{organizations}} of ethnic minorities similarly expressed {{their support for}} <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> of ethnic tolerance, though he was criticized by, {{in addition to the}} Polish communists, the Jewish Labour Bund, and Ukrainian, German and Lithuanian extremists.|$|E
5|$|As Chief Minister, Modi favoured {{privatisation}} {{and small}} government, {{which was at}} odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. <b>His</b> <b>policies</b> during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth 6.6trillion were signed.|$|E

5|$|For a time, Duyệt's {{attitude}} and stature {{in the south}} forced Minh Mạng to moderate <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> and allow the preaching of Christian missionaries. However, it also increased {{the tension between the}} pair and Minh Mạng was anxious to curtail the autonomy that his father had granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began to slowly wind back their military powers, in an attempt to wear down Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> {{led to the}} GTP's {{collapse}} in 1919. The company was placed in receivership, and the government seized GTR's stock. It was later alleged that Hays had deceived the company's London directors in 1903 by committing them to conditions in the railway's agreements with the Canadian government for {{the building of the}} GTP that they did not agree to. That scheme was blamed for the company's collapse.|$|E
5|$|In an editorial, the Lyttelton Times welcomed Sewell's {{intention}} of representing the electorate again, but criticised {{him for the}} briefness of his statement. The newspaper's expectation was that Sewell should publicly state what <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> were, and not just rely on his past representation in Parliament. On 7 January 1860, Sewell placed an advertisement in the Lyttelton Times, inviting electors to {{a meeting at the}} Mechanics' Institute next to the Christchurch Town Hall on Friday, 13 January.|$|E

500|$|In his valedictory Farewell Address, {{in which}} Washington {{announced}} {{his decision to}} step down from the presidency (due in part to his increasing weariness with public life), he included a short passage defending <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of ignoring French requests for American assistance. In an attempt to keep his remarks apolitical, Washington defended <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> by framing it as generic guidance {{for the future and}} did not mention the French by name: ...|$|R
5|$|Lee's {{programs}} in Singapore {{had a profound}} effect on the Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.|$|E
5|$|Under him the Buyid kingdom flourished. <b>His</b> <b>policies</b> were liberal {{so there}} were no riots during his reign. He embellished Baghdad with {{numerous}} public buildings. He also built a famous public hospital known as the al-'Adudi Hospital. It was the largest hospital of that time, and was destroyed during the Mongol conquests. Many prominent figures worked at the hospital, such as 'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi and Ibn Marzuban.|$|E
5|$|After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous {{provision}} to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> reversed, {{and he is}} generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's hasty trial and execution as contrary {{to the principles of}} justice. The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, {{is the subject of a}} 2012 study.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Gandhi {{established}} an idealistic community called 'Tolstoy Farm' near Johannesburg, where he nurtured <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of peaceful resistance.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>policy</b> {{proposals}} included cheaper beer, better representation for {{fathers in}} the family court system and a referendum on bringing back the death penalty. Also amongst <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> proposals were prison reform and a move to save the British public house by reintroducing smoking via the use of efficient extraction systems as used within the European Parliament itself. While in favour of Muslim faith schools and same-sex marriage, he advocates banning the Burka.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2013, Fournier wrote {{a column}} about {{breaking}} ties with a White House official after a pattern of [...] "vulgarity, abusive language" [...] and [...] "veiled threat(s)", but did not identify the official due to <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> of granting blanket automatic anonymity to all his sources. [...] Fournier received some criticism from commentator Glenn Greenwald for behaving in a [...] "petulant" [...] manner and for <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> on anonymity for sources.|$|R
5|$|Chamberlain's {{reputation}} remains controversial among historians, {{with the}} initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as Guilty Men, published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in The Gathering Storm. Some recent historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and <b>his</b> <b>policies,</b> citing government papers released under the Thirty Year Rule and arguing that {{going to war with}} Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was not ready. Nevertheless, Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British Prime Ministers.|$|E
5|$|Duyệt's death {{opened the}} way for Minh Mạng to apply <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> in the south, as the viceroy's {{subordinates}} lacked the influence to defy the court. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyệt's followers’ political power by abolishing the post of viceroy and putting the south under his direct rule, thus making Duyệt the last holder of the post. Soon after Duyệt's death, Minh Mạng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyệt and his aides had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices.|$|E
5|$|Ernest was {{an active}} member of the House of Lords, where he {{maintained}} an extremely conservative voting record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet and had fathered a son by his sister, Princess Sophia. Before Victoria succeeded to the British throne, it was rumoured that Ernest intended to murder her and take the throne himself. When King William IV died on 20 June 1837, Ernest acceded to the Hanoverian throne. Becoming Hanover's first ruler to reside in the state since George I, he had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy when he dismissed the Göttingen Seven (including the two Brothers Grimm) from their professorial positions for agitating against <b>his</b> <b>policies.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>policies</b> {{and tactics}} {{highlighted}} {{and increased the}} separation between the king and his subjects. Andrianjaka transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom. He made a demonstration of royal power by appropriating the local tradition of sampy (talismans), previously created by village chiefs and others for personal or local spiritual ends, restricting their number to twelve and declaring their creation a strictly royal prerogative. The king also imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice, the trial by ordeal: Andrianjaka ordered that rather than administering tangena poison to an accused person's rooster to determine their innocence by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>policies</b> ran {{afoul of}} the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States {{government}} to have him overthrown. The US was also concerned {{by the presence of}} communists in the Guatemalan government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. Árbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended further into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an official apology for Árbenz's overthrow.|$|E
5|$|In 1547 Dudley {{was created}} Earl of Warwick and, with the Duke of Somerset, England's Lord Protector, {{distinguished}} {{himself in the}} renewed Scottish war at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. During the country-wide uprisings of 1549 Dudley put down Kett's Rebellion in Norfolk. Convinced of the Protector's incompetence, he and other privy councillors forced Somerset out of office in October 1549. Having averted a conservative reaction in religion and a plot to destroy him alongside Somerset, Dudley emerged in early 1550 as de facto regent for the 12-year-old EdwardVI. He reconciled himself with Somerset, who nevertheless soon began to intrigue against him and <b>his</b> <b>policies.</b> Somerset was executed on largely fabricated charges, three months after Dudley had been raised to the Dukedom of Northumberland in October 1551.|$|E

5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority of his colleagues, leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over <b>his</b> <b>policies.</b> On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E
5|$|In private, Thơ {{expressed}} his displeasure with Diệm's rule to U.S. officials. He complained of Diệm's reliance on Nhu {{in the running}} of the country, Nhu's attempt to run a police state through his secret Cần Lao apparatus and the lack of success against the Việt Cộng. During the McNamara Taylor mission to South Vietnam, Thơ confided his belief that the country was heading in the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Diệm to reform <b>his</b> <b>policies.</b> He privately revealed his belief that of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, fewer than thirty were functional.|$|E
5|$|Interior Secretary Carl Schurz {{carried out}} Hayes's American Indian policy, {{beginning}} with preventing the War Department from {{taking over the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hayes and Schurz carried out a policy that included assimilation into white culture, educational training, and dividing Indian land into individual household allotments. Hayes believed that <b>his</b> <b>policies</b> would lead to self-sufficiency and peace between Indians and whites. The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, including Schurz, but instead proved detrimental to American Indians. They lost much of their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators. Hayes and Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations.|$|E
40|$|Independent {{monetary}} and fiscal policymakers choose between two settings of their single policy variable and have preferences defined over the four resulting outcomes. With incomplete information about each other's preferences, maintaining one value for <b>his</b> <b>policy</b> variable provides credibility for the policymaker and <b>his</b> <b>policy.</b> The incentive {{for having a}} credible policy is that it provides the authority {{with the opportunity to}} attain <b>his</b> most preferred <b>policy</b> mix. However, when both pursue these benefits, the dynamically unstable policy mix occurs. Since neither wish this to continue, one authority always acquiesces to the wishes of the other...|$|R
