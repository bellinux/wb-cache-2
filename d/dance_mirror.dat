At all rungs of the cultural ladder, gender bias is prominent. 2. My Personal Experience Dance has been an integral part and ventricular parcel of my life since childhood. I began this endeavor {{at the tender age}} of three with Sri Kunhiraman and Srimathi Katherine Kunhiraman of Kalanjali Dances of India. They were a great source of encouragement as they were the only teachers who consented to accept me into their tutelage at a young age. They have indeed inspired me to great depths. I learned the basics of Bharatanatyam from them. As part of Kalanjali’s production “Folk Dances of India”, I ascended the stage at the age of 4. Due to geographical relocation of my residence, I continued learning Bharatanatyam from a lineage of Kalakshetra teachers including Sundara Swaminathan, K. P. Yesodha, K. Mohanan and currently back again with the Kunhiramans. These teachers have taught me several items in the Bharatanatya...|$|R
5000|$|The {{video was}} {{released}} on 2 March 2016. [...] The music video is directed by UK based director Toby Ashenheim, and the poignant video sees two puppets engaged in a stirring and emotional <b>dance,</b> <b>mirrored</b> by their human shadows. The video took months of meticulous, painstaking work to create - the dolls animated predominantly by hand using strings and basic rigging to simulate dancing, with 3D animation taking care of more complex movements.Toby Ashenheim said; “To me the song feels really fresh and uplifting, and I wanted to try a simple concept to echo that feeling. I had the idea listening to the track; {{an image of a}} worse for wear mannequin, casting a shadow far more dimensional than its stock “one size fits all” appearance. In a way the dolls could be anyone, what’s important is that when they’re together they become something truly special, representing a special bond between two people who have been very close friends or lovers… a dynamic that may only ever be understood by them”.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mirror</b> <b>Dance</b> is a Hugo- and Locus-award-winning {{science fiction}} novel by Lois McMaster Bujold. Part of the Vorkosigan Saga, {{it was first}} {{published}} by Baen Books in March 1994, and {{is included in the}} 2002 omnibus Miles Errant.|$|R
50|$|He is {{the author}} of a very copious oeuvre and of a {{characteristic}} melodic, harmonic and rhythmic invention. Bjelinski never belonged expressly to the “national course” but he was far from indifferent to folk music (the influence of idiosyncratic Balkan rhythms and even of exotic South American <b>dances</b> <b>mirroring</b> the impressions of the composer’s repeated stays in Brazil, with occasional inspirations by the particular features of jazz). The fundamental features of this sensitive and easily recognisable musical speech are a light Mediterranean lyricism, a general facility of expression and a message that is always optimistic, all interwoven with occasional dramatically accumulated sounds. Visible in his work are traces of Baroque music with its incessant kinetic motion and well-thought-out structures. But neo-Classical impulses are always at the roots of his creative work; rejecting all that is outside the tried and tested laws of classical order, the composer, respecting these same laws, also played with them a little. The unpretentious poeticism of his works is often suffused with a gentle humour that occasionally borders on irony. Bjelinski successfully tried his hand at almost all the areas of serious music.|$|R
40|$|Tap {{dance is}} an {{indigenous}} American art form {{that not only}} holds a valuable presence {{in the world of}} entertainment but also boasts an important historical background. From the slave quarters on plantations to Hollywood’s silver screen, the development of tap <b>dance</b> <b>mirrors</b> the story of American history. Tap dance must be preserved because of its cultural significance in American history; likewise, it is imperative for dancers to understand its development in order to appreciate the art and for today’s artists to continue the growth and presence of tap dance in America. However, many dance educators today focus solely on teaching a vocabulary of steps to students and fail to also impart knowledge of the traditions and significance of tap dance. This study examines the development of the styles and education of tap dance from both historical and contemporary perspectives by using traditional research methods as well as personal experiences of taking dance classes from a variety of instructors, performers, and choreographers, conversing with other artists, and teaching practice. The collected information has been analyzed from a pedagogical standpoint in order to develop a tap dance curriculum with syllabi and lesson plans for students of varying skill levels...|$|R

Reception for the sequels was largely negative, with the Orlando Sentinel criticizing Raven Dance as [...] "reflecting poorly on the classic original". [...] William Sanderson was the only actor from the first film to return for the second movie, albeit in a different role. The second film notably featured an early film appearance for Mark Ruffalo.|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, the {{attention}} of the then Mayor Roque Tiu was called regarding the 2005 Calendar of the Philippine National Oil Corporation entitled Sulyap (Glimpse) which highlighted the looking back into the home of Filipino culture and taking a glimpse into one’s roots in relation to moving forward in life. In the second page (March-April page), it featured the Tinikling with a brief description in Pilipino dialect …”ang Tinikling ay nagmula sa Tanauan, Leyte. Isa ito sa mga pinaka-kilalang Pilipinong sayaw sa buong mundo. Ang pagkamalikhain ng mga taga Leyte ay nagbigay buhay sa simpleng galaw ng ibong tikling, kung saan nakuhaang pangalan ng sayaw. Sa Tinikling naipamalas ang likas na halina at pagiging masayahin na nabubukod-tangi sa mga Pilipino.” (Tinikling originated in Tanauan, Leyte. It {{is one of the best}} known Philippine dance. The creativity of the people of Leyte gave life to the simple movement of tikling birds from which the dance got its name Tinikling. The <b>dance</b> <b>mirrors</b> the innate grace and joy of the Filipinos). Since then, the municipal government of Tanauan requested historians and enthusiasts of culture and the arts to shed light on the issue so that the local government can initiate moves towards preserving the culture of the municipality which has been baptized the title of “Cradle of the Intellectuals” ("Bungto Han Kamag-araman" [...] in Waray-Waray dialect) ever since the Spanish Regime. Another version of the story has it, that the Tinikling really originated in Tanauan, Leyte particularly in Barangay Kiling. The name “Kiling” is derived from the tikling bird. This version of the story have yet to be authenticated. Today, pinpointing the exact origin of this dance still remains a mystery.|$|R
50|$|At a conference, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} kidnap Miles and the other attendees.

50|$|While {{leading the}} Dendarii Mercenaries on a hostage rescue mission, Miles has a seizure (a {{recurring}} consequence {{of his death}} and resuscitation in <b>Mirror</b> <b>Dance)</b> — which results in his accidentally severing the rescued hostage's legs.

However, Illyan finds out anyway from spies planted among the Dendarii, and Miles is forced to accept a medical discharge from ImpSec.|$|R
5000|$|Cordelia, as a Betan, offers Aral a {{different}} vision of honor, {{which does not}} require bloodshed but {{is devoted to the}} protection of the living, such as her brain-damaged Ensign Dubauer and the seventeen fetuses conceived by the Barrayaran military on female prisoners of war. In <b>Mirror</b> <b>Dance,</b> when he thinks he is dying, Aral attempts to offer his clone-son Mark some last words: “All true wealth is biological” (ch. 15, recalled by Mark in ch. 33).|$|R
50|$|At age 44, at the {{beginning}} of the novels, Aral meets and falls in love with the Betan Survey captain Cordelia Naismith. According to her analysis, she provides a “solution” to his bisexuality, being both a woman and a soldier (Barrayar, ch. 5, repeated in <b>Mirror</b> <b>Dance,</b> ch. 16). They marry and have a child, Miles, who is physically handicapped as a result of exposure to a teratogen. Count Piotr attempts both abortion and infanticide of this imperfect heir, and Aral becomes estranged from his father until Miles is able to walk, at about the age of 5. Aral and Cordelia are otherwise childless until, in <b>Mirror</b> <b>Dance,</b> they discover Mark, a clone of Miles created when Miles was about six years old. They acknowledge Mark as their son and, for a short time when Miles is MIA, the heir to the title of Count. By the time Aral dies, around 83 years old, he has four grandchildren, all Miles's children (Cryoburn). After Aral's death, Cordelia uses x-chromosomes from his frozen sperm, along with her own eggs and, for boys, sperm from Admiral Jole, to create as many as eight posthumous children (Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen).|$|R
50|$|In 1991 the Henegar Center for the Arts {{opened its}} doors with a 493-seat Proscenium style Theatre, {{designed}} by Peter Feller.

50|$|Scottish country dances are {{categorised}} as reels (including hornpipes), jigs, and strathspeys {{according to}} the type of music to which they are danced. The first two types (also called quick-time dances) feature fast tempos, quick movements and a lively feel. The third type (strathspey) has a much slower tempo and a more tempered, stately feel. It should be noted that although general guidelines are given below almost all elements of SCD have exceptions through the playfulness of the dance writers to the wide variety of influences and interpretations over the years; some exceptions include the Eightsome Reel (has two parts repeated as ABBBBBBBBA and is thus considerably longer than most other dances), The Wee Cooper of Fife (ten bar phrases - with music to match), The Willowtree (often only repeated four times despite having eight couples because the <b>dance</b> is <b>mirrored</b> from both ends of the set).|$|R
50|$|In marrying Etienne Vorsoisson {{her name}} changed. Etienne's {{branch of the}} Vorsoissons were still low Vor, and thus she did not gain the title Lady.

Thus she sees it as her duty to stand by her own ignoble husband.|$|R
