5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E

25|$|Laczkovich's proof <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> the hypergeometric function. In fact, fk(x)=0F1(k;x2) and Gauss found a {{continued}} fraction {{expansion of the}} hypergeometric function using its functional equation. This allowed Laczkovich {{to find a new}} and simpler proof {{of the fact that the}} tangent function has the continued fraction expansion that Lambert had discovered.|$|E

25|$|Pohela Boishakh, the Bengali new year, is {{the major}} festival of Bengali culture and sees {{widespread}} festivities. Of the major holidays celebrated in Bangladesh, only Pohela Boishakh comes without any preexisting expectations (specific religious identity, culture of gift-giving, etc.). Unlike holidays like Eid al-Fitr, where dressing up in lavish clothes has become a norm, or Christmas where exchanging gifts has {{become an integral part}} of the holiday, Pohela Boishakh <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> celebrating the simpler, rural roots of the Bengal. As a result, more people can participate in the festivities together without the burden of having to reveal one's class, religion, or financial capacity. Other cultural festivals include Nabonno, and Poush Parbon both of which are Bengali harvest festivals.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Gil Green. In an interview with MTV News, Diddy explained the video, stating, [...] " [...] <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> me being {{in a relationship with}} a young lady and you're constantly loving this person, and hoping that this day comes where they change and they love you back." [...] Additionally, Green said that the video shows [...] "moments of him and his love but you can tell there's an emotional distance". The video was premiered on BET's 106 & Park on October 27, 2010.|$|E
500|$|So, {{this song}} is about faith, but it's also about finding faith in other places, in the beyond, and my {{experience}} with love being something that took me up a really long time to find. So it's really psychedelic and it really takes you on a journey [...] I kinda got this lot of different inspiration from this sort of futuristic disco meets late 70s and jazz and this really really kinda gooey deep groove [...] This song <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> sex, but it's about sex on the most mythological way.|$|E

500|$|In December, Ms. Marvel is set {{to begin}} a new story arc titled [...] "Teenage Wasteland" [...] {{as part of the}} Marvel Legacy relaunch. Wilson said, [...] "Since the events of 'Civil War II', there's been {{friction}} between Kamala and her mentor, Captain Marvel. In this arc, we're exploring how complicated legacies can be when they're passed from generation to generation... She's questioning a lot about herself and her mission. Her friends end up stepping into some very important - an unexpected - roles. So in a sense, the arc <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> a bunch of chronically under-estimated teenagers who pull together to fight evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{is deeply}} self-centered and takes {{everything}} personally, a trait which {{is reflected in}} his discussion of the news and current events. According to the comedian, [...] "There's nothing too large that doesn't involve him. Every news story <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> him ... Everything he cares about is a news story because he cares about it." [...] This is expressed in his frequent attacks on and feuds with well-known figures such as The Decemberists, Sean Penn, Conan O'Brien, Rain, Barry Manilow, Tony Bennett, and Don Rickles (the latter three of whom beat out Colbert for Best Individual in a Variety or Music Program at the Emmys). The comedian equates these feuds with Bill O'Reilly's culture wars.|$|E
500|$|The Hustler is {{fundamentally}} {{a story of}} what it means to be a human being, couched within the context of winning and losing. Describing the film, Robert Rossen said: [...] "My protagonist, Fast Eddie, wants to become a great pool player, but the film <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being. He attains self-awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused— and then he wins his pool game." [...] Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment, citing The Hustler as [...] "one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Lady Gaga and RedOne.

Gaga said that the song was inspired {{after a night of}} partying at the Laboratory nightclub in Berlin, Germany. The next day, she wrote [...] "Scheiße", stating that she [...] "meant [...] like 'shit, it's good.' But I also meant it the other way; because this song <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> wanting to be a strong female without all the bullshit that comes along with. Anything that gets in your way from being brave. It's not the only word I know, I just like that word. It's sexy." ...|$|E

500|$|The character's first romance on {{the soap}} opera was with Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz). She later tricked him into believing they were married, and they {{separated}} after the truth surfaced. After the relationship ended, the writers planned on pairing Cane with Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford), but the popularity of Phyllis' romance with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow) halted {{the plans for the}} pairing. Cane was instead written into a romance with Lily Winters (Christel Khalil); Goddard described Lily as becoming Cane's [...] "anti-Amber". He felt the character lost a [...] "certain amount of edge" [...] and a [...] "certain amount of his dynamic" [...] after being paired with Lily but said it was replaced with [...] "a level of compassion, understanding, tolerance, romance and love", since that those characteristics were [...] "all the things that daytime <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> at its core".|$|E
500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about.</b> It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod, {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to show Blackfish's death off screen, saying [...] "there {{was a lot of}} tonal discussion about this, and I think I can safely speak for the writers that the choice was a conscious one in the writing not to see his actual death, because the emotional focus <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> the final moments between him and Brienne -- two warriors, two samurais, facing each other -- and Brienne's acknowledgment that this fellow samurai has chosen his moment, and this is his moment of dignity and choice of his death. So it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|R

[...] On the political nature of her songs she has said, [...] "Nobody wants to be dancing to political songs.

500|$|While {{researching the}} book, Taraborrelli {{realized}} {{that one of}} the greatest misconceptions about Madonna was the general perception that she was cold and unemotional in her personal relationships. The opposite proved true; Madonna was indeed emotionally vulnerable, and Taraborelli cited as an example the icon's 1990 relationship with actor Warren Beatty. Their relationship was generally perceived as nothing more than a means to promote their film Dick Tracy, and Madonna was regarded under the circumstances as opportunistic. Taraborelli discovered however that Madonna actually had strong feelings for Beatty. The actor however was not as emotionally invested as Madonna, and the relationship ended with her heart being broken. Taraborelli observed, [...] "So, what I think will surprise people with this story are the many times that Madonna has ended up feeling alone and rejected. She has built her entire career on an image of indestructibility. But at least in her personal life, and again, I make that distinction, because this isn't necessarily true in her business life, {{she is one of the}} most fragile subjects I've ever written about...This book <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> placing her life into the proper historical context, and once again answering the why questions about her." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, [...] "I've worked on films where {{there have been}} a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, [...] "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [...] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [...] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." ...|$|E
