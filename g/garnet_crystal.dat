50|$|The most {{important}} optical element in an isolator is the Faraday rotator. The characteristics that one looks {{for in a}} Faraday rotator optic include a high Verdet constant, low absorption coefficient, low non-linear refractive index and high damage threshold. Also, to prevent self-focusing and other thermal related effects, the optic should be as short as possible. The two most commonly used materials for the 700-1100 nm range are terbium doped borosilicate glass and terbium gallium <b>garnet</b> <b>crystal</b> (TGG). For long distance fibre communication, typically at 1310 nm or 1550 nm, yttrium iron garnet crystals are used (YIG). Commercial YIG based Faraday isolators reach isolations higher than 30 dB.|$|E

5000|$|Ferrite {{circulators}} are {{radio frequency}} circulators which {{are composed of}} magnetised ferrite materials. They fall into two main classes: 4-port waveguide circulators based on Faraday rotation of waves propagating in a magnetised material, and 3-port [...] "Y-junction" [...] circulators based on cancellation of waves propagating over two different paths near a magnetised material. Waveguide circulators may be of either type, while more compact devices based on stripline are of the 3-port type. [...] Two or more Y-junctions can be combined in a single component to give four or more ports, but these differ in behaviour from a true 4-port circulator. A permanent magnet produces the magnetic flux through the waveguide. Ferrimagnetic <b>garnet</b> <b>crystal</b> is used in optical circulators.|$|E
30|$|If {{the number}} of <b>garnet</b> <b>crystals</b> is much fewer than {{the number of}} {{reactant}} crystals, the evolution of garnet size and degree of supersaturation should follow path-A. For diffusion-controlled growth in this case, a small nucleation rate and large number of reactant crystals favor the growth of a small number of <b>garnet</b> <b>crystals,</b> thus producing unstable porphyroblastic garnet. Large garnet porphyroblasts with irregular and branching morphologies will form. Conversely, if the number of <b>garnet</b> <b>crystals</b> is much larger {{than the number of}} reactant crystals, the evolution of garnet size and degree of supersaturation should follow path-B. Due to a high nucleation rate and a small number of reactant <b>crystals,</b> many small <b>garnets</b> should grow rather than porphyroblasts. In addition, path-B promotes a stable garnet morphology, thus preventing the formation of branching and irregular textures.|$|R

50|$|YAG is an {{abbreviation}} for yttrium aluminum <b>garnet</b> which are <b>crystals</b> {{that are used}} for solid-state lasers while Nd:YAG refers to neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum <b>garnet</b> <b>crystals</b> {{that are used in}} the solid-state lasers as the laser medium.

50|$|In other cases, {{such as in}} the {{neodymium}} YAG laser, {{the crystal}} is synthetically made and does not occur in nature. The man-made yttrium aluminum <b>garnet</b> <b>crystal</b> contains millions of yttrium atoms in it, and due to its physical size, chemical valence, etc., it works well {{to take the place of}} a small minority of yttrium atoms in its lattice, and to replace them with atoms from the rare-earth series of elements, such as neodymium. Then, these dopant atoms actually carry out the lasing process in the crystal. The rest of the atoms in the crystal consist of yttrium, aluminum, and oxygen atoms, but just as above, these other three elements function to simply support the neodymium atoms. In addition, the rare-earth element erbium can readily be used as the dopant rather than neodymium, giving a different wavelength of its output.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to use the {{technique}} of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) to fabricate thick multilayered <b>garnet</b> <b>crystal</b> planar waveguides with rare-earth ion doped cores for use as planar waveguide laser devices. Planar waveguides are of interest because {{of the implications of}} their structure, which allows for lasing, pumping and heat dissipation to each have a unique axis of operation, and the confinement properties of planar waveguide lasers result in lower pump power thresholds, higher gains per unit pump power and higher efficiencies than their bulk counterparts. Thick planar waveguide lasers are desirable because they can be pumped by high power diode laser arrays, and suffer less from the detrimental effect of particulates (a practically unavoidable side effect of the PLD technique). The use of multilayers allows a device with a high numerical aperture to be fabricated and the careful choice of the cladding layer thicknesses and refractive indices allows good beam quality output to be produced using diode pumping. Other aims of the project were to fabricate a self-imaging waveguide amplifier and explore other applications of thick <b>garnet</b> <b>crystal</b> films such as the possibility of using a highly doped thick film as a thin-disk laser device. Now that the technique of thick <b>garnet</b> <b>crystal</b> film deposition via multiple growth runs has been established, the potential of thick <b>garnet</b> <b>crystal</b> films needs to be exploited. Multilayer structures with more ideal geometries need to be fabricated to make optimal waveguide laser devices and difficulties resulting from thermal expansion mismatch need to be addressed so that side-pumping can be performed with diode laser arrays.

40|$|An unusual andesitic suite {{from the}} Miocene {{volcanic}} arc in Northland, New Zealand, comprises pyroxene andesite and garnet-bearing hornblende-pyroxene, hornblende and biotite-hornblende andesites. <b>Garnet</b> <b>crystals</b> occur as 1 - 10 mm single crystals or more commonly as {{two or more}} annealed crystals and as garnetite lenses. The andesitic rocks also contain enclaves of high-MgO pyroxenite, hornblendite, and pyroxene-hornblende gabbro as well as high-Al 2 O 3 hornblende gabbro, garnet-hornblende gabbro, and anorthosite. <b>Garnet</b> <b>crystals</b> in the andesitic volcanic rocks and in the enclaves show comparable compositional ranges, zoning patterns and inclusions, which indicate that they share a common petrogenetic history. They can be grouped into four distinct types {{on the basis of}} mode of occurrence, chemical composition and zoning patterns, which leads to their interpretation as antecrysts rather than orthocrysts. The compositions of the garnets, as well as their included mineral assemblages, reflect a petrogenetic trend from high-temperature pyroxene-bearing high-Mg garnet to low-temperature Fe-rich garnet at relatively constant pressure. Well-preserved zoning patterns, in particular those of the Ca- and Mg-rich garnets, reflect processes within a deep crustal arc environment. Later assimilation is suggested by some zoning patterns that show decreasing Ca and increasing Fe and Mn contents. The garnets are interpreted as being derived by disintegration of discrete but closely related cumulate material that formed at pressures of 8 - 10 kbar. The host volcanic rocks and their <b>garnet</b> <b>crystals</b> together with the enclaves thus represent a consanguineous mixture of liquid and solid components that developed where subduction-related magmas ponded and interacted at or near the base of the crust. Together they represent a rare snapshot of the processes and components that produce arc-type rocks. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.
