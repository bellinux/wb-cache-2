The athletes interact through the choice of their strategies x,y∈[0, 1].

Each athlete picks his strategy based on his knowledge of his own and his competitor's performance distribution, and on his evaluation of the danger of exhaustion, which increases with the amount of invested energy. We formulate this problem as a zero-sum game.

Although the classical capacity of this channel is zero, we show that rates approaching the empirical capacity log |X | − Hemp(Z n) can be universally attained, where Hemp(Z n) is the empirical entropy of Z n. For the more general setting where the channel can map its input to an output in an arbitrary unknown fashion subject only to causality, we model the empirical channel actions as the modulo-addition of a realized noise sequence, and show that the same result applies if common randomness is available. The results are proved constructively, by providing a simple sequential transmission scheme approaching the empirical capacity.

40|$|Introduction: Following the evidence, the American Heart Association {{recently}} published a Science Advisory with the recommendation {{that patients with}} Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) should be screened for depressive symptoms and depression. Also the Heart Failure Guidelines recommend routine screening for depressive symptoms. Screening for anxiety {{was not included in}} these recommendations, despite findings in literature suggesting that cardiac patients are at risk for high levels of anxiety. Objective: The aim of the current study is to obtain a realistic estimation of the consequences and implications of this advice for clinical practice. Method: Data on anxiety, and depression, need for help, demographics and disease related variables were collected in a cross-sectional study within a 2 -month period (July August 2008) at the cardiac outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center Groningen (The Netherlands). Patients: Data of 217 patients were analyzed, mean age was 58 years (+/- 16) and 62 % of the respondents were male. Results: Of 217 patients, 26 % indicated to have depressive symptoms and 42 % indicated elevated levels of anxiety. About 35 - 50 % of these patients indicated a moderate to high need for help. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was mainly associated with demographic factors and the occurrence of stressful life events.

40|$|Abstract. We look at {{the problem}} of {{coloring}} locally specially constructed spanners of unit disk graphs. First we present a local approximation algorithm for the vertex coloring problem in Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) which uses at most {{four times as many}} colors as an optimal solution requires. Next we {{look at the}} colorability of spanners of UDGs. In particular we present a local algorithm for constructing a 4 -colorable spanner of a unit disk graph. The output consists of the spanner and the 4 -coloring. The computed spanner also has the properties that it is planar, the degree of a vertex in the spanner is at most 5 and the angles between two edges are at least π/ 3. By enlarging the locality distance (i. e. the size of the neighborhood which a vertex has to explore in order to compute its color) we can ensure the total weight of the spanner to be arbitrarily close to the weight of a minimum spanning tree. We prove that a local algorithm cannot compute a bipartite spanner of a unit disk graph and therefore our algorithm needs at most one color more than any local algorithm for the task requires. Moreover, we prove that there is no local algorithm for 3 -coloring UDGs or spanners of UDGs, even if the 3 -colorability of the graph (or the spanner respectively) is <b>guaranteed</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{operating}} systems have recently introduced mandatory access controls (MAC) {{that can be}} used to ensure system-wide data confidentiality and integrity. These protections rely on restricting the flow of information between processes based on security levels. The problem is, there are many applications that defy simple classification by security level, some of them essential for system operation. Surprisingly, the common practice among these {{operating systems}} is simply to mark these applications as “trusted”, and thus allow them to bypass label protections. This compromise is not a limitation of MAC or the operating system services that enforce it, but simply a fundamental inability of any operating system to reason about how applications treat sensitive data internally—and thus the OS must either restrict the data that they receive or trust them to handle it correctly. These practices were developed prior to the advent security-typed languages. These languages provide a means of reasoning about how the OS’s sensitive data is handled within applications. Thus, applications can be shown to enforce system security by <b>guaranteeing,</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of execution, that they will adhere to the OS’s MAC policy. In this paper, we provide an architecture for an operating system service, that integrate security-typed language with operating system MAC services. We have built an implementation of this service, called SIESTA, which handles applications developed in the securitytyped language, Jif, running on the SELinux operating system. We also provide some sample applications to demonstrate the security, flexibility and efficiency of our approach. ...|$|R
5000|$|A second {{cluster of}} {{expanded}} wealth span complexities {{centers on the}} substantial changes in the U.S. pension or [...] "retirement income" [...] system. In addition to the national Social Security system which provides some basic retirement income for almost all workers, almost half (46%) of all private sector workers also have an employer-sponsored pension. The increasing wealth span complexity, however, {{is found in the}} dramatic change in the kind of pensions held by American workers: Defined Benefit (DB plans) vs. Defined Contribution (DC plans) pension schemes. While the discussion of these types of pensions is discussed in detail elsewhere, it is the fundamental difference in what is [...] "defined"—that is, what is [...] "guaranteed" [...] to the worker in the expenditure stage—that produces the substantial increases in complexity. Conceptually, DB plans define, or largely guarantee, the number of dollars the worker will receive after retirement. It is the employer primarily who is responsible for contributing the necessary funds into the plan (sometimes but not always with contributions from the employee). In other words, it is the [...] "output" [...] of pension money that is defined or <b>guaranteed.</b> By contrast, <b>in</b> DC plans, it is only the [...] "input" [...] of contributions into the pension plan that is defined or <b>guaranteed</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> <b>In</b> many DC plans the employee contributes a specified amount (or percentage) and the employer matches the amount; sometimes only the employee or only the employer make the contributions. In all these cases, however, the later [...] "output" [...] of money to the retiree is based on how well, how successful, the contributed funds have been invested. The magnitude of changes in wealth span complexity precipitated by the shift from Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution plans is illustrated by the clarity of the shift from 1979 to 2013, documented by the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and reported by the Employee Benefit Research Institute: in 1979 28% of private sector workers had a DB pension and only 7% had a DC pension (10% had both); by 2013, only 2% had a DB pension and 33% had a DC pension (11% had both).|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the concept of}} QoS has led to an extension of the traditional concepts of service and service specification.

To implement this degradation path support across multiple layers, a negotiation of preferred and supportable failure semantics is a requirement.

This allows exploitation of auxiliary information, e. g. census totals, {{to improve the}} representativeness of sample data (addressing coverage limitations, non-response) {{and the quality of}} estimates of population parameters. Calibration methods may fail with samples presenting small/zero counts for some benchmark groups or when range restrictions (RR), such as positivity, are imposed to avoid unrealistic or extreme weights. User-defined modifications of BC/RR performed after encountering non-convergence allow little control on the solution, and penalization approaches modelling infeasibility may not guarantee convergence. Paradoxically, this has led to underuse in calibration of highly disaggregated information, when available. We present an always-convergent flexible two-step Global Optimisation (GO) survey calibration approach. The feasibility of the calibration problem is assessed, and automatically controlled minimum errors in BC or changes in RR are allowed to <b>guarantee</b> convergence <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> while preserving the good properties of calibration estimators.

40|$|Display {{advertising}} {{is an important}} online advertising type where banner advertisements (shortly ad) on websites are usually measured by how many times they are viewed by online users. There are two major channels to sell ad views. They can be auctioned off in real time or be directly sold through <b>guaranteed</b> contracts <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> The former {{is also known as}} real-time bidding (RTB), in which media buyers come to a common marketplace to compete for a single ad view and this inventory will be allocated to a buyer in milliseconds by an auction model. Unlike RTB, buying and selling guaranteed contracts are not usually programmatic but through private negotiations as advertisers would like to customise their requests and purchase ad views in bulk. In this paper, we propose a simple model that facilitates the automation of direct sales. In our model, a media seller puts future ad views on sale and receives buy requests sequentially over time until the future delivery period. The seller maintains a hidden yet dynamically changing reserve price in order to decide whether to accept a buy request or not. The future supply and demand are assumed to be well estimated and static, and the model's revenue management is using inventory control theory where each computed reverse price is based on the updated supply and demand, and the unsold future ad views will be auctioned off in RTB to the meet the unfulfilled demand. The model has several desirable properties. First, it {{is not limited to the}} demand arrival assumption. Second, it will not affect the current equilibrium between RTB and direct sales as there are no posted guaranteed prices. Third, the model uses the expected revenue from RTB as a lower bound for inventory control and we show that a publisher can receive expected total revenue greater than or equal to those from only RTB if she uses the computed dynamic reserves prices for direct sales.

40|$|The {{last century}} was {{dominated}} by the creation of scientific theories: the newborn Relativistic, Quantum and Cosmological Theories are proper examples. The Earth Sciences followed this trend by proposing the principles of Plate tectonics. On the contrary, {{the concept of the}} Expanding Earth was not developed as a commonly accepted paradigm, but was an open field of original investigations, interpretations, and results. This innovative attitude is evident in the di erent interpretations of the Pacific and Indian oceans paleogeographical evolution; in the cosmological or incidental motor of expansion (still to be identified); in the different estimates of the Earth’s radial expansion. This is a positive sign of vitality: we cannot crystallize these ideas in a few postulates from which we may deduce all the answers, and to which we may constrain all data. The Expanding Planet scheme provides a common explanation of several complex and debated issues relating to Paleontology, Paleomagnetism, Geology and Climatology. The Workshop, through oral and poster contributions, will cover {{a wide range of issues}} in a field that, although supported by compelling evidence, is still in search of a definite and commonly accepted cause for the expansion. Our final goal is to explore the Expanding Earth concept from di erent scientific perspectives. Some important new entries come from Physics and these can suitably be linked to clues derived from Paleogeography, Paleontology, Life Evolution, Climatology, [...] . etc. It is perhaps of particular significance that these progresses in Physics, towards a material physical space, will be presented at the Ettore Majorana Centre, considering that the uncle and mentor of Ettore Majorana was Quirino Majorana, a physicist who performed several experiments with a view to revealing the material essence of gravity. A group of non-expansionist researchers in the fields of Geodesy, Oceanography and Seismology, have accepted our invitation to deliver lectures to our community to clarify the limits and show up the new ways that expansionists should consider while building their new interpretations. The Poster session is going to be full of high quality presentations and also of papers by outstanding scientists in absentia, who will not be able to come to Erice. The Workshop should be a forum for sharing ideas and for promoting the convergence of aims, but also given that we are the so-called heretics in Geosciences the birthplace of new and original ideas, possibly destined to become the accepted conceptions in the future.
