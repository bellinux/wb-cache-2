5|$|Final Fantasy Xs {{depiction}} of Spira {{set a new}} standard with the traversing of real-time 3D environments <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overworld map, making the portrayal of Spira a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the style}} of a {{traditional}} musical, this episode follows a two-act structure – with the acts separated by a commercial break <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intermission. However, in {{the style of}} a traditional Scrubs episode, this is preceded by a cold open.|$|E
5|$|Because Montgomery was now {{tied to the}} Livingston family, who {{supported}} the Patriot cause, he began to turn against the British government, seeing himself as an American <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Englishman. He {{came to believe that}} the British government was being oppressive and was acting like a tyrannical parent-state.|$|E

5|$|Design of {{the bridge}} was awarded to Aas-Jakobsen and Det Norske Veritas, the former who also {{performed}} dynamic analysis and structural engineering. Architects were Hindhammer–Sundt–Thomassen, Lund & Løvseth, and Lund & Slaatto. An H pylon was chosen <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> A pylon both because it was more functional, and would be more aesthetic {{in conjunction with the}} other bridges in the area, particularly three suspension bridges.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bethesda Softworks {{purchased}} the license {{to develop and}} publish Fallout 3, {{as well as an}} option to create two sequels, from Interplay Entertainment. Three years later they bought the Fallout intellectual property. Bethesda abandoned the original gameplay style of previous Fallout titles; <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> isometric game with action point/turn-based combat, Bethesda's Fallout 3 was a fully 3D game with real-time combat as well as the action point-based V.A.T.S. system.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the North American market {{accounted}} for over 10% of the company's net sales. Nokian Tyres has a tyre subsidiary based in LaVergne, Tennessee (USA). In that market, Nokian Tyres sell only to independent dealers, {{some of whom}} use the tyre products to fill in gaps in their product lines <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exclusive or majority share. This results in some dealers being knowledgeable about specific tyres but not Nokian Tyre's full tyre product range.|$|E
5000|$|In Finland {{the fairy}} tale similar to Cinderella is known as [...] "Liisa and the Prince". <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> step-mother, an evil ogress impersonates the mother, and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fairy god-mother, the spirit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> birch tree helps Liiisa out.|$|R

The total amount of GPUs is 13. The video cards together bring 12 teraflops of computing power. Four of the six GTX 295 video cards have 2 PCBs, while the other two have only 1 PCB.|$|E
5|$|The study {{undertaken}} by the Space Technology Laboratory suggested {{the use of a}} Thor-Hydra booster, however the more capable and more readily available Atlas-Agena B booster was selected instead. In phase two they switched {{to the use of the}} Atlas-Centaur booster, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Atlas-Agena B booster.|$|E
5|$|When {{they reach}} the {{coordinates}} shown on the parchments, there is no island in sight. Frustrated, Haddock ponders turning back, but Tintin soon realizes the problem: If Sir Francis had used a French chart <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> English chart to calculate the position, the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian. As they have been using the Greenwich Meridian, they realise that they are too far west.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] keyword is {{used here}} <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> , and <b>an</b> [...] method <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> global [...] function, but {{otherwise}} {{the structure and}} the effect of the code are the same.|$|R
30|$|Further, the MVME {{technique}} is very complex. Therefore, {{the complexity of}} this technique can be reduced by using fast motion search techniques such as a multigrid [27] approach <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed block size {{in addition to an}} N-step [28] search <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full search.|$|R
50|$|Three minor Dalek {{variants}} {{appear in}} the film. Some Daleks are fitted with a two-jawed mechanical claw <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plunger, some have integrally moulded collars with reversed angles on the front edges and one is seen with <b>a</b> cutting torch <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> telescopic arm.|$|R
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of iron ore deposits {{in the north of}} Sweden, Lappland became a frontier for industrial development, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exotic wilderness of the Sami culture and midnight sun. Opportunistically, Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published his Lappland, det stora svenska framtidslandet (Lappland, the great Swedish land of the future). He engaged noted Swedish artists—such as Karl Tirén, Alfred Thörne, Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg—to create the illustrations. Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison, Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him to create some drawings of Sami people at Skansen.|$|E

5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E
5|$|<b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{immediate}} {{return to}} France, the Western Allies staged offensives in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, where British troops were already stationed. By mid-1943 {{the campaign in}} North Africa had been won. The Allies then launched the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, and subsequently invaded Italy in September the same year. By then, Soviet forces were on the offensive and had won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion {{within the next year}} was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943. Initial planning was constrained by the number of available landing craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and Pacific. At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin that they would open the long-delayed second front in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{absorption}} {{in carbon}} nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> absorption threshold {{followed by an}} absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E
50|$|Dangerous actions {{should be}} undoable {{wherever}} possible; a modal dialog that appears unexpectedly or which is dismissed by habituation will not protect from the dangerous action. This {{problem can be}} avoided by providing <b>an</b> undo action <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warning, or showing the warning in <b>an</b> infobar <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dialog.|$|R

5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of eating disorders, Rumination {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside eating disorders such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|The advancements in portraying {{realistic}} emotions {{achieved with}} Final Fantasy X through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become {{a staple of}} the series, with Final Fantasy X-2 and other subsequent titles (such as , Final Fantasy XII, XIII and its sequels, and XV) also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overworld map has also become a standard of the series, as demonstrated in Final Fantasy XI, XII, XIII and its sequels, XIV and XV. Final Fantasy X can be considered a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.|$|E
5|$|While over land, {{a surface}} {{circulation}} developed near Orlando, and the National Hurricane Center designated {{the system as}} Subtropical Depression One. The subtropical designation was because the convection was far-removed from the center. Additionally, an upper-level trough provided outflow, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anticyclone as found in tropical cyclones. The subtropical depression moved to the east-northeast, and steadily organized as deep convection developed closer to the center. Initially, the strongest winds were 175mi (280km) from the center, but by the morning of October5, the distance decreased to 85mi (135km). Based on its organization and winds of 40mph (65km/h), the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Leslie.|$|E
