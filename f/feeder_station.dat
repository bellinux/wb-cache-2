25|$|S-trains run on standard-gauge {{tracks and}} are powered via {{overhead}} wires. The voltage is 1,500 or 1,650 volts DC (negative overhead wire), indicating that it varies considerably with the loading and distance from a <b>feeder</b> <b>station.</b> Power {{is drawn from}} the national grid through 38 feeder stations. They have to be relatively {{close to each other}} because the large currents in the overhead wires (caused by the relatively low voltage) would lead to unacceptably large transmission losses otherwise.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a <b>feeder</b> <b>station</b> {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|E
2500|$|On May 22, 1942 {{after the}} Wannsee conference an {{exclusive}} presentation {{was made to}} the higher echelons of the German army at the Hotel Majestic by Reinhard Heydrich, {{one of the main}} architects of the Holocaust. He spoke of experiments for the killing of Jews using a specially prepared truck whose exhaust fumes would kill the deportees. In this context the word “gassing” was first used outside of Hitler's inner circle in relation to the extermination of the Jewish population of Paris. On this occasion, Heydrich introduced Carl Oberg, the new police and SS officer for Paris, who had been issued with the authority to order deportations of Jews without reference to the military commander of the French authorities. Militärbefehlshaber Frankreich staff at The Majestic were soon processing hundreds of deportation orders against the Jewish population of Paris. Joseph Goebbels established his Paris propaganda headquarters at the Majestic around the same time and [...] the building's staff assumed control of the notorious Camp Royallieu at Compiègne, know to the Germans as Frontstalag 122, which served as a <b>feeder</b> <b>station</b> for the extermination camps at Auschwitz, Ravensbrück, Buchenwald and Dachau.|$|E

40|$|The {{heavy haul}} rail network in Queensland Australia {{generally}} adopts a lightning {{impulse withstand voltage}} rating of 250 kV for the switchgear and autotransformers within its 50 kV ac traction <b>feeder</b> <b>stations.</b> The aging switchgear across a number of <b>feeder</b> <b>stations</b> in this network are undergoing upgrade and the rail network operator is considering {{the possibility of using}} 200 kV rating for the upgraded switchgear. This paper investigates the lightning over-voltages that could occur at the <b>feeder</b> <b>stations</b> under review. Fast front transient models of the <b>feeder</b> <b>stations</b> and the associated traction corridors are developed in PSCAD/EMTDC software. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the likely over-voltages under various scenarios and the results are presented.

40|$|To further {{understand}} {{the source of}} the epidemic of salmonellosis in some species of birds using bird feeders in southern Ontario in the winter of 1997 - 1998, 124 bird <b>feeder</b> <b>stations</b> were examined for their state of hygiene and for Salmonella on 5 occasions during the winter of 1999 in a city of 100, 000 people in southwestern Ontario. No Salmonella were isolated from feed contaminated with feces recovered from the feeders. Squirrel-proof feeders were significantly less contaminated with feces than were other feeder types (hopper, platform, silo), which did not differ significantly in their hygiene scores. Contamination of squirrel-proof feeders increased significantly through the course of the study, but other feeder types showed no significant change. Hygiene was poorer if feeders were maintained equally by both male and female household members, particularly as they grew older, but no age or gender effect was observed if only one person was largely responsible for maintaining the feeders. We concluded that winter bird <b>feeder</b> <b>stations</b> in a southern Ontario city were not contaminated with Salmonella but that bird <b>feeder</b> <b>stations</b> could be designed better to reduce fecal contamination of feed...|$|R

Moreover, future distribution systems aim to achieve more flexible, reliable, and efficient network architectures and power-flow scheduling and control [1, 2].

50|$|Electric trains that {{collect their}} current from {{overhead}} lines use a device {{such as a}} pantograph, bow collector or trolley pole.

Non-electric locomotives (such as diesels) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line, although there may be difficulties with overhead clearance. Alternative electrical power transmission schemes for trains include third rail, ground-level power supply, batteries, and electromagnetic induction.|$|E
