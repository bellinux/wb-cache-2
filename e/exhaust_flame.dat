A centre-line ETC 501 rack typically held a 250kg (550lb) bomb, and wing-mounted racks mounted 300L drop tanks. A EK16 gun camera, as well as landing lights, were fitted to the wing leading edge. The U2 was armed with only two 20mm MG 151 cannon.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, Historian Emeritus Paul E. Garber of the NASM interviewed Coandă, who related {{that the}} December 1910 flight was no accident, {{that he had}} seated himself in the cockpit {{intending}} to test five factors: aircraft structure, the engine, the wing lift, the balance of controls, and the aerodynamics. He said that {{the heat from the}} engine was [...] "fantastic", but that he placed mica sheets and deflecting plates to direct the jet blast away from the wooden fuselage. Garber wrote that as Coandă's aircraft began to move forward and rise from the ground, [...] "the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flame,</b> instead of fanning outward, curved inward and ignited the aircraft." [...] In this interview Coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control, but the landing was [...] "abrupt" [...] and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame, the engine reduced to [...] "a few handfuls of white powder." ...|$|E

These Mosquitos were fitted with four [...] Hispano cannon in the fuselage belly and four [...]303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns mounted in the nose. On production Mk IIs the machine guns and ammunition tanks were accessed via two centrally hinged, sideways opening doors in the upper nose section. To arm and service the cannon the bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors: the F and NF Mk IIs could not carry bombs. The type was also fitted with a gun camera in a compartment above the machine guns in the nose and was fitted with <b>exhaust</b> <b>flame</b> dampers to reduce the glare from the Merlin XXs.|$|E

5000|$|In {{line with}} these {{requirements}} Spitfire Is, IIs, VAs and VBs were {{fitted with a}} powerful, retractable landing-light in each wing. Dorsal and ventral identification lights could be operated in Morse code by the pilot using a small morse key in the cockpit. In an attempt to shield the pilot's eyes from the bright <b>exhaust</b> <b>flames</b> many Spitfires were also fitted with rectangular light-alloy [...] "blinkers" [...] secured to light-alloy brackets fixed {{to the sides of}} the fuel-tank housing: these could be easily removed.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the crew}} had loaded and aimed the launcher, {{they had to take}} cover [...] away to avoid the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flames,</b> and would fire the rockets with an {{electric}} switch. After firing, however, a long streak of smoke was visible from a considerable distance, leaving the Nebelwerfer vulnerable to counter-battery fire. It was therefore necessary to relocate the launcher and crew as soon as possible after firing. The loud, shrill howling noise of the incoming rockets led Allied soldiers in the Sicily campaign to give it the nicknames [...] "Screaming Mimi" [...] and [...] "Moaning Minnie".|$|R

40|$|A hydrogen-air {{ignition}} torch {{concept that}} had been used successfully in two rocket engine test facilities to consume excess hydrogen in their exhausters at atmospheric conditions was experimentally evaluated and developed in an altitude test facility at NASA Lewis Research Center. The idea was to use several of these torches in conjunction with hydrogen detectors and dilution air to prevent excess accumulation of unburned hydrogen or mixtures of hydrogen and air exceeding the sea-level lower flammability limit in the altitude facility exhaust system during hydrogen-fueled propulsion system tests. The torches were evaluated for a range of fuel-to-air ratios from 0. 09 to 0. 39 and for a range of exit diameters from 19 / 64 to 49 / 64 in.

40|$|The {{aims of the}} {{research}} for this thesis were fourfold, all of which focused at reducing employee exposure to diesel particulate in underground coal mines. The four aims were to: a) Develop a method to test disposable diesel exhaust filters and if possible improve their performance b) Investigate the relationship between maintenance and diesel particulate generation c) Highlight the benefits of newer design engines in emission reduction d) Review {{the research}} of the Tower Colliery Research group as their findings have been {{the basis for the}} development of control technologies for diesel particulate in NSW underground coal mines. Methods used to achieve these aims involved: a) The construction of a test rig to measure the efficiency and backpressure of new and used disposable filters b) The testing of the in service fleet at four of BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal mines using an R&P Series 5100 diesel analysis system mounted in a trailer c) Comparison of a newer design engine with three current vehicles under mining conditions d) A detailed statistical review of all available data from the Tower Colliery Research group. Key outcomes from research conducted for this thesis are: a) The filtration efficiency and backpressure of disposable diesel exhaust filters used by BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal have been improved. These improvements, together with changes to work practices, generate potential cost savings of $ 395, 000 per annum while affording increased protection to equipment operators. b) Seven engines with unacceptable raw exhaust elemental carbon emissions were identified in a fleet of 66 tested. Some faults identified as causing these elevated emission levels were- blocked <b>exhaust</b> <b>flame</b> traps (scrubber tanks), incorrectly set tappets and worn injectors. c) Testing of a prototype 4 WD fire protected vehicle powered by an "over the road" engine as against three current vehicles, highlighted reductions in atmospheric elemental carbon concentrations of 67 90 %. Significant reductions in raw exhaust elemental carbon levels were also observed. d) A statistical review of data produced by the Tower Colliery Diesel Research group identified elevated exposures within mine transportation roadways. This outcome is significant as much research within the mining industry has focused on other areas in the belief that high air quantities in transportation roadways would limit exposures. This {{does not appear to be}} the case. The project has had a number of positive outcomes, all of which have assisted in the reduction of equipment operators to excessive levels of diesel particulate...|$|E
40|$|Current missile-warning sensors on {{aircraft}} mostly {{operate in}} the ultraviolet wavelength band. Aimed primarily at detecting short-range, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, the detection range of the sensors is of the same order as the threat range, which is 3 - 5 km. However, this range is only attained against older missiles, with bright <b>exhaust</b> <b>flames.</b> Modern missile developments {{include the use of}} new propellants, which generate low-intensity plumes. These threats are detected at much shorter ranges by current ultraviolet warning sensors, resulting in short reaction times. Infrared sensors are able to detect targets at a much longer range. In contrast with the ultraviolet band, in which a target is observed against an almost zero background, infrared sensors must extract targets from a complex background. This leads to a much higher false-alarm rate, which has thus far prevented the deployment of infrared sensors in a missile warning system. One way of reducing false-alarms levels is {{to make use of the}} spectral difference between missile plumes and the background. By carefully choosing two wavelength bands, the contrast between missile plume and background can be maximised. This paper presents a method to search for the best possible combination of two bands in the mid-wave infrared, that leads to the longest detection ranges and that works for a wide range of missile propellants. Detection ranges predicted in the infrared will be compared with those obtained in the ultraviolet, to demonstrate the increased range and, therefore, the increased reaction time for the aircraft...|$|R
