25|$|Philippine {{passports}} {{have different}} styles of <b>data</b> <b>pages.</b> Old brown passports have both a data and physical description page, with the picture located on the description page rather than the data page; these are separated by the passport note. Green passports issued before 2004 have the data page on the inner cover followed by the passport note page. Passports issued after 2004 have the passport note and <b>data</b> <b>pages</b> reversed, with the passport note on the inner cover page.|$|E
25|$|The Btrieve {{file format}} {{consists}} entirely of pages, {{which are the}} data that move between memory and storage when the engine performs an I/O operation. Versions prior to 6.0 merely used <b>data</b> <b>pages,</b> index pages and a file control record (FCR). The file had an index for searching that linked to physical pages. Beginning with version 6.0 logical pages were used. Logical are mapped to physical pages (pages at a fixed location in the file) on the disk by page allocation tables (PATs). The FCR is a record that contains important information about Btrieve files, such {{as the number of}} pages in current use. To avoid database corruption, Btrieve uses two methods of updating records: pre-image paging in Btrieve versions before 6.0, and shadow paging in subsequent versions. It was primarily the change-over from pre-image paging to shadow-paging, which necessitated radical file format changes, that caused compatibility issues between version 6 and previous versions.|$|E
