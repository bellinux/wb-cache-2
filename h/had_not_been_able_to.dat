5|$|In French drawings, Vengeur {{is often}} {{depicted}} as flying the Tricolour, {{which had been}} recently ordered by the Convention to be flown as battle ensign; however, {{due to a lack}} of bunting in Brest, Villaret <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> distribute this flag to all his ships, and thus Vengeur probably still flew the white flag with a canton of three equal columns of red, white, and blue.|$|E

This flight proved uneventful, and all 27 Lancasters landed at Yagodnik in the evening.

A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

Although Ross <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> land on the Antarctic continent, nor approach {{the location of the}} South Magnetic Pole, on his return to England in 1843 he was knighted for his achievements in geographical and scientific exploration.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford many live instruments {{around the time of}} his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E

Upon its release, Sticky & Sweet Tour received mixed reviews from critics, with one group criticizing it for being lifeless, while others praised the album for the performances. It became Madonna's 19th top-ten album on the Billboard 200, while reached the top of the charts in Greece, Hungary, Mexico and Portugal. The album also reached the top-ten in the charts of Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, but had failed to reach the top-ten in Germany and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Netball is an Olympic {{recognised}} sport, {{a status}} attained in 1995 after a twenty-year period of lobbying. It {{has never been}} played at the Summer Olympics, but with recognition a formal requirement for inclusion is met. The absence at the Olympic Games was seen by the netball community as a hindrance to the global growth of the game, depriving it of media attention and funding. Inclusion is hampered, because it is mainly played by women, and mostly in Commonwealth countries. When the sport gained recognition, it opened up sources of funds that the global netball community <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> access before, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), national Olympic committees and sports organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of the fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress. Although most of their experience lay {{in the defense of}} the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground. When the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E
5|$|Bristol {{was made}} a city in 1542, with the former Abbey of St Augustine {{becoming}} Bristol Cathedral, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. The Dissolution also saw the surrender to the king of all of Bristol's friaries and monastic hospitals, together with StJames' Priory, StMary Magdalen nunnery, a Cistercian abbey at Kingswood and the College at Westbury on Trym. In {{the case of the}} friaries at Greyfriars and Whitefriars, the priors had fled before the arrival of the royal commissioners, and at Whitefriars a succession of departing priors had plundered the friary of its valuables. Although the commissioners <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> point to as much religious malpractice in Bristol as elsewhere, there is no record of Bristolians raising any objections to the royal seizures. In 1541 Bristol's civic leaders took the opportunity of buying up lands and properties formerly belonging to StMark's Hospital, StMary Magdalen, Greyfriars and Whitefriars for a total of a thousand pounds. Bristol thereby became the only municipality in the country which has its own chapel, at StMark's.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E

5|$|In late 2009, Dover was {{selected}} as a Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian dressage team, with a contract that extended through the 2010 World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky. After the Games, {{it was announced that}} Dover and the Canadian team <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> agree on contract renewal terms, but in late 2010 it was announced that Dover would remain as the interim trainer for the first quarter of 2011. In March 2011, German equestrian Markus Gribbe was hired, and Dover's term as a Canadian coach came to an end. Dover is known for his coaching abilities, with some of the best dressage riders with top international titles to their credit coming from his stables. During his time as a trainer for Canada, he was no longer be eligible to train top riders with the USEF. In April 2013, Dover was named Technical Advisor/Chef d'Equipe of the US national dressage team. He is expected to remain in the position through the 2016 Summer Olympics. Dover is currently a rider and trainer at Stillpoint Farm in Florida.|$|E
5|$|Model's {{first order}} was that Falaise be defended, {{which did not}} impress his staff. However, he quickly changed his mind, convincing Hitler to authorize the {{immediate}} escape of the German Seventh Army and Panzer Group Eberbach—something that Kluge, with his limited political clout, <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do. He was thus able to rescue {{a high proportion of}} the units involved, albeit at the cost of nearly all their armour and heavy materiel. When Hitler demanded that Paris be held, Model replied that he could do so, but only if given an extra 200,000 men and several panzer divisions—an act that has been described as naïveté by some, and canny bargaining by others. The reinforcements were not forthcoming, and the city's liberation took place on 25 August. Meanwhile, Model fell back to the German border.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{speculation}} about potential medal winners before the Games focused on athletes from Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. Athletes from German-speaking countries had traditionally been {{dominant in the}} sliding sports, luge and bobsleigh, but following the re-introduction of skeleton, {{they had not been}} as strongly competitive in the new sport. Mellisa Hollingsworth of Canada, the defending Olympic bronze medalist, won the 2009-10 Skeleton World Cup, and was considered a strong contender if not the favorite to win. British athlete Shelley Rudman won the only British medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics with her silver in skeleton, and her bronze medal at the European Championships just prior to the Games kept her name in media previews of the Olympic event. Her countrywoman Amy Williams, however, finished outside of the medal places in both the World Cup, in which she placed fifth, and the European Championships, in which she placed sixth. American Noelle Pikus-Pace <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> compete in the 2006 Games after a runaway bobsleigh had broken her leg.|$|E
