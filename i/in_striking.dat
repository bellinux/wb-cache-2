They are especially fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage <b>in</b> <b>striking</b> favourable deals with them.|$|E
5|$|The court's {{decision}} was affirmed in part and reversed {{in part by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit unanimously held that the welfare-advocacy restriction was unconstitutional, but upheld other restrictions that Bronx Legal Services had challenged (such as the lobbying restriction) by a 2–1 vote. The Second Circuit also rejected the claim that any funding conditions would be illegitimate, instead preferring a restriction-by-restriction analysis. The national LSC asked the Supreme Court for review by petitioning for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Second Circuit was wrong <b>in</b> <b>striking</b> down the welfare-advocacy restriction.|$|E

5|$|There are controlled-release {{versions}} of levodopa.

A newer extended-release levodopa preparation {{does seem to be}} more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result <b>in</b> <b>striking</b> improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.|$|E

5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, <b>in</b> <b>striking</b> contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E

5|$|Historian Martin Samuels has {{questioned}} {{whether it was}} in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was <b>in</b> <b>striking</b> contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command. Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the Battle of Zama Hannibal was quoted saying that he had fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes {{that it is impossible to}} be sure who was in command on the day.|$|E
5|$|In 318 BCE, Cassander {{appointed}} Demetrius Phalereus {{to govern}} the city-state of Athens. Demetrius issued a set of laws that are known from later literary works. Although knowledge of these laws is fragmentary, {{it does not appear}} that Demetrius legislated anything on the subject of epikleroi. This is <b>in</b> <b>striking</b> contrast to Solon's legislation, which was concerned with the internal affairs of the family and its external manifestations in public life. By the 4th century BCE, the practice of the epiklerate was falling into disuse, and it disappeared during the Hellenistic Period, although it continued to appear in New Comedy and scattered inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, if dated correctly, refer to occasional epikleroi. One method that developed to avoid the epiklerate was through the adoption of a son by the father of a possible epikleros.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{comments}} on the remarkable decline <b>in</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> Australia {{over the last couple}} of decades in the light of the recent analysis of the same subject matter offered in the Australian Bulletin of Labour by Healy (2002). In this paper a somewhat different perspective is offered on the main factors contributing to the decline <b>in</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> Australia to that offered by Healy (and others). The paper is structured as follows. Section 1 presents a brief review of the extent of the decline <b>in</b> <b>strikes</b> and a summary of Healy's perspective on principal reasons for the decline. Section 2 {{comments on}} the possible impact on <b>strikes</b> of changes <b>in</b> inflation, as well as a selection of other possible explanatory factors tested in the analyses of Morris and Wilson (1994, 1995, 1999, 2000) and Beggs and Chapman (1987 a) but not discussed in Healy. Section 3 explores the issue of the impact of the Accord on strikes, and Section 4 comments on selected international aspects of the decline <b>in</b> <b>strikes.</b> Some concluding thoughts are offered in Section 5. ...|$|R
