At similar infusion rates as used in our study, a plateau effect on respiratory depression was observed. Only an infusion rate of 12 Â mg/kg/h induced a further increase of arterial PCO 2 [13]. If nalbuphine is used in addition to inhalation anaesthesia, we suggest to increase the oxygen content in the inspiratory gas to avoid hypoxemia. Of note, excessive oxygen supply may be harmful [23].

Patient recovery from anaesthesia is smoother and there is less pollution of the working environment than happens with <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> agents. Recently, a number of drugs with profiles (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) suitable for prolonged intravenous anaesthesia have been studied, mostly in humans and, to a certain extent, in dogs and horses.

40|$|The {{activity}} of the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to alveolar hypoxia was assessed by measur-ing the redistribution of pulmonary blood flow {{in response to the}} ventilation of one lung with nitrogen. The vasoconstrictor response was depressed during the administration of 5 % diethyl ether but returned when the ether was withdrawn. It is suggested that depression of the hypoxic vaso-constrictor mechanism may be one cause of the increased alveolar-arterial Po 2 difference noted during ether anaesthesia. It has now been established clearly that there is an increase in venous admixture during anaesthesia. This results in arterial hypoxaemia unless the patient inspires oxygen-enriched gas mixtures. It is generally believed that the major factor producing this change in lung function is an increase in dependent airway closure secondary to a reduction in functional residual capacity (Rehder, Sessler and Marsh, 1975). However, it has been suggested also that <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> agents may produce a further increase in venous admixture effect by depressing the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to regional alveolar hypoxia, thus increasing the blood flow through underventila-ted areas of lung (Sykes et al., 1972).

The data obtained demonstrate that even lower halothane concentrations could induce DNA damage although the anaesthetic does not in-teract directly with DNA. We have found that irre-versible impairment of the cell genome is initiated at a concentration as low as 1. 5 mM.

In this investigation, we have determined {{the effects of the}} <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetics,</b> enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane, administered only during early reperfusion, on myocardial reperfusion injury in vivo. Fifty chloralose-anaesthetized rabbits were subjected to 30 min of occlusion of a major coronary artery followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Left ventricular pressure (LVP, tip-manometer), cardiac output (CO, ultrasonic flow probe) and infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium staining) were determined. During the first 15 min of reperfusion, five groups of 10 rabbits each received 1 MAC of enflurane (enflurane group), isoflurane (isoflurane group), sevoflurane (sevoflurane group) or desflurane (desflurane group), and 10 rabbits served as untreated controls (control group). Haemodynamic baseline values were similar between groups (mean LVP 106 (SEM 2) mm Hg; CO 281 (7) ml min- 1). During coronary occlusion, LVP and CO were reduced to the same extent in all groups (LVP 89 % of baseline; CO 89 %). Administration of <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> during early reperfusion further reduced both variables, but they recovered after discontinuation of the anaesthetics to values not different from control animals. Infarct size was reduced from 49 (5) % of the area at risk in the control group to 32 (3) % in the desflurane group (P = 0. 021), and to 36 (2) % in the sevoflurane group (P = 0. 097).

Study design: Randomized blinded prospective clinical trial. Animals: Thirty horses scheduled for routine arthroscopy. Methods: After premedication (acepromazine 0. 02 mg kg- 1, romifidine 80 mu g kg- 1, methadone 0. 1 mg kg- 1) and induction (midazolam 0. 06 mg kg- 1 ketamine 2. 2 mg kg- 1), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Horses were assigned randomly to receive a CRI of saline (group S) or 40 mu g kg- 1 hour- 1 romifidine (group R). The influences of time and treatment on anaesthetic and cardiovascular parameters were evaluated using an analysis of variance. Body weight (t-test), duration of anaesthesia (t-test) and recovery score (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p < 0. 05. Results: All but one horse were positioned in the dorsal recumbent position and ventilated from the start of anaesthesia. End tidal isoflurane concentrations were similar in both groups at similar time points and over the whole anaesthetic period.

In the control group, cellular injury occurred at early reperfusion (peak CKR 283 (SEM 57) iu litre- 1 at 10 min of reperfusion). Peak CKR to the coronary venous effluent was attenuated by all anaesthetics (halothane group 156 (45), enflurane group 134 (20), sevoflurane group 132 (20), desflurane group 159 (25) iu litre- 1; each P < 0. 05). Isoflurane did not differ from controls (303 (53) iu litre- 1; P = 0. 5). In the sevoflurane group, there was a delayed peak CKR after discontinuation of the anaesthetic at 30 min of reperfusion (260 (34) iu litre- 1).

Therefore, although halothane might have been a component in the aerosol, it was probably not a major component, or perhaps it was a metabolite of another drug.|$|R
40|$|Although {{hundreds}} of compounds on the chemist's shelf {{are known to}} produce anaesthesia, relatively few are used clinically. The requirements for a clinically useful anaesthetic agent are necessarily stringent and include: a wide margin of safety, total reversibility of anaesthetic effect and an absence of long-term toxicity. In addition, a successful inhalation anaesthetic agent must combine the capacity for depression of {{the central nervous system}} with low levels of inter-ference with respiration and the circulation. The central nervous system effects must be quickly reversible. The acute depressant effects produced by the <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> contrast with the slower development of long-term toxicity involving organs such as the liver, the kidneys or the reproductive system. Although such long-term toxicity associated with anaesthetics has been recognized for many years, in the past it has been considered to occur infrequently, to be of little importance and of unde-termined aetiology. More recent findings suggest that not only are these long-term effects serious, but they occur more frequently than was previously recognized. In addition the aetiological factors are now beginning to be understood. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANAESTHETI...|$|E
40|$|In {{its attempt}} to {{liberate}} the hostages in Moscow, the government used a gas or vapour. Classical war gases are not appropriate for such a task because they cause irreparable damage, while <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> are inappropriate because they take too long to take effect, and because hundreds of litres would have been required for a sufficient effect. Following the liberation of the hostages, {{it was reported that}} a fentanyl derivative had been used, most likely carfentanyl. From the way that the hostages, in Moscow were liberated, it is clear that terrorist attacks in which chemicals are used may also take place in the future in the Netherlands. In {{order to be able to}} react adequately to such situations, additional training for physicians and other health-care personnel is urgently necessary and the hospitals must also be better prepared for this task, especially for the artificial respiration of large numbers of patients and for the administration of large amounts of antidote in easy-to-use dosage units. From now on, on-site treatment and stabilisation will not be reserved only for trauma cases...|$|E
40|$|Sevoflurane and {{desflurane}} <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> are in routine use {{providing more}} rapid recovery than pre-existing <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetics.</b> We wanted {{to compare the}} effect of different anaesthetic agents on haemodynamic parameters with using transesophageal echo-Doppler in ASA I-II patients. A total of 45 American Society of Anes-thesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II patients age between 18 - 65 scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery were admitted to this prospective randomized study and divided into three groups. Induction of anaesthesia was provided with 1 Âµgkg - 1 fentanyl, 6 - 8 mgkg - 1 thiopenthal and 0. 1 mgkg - 1 vecuronium in sevoflurane (Group S, n= 15), and desflurane (Group D, n= 15), and 1 Âµgkg - 1 remifentanil, 2 mgkg - 1 propofol, and 0. 1 mgkg - 1 vecuronium in totally intrave-nous anaesthesia (TIVA) group (Group T; n= 15). For maintenance of anaesthesia, patients received an infusion of 0. 15 Âµgkg - 1 min remifentanil, 4 - 6 mgkg - 1 h - 1 propofol, sevoflurane 2 %, or desflurane 6 % at 1. 0 MAC. Bispectral index (BIS) values of 40 - 60 were targeted during operation. After endotracheal intubation, the haemodynamic and respira-tory parameters, and BIS were recorded 5 min after the intubation (T 0), 30 min after the intubation (T 1), 60 min after the intubation (T 2) and before the extubation (T 3) with using haemodynamic monitoring (Hemosonic 100). After induction of anaesthetic agents, heart rate (HR) increased significantly in desflurane group (Group D) compared with group sevoflurane (Group S) and TIVA (Group T) groups at 5 min after the intubations, 30 min after the intubations, 60 min after the intubations and compared with group sevoflurane before the extubation. The Stroke Volume (SV) values increased significantly at the 5 th minute intubation in Group S {{as compared to the}} Group D and in Group D as compared to the Group T. Compared with Group D, maximum acceleration (Acc) increased significanly in Group T before extubation. The BIS values were significantly lower in the Groups S and D at all the time intervals as com-pared to the Group T. Although a significant increase in HR and no significant decrease in Acc were noted in the desflurane group, sevoflurane and desflurane provided similar cardiovascular effects in the present study. The BIS values were significantly lower in the sevoflurane and desflurane groups compared with the TIVA...|$|E
40|$|Background. Whether the {{anaesthetic}} gases are {{hazardous to}} the operating room personnel is controversial. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate their genetic damage using the method of sister chromatid exchanges in personnel working at one Slovenian hospital. Methods. Two subgroups of operating room personnel, non-smokers, female were included in the study: subgroup A (seven subjects) who were co-operating daily with <b>inhalations</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> gases during operations and subgroup B (six control subjects) who were seldom co-operating with the same gases. Monthly and yearly doses of received ionising radiation (IR) were measured on five subjects in the control subgroup, by thermo-luminous dosimeter one month before medical examination. Interview was used to obtain information about personal and family disease and working environment. Neurophysiological symptoms were revealed with Finnish Institute of Occupational Medicine. The exchanges of DNA material of a chromosome was evaluated by counting the number of sister chromatid exchanges in 50 methaphases per probe. Results. The subgroups were of equal age. Subgroup A subjects had 18 years of working experience while those from subgroup B had 20 years. Subgroup A subjects participated at six anaesthetic procedures per day (on average) and those from subgroup B at five. Five subjects of control subgroup B, who works in operating room for orthopaedic and injures room, received yearly dose of 0. 14 mSv on average and cumulative dose of 3. 8 mSv (permited effected equivalent dose is 50 mSv per year). Their mediane value of sister chromatid exchanges was 6. 7 /cell while on the five subjects of subgroup A that were not exposed to IS, was 7. 2 /cell. The average mean value of SCE for both subgroups was 7. 2 and that is higher than the reference value of non-exposed population in Slovenia (6. 5 Â± 0. 7). The mediane value of SCE for subgroup A was higher (7. 5 /cell) than for the subgroup B (6. 7 /cell), but the difference was not statistically significant (Wilcoxon test of sum of ranks). Conclusions. The mediane value in operating room personnel where <b>inhalations</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> gases were mostly used was higher than the reference value of non-exposed population in Slovenia. The monitoring of anaesthetic gases and a proper air conditioning represents a preferable practice prior to a periodical evaluation of SCE. </p...|$|R

40|$|Eight {{patients}} underwent allogeneic renal transplantation under methoxyflurane anaes-thesia. All exhibited further {{impairment of}} renal function. Histological {{examination of the}} renal cortex of seven of these patients revealed precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals, these being the probable cause of the subsequent decrease in renal function. A transient polyuric phase was seen in one case in which autologous renal transplantation was carried out. When halothane, ether or cyclopropane was used for anaesthesia in renal transplantation, crystal formation was not seen. In ninety-four patients who underwent various types of general surgery no harmful renal effect which {{could be attributed to}} methoxyflurane was detected. Methoxyflurane is not a recommended anaesthetic agent for renal transplantation. Methoxyflurane (2, 2 -dichloro-l,l-difluoroethylmethyl ether; Penthrane) * is a relatively new <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> agent, which provides good muscle relaxation, has minimal depressant effect on the circulatory system, gives good postoperative analgesia and is non-explosive. Favourable experiences have been reported by several authors. Paddock, Parker and Guadagni, however, in 1964 reported that methoxyflurane can cause renal damage. Calcium oxalate crystals were found in biopsy material from such affected kidneys and similar reports have sub-sequently been published. In particular, the renal tubules seem to be primarily affected by methoxy...|$|R
