50|$|To machine a {{helical gear}} on a manual machine, a true {{indexing}} fixture must be used. Indexing fixtures can disengage the <b>drive</b> <b>worm,</b> and be attached via an external gear train {{to the machine}} table's handle (like a power feed). It then operates similarly to a carriage on a lathe. As the table moves on the X axis, the fixture will rotate in a fixed ratio with the table. The indexing fixture itself receives {{its name from the}} original purpose of the tool: moving the table in precise, fixed increments. If the indexing worm is not disengaged from the table, one can move the table in a highly controlled fashion via the indexing plate to produce linear movement of great precision (such as a vernier scale).|$|E

This paper analyzes the Autoplay vulnerability commonly exploited by flash worms to infect removable drives and further applies this analysis to the OpenWith worm found in flash drives. Preventive measures which need to be employed to restrict flash worms and techniques for removing these worms have been discussed in this paper.

40|$|We {{present a}} new class of {{algorithms}} for performing valence-bond quantum Monte Carlo of quantum spin models. Valence-bond quantum Monte Carlo is a T= 0 Monte Carlo method based on sampling of a set of operator-strings that can be viewed as forming a tree-like structure. The algorithms presented here utilize the notion of a worm that moves up and down this tree and changes the associated operator-string. In quite general terms we derive a set of equations whose solutions correspond to {{a new class}} of algorithms. As specific examples of this class of algorithms we focus on two cases. The bouncing worm algorithm, for which updates are always accepted by allowing the worm to bounce up and down the tree and the <b>driven</b> <b>worm</b> algorithm, where a single parameter controls how far up the tree the worm reaches before turning around. The latter algorithm involves only a single bounce where the worm turns from going up the tree to going down.

40|$|Effect of {{tilting angle}} on the {{dynamics}} of tilting table <b>driven</b> by <b>worm</b> and worm wheel Wenming Wei, Jun Zhang, Dun Lu and Wanhua Zhao The dynamics of tilting table behaves differently during five-axis machining due to the constant changes {{of the position of}} its center of mass which leads to different forces acting on parts of the transmission system. In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} tilting table <b>driven</b> by <b>worm</b> and worm wheel in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of tilting table system with tilting angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of worm and worm wheel, the torsional stiffness of worm wheel shaft, and the axial stiffness of worm supporting bearings. Moreover, the variations of system natural frequency with the three stiffnesses at different tilting angles are further investigated...|$|R
