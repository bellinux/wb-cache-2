500|$|Eurogamer's {{review by}} Rich Stanton {{described}} XCOM: Enemy Unknown as [...] "a winner" [...] and [...] "a fantastic game" [...] that [...] "brings back and revitalises a classic." [...] Alex Rubens of G4 called it [...] "an exceptionally solid {{return for the}} series, and one that every turn-based tactics fan should experience," [...] adding that [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> played the original, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is turn-based tactics and management at its finest, and a perfect introduction to the genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Darlington, in his review, {{stated that}} [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> play this game, {{you will be}} smarter simply for having read it" [...] since [...] "it quickly becomes hard to {{distinguish}} [...] choice of attributes from a high-level academic deconstruction of the character tropes in gothic horror films at a level which could easily be found on a college reading list." [...] He also {{said that it is}} [...] "one of the very few horror games that may actually need disclaimers, and maybe even safe words too" [...] for its [...] "darker subtext" [...] about escaping from abusive relationships.|$|E
500|$|Upon the Japanese release, {{the critic}} writing for The Japan Times reflected: [...] "If Lost in Translation is the film you'd make when {{all you know}} about Japan are the pampered press junkets at Shinjuku 5-star hotels, then Enter the Void is what you would make <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> got beyond the Roppongi pub-crawl." [...] While the review was largely negative, the author was still {{impressed}} by the visual depiction of the Japanese capital: [...] "Visually, much {{of the film is}} stunning ... and the art design by Marc Caro (Delicatessen) takes Tokyo's love of neon gaudiness to a surreal extreme".|$|E
5000|$|Lomasney {{created a}} famous saying on the {{importance}} of discretion: [...] "Never write <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can speak; <b>never</b> speak <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can nod; <b>never</b> nod <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can wink." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Never write <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can speak; <b>never</b> speak <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can nod; <b>never</b> nod <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can wink," [...] {{attributed}} to Massachusetts political boss Martin Lomasney, is used when a politician damages his own career with notorious disclosures.|$|R

500|$|Presley's {{physical}} attractiveness {{and sexual}} appeal were widely acknowledged. [...] "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", {{in the words}} of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, [...] "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence." [...] His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as [...] "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl." [...] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as [...] "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America." [...] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.|$|E
500|$|The Digital Fixs Ryan Poxon gave CRUSH3D a {{score of}} seven out of ten and called it a [...] "puzzle game that {{genuinely}} surprised me at how brain teasing the game actually is." [...] 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it {{a score of}} 6.6 out of 10 and said, [...] "For a puzzle game, Crush 3D {{is a good choice}} for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as it was a few years ago, it’s still a decent game to check out. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> saw the PSP version or haven’t played games like Fez or Echochrome, I’d recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." [...] However, Digital Spys Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: [...] "Despite the five-year gap between releases, Crush 3D takes a few steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very {{little in the way of}} brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, Crush 3D gets it right where it counts." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.|$|E
500|$|The rescuers {{concealed}} {{the fate}} of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued immigrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten. Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a Mason that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, [...] "Well, mother, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> see me again, do the best you can." [...] Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.|$|E

2500|$|On June 24, 2008, Rove said of Democratic {{presidential nominee}} Barack Obama, [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> met him, {{you know this}} guy.

2500|$|The win {{attracted}} further {{attention on}} social media because Gun Runner ran the final half mile with a horseshoe caught in his tail: a shoe from Cautious Giant flew loose just as Gun Runner was starting his move. [...] "We watched the tape repeatedly, repeatedly," [...] said Asmussen, [...] "and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> seen anything before, just wait around. Can you believe that? I mean if we tried to throw one and stick in one's tail as he was standing, still we'd go 0-for-1,000 – let alone at a run, let alone Gun Runner, let alone in the Whitney – and it stayed. [...] how fast he was going , it was held out from him. When he slowed down to walk, then it came into him. We were obviously unaware of it until {{he came back to}} the winner's circle, but not a nick on him. I mean, there's still nails in it." [...] The race improved Gun Runner's rating to 127 in the World's Best Racehorse Rankings August update, maintaining his third place ranking worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Casting {{began in}} early August 2009, with open auditions held in various states. Jesse Eisenberg was first {{announced}} to {{be attached to}} the project in September 2009. (Coincidentally, in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer, Zuckerberg revealed that Eisenberg's cousin, Eric Fisher, was a Facebook product designer.) Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> {{have to worry about the}} audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie".|$|E

2500|$|Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded the film's {{more mature}} tone {{and said it}} was [...] "darker, more complex, rooted in character." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called the film [...] "a deeper, darker, {{visually}} arresting and more emotionally satisfying adaptation of the J.K. Rowling literary phenomenon," [...] especially compared to the first two installments. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars: [...] "Not only is this dazzler by far the best and most thrilling of the three Harry Potter movies to date, it's a film that can stand on its own even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> heard of author J.K. Rowling and her young wizard hero." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com asserts it to be [...] "one of the greatest fantasy films of all time." [...] Nicole Arthur of The Washington Post praised the film as [...] "complex, frightening, [...] nuanced." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that the film was not quite as good as the first two, but still called it [...] "delightful, amusing and sophisticated" [...] Claudia Puig from USA Today found the film to be [...] "a visual delight," [...] and added that [...] "Cuarón is not afraid to make a darker film and tackle painful emotions." [...] while Richard Roeper called the film [...] "a creative triumph." [...] Sean Smith from Newsweek said: [...] "The Prisoner of Azkaban boasts a brand-new director and a bold new vision," [...] he also called the film [...] "moving," [...] praising the performances by the three main leads, while Entertainment Weekly praised the film for being more mature than its predecessors.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} the song a [...] "diss" [...] towards Lil' Kim, [...] {{who has been}} in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard dissected the song stating [...] "Nicki Minaj's highly-talked about [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] track hit the net over the weekend, and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil' Kim." [...] In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying [...] "Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen" [...] then again [...] "You out of work/I know it's tough/but enough is enough/" [...] Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil'Kim in the second verse rapping, [...] "Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on/ is it my fault that all of you bitches gone/" [...] and following this line this infered she was talking about Lil' Kim [...] "Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot/ word that bitch mad cause I took the spot/ Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off ya top/. Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. First of all, I don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. My records ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about. See that's the thing when you put out records; you know only the 'guilty ones' feel like you're talking about them. So you know, if you have nothing to worry about, if you haven't came out saying stuff, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you wouldn't worry about it." ...|$|E
