The working conditions and technological processes are changing and gradating. We are part of the global economy with growing competitive ability and this fact has substantial impact on the labour market. In the nearest future we will not speak about poor and wealthy nations any more but about the nations that are highly or less educated. Future appears as the world of chaos where can get his way is only the one who can innovate or can quit the automatic ways, the one who will be able of brisk and correct response on unexpected changes, the one who will forget the usual certainty. Information in the education and the directed informal cooperation between a student and a teacher, present the head presumption for educating of individuals who can stand themselves well on the job market in <b>global</b> economy. <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>SOCIETY</b> The <b>Information</b> <b>Society</b> is the objective reality.

In addition to goals for inclusion within the <b>information</b> <b>society</b> and specifically among African nations, the ATU promotes positive collaboration with the Institute for Computer Technology research and development. [...] As the Internet has recently become the preeminent communication technology for fostering economic growth, this area is of great focus for the ATU.
