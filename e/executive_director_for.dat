25|$|Moses {{proposed}} to Governor Al Smith, whom {{he served as}} an aide, that the bond issue be put to voters. After some reluctance, Smith agreed and sent the legislature a formal message to that effect but {{said he would not}} send the legislation itself until 1924. He feared opposition to the high cost, but was surprised when reaction was uniformly positive. The legislation creating the administrative structure of the state parks was drafted by Moses, who had been assured by Smith that he would be appointed to the position of <b>executive</b> <b>director</b> <b>for</b> both the SCP and the Long Island State Parks Commission. Seemingly innocuous phrases in the legislation gave the SCP director considerable power. The legislature passed the bill unanimously in 1924. The bond issue passed overwhelmingly that fall.|$|E
25|$|A music & memory {{program was}} {{developed}} by Dan Cohen, the <b>executive</b> <b>director</b> <b>for</b> a non-profit organization.

In 2010, the program became an official non-profit organization, which then led to a documentary two years later based on the program called , which gave the program more attention. Mainly because a clip from the documentary showed a patient awakening from Alzheimer's disease by listening to songs from his era such as Cab Calloway. Once the documentary was previewed, Alive Inside gained at least 11 millions views, which gave awareness to the program and treatments.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, at a one-night charity {{event on}} the Norwegian Pearl cruise ship, Elizabeth Birch, <b>executive</b> <b>director</b> <b>for</b> the Rosie's For All Kids Foundation, {{confirmed}} that $50 million from O'Donnell's five-year contract were donated in an irrevocable trust to charity.

They also held a sweepstakes in which winners get to fly to New York and meet O'Donnell and attend a charity function as her guest.|$|E
