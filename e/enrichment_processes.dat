2500|$|Uranium as it {{is taken}} {{directly}} from the Earth is not suitable as fuel for most nuclear reactors and requires additional processes to make it usable. Uranium is mined either underground or in an open pit depending on the depth {{in which it is}} found. After the uranium ore is mined, it must go through a milling process to extract the uranium from the ore. This is accomplished by a combination of chemical processes with the end product being concentrated uranium oxide, which is known as [...] "yellowcake", contains roughly 60% uranium whereas the ore typically contains less than 1% uranium and as little as 0.1% uranium (Henderson 2000). After the milling process is complete, the uranium must next undergo a process of conversion, [...] "to either uranium dioxide, which can be used as the fuel for those types of reactors that do not require enriched uranium, or into uranium hexafluoride, which can be enriched to produce fuel for the majority of types of reactors". Naturally-occurring uranium is made of a mixture of U-235 and U-238. The U-235 is fissile meaning it is easily split with neutrons while the remainder is U-238, but in nature, more than 99% of the extracted ore is U-238. [...] Most nuclear reactors require enriched uranium, which is uranium with higher concentrations of U-235 ranging between 3.5% and 4.5%. There are two commercial enrichment processes: gaseous diffusion and gas centrifugation. Both <b>enrichment</b> <b>processes</b> involve the use of uranium hexafluoride and produce enriched uranium oxide.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to study and {{evaluate}} the Nurmia oxygen <b>enrichment</b> <b>process</b> and to compare it with the conventional Linde-Frankl oxygen separation method. The study includes studying both processes, creating a simulation model of the Nurmia oxygen <b>enrichment</b> <b>process,</b> carrying out simulations with different oxygen product purities and {{the analysis of the}} simulation results with a comparison to literature values. The simulation model was assembled according to a basic apparatus of the Nurmia oxygen <b>enrichment</b> <b>process.</b> A sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the functionality of the model. In the simulation results the product purity per compressor power is higher than what is presented in literature, which is caused by partial idealizations in the sub-processes of the simulation model. Otherwise the simulation results corresponded well to the process values presented in literature. The Nurmia oxygen <b>enrichment</b> <b>process</b> is found to enable oxygen concentrate production with better efficiency than the conventional oxygen separation process Linde-Frankl. The power consumption of compression for Nurmia process varies from 75 to 111 kWh/ton of oxygen product depending on the chosen process configuration. Lowering the purity decreases the energy consumption. For the conventional Linde-Frankl process the power consumption from compression work is approximately 245 kWh/ton of oxygen product. The flexibility of the Nurmia process is also better because the Nurmia oxygen enrichment method allows producing oxygen product with purity from 50 mol-% to 99 mol-% depending on the process configuration. For Linde-Frankl process the oxygen content of product is 99. 5 mol-% or more. A dynamic simulation model is recommended to be carried out next to investigate the functionality of the process start-up and process control.
