5|$|Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> to {{have almost}} the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, {{although}} the Sun's diameter is about 400 times {{as large as the}} Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.|$|E

Although there had been only a few new defections to her cause, Matilda still controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south into Wiltshire, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the Thames Valley as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to the west-southwest upon {{entering}} the basin, Evrina gradually weakened as the eye gradually dissipated. It soon encountered the same cooler waters of the southern Indian that affected previous storms Chikita and Davina. By April2, Evrina had weakened below tropical cyclone status, just 30hours after it was at peak intensity. Around that time, the circulation became exposed from the deepest convection, and the track shifted more to the west. On April5, Evrina weakened to tropical depression status. Two days later, the system turned toward the south, moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> not to cause any effects. On April8, the circulation turned to the east, dissipating two days later {{to the south of}} Rodrigues.|$|E

Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E

5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, {{a little closer to}} the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E
5|$|In {{geological}} terms at 7million {{years old}} Lord Howe Island is relatively young {{and was never}} part of any continent, its flora and fauna colonising the island from across the sea, carried by wind, water or birds, possibly assisted at a geological time when other islands were exposed, enabling island hopping. Nevertheless, it is <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> and has had sufficient time to evolve endemic species. The high degree of endemism is emphasised {{by the presence of}} five endemic genera: Negria, Lordhowea, Howea, Lepidorrhachis, and Hedyscepe. Island plants {{are similar to those of}} Norfolk Island, the two islands sharing some endemic species, for example, the critically endangered species of creeping vine Calystegia affinis. The combined flora of these two islands is more closely related to that of New Zealand and New Caledonia than to that of Australia. There is also a small but clear link with the plants of Vanuatu. The closest mainland affinities are with the vegetation of subtropical southeastern Queensland. A link with Gondwanaland is indicated by the presence of endemic species like the wedding lily (Dietes robinsoniana) whose only living relatives occur in South Africa.|$|E

5|$|In late January {{into early}} February, the ITCZ {{produced}} areas of convection around {{the northern tip of}} Madagascar. One such convective system spawned a {{low pressure area}} between Tromelin island and Agaléga, which initially was still located within the ITCZ. On February5, the system developed into a tropical depression, and failed to intensify further while executing a clockwise loop off northeastern Madagascar. After the convection increased, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on February8 and was named Josie by the Meteorological Services of Madagascar. Subsequently, the storm moved across northern Madagascar and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on February9 as a tropical depression, its structure deteriorated. Josie turned to the southwest around western Madagascar, and despite warm waters it initially failed to re-intensify much. On February11, Josie re-attained tropical storm status, and subsequently turned to the south due to a broad area of low pressure in the region. The storm quickly intensified once moving <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> from Madagascar, becoming a tropical cyclone on February13 and soon after reaching peak 10winds of 140km/h (85mph); in contrast, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). While near peak intensity, the eyewall of Josie passed over Europa Island. An approaching cold front turned the cyclone to the southeast, bringing the storm over cooler waters and causing weakening due to increased wind shear. On February16, Josie became extratropical well to the south of Madagascar, and dissipated the next day.|$|E

50|$|The letter {{compares the}} ocean's waves to the {{disturbances}} {{in a vase}} of water, which move for three reasons: {{the slope of the}} vase, external forces exerted on the vase-water system, and the possible acceleration of the vase itself. Comparably, the ocean's tides are due to Earth's terrain, wind currents, and circular accelerations. In Galileo's understanding, Earth's rotation and simultaneous orbital revolution dictate that half of the Earth's rotational arc is in concordance with the direction of revolution and the other half is opposed to the direction of revolution. He reasoned that by sometimes matching and sometimes counteracting the motion of orbit, positive and negative acceleration is generated that influences bodies of water to rock back and forth, creating the tides. Though these opposing acceleration cannot be observed, large bodies of water containing points of location <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>enough</b> to experience significantly different vectors of acceleration would necessarily contour into waves.|$|R

40|$|The Canadian Arctic is {{currently}} undergoing rapid environmental and climatic changes. Resource development in northern regions also continues to expand, which requires more infrastructure such as roads. The Dempster Highway {{is a potential}} source for calcareous road dust since construction was completed in AD 1979. Along the same timeline, the regional air temperatures began increasing, with the warming beginning around AD 1970. Previous research indicates that dust from gravel highways {{has an impact on}} vegetation, and that the roadbed itself can alter near-surface permafrost temperature regimes. This research aims to employ paleolimnological methods to examine the potential impact of calcareous road dust on the aquatic ecosystems close to the Dempster Highway, as well as the possible effects from a warming climate. Lake sediment cores were taken from two impacted lakes adjacent to the highway (FM 02 and FM 04) and from one reference lake (FM 06) located a <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> distance <b>away</b> that it is outside the range of dust transport. Through analyses of water chemistry, it was discovered that both the dust from the Dempster Highway and retrogressive thaw slumps in the surrounding area have an extensive impact on certain water chemistry variables (i. e. conductivity, pH, Ca+ 2, etc.); However, elemental profiles of the sediment cores revealed no signal from calcareous road dust in lake FM 02. The NPP exhibited a clear shift to genera that prefer both warmer and more humid climates, as well as increased nutrients, all products of regional warming and increased influx of calcareous road dust during construction of the Dempster Highway. This research will help the Department of Transportation and Department of Natural Resources in making regulatory decisions regarding new infrastructure in the Canadian Arctic...|$|R
