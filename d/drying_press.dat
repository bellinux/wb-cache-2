40|$|This article {{reports the}} impacts of three {{different}} drying treatments on selected physical and mechanical properties of European (Populus tremula L.) and hybrid (P. tremula × tremuloides) aspen wood. The material originates from 5 European aspen stands and 7 hybrid aspen stands in southern and central Finland. After processing the logs at a saw mill, sawn timber samples were dried using 1) conventional warm air <b>drying,</b> 2) <b>press</b> <b>drying,</b> or 3) heat treatment into Thermo-S grade by the Finnish Thermowood ® method. Finally, small clearwood specimens were manufactured from different within-stem positions for the measurements of physical and mechanical properties. Both <b>press</b> <b>dried</b> and heat treated specimens absorbed water at significantly slower pace than the conventionally dried specimens. In normal climate, the conventionally <b>dried,</b> <b>press</b> <b>dried</b> and heat treated specimens conditioned at equilibrium mois-ture contents of 12. 2, 8. 7, and 8. 9 per cent, respectively. It appears that the butt logs between 2 – 6 metres contain the lightest and, thus, weakest wood in aspen stems. Radial compression strength was at its highest in heat treated specimens, whereas conventionally and <b>press</b> <b>dried</b> specimens {{did not differ from}} each other. <b>Press</b> <b>dried</b> specimens had the highest longitudinal compression strength, also heat treated specimens showed higher values than the conven...|$|R

Sintering behaviour as dependence of water absorption of <b>dry</b> <b>pressed</b> test samples made from different fluxes (zeolite, sodium-potassium feldspar) and binder (kaolin) on the firing temperature (1150 – 1300 °C) were analysed. Zeolite is very intensive fluxing agent compared with sodium-potassium feldspar. Zeolite with kaolin creates body (after firing) with lower coefficient of linear thermal expansion. Thanks to higher content of ferric oxides is not suitable for whiteware, because the colour of the sintered body is dark (brown) ...|$|R
