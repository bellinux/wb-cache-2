5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} historian Yahya of Antioch, the conspirators of 1022 were released by Constantine VIII after Basil's death in 1025, but Xiphias remained in exile until 1028, when the new emperor, Romanos III, released him. Xiphias, however, was by now too old and weary, and soon retired to the Stoudios Monastery. Nothing further <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from fighting Dyer ran various boxing gyms in London, successfully managing British flyweight champion Bert Kirby. Dyer {{then became a}} physical culture coach and was {{at the forefront of}} a diet fad in the 1920s based on fruit and vegetable drinks. Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> his life after the Second World War and he faded into anonymity.|$|E
5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E

Their sister Joan was a nun at Shaftesbury Abbey until her death in 1384.|$|E
5|$|First {{collected}} in 1964, it was formally described in 2009. The species {{may be most}} closely related to O.concolor and O.mamorae, which are distributed further north and south in South America. Among other characters, the three share a particular arrangement of the arteries of the head. Virtually nothing <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> its biology.|$|E
5|$|Her {{rule was}} finally ended by the {{politician}} Aulus Postumius, after she opted against Roman suppression. Very little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest of}} her life, but she was eventually succeeded by Gentius in 181 BC. According to the folklore of the modern inhabitants of Risan, Teuta ended her life in grief by throwing herself from Orjen Peak.|$|E
50|$|The {{species are}} based on male {{genitalia}} characters and only two females are described, A. musci and A. antecalvus.

5|$|Hygeberht (died after 803) was the Bishop of Lichfield from 779 and Archbishop of Lichfield {{after the}} {{elevation}} of Lichfield to an archdiocese some time after 787, {{during the reign of}} the powerful Mercian king Offa.

5|$|Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> Berhtwald's ancestry or {{his early}} life, {{but he was}} born around {{the middle of the}} seventh century. By 679, he was made abbot of the monastery at Reculver in Kent, and a charter dated May 679 names Berhtwald as abbot. This charter, from Hlothere, King of Kent, is the {{earliest}} surviving original Anglo-Saxon charter.|$|E
