I {{did not try to}} write a story of slaver, as I might very well have done; I did not imitate either the make or the manner of Mrs. Stowe's romance; I kept on at my imitation of Pope's pastorals, which I dare say I thought much finer, and worthier the powers of such a poet as I meant to be. I did this, as I must have felt then, at some personal risk of a supernatural kind, for my studies were apt to be prolonged into the night after {{the rest of the family}} had gone to bed, and a certain ghost, which I had every reason to fear, might very well have visited the small room given me to write in. There was a story, which I shrank from verifying, that a former inmate of our house had hung himself in it, but I do not know to this day whether it was true or not. The doubt did not prevent him from dangling at the door-post, in my consciousness, and many a time I shunned the sight of this problematical suicide by keeping my eyes fastened on the book before me.

As the design and development was almost completely finished by the time of actual start on literature study and thesis work, I was very glad to be invited to the kick-off meeting of Delfi-n 3 Xt. As I indicated preference for working on the structural subsystem or the electrical power subsystem, and Robert Teuling had already started preliminary work on the electrical power subsystem, I started on the structural subsystem.
