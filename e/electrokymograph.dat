40|$|The {{quantitative}} <b>electrokymograph</b> {{has been}} developed {{in an effort to}} provide an instrument which will be easier to operate than the electrokymographic equipment currently available. In addition, provision has been made for the recording of both border-motion phenomena and den-sitometric changes within the heart and great vessels. In the design of the instrument, consider-able attention has been directed toward the development of a means whereby electrokymographic tracings may be calibrated. Care has also been exercised in the instrument's design in order to provide a frequency response that is essentially flat from 0 to 40 cycles per second. SINCE its development a few years ago,' the <b>electrokymograph</b> has been used by a number of workers to study the border motions of the heart and great vessels. Early investigations have been concerned primarily writh an examination of the normal movements of these structures. 2 ' 3 More recently, however, the study of a number of pathologic states has been undertaken. Characteristic electrokymo-graphic tracings have now been identified in myocardial infarction, 4 5 constrictive pericar-ditis, 6 a variety of valvular lesions, 7 -' 0 and ventricular and aortic aneurysms. " In addition to its use in the study of border motions, the <b>electrokymograph</b> has been ap-plied to a limited extent in the recording of densitometric changes within the heart and lungs. By these densitometric studies, it has been possible to estimate cardiac output ' and pulmonary arterial pressure ' with some suc-cess. Although much good work has been done with the <b>electrokymograph,</b> a number of de-ficiencies within the instrument have seriously limited its application. First, it has not been possible to calibrate the amplitudes of electro-kymographic tracings in terms of the physio-logic phenomena which have produced them. This applies not only when one has used the instrument to record cardiac and vascular bor-der motions, but also when one has applied the device to study the densitometric changes of a structure.

Confirmation of this work has been reported by others (3. 5, 6). Our studies were designed to investigate the accuracy with which movements of the aorta and pulmonary artery could be re-corded with this instrument, and the significance of these movements as measures of dynamic car-diovascular changes during certain acute disturb-ances of the circulation. For these experiments, acute intrathoracic pressure variation was chosen as the implement for the production of circula-tory disturbances. It is a procedure with which a new investigative method may be evaluated by comparison with observations of venous, arterial and pulmonary arterial blood pressure. cardiac output, roentgenokymographv, and roentgeno-graphic lung density in control studies or in the published reports of others. The <b>electrokymograph</b> utilizes the roentgen ray beam of the fluoroscope. When the long axis of a small rectangle of fluoroscopic screen is placed perpendicular to the pulsating border of the heart or a great vessel, the average intensity of illumi-nation of the whole rectangle will vary with the motion of the border. When movements of a great vessel are recorded, the dense shadow moves outward in systole to diminish the intensity and in diastole the reverse occurs. These changes in illumination, when viewed by a sensitive photo-electric tube, are converted to electrical impulses which are recorded by an electrocardiographic apparatus...|$|E
40|$|IN essence, electrokymography is {{a method}} of {{recording}} the repeated pulsating motions exhibited by the heart and great vessels. A photosensi-tive tube is used to pick up variations in the light emitted by a fluoroscopic screen placed over {{the border of the}} cardiovascular stripe. The device, in its present form, was originally developed during the war years with the hope of obtaining an apparatus which might be applicable to mass screening technics in the investigation of heart disease. Although many individuals contributed ideas and suggestions for its development, Drs. B. R. Boone, G. C. Henny, and W. Edward Chamberlain are among those primarily responsible for the present development of the apparatus reported on in this paper. 1 * 2 Earlier work by Hjelmare, 3 Heckmann 4 and others has been reviewed by Luisada et al. 6 The history of the development of roent-genkymography, parent of electrokymography, is well known.

40|$|Several electrokymographs were {{subjected}} to study of their recording fidelity. Distortions were found in respect to time and amplitude of recorded response. The recording defects were analyzed quantitatively, {{and the degree to}} which the various components of the <b>electrokymograph</b> contribute to these distortions was measured. The significance of these deviations in recording fidelity is discussed in reference to the application of the electrokymlograph to the study of cardiovascular dynamics. T HE ELECTROKYMOGIRAPH was de-vised to record the border motions of the heart and great vessels. '- ' Although simple in operation, the instrument is complex in principle. In ordinary fluoroscopy, an x-ray beam, pulsating at 120 cycles per second, passes differentially through the thoracic tissues and causes characteristic shadows and translucen-cies to appear on a fluoroscopic viewscreen. The process of electrokymography interposes another small rectangle of fluoroscopic screen placed perpendicularly to the moving border of the desired objective. The changes in inten-sity of illumination of this screen are converted by a photomultiplier tube to changes in milli-volt output from the tube. These millivolt changes are recorded by an electrocardiograph after passage through an electrical filter. The filter is a complex system of condensers and resistors, designed to eliminate the 120 cycle per second pulsations of the x-ray beam with-out interfering with the lower frequency changes in fluoroscopic screen illumination. As with any apparatus, knowledge of the recording fidelity is essential. Wave motions generated on the fluoroscopic receptor slot might be distorted in each of the several essential components of the electrokymograph: (1) The fluoroscopic screen, (2) the photomultiplier tube, (3) the filter, and (4) the electrocardio-graphic recorder.
