40|$|Extrapolation [6] {{involves}} {{taking a}} certain linear {{combination of the}} numerical solutions of a base method applied with different stepsizes to obtain greater accuracy. This linear combination is done so as to eliminate the leading error term. Extrapolation can be applied in two different ways: 1) In the active mode the <b>extrapolated</b> <b>value</b> is used to propagate the numerical solution at each step; 2) in the passive mode extrapolation is carried out only at points where greater accuracy is desired but where the solutions of the base method are propagated without using the <b>extrapolated</b> <b>value.</b> The technique of extrapolation in ac-celerating convergence has been used successfully in the numerical solution of non-stiff ordinary differential equations (Gragg [4], Bulirsch and Stoer [2]). Gragg introduced the smoothing formula for the explicit midpoint rule while Bulirsch and Stoer developed the first code ODEX for the “Gragg-Bulirsch-Stoer algo-rithm ” using the explicit midpoint rule as the base method. Meanwhile, the first successful extrapolation code developed for stiff problems is METAN 1 by Bader and Deuflhard [1] which implements the linearly implicit midpoint rule. In this study we investigate the implicit midpoint rule (IMR) denoted by M for stiff problems. For example, consider the problem y′(x) = qy(x), y(0) = 1, where q is a large negative number.
