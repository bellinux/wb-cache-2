25|$|C-PTSD also {{differs from}} {{continuous}} traumatic stress disorder (CTSD), which was {{introduced into the}} trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable {{to the effects of}} exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic {{as well as to the}} effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.|$|E
25|$|In {{examining}} femicide in Ciudad Juárez, it {{is important}} to consider the impact of the drug trade. Juárez is the seat of the Mexican drug cartel which has resulted in <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> that have been directed at the Mexican population. It is believed that the femicide in Ciudad Juárez may be related to the powerful drug cartels along the border. Further, gangs have become a permanent threat particularly to women on the border. Gang activity creates high risk for women especially due to very little institutional protection.|$|E

50|$|People have {{different}} views about cartoons {{and the violence}} within them. Some researchers believe that <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in cartoons can make children more aggressive.

Output aimed at {{children as young as}} seven, which include a number of cartoons, had the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|R

500|$|Despite better {{relations}} with the police, The Bill has still not been without controversy. [...] The Bill has been repeatedly criticised for the <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> portrayed in its scenes, especially prior to 2009 when it occupied a pre-watershed timeslot. Specific story lines have also come under fire in the media, such as that surrounding a gay kiss in 2002, {{as well as an}} episode broadcast in March 2008 which featured a fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis, leading the MS Society to brand the plot [...] "grossly irresponsible".|$|E
500|$|Mexico {{is among}} the most {{dangerous}} countries on the planet in which to practice journalism, particularly on the topics of organized crime and drug trafficking. Since 2000, nearly 100 journalists have been kidnapped or killed throughout the country; many of the killings, however, remain unsolved and unpunished. [...] The <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and attacks on the press have forced many local media outlets to downplay their coverage. As a result, many people have turned to social media outlets like Valor por Tamaulipas to see hourly updates on the security atmosphere in their areas. But social media reporting carries its own risks too; in September 2011, journalist and blogger María Elizabeth Macías Castro was decapitated by Los Zetas for posting their organized crime activities in her personal blog. That same month, two alleged Twitter users were killed and hanged on a bridge in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas for denouncing on Twitter.|$|E

2500|$|While Guatemala has {{achieved}} {{some forms of}} reparation, it faces significant instability and social inequality. Many of the estimated 1.5 million people displaced by the civil war have remained displaced. One million people migrated to the United States. In addition, in 2005, there were 5,338 murders in a total population of 12 million. The <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and instability in Guatemala are exemplified by a clash between protesters and police in October 2012, when police opened fire {{on a group of}} protesting teachers, killing seven. [...] The country still has high rates of poverty, illiteracy, infant mortality and malnutrition.|$|E
2500|$|Housing in San Francisco {{was at a}} premium, and {{abandoned}} ships whose crews had headed for the mines were often converted to temporary lodging. In the gold fields themselves living conditions were primitive, though the mild climate proved attractive. Supplies were expensive and food poor, typical diets consisting mostly of pork, beans, and whiskey. These highly male, transient communities with no established institutions were prone to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> drunkenness, profanity, and greed-driven behavior. Without courts or law officers in the mining communities to enforce claims and justice, miners developed their own ad hoc legal system, based on the [...] "mining codes" [...] used in other mining communities abroad. Each camp had its own rules and often handed out justice by popular vote, sometimes acting fairly and at times exercising vigilantism—with Indians, Mexicans, and Chinese generally receiving the harshest sentences.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{communities}} with <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> {{do not provide}} the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy.

2500|$|Since the 1980s {{violent crimes}} in the United States have been {{steadily}} declining. Between 1980 and 1990, the murder rate for the United States fell by 9%, and between 1973 and 1992, the victimization rate of rapes fell by 28%. [...] "Although rates of crime may be going down for the United States generally, they are spirally upward for one specific group of Americans: African Americans." [...] Douglas Massey argues that the rising of African American poverty {{and the addition of}} racial segregation produces a sharp increase in the geographic concentration of poverty. He continues by stating that [...] "as poverty is concentrated… all things associated with it are concentrated, including crime… thus… creating an ecological niche characterized by <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and a high risk of victimization". Furthermore, Massey argues that a person living within this niche becomes violent themselves in an effort to deter potential criminals and increase their chance of survival, thus creating a cycle of African American violence which at some point cannot be reversed.|$|E
