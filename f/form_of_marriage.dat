5|$|Marriage most {{commonly}} involved a betrothal (engue), before the bride was {{given over to}} her new husband and kyrios (ekdosis). A less common <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> practised {{in the case of}} epikleroi, required a court judgement (epidikasia). Athenian women married with a dowry, which was intended to provide their livelihood. Depending on the family, a dowry might have been as much as 25 percent of the family's wealth. Daughters of even the poorest families apparently had dowries worth ten minae. Rich families could provide much larger dowries; Demosthenes' sister, for instance, had a dowry of two talents (120 minae). Dowries usually consisted of movable goods and cash, although land was occasionally included.|$|E

25|$|The women's rights {{movements}} in these nations {{want to make}} monogamy the only legal <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> The United Nations joined these efforts in 1979 when the General Assembly adopted the , an international bill of rights for women that over 180 nations have agreed to implement. Article 16 of the Convention requires nations to give women and men equal rights in marriage. Polygamy is interpreted as inconsistent with Article 16 when it extends the right of multiple spouses to men but not to women. The United Nations has established the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to monitor the progress of nations implementing the Convention. The United Nations is thus working through the Convention and CEDAW to promote women's equality by making monogamy the only legal <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism permit total {{personal}} autonomy in interpretation of Jewish Law, and intermarriage is not forbidden. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis {{are free to}} take their own approach to performing marriages between a Jewish and non-Jewish partner. Many, but not all, seek agreement from the couple that the children will be raised as Jewish. In other words, Judaism does not exist as a Law, but as a voluntary lifestyle, to be tweaked as desired. This allows for any <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to be officiated at by a Reform rabbi, so long as all parties involved label their lifestyle as Jewish.|$|E
25|$|Though {{celestial}} {{marriage is}} the only <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> recognized as a sacrament, the church permits sex within government-recognized marital unions, the notable exceptions being same-sex marriage, common law marriage, civil unions (in jurisdictions where marriage is available), and polygamy. The church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy, and entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, will result in mandatory consideration of church discipline and possible excommunication. Today, the church's teachings allow married couples to decide what is appropriate sexual behavior between themselves. The law of chastity has also been interpreted to include various standards of modesty, which have varied according to cultural norms of the time. Serious offenses {{of the law of}} chastity may result in church discipline, including the possibility of excommunication.|$|E
25|$|Polyandry is {{believed}} to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources, as it {{is believed}} to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> that exists not only among poor families, but also the elite. For example, in the Himalayan Mountains polyandry is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In Europe, this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance (the disinheriting of most siblings, many of whom went on to become celibate monks and priests).|$|E

25|$|Forced {{prostitution}} and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, {{and can be}} found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because {{they do not want to}} abandon their child.|$|E
25|$|A {{wife was}} also {{seen as being}} of high value, and was therefore, usually, {{carefully}} looked after. Early nomadic communities practised a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> known as beena, in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession (specifically, Jael, Sarah, and Jacob's wives). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted; {{in the case of}} wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Polyandry is {{believed}} to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources. It {{is believed}} to limit human population growth and enhance child survival.

If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In contrast, very poor persons not owning land were less likely to practice polyandry in Buddhist Ladakh and Zanskar. In Europe, the splitting up of land was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance. For example, disinheriting most siblings where many of whom then became celibate monks and priests.|$|E

25|$|Much of the Caribbean {{economic}} development was contingent to Europeans' demand for sugar, which plantation owners traded for European and North American manufactured goods. Saint Domingue also had extensive coffee, cocoa, and indigo plantations, {{but these were}} smaller and less profitable than the wealthy sugar plantations. Starting in the 1730s, French engineers constructed complex irrigation systems to increase sugarcane production. By the 1740s Saint-Domingue, together with Jamaica, had become the main supplier of the world's sugar. Sugar production depended on extensive manual labor provided by enslaved Africans in the harsh Saint-Domingue colonial plantation economy. Saint-Domingue was the most profitable French colony in the entire world, indeed {{one of the most}} profitable of all the European colonies in the 18th century, with an average of 600 ships engaged every year in shipping products from Saint-Domingue to Bordeaux and the value of Saint-Domingue's goods almost equal in value to all of the products shipped from the British 13 colonies to Great Britain. The economic importance of St. Domingue to France {{can be seen in the}} livelihood of 1 million out of the 25 million or so people who lived in the Kingdom of France in 1789 depended directly upon the imports of coffee, indigo and sugar from St. Domingue, and several million indirectly depended upon trade from France's richest colony to maintain their standard of living. To sustain the sugar production amid the unhealthy climate of the Caribbean with malaria and yellow fever running rampant was slavery. In one year alone, namely 1787, the French imported about 20, 000 slaves from Africa into Saint-Domingue while the British imported about 38, 000 slaves to all of their Caribbean colonies. The death rate from yellow fever was such that at least 50% of the slaves imported from Africa died within a year of arriving, and as such the masters preferred to work their slaves as hard as possible while providing with them with the barest minimum of food and shelter, calculating that it was better to get the most work out of their slaves with lowest possible expense possible since they were probably going to die of yellow fever anyway. The death rate was so high that polyandry - one woman being married to several men at the same time - came to be a common <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> among the slaves. As slaves had no legal rights, rape by the masters was a common occurrence on the plantations.|$|E
