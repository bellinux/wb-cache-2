40|$|Does {{competition}} among financial intermediaries lead to excessively low standards? To examine this question, we construct a model where intermediaries design contracts to attract trading volume, {{taking into consideration}} that traders differ in credit quality and may default. When credit quality is observable, intermediaries demand the "right" amount of guarantees. A monopolist would demand fewer <b>guarantees.</b> <b>Private</b> information about <b>credit</b> quality has an ambiguous effect in a competitive environment. When the cost of default is large (small), private information leads to higher (lower) standards. We exhibit examples where private information is present and competition produces higher standards than monopoly does. © 2001 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R
30|$|Consistent {{with recent}} {{information}} asymmetry literature, information-sharing bureaus are measured by assessing public <b>credit</b> bureaus and <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries (Triki and Gajigo 2014; Asongu et al. 2016). Asongu et al. (2016) have documented six distinguishing characteristics between public <b>credit</b> bureaus and <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries, notably: purpose, coverage, status, ownership, data sources used, and access. First, whereas <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries {{are made up}} of public institutions that are constituted within the framework of supervising the banking sector, public credit bureaus are created in response to the need and demand for information on borrowers in the banking market. Hence, data from <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries, usually employed to examine the creditworthiness of clients, could also be acknowledged as a collateral benefit or by-product of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries. Second, while the coverage engendered by <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries is restricted in terms of information (or data) type and history provided, public credit bureaus extend beyond the scope of large corporations and include small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) that are characterized by richer data and longer histories. Third, whereas public credit bureaus are fundamentally established for profit making, <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries are not primarily focused on profits. Fourth, on the issue of ownership, whereas public credit registries belong to governments and/or central banks, the ownership of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> bureaus revolve outside highlighted establishments (central banks and governments) to include lenders, lenders’ associates, and independent third parties. Fifth, while the data used by <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries are sourced from non-bank and bank financial establishments, data from public <b>credit</b> bureaus entails <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries, tax authorities, courts and utilities, to sources employed by <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries for information. Sixth, access to <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries (public credit bureaus) is restricted to providers of information (open to all lender types).|$|R

40|$|International trade {{relies on}} trade finance (credit or insurance) by {{financial}} institutions. Data limitations, however, {{have made it}} difficult to quantify the impact of changes in the supply of trade finance on trade. This paper is the first to establish a causal link between the supply of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurance and exports. I overcome endogeneity issues by using a unique bilateral data set which covers the activities from 1992 to 2006 of one of the world's leading <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurers. This database enables me to use the insurer's claim ratio - a primary determinant of the supply of credit insurance - as an instrument for insured exports. Subsequently, applying the method of instrumental variables and a variety of trade models, I consistently find a positive and statistically significant effect of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurance on exports. The estimates are economically relevant and suggest that, depending on the decline in the supply of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurance during the 2008 - 09 international trade collapse, the reduction in private insurance exposure explains about 5 to 9 percent of the drop in world exports and 10 to 20 percent of the drop in European exports. trade finance; <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurance; international trade; trade credit...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} widely used {{indicators}} of financial development in the empirical literature is the <b>Private</b> <b>Credit</b> to GDP ratio. A key shortcoming of this measure {{is that it does not}} distinguish between the share of credit extended to households vis-a-vis firms. It is our contention that this distinction is crucial to analyze the effects of financial development on the trade balance: Changes in the composition of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> should have an impact on the foreign trade deficit. Our empirical findings show that: 1) <b>Private</b> <b>credit</b> to households is negatively and significantly correlated with net exports; 2) <b>Private</b> <b>credit</b> to firms is not significantly correlated with net exports; and 3) The allocation of credit matters; a higher proportion of firm credit is positively and significantly correlated with net exports. A key implication of these results is that, whenever there is a sizeable trade deficit or a high risk of a currency crisis, policy makers should limit the growth of household credit while, at the same time, encourage further allocation of funds to firms. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{second result}} reveals {{unidirectional}} causation from loan {{interest rates to}} <b>private</b> sector <b>credit,</b> confirming their long-run relationship. The third result indicates unidirectional causation from <b>private</b> sector <b>credit</b> to the exchange rate. The reverse is not true. This implies that exchange rates do not necessarily affect <b>private</b> sector <b>credit.</b> Indeed, results from the normalized cointegrating equation reveal that exchange rates are not significant in the long-run <b>private</b> sector <b>credit</b> equation. Similarly, short-run dynamics in the VEC model show that the coefficient of the ECT in the exchange rate equation is not significant although it bears the expected negative sign. The fourth result reveals bi-directional causation between core CPI and <b>private</b> sector <b>credit,</b> implying that inflation affects <b>private</b> sector <b>credit</b> and that the reverse is also true.|$|R

We use estimation results obtained for a panel of small open OECD economies (out-of-sample sample) to derive the equilibrium credit level for a panel of transition economies (in-sample panel). We opt for this (out-of-sample) approach because the coefficient estimates for transition economies are fairly unstable.
