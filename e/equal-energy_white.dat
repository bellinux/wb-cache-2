40|$|AbstractChromatic {{induction}} from patterned backgrounds {{depends on}} the spatial {{as well as the}} chromatic aspects of the background light. Color appearance with patterned and uniform backgrounds was compared using chromaticities distinguished by only the S cones; all backgrounds were equivalent to <b>equal-energy</b> <b>white</b> in terms of L-cone and M-cone stimulation. The measurements showed larger shifts in color appearance with a patterned chromatic background than with a uniform background at any chromaticity within the pattern. The measurements also showed that inducing light within different spatial regions could cause opposite shifts in color appearance: inducing light near a test field shifted appearance toward the inducing chromaticity (assimilation), while the same light some distance from the test shifted appearance away from the inducing chromaticity (simultaneous contrast). The shifts in color appearance were accounted for by a neural receptive field with S-cone spatial antagonism...|$|E
40|$|Age-related {{changes in}} the {{temporal}} properties of an S-cone pathway were characterized by the psychophysical impulse-response function (IRF). Participants included 49 color-normal observers {{ranging in age from}} 16. 8 to 86. 3 years. A double-pulse method was used to measure the IRF with S-cone modulation at constant luminance. Stimuli were presented as a Gaussian patch (± 1 SD= 2. 3 °) in one of four quadrants around a central fixation cross on a CRT screen. The test stimulus was modulated from the <b>equal-energy</b> <b>white</b> of the background toward the short-wave spectrum locus. Each of the two pulses (6. 67 ms) was separated by an interstimulus interval (ISI) from 20 to 720 ms. Chromatic detection thresholds were determined by a four-alternative forced-choice method with staircases for each ISI in one session. IRFs were calculated from the threshold data using a model with four parameters of an exponentially damped sine wave. S-cone IRFs have only an excitatory phase and a much longer time course compared with IRFs for luminance modulation measured with the same apparatus. The results demonstrated significant age-related losses in IRF amplitude, but the latency (time to peak) of the IRF was stable with age. © 2006 Optical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChromatic {{discrimination}} thresholds {{were measured}} under conditions which yielded fine and degraded discrimination steps. Discrimination {{was assessed by}} identification of the location of one of four homogeneous equiluminant stimuli arranged in a square or with pseudoisochromatic (PIC) figures using the stimulus design of Regan, Reffin and Mollon (Vis Res 1994; 34 : 1279 – 1299). Stimuli were presented on CRT monitors and specified in units of cone trolands. They were viewed within a surround metameric to the equal energy spectrum. L troland threshold versus retinal illuminance (TVR) functions were measured by four-alternative spatial forced-choice staircase procedures for (1) a four 1 × 1 ° equiluminant stimuli arranged in a square and (2) ‘C’ shaped pseudoisochromatic figures in which the observer had to identify the gap location. The ‘C’ was constructed of spatially discrete patches of varying size and luminance {{to ensure that the}} observer's responses depended on chromatic signals. The TVR functions appeared V-shaped and were similar for the two paradigms. The minimum occurred near the L excitation of <b>equal-energy</b> <b>white.</b> The PIC stimuli yielded poorer discrimination with the TVR function being displaced by ∼ 0. 5 log unit. Discrimination for stimuli degraded by luminance and spatial noise presented within an achromatic appearing surround is sharpest near the chromaticity metameric to the equal energy spectrum...|$|E
