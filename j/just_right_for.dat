25|$|Barkley Canyon {{extends from}} the {{continental}} shelf edge at 400 m down the continental slope to the canyon axis at 985 m water depth. Located {{at the leading edge}} of the Cascadia subduction zone, this site supports the study of the accretionary prism, where the sediments pile along the continental slope as they are scraped off the subducting or descending tectonic plate. This is also a location where pressure, temperature, gas saturation, and local biological and chemical conditions are <b>just</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> exposed gas hydrates to be stable on the seafloor. Gas hydrates have gas molecules, typically methane in marine environments, trapped within “cages” of water molecules. This gives them a crystalline structure that resembles ice and can appear as white to yellow mounds covered by sediment on the seafloor.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{commented on}} the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A. E. Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brienza of Anime News Network (ANN) felt that {{the result was a}} strong storyline, but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for ANN, {{suggested}} that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot. [...] Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action. Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as [...] "dramatic, exciting, and <b>just</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the story he's telling".|$|E
500|$|The {{music that}} is played during the parody of The King's Speech is [...] "Symphony No. 7" [...] by Ludwig van Beethoven, and a musical piece from the Swan Lake ballet is played during the Black Swan parody. For the King of the Hill visual gag, the Simpsons staff {{acquired}} the rights to use the actual theme song from that show. The {{music that is}} played as Krusty performs his new show in front of adults at the theater {{is a mixture of}} the old Krusty theme and the theme from Playboy After Dark, a television show hosted by Hugh Hefner that started airing in the 1960s and featured parties from a Playboy club. This musical combination was composed by Alf Clausen after The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma came with the suggestion. On his blog, Ledesma wrote that theme for Playboy After Dark [...] "was cool and jazzy and <b>just</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> its time. Alf’s homage to that theme, wrapped around Krusty’s theme was very clever indeed." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is <b>just</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Miller of Rolling Stone {{condemned}} Harrison for releasing {{an album}} with his voice blown {{and for his}} apparent disdain towards the Beatles' legacy, and he dismissed the song as [...] "a raspy stab at 'Auld Lang Syne'". Amid the scathing critique he gave Harrison's tour and album, Jack Sheridan of Baltimore radio station WCAO cited [...] "Ding Dong" [...] {{as an example of}} how the former Beatle's music had altered [...] "so radically". Writing in Circus Raves magazine, Michael Gross defended Harrison's move away from the past, saying that Dark Horse matched the critically acclaimed All Things Must Pass, [...] "surpassing it, at times, with its clarity of production and lovely songs", and he praised [...] "Ding Dong", the title track and the Harrison–Ron Wood collaboration [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "all, simply, good songs". While remarking on the surprisingly late release for a holiday-season single, Billboards reviewer deemed the track to be an [...] "Extremely listenable performance" [...] and added: [...] "George has a genuine hit sound to offer here that's <b>just</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> those early January time-to-change resolutions. Catchy, heavily percussive production in Harrison's uptempo guru vein … Get on it, jocks." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Bazlen won the {{starring}} role in the children’s program The Blue Fairy, broadcast by the independent station WGN-TV in Chicago on Monday nights (7.30pm–8.00pm). It {{was one of the}} earliest children’s shows to be produced in color. The producer of the show had spotted Bazlen playing hopscotch outside of Bazlen's Chicago home and told Bazlen's mother that [...] "your little girl is <b>just</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> my TV series". In the show, the Blue Fairy, played by Bazlen, lived in the “Blue Forest." [...] Dressed in a blue gown and diamond tiara, she also clasped a [...] silver wand. At the beginning of each show, Bazlen, suspended by wires, would fly (as if on elfin wings) across the stage saying “I’m the Blue Fairy, I’ll grant you a wish to make all your dreams come true." [...] She would then sit on an oversized mushroom visited by creatures such as Tugnacious R. Jones, Myrtle Flower, and an old nasal voiced wizard (which were puppets designed by George Nelle and writer-director Don Kane), and introduced stories enacted by the Rufus Rose Marionettes. They also engaged in various projects which included constructing a popcorn machine that would not stop popping and making a sewing machine that turned out marbles. Bazlen won enormous critical praise for her performance (one critic describing it as “beguiling” and “mesmerising” and Hedda Hopper declared Bazlen “the Celtic Alice in Wonderland”) and the show was recognised as the top children’s program of 1958 winning a Peabody Award. Bazlen herself said of her role that she [...] "flew around and had a wonderful time." [...] Although The Blue Fairy could only be seen locally in Chicago on Channel 9, the Peabody Award it won brought it and Bazlen to national attention. Furthermore, the show also inspired Ernie Kovacs into doing one of his notorious comedy sketches where Kovacs (wearing a mustache, chewing a cigar, dressed in a blue gown and blonde wig, and holding a silver wand) flew across a stage, slammed head first into a wall on the opposite side, and was then left dangling lifelessly (in mock fashion) in mid-air.|$|E
