50|$|The tramway {{remained}} in operation over its full length {{for close to}} a century. The section between Cwt y Bugail and Rhiwbach was lifted in 1956 and the section from Cwt y Bugail to Maenofferen was closed in 1961 and lifted in 1964. The first incline {{was replaced by a}} road, but a short section {{remained in}} use between the mills at Maenofferen and the foot of No 2 Incline, which became the last remaining <b>gravity</b> <b>incline</b> in the North Wales slate industry. This section was finally closed in 1976 after a new quarry road was built connecting the upper levels of Llechwedd with the mills at Maenofferen. Most of the track was lifted, although short sections of track remained intact as late as 2013.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} weekly {{nonlinear}} convection in a horizontal mushy layer under suitable assumptions and approximations in a <b>gravity</b> <b>inclined</b> environment is studied analytically by applying a modified perturbation technique. The finite amplitude {{solution for the}} weakly nonlinear problem is obtained under a near eutectic approximation, large far field temperature and for large Stefan number in a <b>gravity</b> <b>inclined</b> environment. Specific information {{with regard to the}} convective solutions are obtained with regard to the behaviour of the system. From the results it appears that the chimney formation gets promoted as the system gets destabilised when the concentration ratio is increased while, the formation of chimneys occurs at a larger Darcy Rayleigh number when the concentration ratio is decreased. Also, it is found that the gravity inclination reduces the tendency for chimney formation under the given physical conditions. It is concluded that by a proper choice of the inclination parameter and the governing parameters, it is possible to have a good control over the formation of chimneys convection so that the appearance of freckles in the resulting solid during the solidification process could be avoided. The results are in excellent agreement with the available results in the limiting cases...|$|R
50|$|Anthracite {{was being}} mined {{near the mouth}} of Racket Brook by 1820. The mining was done by William and Maurice Wurts, founders of the Delaware and Hudson Enterprise, which singlehandedly allowed the {{anthracite}} industry in the mid and upper Lackawanna River watershed to develop. Historically, the Racket Brook Colliery was in the stream's vicinity. It was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Coal Company. However, by the early 1900s, it had been abandoned and most of its buildings were torn down. Historic sites in the watershed of Racket Brook include the D&H sites and <b>Gravity</b> <b>Inclines</b> in Carbondale and the Racket Brook Vault in Carbondale Township. The first D&H <b>gravity</b> railroad <b>inclined</b> plane began operations {{at the mouth of the}} stream in 1829. The Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan proposed a Heritage Landing at this site.|$|R
50|$|From about 1857 mineral {{traffic at}} Consett became very {{difficult}} to operate. The railways had been built to take heavy minerals from the area downhill to the Tyne and the coast, but now iron ore was being brought in from the Cleveland districts to the east, and from Whitehaven in the west, requiring a long uphill haul. As much of these routes was over rope-worked inclines, this was an expensive and slow business. In {{the case of the}} self-acting (<b>gravity)</b> <b>inclines,</b> locomotive assistance was brought in; in some cases to propel the loaded uphill set.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} predecessor to the Penrhyn Quarry Railway was the {{one mile}} (1.6 km) long [...] gauge Llandegai Tramway which was built in 1798. The tramway was connected to a local flint mill that ground clay and chert into flints. These were transported to Porth Penrhyn on the coast by the tramway, {{which was one of}} the earliest overground railways in Britain. It included two balanced <b>gravity</b> <b>inclines</b> one from the floor of the Cegin valley near Llandegai to the hills above Bangor, the other dropping from there to the mill. Both inclines used vertically mounted winding drums.|$|R
5000|$|Brampton Railway was reconfigured in 1836, and {{included}} a <b>gravity</b> balanced <b>inclined</b> plane between Kirkhouse and Hallbankgate. It had a maximum gradient of 1 in 17. The mineral lines above the plane were operated after 1840 by Stephenson's Rocket.|$|R

5000|$|A {{variation}} of the <b>gravity</b> balance <b>incline</b> was the [...] "tank" [...] incline found at several quarries in north Wales, notably the Dinorwic Quarry. These were worked by gravity, but instead of the wagons running on their own wheels, permanently attached angled wagons were used that had a horizontal platform on which the cargo-carrying wagons rode. Despite their name, these inclines were not a form of water balance incline.|$|R
50|$|The museum {{also has}} the largest working {{waterwheel}} in mainland Britain, which is available for viewing via several walkways. The waterwheel was constructed in 1870 by De Winton of Caernarfon and is 50 ft 5ins in diameter, 5 ft 3ins wide and was built around a 12in axle.

There are a number of water supply {{reservoirs}} in its watershed: the Brownell Reservoir, Carbondale Reservoir Number 4, and Carbondale Reservoir Number 7. Anthracite has been mined in the stream's vicinity as early as 1820. The Delaware and Hudson <b>Gravity</b> Railroad <b>inclined</b> plane existed at its mouth by 1829 and there were railroad lines along the stream by the 1880s. In the 20th century, a number of bridges were constructed across the stream. Racket Brook is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.|$|R

5000|$|At an {{altitude}} of over 1,000 ft and remote from usable roads, the deposits needed a form of transport to get the ore to South Wales. The West Somerset Mineral Railway, which included a 0.75 mi long <b>gravity</b> worked <b>incline</b> on a gradient of 1 in 4, was built to take the ore to Watchet Harbour where it was loaded onto ships {{to be sent to}} Ebbw Vale for smelting. At Burrow Farm Mine a [...] Cornish beam engine was installed around 1868 to pump water out of the mine. The mines provided employment for an average of 245 people between 1873 and 1882. Accommodation was also built for the mine workers.|$|R
500|$|The rise in {{altitude}} {{to reach}} the mines was accomplished by a <b>gravity</b> worked <b>incline,</b> [...] long, on a gradient of 1 in 4 (25%). To achieve the constant gradient, formidable earthworks were necessary, and construction took four years with a Mr Gunn as the contractor. While {{this was going on}} mining had been proceeding apace and large stocks of ore were waiting at the incline head to be conveyed to the harbour. Ore was brought down the incline while it was being completed, from 31 May 1858, and it was not fully finished until March 1861, when two [...] diameter winding drums were installed on a single axle, located below the track, at Brendon Hill. Public goods traffic was accepted from 28 September 1859.|$|R

The branch to the site was lifted in 1884 and the engines dismantled and sent to Ebbw Vale for reuse. The mine buildings were blown up by the Syndicate to provide ballast to <b>gravity</b> work the <b>incline</b> and, in 1909, hardcore infill for the timber jetty at Watchet.|$|R
40|$|The {{suspensions}} in {{the treatment}} of water, domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater can be separated into clarified fluid and solid matter by <b>gravity</b> settlers. <b>Inclined</b> plate settler (IPS) is a type of gravity settler. Its performance strongly depends on the inlet zone configuration. Three different inlet structures were used to develop a model that can describe the effect of the inlet configuration on the hydraulic characteristics of lab-scale IPS numerically and validate it experimentally. The results show that feeding the IPS by a nozzle distributor can enhance the hydraulic performance of the IPS. Based on the previous results, the response surface methodology (RSM) combined with numerical simulation was used to optimise this distributor. The optimisation of nozzle has improved the hydraulic performance, flow distribution between the settlers and the separation efficiency of the IPS. Finally, a sediment gutter on the plates with an inclination angle to collect the sediment and disposes it via a lateral outlets is suggested to improve the separation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a telepresence system to provide users {{with a highly}} realistic sensation using a motion base with limited degrees of freedom (DOF). Conventional studies using a limited DOF motion base have never investigated the generation of various inertial forces such as a transitional inertial force and a continuous inertial force. This is because the motion base can not realize the same motion as the real ride. This paper proposes a new telepresence system which can provide a user with an inertial force sensation using a motion base with rotational DOF and an immersive display. In our research, the various inertial forces are generated virtually with a component of acceleration of gravity and a visual stimulus which induces self-motion perception. The inertial force is generated with acceleration of <b>gravity</b> by <b>inclining</b> the motion base. The visual stimulus {{is given to the}} user by translating a view-point virtually with an image-based rendering approach. The magnitude of inertial force given to the user is determined from a ride motion estimated using an image sequence captured by an omnidirectional camera on the running ride. In experiment, a prototype system has successfully produced a highly realistic sensation in various environments...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a granular gas under {{the action of}} gravity, fluidized by a vibrating base. We show that a horizontal temperature gradient, here induced by limiting dissipative lateral walls (DLW), leads always to a granular thermal convection (DLW-TC) that is essentially different from ordinary buoyancy-driven convection (BD-TC). In an experiment where BD-TC is inhibited, by reducing <b>gravity</b> with an <b>inclined</b> plane, we always observe a DLW-TC cell next to each lateral wall. Such a cell squeezes towards the nearest wall as the gravity and/or the number of grains increase. Molecular dynamics simulations reproduce the experimental results and indicate that at large gravity or number of grains the DLW-TC is barely detectable.

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the current method for calculating a ship's vertical centre of <b>gravity</b> following <b>inclining</b> experiments is limited when considering magnitude of applied heel angle and accuracy achieved for certain hull-forms due to the assumption of unchanged metacentre position when the vessel is heeled. New methods for calculating the have been proposed, notably the Generalised and the Graphical methods. This paper aims to test these methods {{on a range of}} vessels, as well as present and contrast a new method named, the Polar method. The test will establish the error potential for each method using a purely technical software-simulated inclining experiment. Using the established error potential, a corrected is calculated from actual inclining values, which have been evaluated against the loading conditions for each vessel to see if the stability margins have been compromised. The study confirms the Classical method's dependency on applied heel angle magnitude, the change in waterplane area and that it compromises safety in some cases. The other methods, especially the Generalised and the Polar, produce very accurate results for any floating position of the vessel, highlighting the need to tear down the wall-sided assumption implicit in the Classical method and replace it with the better and more flexible methods...|$|R
40|$|Slow {{and dense}} {{granular}} flows often exhibit narrow shear bands, making them ill-suited for a continuum description. However, smooth granular flows {{have been shown}} to occur in specific geometries such as linear shear in the absence of <b>gravity,</b> slow <b>inclined</b> plane flows and, recently, flows in split-bottom Couette geometries. The wide shear regions in these systems should be amenable to a continuum description, and the theoretical challenge lies in finding constitutive relations between the internal stresses and the flow field. We propose a set of testable constitutive assumptions, including rate-independence, and investigate the additional restrictions on the constitutive relations imposed by the flow geometries. The wide shear layers in the highly symmetric linear shear and inclined plane flows are consistent with the simple constitutive assumption that, in analogy with solid friction, the effective-friction coefficient (ratio between shear and normal stresses) is a constant. However, this standard picture of granular flows is shown to be inconsistent with flows in the less symmetric split-bottom geometry - here the effective friction coefficient must vary throughout the shear zone, or else the shear zone localizes. We suggest that a subtle dependence of the effective-friction coefficient on the orientation of the sliding layers with respect to the bulk force is crucial for the understanding of slow granular flows.

5000|$|Hallbankgate {{stood at}} the top of a railway incline on the [...] "Lord Carlisle's Railway" [...] which linked Brampton Junction with the various mines and {{quarries}} in the vicinity of Hallbankgate. The Brampton Railway originated as a wooden wagonway on Tindale Fell. The mainline to Brampton Coal Staithe was built in 1798, and it was in operation in 1799. In 1808 the track was relaid using wrought iron rails, This was the first place where they were used commercially. The gauge was changed to [...] standard gauge, the gauge used by Stephenson. In 1836, the route below Hallbankgate was realigned to it could link with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway at Brampton Junction station. The incline from Kirkhouse had at one point a 1 in 17 gradient, adhesion engines could only work slopes up to 1 in 100, so this section of the track was operated as a <b>gravity</b> driven <b>inclined</b> plane. The line was worked by steam, and until 1840 the engine used was The Rocket. There was a passenger service but the line was mainly used to get the coal from the neighbouring mines to Brampton. There was an engine shed built at Hallbankgate, and above the village lines were laid to each pit. The line continued to Halton Lea Gate, but was extended to Lambley and Lambley Junction in 1852. The line finally closed in 1953. Blacksyke junction is just to the east of the village and the site on a level crossing to the west.|$|R
40|$|A two {{dimensional}} {{model of the}} deflected configuration of the bottom hole assembly of a drill string is developed in this thesis. The analytical solution of the governing equation of the beam-column problem is treated in matrix form using the transfer matrix method which permits the solution of boundary value problems. A simple, easy to use computer method is developed to solve problems including <b>gravity</b> effects in <b>inclined</b> holes, and multiple stabilizers in straight and curved holes, {{and the effect of}} approximating the actual variable compressive axial force with a constant force is studied. Results of the program describe the mechanical behavior of the drill string by solving for the drill string deflection, slope, moment and shear force at any point from the drill bit to the tangency point. From these results, stress and strain at any point, and the resultant force at the bit can easily be computed. Accuracy of the results, for a multiple stabilizers case, is verified by two alternative methods. Simple-beam theory is used to verify the results for the limiting case of a horizontal hole, and the results of the beam-column problem are verified using a computer library, Continuous System Modeling Program (CSMP), which utilizes a Runge-Kutta integration method...|$|R
40|$|On an {{inclined}} surface the {{fiddler crab}} Uca pugnax, during sidewise progression, orients upward through an angle θ on the surface. The extent of negatively geotropic orientation (θ) is a rectilinear function of sin α, where α is the inclination {{of the surface}} to the horizontal. This equation differs from that describing the geotropic orientation of various other animals. The difference is traced {{to the fact that}} from an initial position with the transverse axis of the body horizontal the crab is required to turn upward to an extent such that the vertical line from its center of <b>gravity</b> pierces the <b>inclined</b> surface within the base of support provided by the legs. This leads to the equation sec θ/tan α = const., which is obeyed within the limits of precision of the measurements. This type of control of geotropic orientation represents an extension of the "muscle tension theory," and is in no sense in conflict with this view. The assumptions underlying the analytical expression connecting θ and α are verified by the asymmetry in the orientation of male fiddlers, which is shown to be due to the presence of the enlarged chela and which disappears when the claws are removed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{similarity}} solutions describing a steady, slender, symmetric dry patch in an infinitely wide liquid film draining under <b>gravity</b> down an <b>inclined</b> plane are obtained. The first solution, which {{predicts that the}} dry patch has a parabolic shape and that the transverse profile of the free surface always has a monotonically increasing shape, is appropriate for weak surface-tension effects and far from {{the apex of the}} dry patch. The second solution, which predicts that the dry patch has a quartic shape and that the transverse profile of the free surface has a capillary ridge near the contact line and decays in an oscillatory manner far from it, is appropriate for strong surface-tension effects (in particular, when the plane is nearly vertical) and near (but not too close) to the apex of the dry patch. With the average volume flux per unit width (or equivalently with the uniform height of the layer far from the dry patch) prescribed, both solutions contain a free parameter. For each value of this parameter there is a unique solution in the first case and either no solution or a one-parameter family of solutions in the second case. The solutions capture some of the qualitative features observed in experiments...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{roles of}} the {{magnetic}} field on the gas dynamics in the Galactic bulge by a three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamical simulation data, particularly focusing on vertical flows that are ubiquitously excited by magnetic activity. In local regions where the magnetic filed is stronger, fast downflows with speed of ~ 100 km/s are triggered near the footpoint of magnetic loops that are buoyancy risen by Parker instability. These downward flows are accelerated by the vertical component of the <b>gravity,</b> falling along <b>inclined</b> field lines, which we call magnetic sliding slopes. The two footpoints of rising magnetic loops are generally located at different radial locations and the field lines are deformed by the differential rotation. The angular momentum is transported along the field lines, and the radial force balance breaks down. As a result, a fast downflow is often observed only at the one footpoint located at the inner radial position. The fast downflow compresses the gas to form a dense region near the footpoint, which will be important in star formation afterward. Furthermore, the azimuthal and radial components of the velocity are also excited, which are observed as high velocity features in a simulated position-velocity diagram. Depending on the viewing angle, these fast flows will show a large variety of characteristic features in the position-velocity diagram. Comment: Submitted to MNRAS. 9 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an experimental technique that combines simultaneous planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and infrared (IR) thermography imaging, and its application to the measurement of unsteady and conjugate heat-transfer in harmonically forced, thin liquid-film flows falling under the action of <b>gravity</b> over an <b>inclined</b> electrically heated-foil substrate. Quantitative, spatiotemporally resolved and simultaneously conducted measurements are reported of the film thickness, film free-surface temperature, solid–liquid substrate interface temperature, and local/instantaneous heat flux exchanged with the heated substrate. Based on this information, local and instantaneous heat-transfer coefficients (HTCs) are recovered. Results concerning the local and instantaneous HTC and how this is correlated with the local and instantaneous film thickness suggest considerable heat-transfer enhancement relative to steady-flow predictions in the thinner film regions. This behaviour is attributed to a number of unsteady/mixing transport processes within the wavy films that are not captured by laminar, steady-flow analysis. The Nusselt number Nu increases with the Reynolds number Re; at low Re values the mean Nu number corresponds to 2. 5, in agreement with the steady-flow theory, while at higher Re, both the Nu number and the HTC exhibit significantly enhanced values. Evidence that the HTC becomes decoupled from the film thickness for the upper range of observed film thicknesses is also presented. Finally, smaller film thickness fluctuation intensities were associated with higher HTC fluctuation intensities, while the amplitude of the wall temperature fluctuations was almost proportional to the amplitude of the HTC fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Hydromagnetic {{stresses}} in accretion discs {{have been}} the subject of intense theoretical research over the past one and a half decades. Most of the disc simulations have assumed a small initial magnetic field and studied the turbulence that arises from the magnetorotational instability. However, gaseous discs in galactic nuclei and in some binary systems are likely to have significant initial magnetisation. Motivated by this, we performed ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of strongly magnetised, vertically stratified discs in a Keplerian potential. Our initial equilibrium configuration, which has an azimuthal magnetic field in equipartion with thermal pressure, is unstable to the Parker instability. This leads to the expelling of magnetic field arcs, anchored in the midplane of the disc, to around five scale heights from the midplane. Transition to turbulence happens primarily through magnetorotational instability in the resulting vertical fields, although magnetorotational shear instability in the unperturbed azimuthal field plays a significant role as well, especially in the midplane where buoyancy is weak. High magnetic and hydrodynamical stresses arise, yielding an effective α-value of around 0. 1 in our highest resolution run. Azimuthal magnetic field expelled by magnetic buoyancy from the disc is continuously replenished by the stretching of a radial field created as gas parcels slide in the linear <b>gravity</b> field along <b>inclined</b> magnetic field lines. This dynamo process, where the bending of field lines by the Parker instability leads to re-creation of the azimuthal field, implies that highly magnetised discs are astrophysically viable and that they have high accretion rates.

40|$|I. The {{problem of}} {{draining}} of a liquid from a cylindrical tank {{through a hole}} in the bottom is considered. The flow is irrotational, and the free surface boundary conditions are linearized. Solutions are obtained and the shape of the free surface determined for any constant mass flow rate. At large mass flow rates, the free surface deforms appreciably when the mean depth is about 40 per cent or less of the tank diameter. The initial acceleration distribution of the free surface and the transient behavior of the mass flow rate are determined for a flow started impulsively from rest as a result of a constant pressure head. At large Froude numbers it is possible to compare the results with the recent experiments of Gluck, Gille, Zukoski, and Simkin, and the present analysis is consistent with the experimental observations. II. The stability characteristics of a laminar film with a free surface flowing under the action of <b>gravity</b> down an <b>inclined</b> plane are examined. Approximate solutions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation are obtained. These are valid as long as the wave speed of the disturbance is somewhat larger than the maximum velocity of the undisturbed flow. Curves of neutral stability as functions of Reynolds number of the undisturbed flow and wave number of the disturbance are found. These are valid over a larger domain of Reynolds number and wave number than the previous results of Benjamin. The special case of a vertical wall and zero surface tension is also discussed. It is shown that undamped waves of the type predicted by Yih (and tentatively suggested by Benjamin) cannot exist, and a source of error in Yih's analysis is suggested...|$|R
50|$|Coal {{has been}} mined in the {{surrounding}} area since Roman times. Coal was then obtained by drift mining, but by the 14th century shafts were used. In 1819 the Hetton Coal Company was formed and the first shaft was sunk a year later. It was a highly controversial undertaking, with geologists doubtful as to whether coal of any value existed there. The Hetton Coal Company's owners also decided to build a wagonway from their new Hetton colliery to the River Wear at Sunderland. George Stephenson was hired to build the 8 mi line. The trains were powered by <b>gravity</b> down the <b>inclines</b> and by locomotives for its level and upward stretches. It was the first railway to use no animal power at all. These methods were used until 1959, as was some of the original machinery. These activities led to a rapid increase {{in the size of}} Hetton and over 200 houses for the miners were built at once. These have all but gone now, but twelve of these former mining cottages from Francis Street in the Hetton Downs area of the town were re-erected stone by stone at Beamish Open Air Museum, Stanley, near Chester-le-Street. The UK miners' strike (1984-1985) brought about hardship for many of the workers. Two local unsigned bands (The Pigeon Fanciers & Haswell Crisis) recorded and released a single {{to raise money for the}} families and to recognise the contribution made by miners over the years in their locality. Their adapted version of a Bob Dylan classic failed to chart, but the project made a slight profit as local support from other mining communities ensured that 'Knocking on Hetton's Floor' sold in excess of 1000 copies.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of a viscous liquid film flowing under <b>gravity</b> down an <b>inclined</b> wall with periodic corrugations is investigated. A long-wave model equation valid at near-critical Reynolds numbers {{is used to}} study the film dynamics, and calculations are performed for either sinusoidal or rectangular wall corrugations assuming either a fixed flow rate in the film or a fixed volume of fluid within each wall period. Under the two different flow assumptions, steady solution branches are delineated including subharmonic branches, for which {{the period of the}} free surface is an integer multiple of the wall period, and the existence of quasi-periodic branches is demonstrated. Floquet-Bloch theory is used to determine the linear {{stability of}} steady, periodic solutions and the nature of any instability is analysed using the method of exponentially weighted spaces. Under certain conditions, and depending on the wall period, the flow may be convectively unstable for small wall amplitudes but undergo transition to absolute instability as the wall amplitude increases, a novel theoretical finding for this class of flows; in other cases, the flow may be convectively unstable for small wall amplitudes but stable for larger wall amplitudes. Solutions with the same spatial period as the wall become unstable at a critical Reynolds number, which is strongly dependent on the period size. For sufficiently small wall periods, the corrugations have a destabilizing effect by lowering the critical Reynolds number above which instability occurs. For slightly larger wall periods, small-amplitude corrugations are destabilizing but sufficiently large-amplitude corrugations are stabilizing. For even larger wall periods, the opposite behaviour is found. For sufficiently large wall periods, the corrugations are destabilizing irrespective of their amplitude. The predictions of the linear theory are corroborated by time-dependent simulations of the model equation, and the presence of absolute instability under certain conditions is confirmed. Boundary element simulations on an inverted substrate reveal that wall corrugations can have a stabilizing effect at zero Reynolds number. © 2013 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} are large-scale {{natural phenomena}} that consist of suspended sed- iment travelling over an impermeable underlying boundary. We employ a shallow- layer approach to model their dynamics, {{taking advantage of}} the fact that their streamwise length is much larger than their vertical height. We frequently consider flows initiated by the instantaneous release of a finite volume of stationary material, known as a 'dam break' configuration. New complete analytical solutions of dam-break flows into a layer of quiescent fluid, or 'tailwater', are found. The tailwater's presence introduces new phenomena: after sufficient time the front of the flow decelerates and an internal bore develops. A model of polydisperse turbidity current motion is developed in which we con- serve interstitial fluid, momentum and particulate. To integrate our model we con- struct a new numerical scheme that is second-order accurate, simple to apply, shock- capturing and non-oscillatory. The scheme is validated by comparison with existing analytical results and employed in three ways. First, the effect that entrainment of ambient fluid and the gradient of the un- derlying boundary have on particle-driven gravity currents is derived through new scaling relationships. These highlight the role that these processes may have in large- scale geophysical flows and indicate why laboratory investigations at much smaller scales may not have needed to include these effects. The turbidity current formed by a lava dome collapse on the Soufriere Hills volcano, Montserrat in July 2003 is modelled next using no fitting parameters. We employ field data to inform our model and validate the output. Agreement is found for the predicted deposit thickness and aspects of the grain size distribution, thus our model effectively captures the key dynamical processes. Finally, new analytical self-similar solutions to entraining <b>gravity</b> currents on <b>inclined</b> planes are presented. We demonstrate that these are attractive solutions of the governing equations after sufficient time. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
