500|$|Generally, {{critics and}} fans were {{disappointed}} Mr. Eko was killed after {{being on the}} show for only one season. Kristin Dos Santos of E! called Mr. Eko [...] "the best character of the show", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. In response to Mr. Eko's death, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated [...] "I'll miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje—his acting was up there with Terry O'Quinn's, Elizabeth Mitchell's, and Michael Emerson's. I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the sacrifice the island demanded". Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that his death [...] "sucked hard, and loud, and long". IGN listed Eko's death as number one on its list of [...] "Top 10 Lost Deaths".|$|E
500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Said Zev Buffman, a Broadway {{producer}} and financier for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, [...] "When Andy {{was at the}} theater, he was a joy. But he wasn't there enough," [...] adding that of the five people to play Joseph up to that point, Gibb was the best actor. He also said after Gibb's death, [...] "We'd lose him over long weekends. He'd come back on Tuesday, and he'd look beat. He was like a little puppy – so ashamed when he did something wrong. He was all heart, but he didn't have enough muscle to carry through." [...] An unnamed co-star in Dreamcoat was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{he spent most of}} his time in his hotel room in front of the TV. I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> frightened and insecure. That's what happens when you're the baby brother of the Bee Gees." [...] Commenting after Gibb's death, Solid Gold producer Brad Lachman stated, [...] "... was a very charming, vulnerable and charismatic performer. He clearly meant well. He wasn't being difficult. He was going through problems he couldn't deal with. He wanted everyone to love him. He had so much going for him, and he just couldn't believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> all right," [...] put in {{the office}} boy, with the freedom that seemed natural to him. [...] "Only I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{dependent}} on his uncle for money. Maybe if it wasn't for that, he would have pitched into his uncle more than he did. But say! You said something was stolen. What was it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pretty badly rattled." [...] Jeff stopped {{himself in}} the vague laugh of one who remembers {{something}} ludicrous, and turned his face away.|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a worse {{man than}} Arnold Baxter was," [...] <b>was</b> Dick's comment. <b>He</b> {{referred}} {{to an old}} enemy of the Rovers, who had now reformed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} {{brightest}} men who ever came over to the States from this country," [...] Hartwell declared. [...] "Knows all about oil, too." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'By that I <b>guessed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> some cheese-paring clerk {{or other}} of the King's Ships, so I gave him the price. I forget it now, but it worked out to thirty pounds--carved, gilt, and fitted in place.|$|R
6000|$|... "A fog {{like this}} isn't lifting in a hurry," [...] said Dick. [...] "Like as not it won't move {{until the sun}} comes up {{tomorrow}} morning," [...] and in this <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word," [...] Jet replied, grimly. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{too busy}} {{getting ready to}} leave, for he had to pack all our provisions, my gun and the other things which were lying around into the boat." ...|$|E

6000|$|Miltoun {{came in to}} lunch, {{but from}} his face and manner nothing could <b>be</b> <b>guessed.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a thought more talkative than usual, and spoke of Brabrook's speech--some {{of which he had}} heard.

6000|$|... "I do love to play--I mean--I like to drum on the piano, but I haven't had {{any real}} training. Mr. Judique {{used to say}} I would 've been a good pianist if I'd had any training, but then, I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just {{flattering}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't blame you, Mrs. Roberts," [...] he said. [...] "I know it wasn't your doing. But {{your husband}} wasn't just himself, I <b>guess.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> fightin' mad on general principles, {{and it was}} just my luck to get in the way, that was all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth, Sam, I think he looked a bit strange in his eyes. But I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> all right. I'd not worry too much if I was you. He'll be back before long. Maybe Doctor Havens was out {{and he had to}} wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes.

6000|$|... '"Then I expect I'll have {{to resign}} me club," [...] Lundie goes on. [...] "I don't think that's ever {{been done before}} by an ex-officio member. I must ask the secretary." [...] I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> kinder bunkered for the minute, or maybe 'twas the lordship comin' out on him.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was very}} much {{surprised}} at your determination to give up Brill, and join Dick. I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> afraid Dick would have to shoulder the business alone.

6000|$|He {{thought he}} saw a gleam of {{comprehension}} in the girl's eyes, and made a gesture of protest. [...] "No," [...] he assured her, [...] "I'm not fit to brush her little shoes.
