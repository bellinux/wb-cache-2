40|$|A {{system of}} <b>routine</b> <b>interrogation</b> of {{patients}} {{using a computer}} has been developed. It includes a visual display unit with a specially designed response keyboard, and {{the program has been}} designed to adapt to the individual patient. The system was evaluated objectively, using the criteria of accuracy in eliciting symptoms, acceptability to the patient, and cost. While doctors will always take the ultimate management decisions, it seems that machines can be programmed to undertake the <b>routine</b> <b>interrogation</b> of patients, elicit evidence accurately and acceptably, and calculate the probabilities of disease as effectively as doctors...|$|R
5000|$|Solzhenitzen {{draws on}} his own and fellow prisoners' long {{experiences}} in the gulag {{as the basis for the}} novel. Solzhenitzhen spent time as an inmate at a sharashka or scientific prison, an experience that he also used as the basis of the 1968 novel The First Circle. However, the ultimate integrity and authority of the book is rooted in the first-hand testimony of 227 fellow prisoners. The sheer volume of firsthand testimony and primary documentation that Solzhenitsyn managed to assemble in The Gulag Archipelago made all subsequent Soviet and KGB attempts to discredit the work useless. Much of the impact of the treatise stems from the closely detailed stories of <b>interrogation</b> <b>routines,</b> prison indignities and (especially in section 3) camp massacres and inhuman practices. Solzhenitsyn also poetically re-introduces his character of Ivan Denisovich towards the conclusion of the book. When questioned by the book's author if he has faithfully recounted the story of the Gulag, Denisovich (now apparently freed from the camps) replies that [...] "you author have not even begun...".|$|R
50|$|The {{crew were}} {{subjected}} to <b>routine</b> <b>interrogation</b> {{in an atmosphere of}} mutual respect with their German captors. The officers and ratings were separated and held as prisoners of war in a succession of camps until April 1945. The submarine had been adopted by the village of Seal when she was commissioned, and during their imprisonment the crew received considerable support from the villagers.|$|R
5000|$|International {{organizations}} {{denounced the}} <b>routine</b> <b>interrogation</b> and torture by security agencies in anonymous [...] "ghost houses". To compensate for {{its lack of}} mass support the NIF employed paramilitary force made up of Fallata tribesmen (traditionally agricultural day labourers) to [...] "do its dirty work", the tribesmen being bound to the NIF because [...] "they risked forfeiting everything should the NIF lose its grip on power." [...] In interviews Turabi dismissed abuses as minimal and attributed them to the [...] "extreme sensitively" [...] of his opponents.|$|R
5|$|The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began a <b>routine</b> <b>interrogation.</b> Himmler {{admitted}} who he was, and Selvester had {{the prisoner}} searched. Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|R
50|$|The Piazza Fontana {{bombing was}} {{initially}} attributed to anarchists. After over 80 arrests were made, suspect Giuseppe Pinelli, an anarchist railway worker, died after {{falling from the}} fourth floor window of the police station where he was being held. Serious discrepancies existed in the police account, which initially maintained that Pinelli had committed suicide by leaping from the window during a <b>routine</b> <b>interrogation</b> session. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but a later inquiry filed October 25, 1975 concluded {{that there were no}} wrongdoings regarding Pinelli's death: public prosecutor Gerardo D'Ambrosio established that his fall had been caused by fainting and losing balance.|$|R
50|$|Dismissed {{from his}} posts and {{unwanted}} by his former colleagues, Himmler attempted {{to go into}} hiding {{in order to avoid}} capture. Himmler equipped himself with a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger of the Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police), which was a mistake since members of this organization were sought after by the liberation forces. Macher and Grothmann were both dressed as army privates. Macher, Himmler and Grothmann were stopped at a checkpoint, which had been set up by former Soviet POWs, on May 21 and detained. The three men were taken to an Allied barracks in Lüneburg on May 23. During a <b>routine</b> <b>interrogation,</b> Himmler admitted who he was; thereafter, at the headquarters of the Second British Army, during an attempted medical examination Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and died. After Himmler's suicide, Macher and Grothmann were arrested.|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of alcohol septal {{ablation}} (ASA) on ventricular arrhythmias among patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), as measured by appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) discharges. BackgroundAlcohol septal ablation is an effective therapy for patients with symptomatic HCM. However, concern has been raised that ASA may be proarrhythmic secondary to the iatrogenic scar created during the procedure. The impact of ASA on ventricular arrhythmias has not been well described. MethodsThis prospective study included 123 consecutive patients with obstructive HCM who underwent ASA and had an ICD implanted for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The ICDs were implanted based on commonly accepted risk factors for SCD in the HCM population. Data from ICD <b>interrogations</b> during <b>routine</b> follow-up were collected. ResultsNine appropriate ICD shocks were recorded over a mean follow-up of 2. 9 years in the cohort, which had a mean of 1. 5 ± 0. 9 risk factors for SCD. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the estimated annual event rate was 2. 8 % over 3 -year follow-up. There were no significant differences in the incidence of risk factors between patients who did and did not receive appropriate shocks. ConclusionsThe annual rate of appropriate ICD discharges after ASA is low and less than that reported previously for primary prevention of SCD in HCM. This suggests that ASA is not proarrhythmic. Traditional SCD risk factors did not predict ICD shocks in this cohort...|$|R
50|$|Unwanted by {{his former}} colleagues and hunted by the Allies, Himmler {{attempted}} {{to go into}} hiding.

5000|$|On April 29, 1945, Visconti {{surrendered}} to communist partisans near Malpensa airfield, Milan, {{only after he}} was assured {{that none of the}} air and ground personnel of his unit would be killed in retaliatory attacks. His safety was assured by the mayor of Milan as well, when he was first taken for interrogation. Visconti and the other officers were taken on two buses to the barracks of Savoy Cavalry (Savoia Cavalleria) in via Vincenzo Monti. The barracks was then the command of National Republican Guard Intendancy (Intendenza of Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana). There, at 2 p.m., Visconti and Lieutenant (tenente) Valerio Stefanini, his close collaborator, were seemingly taken for a <b>routine</b> <b>interrogation.</b> They were both shot in the back by a Russian bodyguard of the communist partisan leader [...] "Iso". The Russian was charged with murder but was later discharged because the crime had occurred before 8 May 1945, the official end of the war in Italy, and was therefore considered an act of war.|$|R
40|$|A 53 -year-old {{man with}} nonischemic car-diomyopathy, left bundle branch block QRS mor-phology, and {{congestive}} heart failure underwent biventricular implantable cardioverter defibrilla-tor (ICD) (Model V 365; St. Jude Medical Cor-poration, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) placement for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. The device was programmed with two zones: ventric-ular fibrillation (VF) zone at 210 bpm (285 ms) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) zone at 170 bpm (352 ms). Detection enhancement was programmed on to diagnose VT {{if any of the}} dis-criminators (“Rate Branch, ” “Morphology, ” and “Sudden Onset”) indicated VT. ICD <b>interrogation</b> during the <b>routine</b> follow-up visit revealed an episode of tachycardia with 1 : 1 atrioventricular (AV) relationship (Fig. 1). The tachycardia cycle length was initially slightly longer than the VT detection limit and gradually became shorter than VT detection limit. “Rate Branch ” and “Sudden Onset ” discriminators indicated supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). However, none of eight tachy-cardia beats matched the template as indicated by the “X ” markers. Therefore, VT was detected and successfully terminated by antitachycardia pac-ing (ATP) therapy. What is the mechanism of the tachycardia? Commentary The possible mechanisms of tachycardia with 1 : 1 AV relationship are VT with retrograde AV nodal conduction or SVT. During ATP therapy...|$|R
