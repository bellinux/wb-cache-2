5|$|At this point, {{the longest}} {{duration}} {{in which the}} moon completely covered the sun, known as totality, was during the solar eclipse of July 22, 2009. This total solar eclipse had a maximum duration of 6 minutes and 39 seconds. The longest possible duration of a total solar eclipse is 7 minutes and 32 seconds. The longest annular solar <b>eclipse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century took place on January 15, 2010, {{with a duration of}} 11 minutes and 8 seconds. The maximum possible duration is 12 minutes and 29 seconds.

5|$|Oates {{was born}} August 27, 1962, in Weston, a {{neighborhood}} in Toronto, Ontario. As a youth, he played both hockey and box lacrosse, favouring the latter sport. He played five {{seasons with the}} Etobicoke <b>Eclipse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ontario Lacrosse Association (OLA) Junior A Lacrosse League. An offensive standout, Oates' total of 181 points in 19 games in 1981 was the 11th highest total in OLA junior history at the time. As the league's leading scorer, he won the Bobby Allan Award and in one game that season, set OLA Junior A single-game records of 19 assists and 29 points. Oates played one season of Senior A with the Brampton Excelsiors of Major Series Lacrosse but left the game in 1984 to focus on his hockey career.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as omens, or portents. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse {{that occurred during}} a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down their weapons and declared peace {{as a result of}} the eclipse. The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor. An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece, which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular <b>eclipse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC. Alternatively, a partial eclipse was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC. Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The date of the eclipse (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|The Parthenon frieze is the {{defining}} monument of the High Classical style of Attic sculpture. It stands between the gradual <b>eclipse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Severe style, as witnessed on the Parthenon metopes, {{and the evolution}} of the Late Classical Rich style, exemplified by the Nike balustrade. What sources the designer of the frieze drew upon is difficult to gauge, certainly large scale narrative art was familiar to 5th-century Athenians as in the Stoa poikile painting by Polygnotos of Thasos. While there is an overall coherence to the work there are design differences on opposing sides of the frieze that has suggested to some scholars the possibility of more than one designer and a pattern of influence amongst them. There is greater nudity and frontally on the north than the south, the massing and distribution of figures is greatly different on the east than the more widely spaced west, and the east and north generally exhibit greater innovation. This evidence, along with the frequency with which Greek artists are thought to have collaborated, has led Jenifer Neils to hypothesize the existence of two designers working on the sculpture. This would admit the possibility of a later designer comparing and competing with the earlier, and so, explain the observable changes in composition. Geographical orientations also may have dictated what would be represented on one side versus another, i.e., Amazons to the west, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are rare}} events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is {{estimated}} that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average. The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7min 32s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7min 2s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra. The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7min 29s. For comparison, the longest total <b>eclipse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century at 7min 8s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there are no total solar eclipses over 7min in duration in the 21st century.|$|E
40|$|During 5, 000 -year {{period from}} - 1999 to + 3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE), Earth will {{experience}} 11, 898 <b>eclipses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. <b>The</b> statistical distribution <b>of</b> <b>eclipse</b> types for this interval is as follows: 4, 200 partial eclipses, 3956 annular eclipses, 3173 total eclipses,and 569 hybrid eclipses.

500|$|Book III {{covers the}} mediaeval Quadrivium, the four {{subjects}} which supplemented the Trivium being mathematics, geometry, music and astronomy.

He attributes geometry to Ancient Egypt, arguing that because the River Nile flooded and covered the land with mud, geometry was needed to mark out people's land [...] "with lines and measures". Isidore distinguishes astronomy from astrology, and covers the world, the sky and the celestial sphere, the zodiac, the sun, moon, stars, Milky Way, planets and <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars.

The optical light curves display sinusoidal variations modulated on the orbital period as well as large night to night changes in mean intensity. <b>The</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variations increases with mean intensity while maintaining sinusoidal shape. Considering <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> constraints placed by the X-ray and optical data we argue that V 1408 Aql may harbor a very low mass black hole.

25|$|Lunar eclipses {{occur when}} the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow. This happens only during a full moon, when the Moon is {{on the far side}} of the Earth from the Sun.

For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.|$|E
