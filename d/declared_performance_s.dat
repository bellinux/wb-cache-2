40|$|The Purpose and Procedures. The {{primary purpose}} of this study was twofold: (1) to {{determine}} the present evaluation policies and practices used by Nebraska Class II and III school districts, and (2) to determine the current attitudes of superintendents and board members toward the formal evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance.</b> ^ The literature dealing with the assessment of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance</b> was reviewed to ascertain the practices and procedures currently being used and recommended. ^ A questionnaire was developed to obtain the information about current practices and prevailing attitudes toward formal evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance</b> in Nebraska Class II and III school districts. A random sample of 182 superintendents and 182 board chairpersons was surveyed. ^ Major Findings of the Study. (1) Most Class II and III school districts in Nebraska do not formally evaluate the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance.</b> (2) A combination of techniques and instruments were usually used to formally evaluate the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance.</b> (3) The results of the formal evaluation were presented annually to the superintendent in executive session using a combination of oral and written reports. (4) Most school districts did not have a board policy governing the evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance.</b> (5) There was limited support for the involvement of persons other than board members in the evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance.</b> ^ Conclusions. This study strongly indicated a growing interest in formally evaluating the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance.</b> However, the actual practice was not keeping pace with the expressed interest. Both superintendents and board chairpersons desired more information about job descriptions, performance standards, and suitable evaluation instruments. ^ The evaluation of the superintendent rests primarily with the board of education. However, the input of other individuals may be desirable. ^ The complexity of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s position strongly suggests that a detailed job description is essential to a successful evaluation program and the evaluation system should include an assessment of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>performance</b> in all areas of responsibility. ...|$|R

40|$|MEd (Learner Support), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2013 It {{seems as}} if there is a {{continued}} problem with mathematical performances nationally. The rate, at which FET (Further Education and Training) phase learner s discontinue Mathematics as a result of poor mathematical performances, is of great concern. This research study determined how academic self-confidence could have an influence on learners’ abilities to perform in Mathematics. The literature review confirmed {{that there could be a}} link between academic self-confidence and mathematical performance. Consequently, the researcher wanted to establish if the same could be found at a school where the emphasis is very much on mathematical achievement. The school is based in Northern Johannesburg (D 10) in Gauteng, South Africa. By applying an explanatory mixed method approach (quantitative, followed by qualitative methods), the researcher identified a clear link between this school’s learners’ abilities to perform in Mathematics and their academic self-confidence. Amongst others, positive links were also identified between the learner s’ comprehension of Mathematics, their problem- solving skills as well as educator assistance, which in turn influence their academic self - confidence and consequently al so their <b>performance</b> <b>s.</b> A cycle of mathematical influences was identified that demonstrated that the influence i s not only working one way, but that a cycle forms; academic self-confidence influences the learner’s ability to perform in mathematics and mathematical <b>performance</b> <b>s</b> al so influence academic self - confidence, causing a continuous cycle of influence.
