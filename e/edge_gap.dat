40|$|We {{present the}} theory of the leading <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> in the normal state of underdoped high-T_c materials. The {{consideration}} is based on a magnetic scenario for cuprates. We show that as doping decreases, the increasing interaction with paramagnons gives rise to a near destruction of the Fermi liquid and this in turn yields precursors to d-wave pairing. We argue that the leading <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> at ∼ 30 meV and a broad maximum in the spectral function at ∼ 150 meV are byproducts of the same physical phenomenon.

In {{contrast to the}} common belief, neither the band filling nor the band parameters are significantly affected by the oxygen reduction process. Instead, we show that the main electronic role of the reduction process is to remove an anisotropic leading <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> around the Fermi surface.

40|$|We {{consider}} thermal {{evolution of}} the spectral function A(Omega, T) in underdoped cuprates at T >Tc. We find that in the strong coupling limit, the fermionic Green's function near (0,π) behaves as G^- 1 (Omega) √(Omega) in the whole frequency range relevant to photoemission experiments. The analysis of the pairing problem with this form of G yields a leading <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> in A(Ω) and a broad maximum at larger frequencies. We find that classical fluctuations predominantly add a frequency independent term to G^- 1 (Omega). This term destroys the leading <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> at T =T* (k) which has a maximum value of about 200 K near (0,π). Comment: 4 pages, Revtex, two figures (EPS-format...|$|E

40|$|Our {{interest}} is in the cumulative probabilities Pr(L(t) < l) for the maximum length of increasing subsequences in Poissonized ensembles of random permutations, random fixed point free involutions and reversed random fixed point free involutions. It is shown that these probabilities are equal to the hard <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> probability for matrix ensembles with unitary, orthogonal and symplectic symmetry respectively. The gap probabilities can be written as a sum over correlations for certain determinantal point processes. From these expressions a proof can be given that the limiting form of Pr(L(t) < l) in the three cases {{is equal to the}} soft <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> probability for matrix ensembles with unitary, orthogonal and symplectic symmetry respectively, thereby reclaiming theorems due to Baik-Deift-Johansson and Baik-Rains.

Seedling establishment may be favoured by creating small and irregular gaps and by successive extension of gaps along the sun-exposed <b>gap</b> <b>edge.</b> ContextTo successfully manage natural regeneration, {{it is important to}} understand the interactions of forest gap micro-climates and soil features. AimThe aim of this study was to identify conditions for successful natural regeneration of European beech, sycamore maple and silver fir in mixed forests. MethodsSeedling growth and survival were recorded within and around two artificial gaps, and the relationships to irradiance, ground vegetation and soil features were examined. A simple conceptual model was applied to identify optimal micro-sites for regeneration. ResultsGround vegetation hindered the establishment of natural regeneration in the centre of the gaps. Small seedlings of maple and beech were more abundant within the small gap and along gap edges; beech had the highest density on sun-exposed edges and maple on shaded <b>gap</b> <b>edges.</b> Tall beech and maple seedlings were more abundant along sun-exposed <b>gap</b> <b>edges.</b> Greater variability of irradiance in the larger gap contributed to greater micro-site heterogeneity relative to the small gap. ConclusionsSeedling establishment may be favoured by creating small and irregular gaps and by successive extension of gaps along the sun-exposed <b>gap</b> <b>edge.</b> Circular <b>gaps</b> with diameters greater than stand height contribute to increased ground vegetation coverage and hinder tree regeneration, including semi-shade tolerant maple and spruce...|$|R

We derive and solve a set of three coupled Eliashberg-type equations for spin-mediated pairing and show that in some $T$ range below the pairing instability, there is no feedback from superconductivity on fermionic excitations, and fermions remain diffusive despite of the pairing. We conject that in this regime, fluctuations of the pairing gap destroy the superconducting condensate but preserve the leading <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> in the fermionic spectral function.

Our analysis suggests that the cone is slightly anisotropic and its apex is located very near the Fermi level, leading to tiny Fermi surface pockets. Moreover, the bands forming the cone show an anisotropic leading <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> away from the cone that suggests a nodal spin-density-wave description. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

The deformation will stop when an equilibrium state is achieved. To overcome the low contrast of the original image data, a nonparametric kernel-based method is applied to simultaneously update the interior probability distribution during the model evolution.

The GNRs considered have either armchair or zigzag shaped edges on both sides with hydrogen passivation. Both varieties of ribbons are shown to have band gaps. This differs from the results of simple tight-binding calculations or solutions of the Dirac's equation based on them. Our ab initio calculations show that the origin of energy gaps for GNRs with armchair shaped edges arises from both quantum confinement and the crucial effect of the edges. For GNRs with zigzag shaped <b>edges,</b> <b>gaps</b> appear because of a staggered sublattice potential on the hexagonal lattice due to edge magnetization. The rich gap structure for ribbons with armchair shaped edges is further obtained analytically including edge effects. These results reproduce our ab initio calculation results very well...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} certain workmanship requirements {{applying to}} insulants in cavities. It presents previously reported measured {{values for the}} effects of edge gaps, and compares these results with new laboratory measured results for the heat transfer across insulated wall and ceiling cavities, in configurations which permit natural convection to flow around the insulant. The results show the ex-istence of a threshold <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> width of a few mm for the onset of convection in upward heat flow, but no threshold gap width of detectable size for horizontal heat flow. The loss of thermal performance from convection, as expected, outweighs that previously reported for non-convecting gaps. SUMMARY THERE IS NOW a considerable amount of data [1 - 8] concerning the lossof thermal performance of structural cavities which can result from ther-mal bridging of various forms and degree. In many of these reports, losses of 3 to 5 % of the cavity insulating value for each 1 % of gap width (i. e., <b>edge</b> <b>gap</b> as a percent of cavity width), seem to be quite typical, although there are a few reports in which the loss reaches 10 % or more per 1 % of gap width. To give a perspective to these figures, note that a gap of 1 % would mean a gap width of 5 mm when the frame spacing is at 500 mm, and so would not be difficult either to detect or to avoid. At least one case has been reported [7] in which degradation was much more severe even than above. This is recognisably a case where convective air circulation has enabled heat to bypass the insulant. It occurred in a wall panel, where the convective circulation pressure difference may be relatively large. The corresponding condition applying in ceiling cavities, where the convective circulation pressure must be much smaller, was not reported...|$|E
