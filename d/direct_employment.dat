25|$|As a Provincial Crown Corporation, {{investment}} decisions by Manitoba Hydro are {{heavily influenced by}} political and economic goals of the provincial government. For example, in the 1986 Manitoba provincial election, the incumbent New Democratic Party government announced accelerated construction of the Limestone project, with promises of increased employment as a result. Limestone GS was estimated to create 6000 person-years of <b>direct</b> <b>employment,</b> 11,000 of indirect employment over the construction period of eight years. As part of the contract for the ten turbine-generator units, Canadian General Electric agreed to invest $10,000,000 CAD in Manitoba business operations, and to obtain at least 15 per cent of installation labour locally.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, DSPD {{has faced}} steep {{obstacles}} in its mission {{to care for}} Utahns with disabilities. The most acute and recent challenge involved funding issues which arose after the economic downturn of 2008. As state tax receipts fell {{in the months following}} the crisis, the legislature began making difficult decisions about how to fund state programs. The Division was asked to make do with a significant budget reduction. DSPD decided {{that the best way to}} reduce operational costs was to privatize casework. This allowed the Division to preserve critical services. By the end of 2009, all but a handful of caseworkers had transitioned from <b>direct</b> <b>employment</b> with the state to a private contractor. In both 2010 and 2011, the Division met additional budget shortfalls with staffing reductions, to avoid the reduction of critical services to waiver services recipients. It has been challenging for the Division to meet the same workload demands with less staff and resources.|$|E

About 90% of the population in Himachal depends directly upon agriculture, which provides <b>direct</b> <b>employment</b> to 62% of total workers of state.

The apple cultivation constitute 49 per cent of the total area under fruit crops and 85% of total fruit production in the state with an estimated economy of 3500 crore. Apples from Himachal are exported to other Indian states and even other countries. In 2011-12, the total area under apple cultivation was 1.04 lakh hectares, increased from 90,347 hectares in 2000-01.|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effects of foreign <b>direct</b> {{investment}} on <b>employment</b> generation in Central Europe. Foreign affiliates operate as a buffer to reductions in overall employment and show significant cross-country differences. A model analyzing the contribution of foreign direct investment to restructuring is developed. This model helps interpret the empirical evidence on the link between foreign <b>direct</b> investment and <b>employment</b> in Central Europe. Increasing differentiation in employment between manufacturing industries dominated by foreign affiliates suggests the importance of diversified sources of foreign <b>direct</b> investment for <b>employment</b> generation and preservation. A disaggregate analysis indeed reveals a much more complex and differentiated role of foreign <b>direct</b> investment in <b>employment</b> preservation, employment generation and structural change than the aggregate picture would suggest. This diversity has important policy implications for attracting and upgrading foreign direct investment...|$|R

60|$|He {{distinguished}} me, as the French say; he honoured me {{with his}} esteem and, as the days elapsed, with no small share of his confidence. Sometimes he bored me a little, for {{the tone of his}} conversation was not cheerful, tending as it did almost exclusively to a melancholy dirge over the financial prostration of our common country. “No, sir, business in the United States is not what it once was,” he found occasion to remark several times a day. “There’s not the same spring—there’s not the same hopeful feeling. You can see it in all departments.” He used to sit by the hour in the little garden of the pension with a roll of American newspapers in his lap and his high hat pushed back, swinging one of his long legs and reading the New York Herald. He paid a daily visit to the American banker’s {{on the other side of}} the Rhône and remained there a long time, turning over the old papers on the green velvet table in the centre of the Salon des Etrangers and fraternising with chance compatriots. But in spite of these diversions the time was heavy on his hands. I used at times to propose him a walk, but he had a mortal horror of any use of his legs other than endlessly dangling or crossing them, and regarded my <b>direct</b> <b>employment</b> of my own as a morbid form of activity. “You’ll kill yourself if you don’t look out,” he said, “walking all over the country. I don’t want to stump round that way—I ain’t a postman!” Briefly speaking, Mr. Ruck had few resources. His wife and daughter, on the other hand, it was to be supposed, were possessed of a good many that couldn’t be apparent to an unobtrusive young man. They also sat a great deal in the garden or in the salon, side by side, with folded hands, taking in, to vague ends, material objects, and were remarkably independent of most of the usual feminine aids to idleness—light literature, tapestry, the use of the piano. They lent themselves to complete displacement, however, much more than their companion, and I often met them, in the Rue du Rhône and on the quays, loitering in front of the jewellers’ windows. They might have had a cavalier in the person of old M. Pigeonneau, who professed a high appreciation of their charms, but who, owing to the absence of a common idiom, was deprived, in the connexion, of the pleasures of intimacy. He knew no English, and Mrs. Ruck and her daughter had, as it seemed, an incurable mistrust of the beautiful tongue which, as the old man endeavoured to impress upon them, was pre-eminently the language of conversation.|$|E
