40|$|The {{design of}} a {{ventilation}} system for operating theaters (OT) is aimed to reduce the patient infection risk while maintaining adequate comfort and productivity for the surgical staff. Nowadays, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) represents an important tool to simulate the airflow pattern in an operating theater {{and its ability to}} remove airborne particles. The CFD advantages, compared to experimental campaigns, consist in the ability to test different configurations, in the ease of implementation and in time and money savings. The aim of this work is to numerically and experimentally investigate an OT with a layout according to the Standard DIN 1946 - 4. Moreover the effectiveness of a differential airflow diffusion system on reducing the particle concentration above the operating table is analyzed. The supply air comes from a ceiling filter system composed of 23 H 14 filters, which assures an unidirectional flow with <b>differential</b> <b>air</b> velocities over the protected area. In order to experimentally evaluate the performance and the protection grade SG, according to DIN 1946 - 4, and to validate the numerical results, a measuring campaign has been carried out within a laboratory setup of an OT. Two different scenarios have been adopted to evaluate the protection level against the entry of external and internal contaminant loads into the protected area.

The hydrodynamic performance of such converters heavily depends on their interactions with ocean waves; therefore, understanding these interactions is essential.

50|$|Vacuum {{technology}} {{is based on}} <b>differential</b> <b>air</b> pressure. Rotary vane vacuum pumps generate an operation pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar at the vacuum station, {{which is also the}} only element of the vacuum sewerage system that must be supplied with electricity. Interface valves, that are installed inside the collection chambers, work pneumatically. Sewage flows by means of gravity from each house into a collection sump that might collect sewage from 2-6 houses and is located in public area. After a certain fill level inside this sump is reached, the interface valve opens. The impulse to open the valve is usually transferred by a pneumatically (pneumatic pressure created by fill level) controlled controller unit. No electricity is needed to open or close the valve. The energy is provided by the vacuum itself. While the valve is open, the resulting differential pressure between atmosphere and vacuum becomes the driving force and transports the wastewater towards the vacuum station. Besides these collection chambers, no other manholes, neither for changes in direction, nor for inspection or connection of branch lines, are necessary. High flow velocities keep the system free of any blockages or sedimentation.|$|R

Root mean square deviation (RMSD) is being employed to justify the sensor compatibility.

40|$|This study uses sharp, <b>differential</b> <b>air</b> quality changes across sites {{attributable}} to geographic {{variation in the}} effects of the 1981 - 82 recession to estimate the relationship between infant mortality and particulates air pollution. It is shown that in the narrow period of 1980 - 82, there was substantial variation across counties in changes in particulates pollution, and that these differential pollution reductions appear to be orthogonal to changes in a multitude of other factors that may be related to infant mortality. Using the most detailed and comprehensive data available, we find that a 1 mg/m 3 reduction in particulates results in about 4 - 8 fewer infant deaths per 100, 000 (a 0. 35 - 0. 45 elasticity). The estimated effects are driven almost entirely by fewer deaths occurring within one month and one day of birth, suggesting that fetal exposure to pollution has adverse health consequences. The estimated effects of the pollution reductions on infant birth weight provide evidence consistent with this potential pathophysiologic mechanism. The analysis also reveals a nonlinear relationship between pollution and infant mortality at the county level. Importantly, the estimates are remarkably stable across a variety of specifications. All of these findings are masked in conventional' analyses based on less credible research designs. ...|$|R

40|$|High-precision <b>differential</b> <b>air</b> {{pressure}} measurements {{were conducted in}} the below-canopy space of a Scots pine forest and in the forest soil to investigate small air pressure fluctuations and their effect on soil gas flux. In addition to air {{pressure measurements}}, tracer gas concentration in the soil and airflow characteristics {{above and below the}} canopy were measured. Results suggest that air pressure fluctuations in the frequency range of 0. 01  Hz– 0. 1  Hz are strongly dependent on above-canopy wind speed. While amplitudes of the observed air pressure fluctuations (< 10 Pa) increase significantly with increasing above-canopy wind speed, the periods decrease significantly with increasing above-canopy wind speed. These air pressure fluctuations are associated with the pressure-pumping effect in the soil. A pressure-pumping coefficient was defined, which describes the strength of the pressure-pumping effect. During the measurement period, pressure-pumping coefficients up to 0. 44 Pa·s− 1 were found. The dependence of the pressure-pumping coefficient on mean above-canopy wind speed can be described well with a polynomial fit of second degree. The knowledge of this relation simplifies the quantification of the pressure-pumping effect in a Scots pine forest considerably, since only the mean above-canopy wind speed has to be measured. In addition, empirical modeling revealed that the pressure-pumping coefficient explains the largest fraction of the variance of tracer gas concentration in the topsoil...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of salmeterol xinafoate (SX) powders {{was carried out}} to define the aerodynamic properties and mechanism of particle dispersion {{relevant to the use}} of these materials in dry powder inhalation drug delivery. Particle sizing methodology was evaluated using laser diffraction, time-of-flight and Andersen cascade impactor measurements combined with electron microscopy and surface area determination. Particle interactions, assessed on the basis of powder bulk density and inverse gas chromatography surface energy measurements, were compared with the aerodynamic forces generated by a dry-powder dispersion device. The supercritically produced material showed by a factor of seven reduced tensile strength of the aggregates and indicated a two-fold increase of fine particle fraction deposited in a cascade impactor when blended with lactose. This effect was explained by the reduced particle aggregation at low <b>differential</b> <b>air</b> pressures and flow rates. A relatively small value of aerodynamic stress required to disperse supercritically produced particles in comparison to micronized material comes from: (a) lower bulk density (loose aggregate structure), (b) larger volume mean diameter, (c) larger aerodynamic shape factor and (d) smaller specific free energy of S-SX particles, in this order of priority. It is shown that aggregation between primary drug particles is important for SX/lactose formulations because such aggregates survive the pre-separation impactor stage. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study analyzes the classification and characteristics of SSDS especially their lithofacies association and lithologic characteristics through field outcrops investigation and thin section analysis as well.

The SSDS types in the Qingshan Group includes load and flame structure, ball and pillow structure, water-escape structure, hydroplastic deformation structure, plastic sandstone breccia structure, volcanic drop stone and V-shaped ground fissure mainly caused by volcanic earthquakes of three types: (1) seismic waves, (2) gravity and inertia effect of pyroclastic flows, (3) instant <b>differential</b> <b>air</b> pressure; which is different from slumping and tectonic earthquakes occurred in the Laiyang Group. In addition, with the lithofacies association analysis between pyroclastic flow and SSDS beds, a distribution model of SSDS related to volcanic earthquakes can be established: SSDS types changed gradually with their distance further away from the volcanic activity core. Brittle deformation which was common in the proximal zone disappeared gradually; liquefied and plastic SSDS continued to dominate in the medial zone; and slightly liquefied SSDS were developed in the distal zone.
