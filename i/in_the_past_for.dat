5|$|The size of glaciers on Mount Rainier has fluctuated {{significantly}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>For</b> example, {{during the}} last ice age, from about 25,000 to about 15,000years ago, glaciers covered most of the area now {{within the boundaries of}} Mount Rainier National Park and extended to the perimeter of the present Puget Sound Basin.|$|E
5|$|A {{third track}} along {{much of the}} line north of 96th Street has been used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>for</b> peak {{direction}} express service, at least between 96th Street and 137th Street. This center track is currently used only during construction reroutes. There is another unused third track between Dyckman Street and Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street. Three yards have connections to the line. The 240th Street Yard is located between Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street and 238th Street. This yard holds 21 layup tracks and can hold the entire rolling stock for the 1. The next yard, 207th Street Yard holds a few trains that are used during rush hours and cleans and overhauls some of the line's fleet. Finally, the 137th Street Yard has six tracks, which hold rush hour turn-around trains.|$|E
5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, {{he has not}} claimed that the idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} for similar ideas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>For</b> instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E

5|$|Extradition {{requests}} {{had been}} granted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> (<b>For</b> example, in 2002 Murad Garabayev has been handed to Turkmenistan., Garabayev's extradition was later found unlawful by the Russian courts and he was awarded 20,000 Euros in damages to be paid by the Russian government by the European Court of Human Rights.) Article 63 does not explicitly mention Russian citizens, and therefore {{does not apply to}} them, but only to foreign nationals living in Russia. Article 61 supersedes it for the people holding the Russian citizenship.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up and down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>for</b> unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
5|$|White {{missed the}} opening of NBA camp on Monday October 1, due to a desire to have a {{contractual}} plan put in place with the Rockets and the NBA that addressed the league wide mental health policy or lack thereof. After sessions with his own long-time doctor, White requested permission to travel by bus when {{necessary in order to}} limit his flight schedule. The Rockets and White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White travel by personal bus rather than flying (which has been an anxiety trigger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>for</b> white). White missed the first week of training camp before this agreement was put in place.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to the public in the reception area showing some traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>for</b> visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws for me when I am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010–11 season, Bieksa's {{offensive}} production decreased, {{but he was}} lauded by {{the media}} and Head Coach Alain Vigneault for improving his defensive game. He had been criticized at times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>for</b> making risk/reward plays that resulted in scoring chances for the opposing team, but his play improved to become more responsible in the defensive zone. In February 2011, he suffered a 2nd fractured bone in his foot. Playing in a game against the Minnesota Wild, Bieksa sustained the injury while blocking a shot. While he finished the game and initial x-rays came back negative, a subsequent CT-scan revealed the fracture. He became the sixth Canucks defenceman injured at the time. After missing 15 games, he returned to the line-up in late-March. Playing on a shutdown defensive pairing with Dan Hamhuis, his season-ending +32 plus-minus established a personal best and ranked second in the NHL, one point behind Boston Bruins defenceman Zdeno Chára. Complementing his strong defensive play, he recorded six goals and 22 points in 66 games.|$|E
5|$|Kim Possible {{takes place}} {{primarily}} within the fictional United States town of Middleton, {{and focuses on}} the life and adventures of teenager Kim Possible. She is an accomplished high school student and cheerleader who fights crime on a regular basis, assisted by her best friend and sidekick, Ron Stoppable, and Rufus, his pet naked mole rat. Ron's personal fears, insecurities and clumsiness sometimes {{have a tendency to}} jeopardize the success of their own missions. Kim and Ron are aided remotely by Wade, a 10 year-old computer genius who seldom leaves his bedroom and communicates with the duo via device he invented himself known as a Kimmunicator. Together, the foursome is known as Team Possible. The majority of Kim's missions involve her traveling to various destinations around the world to rescue citizens from harm and battle a variety of enemies and villains, the most frequent of whom are Dr. Drakken, a mad scientist constantly plotting world domination, and his superpowered sidekick Shego, who possesses the ability to generate powerful energy blasts and emit them from her hands, making her the heroine's most dangerous opponent. Not yet of age to drive herself to most of her missions, Kim often relies on favors from various people and friends she has assisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>for</b> transportation.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius' brother Gaius {{was elected}} tribune in 123 BC. Gaius Gracchus' {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>for</b> example, the senate would eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum ("ultimate decree of the senate"). Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the senatus consultum ultimum to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support. He stood for election to a third term in 121 BC, but was defeated and then murdered by representatives of the senate with 3,000 of his supporters on Capitoline Hill in Rome.|$|E

25|$|At step five, {{the victim}} and {{counselor}} should begin to collaboratively generate and explore alternatives for coping.

25|$|The Cossacks, {{even more}} than other Russians, are highly {{antagonistic}} towards Circassian nationalism, as it is towards their aims, which include the revival of traditional Cossack paramilitary forces, already underway in Russia (see Cossacks and related pages).
