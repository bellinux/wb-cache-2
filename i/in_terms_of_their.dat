5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.|$|E

It was Harrison's first formal music project outside the Beatles and coincided with his {{continued}} immersion in Indian classical music. Since 1966, this association with India had given Harrison a distinct musical identity beside the band's primary songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. While he had minimal interest in the Beatles' main projects during 1967 – the album Sgt.

This study {{aims to examine}} if there is significant difference {{between male and female}} among Kota Bharu people <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> buying behavior. Factors examined include culture values, purchase intention, consumers’ preferences and demographic details ranging from gender, ethnic, ages, marital status, education background, monthly income to spending on apparel per year. 100 questionnaires were distributed to consumers at random among Kota Bharu people equally for both genders. Data collected was analyzed using T-test. Findings showed that there are significance differences between male and female <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> culture values and their purchase intention which is indicate that the P-value is 0. 000, however there is no significant difference between male and female <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> preferences as the P-value is 0. 804. As a conclusion male and female among Kota Bharu people basically is focusing more on their preferences in apparel buying behavior such as reasonable and affordable price, apparel fashion design that still maintaining the Asian culture values at the same time still follow current design, conformability and as basic needs.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} {{had previously}} been considered, but rejected, by Isaac Newton as a practical demonstration of his theory of gravitation. However, a team of scientists, notably Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, {{was convinced that the}} effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their moons, and the Sun, previously known only <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the concept of contour lines, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in cartography.|$|E

5|$|The {{types of}} {{minerals}} present in volcanic ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate magma are silicon and oxygen, {{the various types of}} magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> silica content. Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg). The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a silica content between 55-69%.|$|E
