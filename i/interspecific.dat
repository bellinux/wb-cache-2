5|$|Birds {{communicate}} using primarily {{visual and}} auditory signals. Signals can be <b>interspecific</b> (between species) and intraspecific (within species).|$|E
5|$|Both {{intraspecific}} competition, {{with features}} such as sexual conflict and sexual selection, and <b>interspecific</b> competition, such as between predators, {{may be able to}} drive coevolution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interspecific</b> hybrids are the {{offspring}} from interspecies mating; these sometimes result in hybrid speciation.|$|E
5|$|Population hybrids {{result from}} the {{crossing}} of plants or animals in one population with those of another population. These include <b>interspecific</b> hybrids or crosses between different breeds.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{a number}} of <b>interspecific</b> Telopea hybrids have also been produced. These have been bred or used as more frost- or shade-tolerant plants in cooler climates such as Canberra, Melbourne or elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interspecific</b> hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from two species, normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and mules or hinnies have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile <b>interspecific</b> hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|E
5|$|Seeds can be {{used for}} {{propagation}} of the plant or to create hybrids and can take five to eight years to produce flowering plants. Since <b>interspecific</b> cross-pollination occurs, overlapping wild populations can create natural hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frogs are {{an example}} of an aposematic organism. Their bright {{coloration}} advertises unpalatability to potential predators. Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both <b>interspecific</b> and intraspecific – in their aposematic coloration. This is surprising given the frequency-dependent nature of this type of defense mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The adult bobcat has few predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in <b>interspecific</b> conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Great {{white sharks}} (Carcharodon carcharias) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle. There {{is a record}} of a small {{individual}} caught off Argentina that bore bite marks from a copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) or similar species, but it is uncertain whether the porbeagle {{was the target of}} attempted predation or if the two were simply involved in <b>interspecific</b> aggression. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Dinobothrium septaria and Hepatoxylon trichiuri, and the copepods Dinemoura producta, Laminifera doello-juradoi, and Pandarus floridanus. Natural annual mortality is low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of <b>interspecific</b> brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|Sylvia warblers are {{unusual in}} that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use {{identical}} habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are {{a feature of the}} Sylvia warblers as a group, and {{it has been suggested that}} this promotes <b>interspecific</b> competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} {{in the use}} of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs. <b>Interspecific</b> pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E
5|$|The {{allometric}} exponent for sail {{height is}} similar in magnitude to the scaling of <b>interspecific</b> antler length to shoulder height in cervids. Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed {{in the context of}} Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). There is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of the spines of D. limbatus (Romer and Price 1940).|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is known}} to hybridise with the black wildebeest. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented <b>interspecific</b> hybridisation, however it may occur when both species are confined within the same area, and the offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had congenital abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the Wormian bones of the skull. Another study reported {{an increase in the}} size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some hybrid animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat prey base {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the <b>interspecific</b> relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat {{is likely to have}} prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only <b>interspecific,</b> showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as <b>interspecific</b> hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E
5|$|<b>Interspecific</b> {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} {{is known}} to hybridise with its taxonomically close relative, the blue wildebeest. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented <b>interspecific</b> hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The mallard is {{omnivorous}} {{and very}} flexible in its choice of food. Its diet may vary based on several factors, including {{the stage of}} the breeding cycle, short-term variations in available food, nutrient availability, and <b>interspecific</b> and intraspecific competition. The majority of the mallard's diet seems to be made up of gastropods, invertebrates (including beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and caddisflies), crustaceans, worms, many varieties of seeds and plant matter, and roots and tubers. During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal matter and 62.4% plant matter, most notably Echinochloa crus-galli, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal matter and 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal matter and only 28.1% plant matter. Plants generally make up the larger part of a bird's diet, especially during autumn migration and in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of the {{wildebeest}} are known to hybridise. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented <b>interspecific</b> hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals, the tympanic part of the temporal bone is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} (1) covariance between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific {{response to the}} environment decouple the strongest intraspecific and <b>interspecific</b> competition experienced by a species. Intraspecific competition is strongest when a species is favored by the environment, whereas <b>interspecific</b> competition is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of <b>interspecific</b> competition when a species is not favored by the environment. As a consequence, the impact of intraspecific competition on the species favored by a particular environment exceeds that of the <b>interspecific</b> competition on species less favored by that environment. We see that the fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus storage effect is able to maintain stable coexistence {{in a community of}} competing species.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, <b>interspecific</b> {{competition}} {{occurs when}} members of different species compete for a shared resource. Members {{of the same species}} have very similar resources requirements whereas different species have a smaller contested resource overlap, resulting in intraspecific competition generally being a stronger force than <b>interspecific</b> competition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interspecific</b> {{competition}}, in ecology, {{is a form}} {{of competition}} in which individuals of different species compete for the same resources in an ecosystem (e.g. food or living space). This can be contrasted with <b>interspecific</b> cooperation, a type of symbiosis. Competition between members of the same species is called intraspecific competition.|$|E
25|$|In normal {{intraspecific}} crossings (resulting {{in normal}} hybrids of one species), the inheritance of plastid DNA {{appears to be}} quite strictly 100% uniparental. In <b>interspecific</b> hybridisations, however, the inheritance of plastids {{appears to be more}} erratic. Although plastids inherit mainly maternally in <b>interspecific</b> hybridisations, there are many reports of hybrids of flowering plants that contain plastids of the father.|$|E
25|$|Important {{implications}} {{of both the}} intra- and <b>interspecific</b> O–A relationships are discussed by Gaston et al.|$|E
25|$|If a {{tree species}} in a dense forest grows taller than {{surrounding}} tree species, it {{is able to}} absorb more of the incoming sunlight. However, less sunlight is then available for the trees that are shaded by the taller tree, thus <b>interspecific</b> competition. Leopards and lions can also be in <b>interspecific</b> competition, since both species feed on the same prey, and can be negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interspecific</b> hybrids of tall waterhemp and Amaranthus hybridus {{have been}} {{observed}} in experimental fields but have not been observed in agronomic fields.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, <b>interspecific</b> {{competition has}} {{great impact on}} community composition and structure. Niche separation of species, local extinction and competitive exclusion are {{only some of the}} possible effects. In addition to these, <b>interspecific</b> competition can be the source of a cascade of effects that build on each other. An example of such an effect is the introduction of an invasive species to the United States, purple-loosestrife. This plant when introduced to wetland communities often outcompetes much of the native flora and decreases species richness, food and shelter to many other species at higher trophic levels. In this way, one species can influence the populations of many other species as well as through a myriad of other interactions. Because of the complicated web of interactions that make up every ecosystem and habitat, the results of <b>interspecific</b> competition are complex and site-specific.|$|E
25|$|Competition is {{only one}} of many {{interacting}} biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure. Moreover, competition is not always a straightforward, direct, interaction. <b>Interspecific</b> competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered fecundity, growth, or survival may result in at least one species. <b>Interspecific</b> competition has the potential to alter populations, communities and the evolution of interacting species. On an individual organism level, competition can occur as interference or exploitative competition.|$|E
25|$|Bison (Bison bison) {{numbers in}} the {{northern}} range have been steadily increasing as elk numbers have declined, presumably due to a decrease in <b>interspecific</b> competition between the two species.|$|E
25|$|Many studies, {{including}} those cited previously, have shown major impacts on both individuals and populations from <b>interspecific</b> competition. Documentation of these impacts {{has been found}} in species from every major branch of organism. The effects of <b>interspecific</b> competition can also reach communities and can even influence the evolution of species as they adapt to avoid competition. This evolution may result in the exclusion of a species in the habitat, niche separation, and local extinction. The changes of these species over time can also change communities as other species must adapt.|$|E
25|$|Much animal {{communication}} is intraspecific, that is, it occurs {{between members of}} the same species. As for <b>interspecific</b> communication, that between predator and prey is of particular interest.|$|E
25|$|Mapping {{genes that}} cause partial to {{complete}} sterility in many <b>interspecific</b> hybrids. As many as 35 such genes have been mapped in Oryza, and sterility {{is a big}} problem in the perennial rice program.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the types}} {{described}} here can also apply to intraspecific competition, that is, competition among individuals within a species. Also, any specific example of <b>interspecific</b> competition {{can be described in}} terms of both a mechanism (e.g., resource or interference) and an outcome (symmetric or asymmetric).|$|E
