5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially coking coal which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating, which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E

Within three years the Kindite kingdom had split into four groups: Asad, Taghlib, Qays and Kinānah, each led by a prince of Kindah. These small 'principalities' were then overthrown in the 530s and 540s in a series of uprisings of the 'Adnānī tribes of Najd and Ḥijāz.|$|E

25|$|Universities {{used to have}} a {{freshman}} year to prepare students for a degree but now schools are expected to prepare students. This has had a <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> of moving the freshman programs down to grades 11 and 12 and programs for grades 11 to 12 down to grades 9 and 10. The grade 9 to 10 curriculum is now equivalent to grades 11 and 12 in many other countries and it covers more subjects than most other countries require for university.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} of the German Empire to cease minting silver thaler coins in 1871 caused a drop in demand and downward pressure {{on the value of}} silver; this had a <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> in the USA, where much of the supply was then mined. As a result, the United States Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1873, which changed the country's silver policy. Before the Act, the United States had backed its currency with both gold and silver, and it minted both types of coins. The Act moved the United States to a 'de facto' gold standard, which meant it would no longer buy silver at a statutory price or convert silver from the public into silver coins (though it would still mint silver dollars for export in the form of trade dollars).|$|E
25|$|Besides {{these events}} of purely {{religious}} interest {{there were others}} in the political order: through their initiative a more active trade was established between Indo-China, the Indies, and France; embassies were sent from place to place; treaties were signed. In 1681, Jacques-Charles de Brisacier was elected superior of the organization. In 1681 or 1682, the Siamese king Narai, who was seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named Governor of Phuket the French medical missionary Brother René Charbonneau, {{a member of the}} Siam mission of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. Charbonneau held the position of Governor until 1685. In 1687 a French expedition to Siam took possession of Bangkok, Mergui, and Jonselang, and France came close to possessing an Indo-Chinese empire, though failed following the 1688 Siamese revolution, with a <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> on the missions. Mgr Louis Laneau of the Society was involved in these events, and was imprisoned for two years with half {{of the members of the}} Seminar until he could resume his activities.|$|E

500|$|Andy Kellman from AllMusic {{wrote in}} his review that #1's was {{formatted}} the same was as other music scores and anthologies packed for the holiday shopping season. He further commented that its title should have been different and concluded, [...] "the disc reaffirms that Destiny's Child released {{some of the biggest}} R singles of the late '90s and early 2000s." [...] Slant Magazine Sal Cinquemani criticized the album's title as only four of the singles reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. However, he praised Destiny's Child's [...] "impressive output, which includes some of the most recognizable R hits of the past bling/celly/status-obsessed five years". BBC Online's writer James Blake called the album [...] "more than decent" [...] and added that the group's success in the music industry was a notable reason for a greatest hits release. However, he argued that it was very soon to include songs from their final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, as it was released only eleven months before #1's. Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell felt that it was a [...] "smart" [...] move not to arrange the songs on the compilation in a chronological order and felt it [...] "has the odd <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> of suggesting that their legacy may be based on a smaller body of work than imagined". Harvell finished the review by writing, [...] "you can take #1's as pure product and not feel wrong for doing so". Despite classifying its title as [...] "misleading" [...] and criticizing the new material, Houston Chronicles editor Michael D. Clark wrote the album was [...] "dolled up as beautiful and immaculate as" [...] the members of the group and included their best singles from their four studio albums.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} incidence of false whiplash claims to car insurance companies from motorists involved in minor car accidents (for instance; a shunt). Because the mechanism of injury is not fully understood, A doctors {{have to rely on}} a patient's external symptoms (which are easy to fake). Resultingly, [...] "no win no fee" [...] personal injury solicitors exploit this [...] "loophole" [...] for easy compensation money (often a £2500 payout). Ultimately this has resulted in increased motor insurance premiums, which has had the <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> of pricing younger drivers off the road.|$|E

2500|$|These orders {{had been}} of {{considerable}} importance in earlier centuries; but {{tended to be}} sidelined in cathedrals from the 4th century onwards. [...] So long as adult baptism continued as a regular occurrence, female deacons {{would continue to be}} needed for that service; but otherwise the main factor maintaining these orders was a <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> from the rule of continence applied to bishops, presbyters and deacons. [...] When a man became ordained, and moved into the episcopium {{with the rest of the}} bishop's familia; then there would usually also be a requirement for support to their mothers, wives and daughters; and the orders of widows and virgins respectively continued largely for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Economic growth, however, {{has been}} erratic and {{relatively}} slow, partially {{as a result}} of an over-reliance on the agricultural sector. Agriculture production is extremely susceptible to rainfall levels and ranges from 13% to 20% of GDP. Given that 36% of Morocco's population depends directly on agriculture production, droughts have a severe <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> to the economy. Two successive years of drought led to a 1% incline in real GDP in 1999 and stagnation in 2000. Better rains during the 2000 to 2001 growing season led to an 6.5% growth rate in 2001. Growth in 2006 went above 9%, this was achieved by a booming real estate market. Over the long term, Morocco will have to diversify its economy away from [...] to develop a more stable economic basis for growth.|$|E

The crises is described as the deflation of the asset bubble once confidence was undermined in key underlying factors: American house prices and the credit worthiness of sub-prime mortgages. [...] Following on from this was the liquidity crunch {{in the world of}} finance, with the <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> on the real economy. [...] Lord Skidelsky divides his discussion of the response into two sections, covering the bail-outs and the stimulus packages. He identifies the follow possible causes: financial innovation; lack of regulation; the behaviour of the bankers & hedge funds and the failings of both credit-rating agencies and governments. He finishes by asserting that all these actors are influenced by economic theories, and that it is recent trends in economics that are the real cause of the crises.|$|E
