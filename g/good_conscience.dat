5|$|While Article 34 of the {{constitution}} of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister {{that he could not}} in <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only promulgation (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.|$|E

25|$|The 1868 {{convention}} {{witnessed a}} meaningful {{discussion on the}} topic of pulpit and altar fellowship, one of the Four Points in American Lutheranism. Although there were several dissenting opinions, most of the pastors and lay delegates realized that they could not in <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> exchange pastors with non-Lutherans or invite them to commune at their altar. They felt that the position the General Council took on this subject was inadequate. They resolved that, unless it changed course, they would withdraw from the General Council.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, 1869, James and Sarah {{had another}} son, James Rowland Angell, who later served as {{president}} of Yale University. That same year, the University of Michigan offered Angell its presidency following the resignation of Erastus Haven. He visited Ann Arbor with his wife, but felt that he owed it to his supporters in Vermont to stay on with the University of Vermont. The offer was repeated in 1871, his former teacher Henry S. Frieze having served as acting president in the meantime. This time, Angell felt that the University of Vermont had made enough progress that he could leave it in <b>good</b> <b>conscience,</b> and he accepted the offer. He made a trip to Ann Arbor to deliver his inaugural address at Commencement on June 28, 1871, then returned to Vermont to finish out the academic term before moving his family to Ann Arbor for good in September of that year.|$|E

Carrier, despite his dictatorial ways, felt this disadvantage, no doubt, for his tone was more bland, his manner less curt. Only young Jacques Lalouët stood by--like a snarling terrier--still arrogant and still disdainful--the master of the situation--seeing that neither schemes of vengeance nor those of corruption had ruffled his self-assurance. He remained beside the door, ready to pounce on either of the two intruders if they showed the slightest sign of forgetting the majesty of the great proconsul.|$|R

60|$|By {{this word}} PURE I {{understand}} sometimes the chiefest good, the highest good. There {{are many things}} that may be called good, but none of them are good as grace is good. All things indeed are pure, that is, all creatures in themselves are good and serviceable to man, but they are not so good as grace (Rom 14:20; Gen 1:31). 'There is a generation that are pure,' that are good in their own eyes (Prov 30:12). There are <b>good</b> men, <b>good</b> <b>consciences,</b> <b>good</b> works, good days, good angels, &c., but none so good as grace, for it is grace that has made them so. Grace, this water of life, therefore is good, superlatively good, good in the highest degree, for that it makes all things good, and preserveth them good. And whatever it be that this water of life washeth not, it is soil, and given to the curse, as the prophet intimates where he saith, 'But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt' (Eze 47:1).|$|R

500|$|The secular {{approach}} to conscience includes psychological, physiological, sociological, humanitarian and authoritarian views. Lawrence Kohlberg considered critical conscience {{to be an}} important psychological stage in the proper moral development of humans, associated with the capacity to rationally weigh principles of responsibility, being best encouraged in the very young by linkage with humorous personifications (such as Jiminy Cricket) and later in adolescents by debates about individually pertinent moral dilemmas. Erik Erikson placed the development of conscience in the 'pre-schooler' phase of his eight stages of normal human personality development. The psychologist Martha Stout terms conscience [...] "an intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional attachments." [...] Thus a <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> is associated with feelings of integrity, psychological wholeness and peacefulness and is often described using adjectives such as [...] "quiet", [...] "clear" [...] and [...] "easy".|$|E

500|$|Lang {{believed}} that, as Prince of Wales, Edward had {{not always}} been wise in his choice of friends and acquaintances, whose standards Lang was later to condemn as [...] "alien to all the best instincts and traditions of his people". The archbishop had been aware for some time of the king's relationship with the American Wallis Simpson, then married to her second husband Ernest Simpson. In mid-1936 {{it became clear that}} the king intended to marry Simpson either before or shortly after his impending coronation, depending on the timing of her divorce from her husband. Lang agonised over whether he could, with <b>good</b> <b>conscience,</b> administer the Coronation Oath to the king in such circumstances, bearing in mind the Church's teaching on marriage. He confided to his diary his hopes that circumstances might change, or that he might be able to persuade the king to reconsider his actions, but the king refused to meet him. Lang kept close contact with the king's mother, Queen Mary, the prime minister and the king's private secretary.

500|$|Thomas A Kempis in {{the medieval}} contemplative classic The Imitation of Christ (ca 1418) stated that the glory of a good man is the witness of a <b>good</b> <b>{{conscience}}.</b> [...] "Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy." [...] The anonymous medieval author of the Christian mystical work The Cloud of Unknowing similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged contemplation a soul dries up the [...] "root and ground" [...] of the sin that is always there, even after one's confession and however busy one is in holy things: [...] "therefore, whoever would work at becoming a contemplative must first cleanse his [...] conscience." [...] The medieval Flemish mystic John of Ruysbroeck likewise held that true conscience has four aspects {{that are necessary to}} render a man just in the active and contemplative life: [...] "a free spirit, attracting itself through love"; [...] "an intellect enlightened by grace", [...] "a delight yielding propension or inclination" [...] and [...] "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival of}} Spanish {{cardinals}} Solis and de la Cerda on April 27 strengthened the anti-Jesuit party. They also {{violated the law}} of the conclave by establishing regular correspondence with Spanish ambassador Azpuru. The Spaniards had fewer scruples than Bernis and, supported by Cardinal Malvezzi, took the matter into their own hands. They paid attention to the only friar in the Sacred College, Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli, O.F.M.Conv. The attitude of Ganganelli towards the Jesuits was a great mystery – he had been educated by the Jesuits and it was said that he received the red hat at the instance of Father Lorenzo Ricci, general of the Society of Jesus, but during the pontificate of Clement XIII he did not engage himself in the defence of the Order. Cardinal Solis began by sounding him out as to his willingness to give the promise required by the Bourbon princes as an indispensable condition for election. Ganganelli answered that [...] "he recognized in the sovereign pontiff the right to extinguish, with <b>good</b> <b>conscience,</b> the Society of Jesus, provided he observed the canon law; and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the Crowns". It is not certain whether it was a written or only an oral promise, but this declaration fully satisfied the ambassadors.|$|E

In the iconography of this virtue, it is often shown leaning against a column or tower. Here it kills the dragon of discord in the tower. The tower is damaged by the dragon, but stands, thus symbolizing the triumph of fortitude over vice and disorder. The expression on her face reflects some pain, as if the effort to remove the dragon (evil) from the tower (the <b>Good,</b> the <b>conscience)</b> was not achieved without internal struggle. She recalls the role of the Christian knight in defense of the faith.|$|R
