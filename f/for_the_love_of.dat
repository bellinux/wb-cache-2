5|$|Alexander was {{nominated}} to the see of Lincoln in April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22 July 1123, {{at a ceremony}} held in Canterbury.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Christ is {{a central}} element of Christian belief and theology. It refers to <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ <b>for</b> humanity, <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Christians <b>for</b> Christ, and <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Christians <b>for</b> people. These aspects are {{distinct}} in Christian teachings - <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> Christ is a reflection <b>of</b> his <b>love</b> for his followers.|$|R
5|$|In his 1998 {{autobiography}} <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> the Game, Jordan {{wrote that}} he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992. The added exhaustion due to the Dream Team run in the 1992 Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.|$|E
5|$|Je Me Souviens was {{published}} in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published Actes et Entr'actes (Acts and Interludes), {{a collection of short}} plays and poems. One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Phaon the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves. The play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek.|$|E
5|$|While Rastignac desires {{wealth and}} social status, Goriot longs only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> his daughters: a longing that borders on idolatry. Because he {{represents}} bourgeois wealth acquired through trade– and not aristocratic primitive accumulation– his daughters {{are happy to}} take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of}} the book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.|$|E

5|$|Hu {{remained}} with Union {{and directed the}} company's next production, Soeara Berbisa, with peranakan sound technician Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed two young men who compete <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Djoewita had left the company at this point, and the studio hired Raden Soekarno for the leading role of this late 1941 release. The company's final completed production, Mega Mendoeng, was directed by Boen and announced soon after shooting for Soeara Berbisa had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942. In producing both films, Union emphasised realism and targeted educated audiences.|$|E
5|$|On March 24, 1917, Baker {{played his}} last hockey {{game at the}} Winter Garden at Exposition Hall in Pittsburgh. The game pitted an amateur all-star team from Philadelphia, led by Baker, against an all-star team from Pittsburgh's amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team {{defeated}} Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3–2. Baker scored all three Philadelphia goals to net a hat trick. Baker began to tire of playing hockey after 1915; the constant physical play of opposing players on the ice had taken its toll, and the growing professionalism of the sport went against his belief that sports should be played <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|The next Divine film, Lust in the Dust (1985), reunited {{him with}} Tab Hunter and was Divine's first film not {{directed}} by John Waters. Set in the Wild West {{during the nineteenth}} century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a promiscuous woman {{who works as a}} singer in saloons and competes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western Duel in the Sun, the film was a moderate critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of gay male gangster Hilly Blue in Trouble in Mind (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the part because he wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind the stereotype of simply being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine's performance.|$|E

25|$|In June 2007, Beyond Belief, an {{exhibition}} of Hirst's new work, opened at the White Cube gallery in London. The centre-piece, a Memento Mori titled <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> God, was a human skull recreated in platinum and adorned with 8,601 diamonds weighing a total of 1,106.18 carats. Approximately £15,000,000 worth of diamonds were used. It was modelled on an 18th-century skull, but the only surviving human {{part of the original}} is the teeth. The asking price for <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> God was £50,000,000 ($100million or 75million euros).
