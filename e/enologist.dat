25|$|Most of Cafayate {{region in}} Salta {{is located at}} 5,446 feet (1,660 meters) above sea levels in the river delta between the Rio Calchaqui and the Rio Santa Maria. The climate of the area {{experiences}} a foehn effect which traps rain producing cloud cover {{in the mountains and}} leaves the area dry and sunny. Despite its high altitude daytime temperatures in the summertime can reach 100°F (38°C) but at night the area experiences a wide diurnal temperature variation with night time temperatures dropping as low as 54°F (12°C). There is some threat of frost during the winter when temperatures can drop as low as 21°F (-6°C). Despite producing less than 2% of Argentina's yearly wine production, the Cafayate region is increasing gaining in prestige and appearance on wine labels, as well as foreign investment from worldwide wine producers such as <b>enologist</b> Michel Rolland and California wine producer Donald Hess.|$|E

2500|$|In 1866, Louis Pasteur, one of {{the pioneers}} of modern microbiology, {{isolated}} the first bacteria from wine and determined that all bacteria in wine were a cause for wine spoilage. While Pasteur did notice an acid reduction in wine with the lactic bacteria, he did not link that process to a consumption of malic acid by the bacteria, but rather assumed it was just tartrate precipitation. In 1891, the Swiss <b>enologist</b> Hermann Müller theorized that bacteria may be the cause of this reduction. With the aid of peers, Müller explained his theory of [...] "biological deacidication" [...] in 1913 to be caused by wine bacterium Bacterium gracile.|$|E

2500|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} {{is possibly}} {{as old as}} the history of wine, but scientific understanding of the positive benefits of MLF and control of the process is a relatively recent development. For many centuries, winemakers noticed an [...] "activity" [...] that would happen in their wines stored in barrel during the warm spring months following harvest. Like primary alcoholic fermentation, this phenomenon would release carbon dioxide gas and seem to have a profound change on the wine that was not always welcomed. It was described as a [...] "second fermentation" [...] in 1837 by the German <b>enologist</b> Freiherr von Babo and the cause for increased turbidity in the wine. Von Babo encouraged winemakers to quickly respond at the first sight of this activity by racking the wine into a new barrel, adding sulfur dioxide, and then following up with another set of racking and sulfuring to stabilize the wine.|$|E

2500|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was believed}} that up to the mid-19th century, Barolo was a sweet wine. This was attributed {{to the fact that the}} Nebbiolo grape ripens late in October meant that temperatures would be steadily dropping by harvest. By November and December, temperatures in the Piedmont region would be cold enough to halt fermentation, leaving a significant amount of residual sugar left in the wine. Another popular credence was that in the mid-19th century, Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, the mayor of Grinzane Cavour invited the French <b>enologist</b> Louis Oudart to the Barolo region to improve the winemaking techniques of the local producers. Using techniques focusing on improving the hygiene of the cellar, Oudart was able to ferment the Nebbiolo must completely dry, making the first modern Barolo. This new, [...] "dry" [...] red wine soon became a favorite among the nobility of Turin and the ruling House of Savoy, giving rise to the popular description of Barolo as [...] "the wine of kings, the king of wines".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, the French <b>enologist</b> Emile Peynaud {{recommended}} that Barbera producers use small oak barrels for fermentation and maturation {{in order to}} add subtle oak spice flavors and limited levels of oxygenation to soften the wine. The added oxygen would also limit the reductive quality of Barbera and the occurrence of off-odors of hydrogen sulfide that would occur in some examples. The polysaccharides picked up from the oak, was found to increase the richness of Barbera. At the time, his recommendation met some resistance from the tradition minded Barbera producers, but {{the success of the}} [...] "Super Tuscans" [...] which introduced new oak barrel treatment to Sangiovese caused many producers to reconsider. In addition to the subtle oxygenation and spice notes, oak imparts to the wine ligneous wood tannins which give structure to the wine without adding as much astringent bite as the tannins derived from the phenolic compounds of the grape. This, coupled with reduced maceration time, contributed to the production of softer wines. Lower yields and harvesting riper grapes with more fruit and sugar {{has been found to be}} a better balance for Barbera's high acidity.|$|E

The vine pest Phylloxera arrived in Mikulov and Dolní Dunajovice in 1900, struck Perná in 1901, and hit Horní Věstonice and Bavory in 1902, devastating the vineyards. Using Phylloxera-resistant rootstock, the vineyards were replanted with quality vines of single varietals.|$|R

25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of water stress {{is an area}} of continuing research in viticulture. Of particular focus is the connection between yield size and the potential benefits of water stress.

40|$|Abstract: The {{characterization}} of the metabolites accumulated in the grapes of specific cultivars grown in different climates is of particular importance for viticulturists and <b>enologists.</b> In the present study, the metabolite profiling of grapes from the cultivars, Alvarinho, Arinto and Padeiro de Basto, of two Portuguese Controlled Denomination of Origin (DOC) regions (Vinho Verde and Lisboa) was investigated by gas chromatography-coupled time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and an amino acid analyzer. Primary metabolites, including sugars, organic acids and amino acids, and some secondary metabolites were identified.

40|$|Abstract This {{exploratory}} work aims {{to identify}} the potential inhibitors of lactic bacterial growth and to propose enological practices to guarantee the occurrence of spontaneous malolactic fermentation (MLF) in wines from traditional and double-pruning management harvests in southeast Brazil. One white wine from a summer harvest and one red wine from a winter harvest that failed to complete MLF were utilized as comparative models to identify inhibitor compounds to lactic bacteria. Wine composition, alcoholic-fermentation temperature and bacterial strain {{contribute to the success}} or failure of MLF. Temperatures below 12 °C during alcoholic fermentation decrease lactic bacterial metabolism and may impair the bacteria’s growth after yeast cells lysis. A must pH below 3. 2 in a summer harvest impairs bacterial growth, and the association of low pH with a free-SO 2 concentration above 10 mg L- 1 may inhibit MLF. For grapes with a high sugar content, harvested in the winter cycle, <b>enologists</b> should keep the alcohol content below 15 % and control the alcoholic-fermentation temperature...|$|R
