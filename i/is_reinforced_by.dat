5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the work's {{provenance}} before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across {{all areas of the}} panels.|$|E
5|$|Stressing of {{the host}} tree and visible larval {{boreholes}} appear in the fourth stage. The infestation <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> further insects or fungi, which in turn may cause more symptoms. Imago, fungus, and larvae together can cause tree death in a period ranging from two weeks to eight months.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure {{in comparison to the}} immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E

5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E
5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, {{and it may be}} that the 260-day count is based on the human gestation period. This <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{crucifix}} measures 448cm x 390cm and {{consists of}} five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> two full length vertical battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.|$|E

40|$|The fixed-ratio {{requirement}} was {{varied in}} concurrent fixed-interval fixed-ratio schedules. Fixed-interval responding <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> food. In different phases, fixed-ratio responding <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> food or water. There {{was a direct}} relation between the ratio requirement and interval response rates when both responses <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> with food, but essentially no relation when the reinforcers were different.

5|$|The site of {{the battle}} is uncertain. Until {{relatively}} recently the battle was most commonly known by its Northumbrian name, the Battle of Nechtansmere, from the Old English for 'Nechtan's lake', following 12th-century English historian Symeon of Durham. The location of the battle near a lake <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> Nennius' record of the conflict as Gueith Linn Garan, Old Welsh for 'Battle of Crane Lake'. It is likely that Linn Garan was the original Pictish name for the lake.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E

5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the clock placed {{on the table beside}} him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the important and influential military aristocracy that formed in Mycenaean society offers an overwhelming impression of a fierce and warlike people. This impression of militarism <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the fortifications erected throughout Mycenaean Greece, the large numbers {{and quality of the}} weapons retrieved from the Mycenaean royal graves, artistic representations of war scenes and the textual evidence provided by the Linear B records. The Linear B scripts also offer some detail about the organization of the military personnel, while military production and logistics were supervised by a central authority from the palaces. According to the records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army; similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} a non-hierarchical, organic {{collection}} of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and blend in with, the surrounding rugged scenery and symbolise the connection between nature and the Scottish people. As a consequence the building has many features connected to nature and land, such as the leaf shaped motifs of the roof in the Garden Lobby of the building, and the large windows of the debating chamber, committee rooms and the Tower Buildings which face the broad expanse of Holyrood Park, Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. Inside the buildings, the connection to the land <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the use of Scottish rock such as gneiss and granite in the flooring and walls, {{and the use of}} oak and sycamore {{in the construction of the}} furniture.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} a large and {{powerful}} foot with brown spots and markings towards the edge, but is white nearer to the visceral hump that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs. The base of the anterior end of the foot has a distinct groove, which contains {{the opening of the}} pedal gland. Attached to the posterior end of the foot for about one third of its length is the dark brown, corneous, sickle-shaped operculum, which <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> a distinct central rib. The base of the posterior two-thirds of the animal's foot is rounded; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion. The columella, the central pillar within the shell, serves as the attachment point for the white columellar muscle. Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E

25|$|The {{second level}} of {{underground}} (950m, 3,200m2, 13,000m3) is 53m under the courtyard. Four tunnels were bored {{into the base}} of the hill: 1.(85m), 2.(42m), 3.(88m), 4.(70m). The complex contains large tunnels (5m high and 5.6m wide) and four chambers. Seventy-five per cent <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> concrete. There are two additional shafts leading to the surface, one with dimensions 3.5mx3.5m (45m) and one with diameter 0.5m (40m), presently used to supply electricity.|$|E
