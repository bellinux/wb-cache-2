In the concluding chapter ("Conclusions and Implications") Arebi theorizes the implications of the women writers’ role within their culture, and the cultural <b>apparatus</b> <b>driving</b> their discourse. She attempts to answer the question of whether we are justified in seeing their endeavor as a form of resistance, considering that they establish a dialectical relationship between opposition and affirmation of major cultural values and institutions.|$|R

Aim of the paper is to analyze the behavior of the resulting <b>driving</b> <b>apparatus</b> during the steering maneuver in order to subsequently develop a suitable control system. The analysis is carried out in two stages, termed kinematic and dynamic. The kinematic analysis describes the steering maneuver when no lateral forces are exerted on the vehicle whilst the dynamic analysis accounts for them. The study has been carried out by an analytical approach and has been documented by simulation. As a case study, a minicar is considere...|$|E
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} {{evidence of a}} global bifurcation on a highly turbulent von Karman flow. The mean flow presents multiple solutions: the canonical symmetric solution becomes marginally unstable towards a flow which breaks the basic symmetry of the <b>driving</b> <b>apparatus</b> even at very large Reynolds number. The global bifurcation between these states is highly subcritical and the system thus keeps a memory of its history. The transition recalls low-dimension dynamical systems transitions and exhibits a very peculiar statistics. We discuss the role of turbulence in two ways: the multiplicity of hydrodynamical solutions {{and the effect of}} fluctuations on the nature of transitions.

40|$|The dynamic free lance, {{discovered}} accidentally in 2005, is a {{new type}} of injection lance with its top-end connected with a flexible joint so that the lance tip could move during the gas injection. Without mechanical <b>driving</b> <b>apparatus,</b> the free lance is capable of injection of reagent into wide space of the bath. The investigation of the free lance indicated that the lance movement caused forceful interaction of the injection gas with the liquid phase, and jet trajectory was changed due to the drag force from the liquid phase. A lance with weight of 15 kg and length of 2 m has been used as the free lance for modeling study, indicating that the heavy free lance for the industry could achieve certain extent of movement for dispersion injection, and this prediction has been proved in 2012 by industrial application of the 9 meters free lance used for the injection modification of end-slag from BOF converter. In 2013, a stationary refractory lance with weight of 2 t for 120 t ladle of steelmaking desulphurization has also been redesigned and converted into the dynamic free lance with initial tests exhibiting the lance movement...|$|E

Since using the Electric-spark alloying (ESA) and Laser alloying (LA) the creation of coatings of different functions with improved physical and mechanical properties on iron alloys were proposed. In the application of new technological methods ESA and LA at complex composition saturated environments using (by two-time changes saturated atmosphere during ESA and add powdered carbides Cr 3 C 2, TiC, ZrC, graphite in liquid environment and at the using during LA powder (TiC, TiN) and carbon-containing paste) is set the increase surface hardness alloys of iron to 4 - 10 GPa and increase durability in 4 - 8 times due to additional surface enrichment carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides. A methods of the temperature distribution calculating in the surface layer of iron alloys and changes over time at the LA were developed.

40|$|Since {{the first}} months of 1955, the design of a pump-oxygenator system and it 2 ̆ 7 s method of {{application}} of extracorporeal circulation has been studied in our experimental laboratory for the purpose of creation a most simplified Pump-oxygenator Apparatus. Modified Sigma-motor Pumps named by Type III and IV, have been created in our laboratory. The Output of the Pump Type III and IV were 2050 ml/min and 8300 ml/min respectively. Fundamental studies of the Pressure-flow characteristics of these pumps revealed the necessity for obtaining the optimum occlusive setting of the pressure plate to maintain stable flow in face of considerable variation in systemic resistence during perfusion. Hemolysis due to pumping action is a direct function of stroke volume rather than presence or absence of total occlusion in these pumps studied. On the base of fundamental research concerned efficiency of oxygenation and debubbling, the most simplified bubble oxygenator model I-IV have been constructed of two vinyl plastic tube employing the same principle of a vertical blood-oxygen mixing tube and an antifoam coated debubbling tube in our laboratory. The experiments of extracorporeal circulation utilizing those pump-oxygenator model I-IV have been done in 10 dogs, obtaining the results as follow : All of three dogs perfused with model I died within 24 hours. One of two dogs perfused with model II lived for five days and one of two dogs perfused with model III survived for three days. Finally there was one long term survival in three doge undergoing perfusion with model IV. A step-by-step improvement of oxygenator 2 ̆ 7 s design has carried out on the earlier models led to the configuration of the model IV proving no cardinal defect of it 2 ̆ 7 s function for extra-corporeal circulation. Subsutitution of a helical reservoir for the vertical glass reservoir for the final elimination of all bubbles in oxygenator model IV (modified De Wall 2 ̆ 7 s type) has improved the over all poor results described above. Of the total number of 19 dogs which were by-passed with the helix reservoir oxygenator, seven died within 24 hours, one lived for six days, and eight surived more than one week. In the first 11 dogs undergoing perfusion, the survival rate obtained was only 30 per cent. There was, however, survival rate of 86 per cent in the latter consecutive series of eight dogs perfused by well-drilled team. A striking improvement in survival rate was epecially evident when total body perfusion has been done by the highly disciplined team keeping a well-balanced in-and-out flow and an adequate application of the bubble exygenator. During this study, techniques and team work have been develeped which appear to have reduced the hazards of total body perfusion. It seems to be more important what team is <b>driving</b> <b>apparatus</b> than what type of apparatus is used. This proves the all importance of team work and technical skill...|$|E
