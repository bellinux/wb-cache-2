40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} {{consists in}} analysing {{the results of the}} biotechnological techniques (insemination, embryotransfer) for a selected herd of meat-type cattle raised in a foothills countryside dutiny 5 years (2002 [...] 2006) and their comparison with natural breeding. The results this obtained are presented in dependence on the breed, <b>faters</b> origin and calving month. The analysis involves 795 Charolais calves and 450 meat-type Siemental calves. In the Charolais group insemination gave 275 calves, while natural breeding gave 520 calves. In the case of meat-type Siemental group the corresponding numbers are 179 and 271, accordingly. After embryotranfer we have got 4 Charolais calves and 15 calves of the other breed. The work evaluates the influence of the technique of breeding on to the rate of calf grow, with this investigation being performed in dependence on the breed. The meat-type Siemental bulls have shown a significant difference (p > 0, 05) in the live weight of the calves 120 and 365 days old. In this age bulls born after insemination have been heavier (183, 9 kg, 527, 9 kg) in comparison with bulls born after natural breeding (172, 4 kg, 497, 0 kg). Concerming Charolais bulls, no statistically significant difference in the live weight have been found. In addition, no significant influence of the mode of breeding on to the live weight has been found for heifers of both breeds. Concerning the effect of the calving month on the rate of grow, the meat-type Siemntal calves have shown a highly statistically significant (p > 0, 001) difference in the live weight of calves born in March. The live weights of calves born in March and weighed at 120, 210 and 365 days have been 181, 17 kg, 289, 2 kg and 510, 31 kg, these values being valid for calves after insemination. The corresponding values for natural breeding are lower, particularly 168, 26 kg, 271, 37 kg and 439, 59 kg. In addition a statistically considerable difference (p > 0, 01) in the live weight has been found for calves 120 days old if the calves were born in April. Insemination has led to a live weight of 194, 5 kg, while natural breeding to 168, 9 kg. In the group of Charolais calves a statistically significant difference (p > 0, 01 [...] 0, 05) has been found at the age of 365 days. Calves born after insemination had a higher live weight (462, 85 kg) as compared to those born after natural breeding (432, 85 kg). As concerns the parameters characterising fertility, the following ones have been analysed: the service period (SP), the birth-to-birth interval and the percentage of becoming pregnanat after the first insemination. For the whole period under investigation, the SP value for the Charolais calves (T 100) has been 89, 19 days while for the meat-type Siemental calves (S 100) 80, 04 days. As concerns the birth-to-birth period found for Charolais (381, 32 days) and the meat-type Siemental (390, 35 days), it may be stated that these results are satisfactory. The percentage of becoming pregnant after the first insemination has shown a downword trend for both breeds {{in the course of the}} years under study. Investigated paramentrs of growth and reproduction are markedly influenced by the breed...|$|R

50|$|An estate on an eight-hectare (20 acre) {{property}} in Buenos Aires' southside became {{the site of}} a homemade museum in 1866, when 14-year-old Francisco Moreno and his <b>fater</b> his father classified and mounted their extensive collection of fossils and artifacts, gathered in excursions along the vast lot. Following his landmark exploration of Patagonia during the 1870s and '80s, Moreno established a charitable school at the estate, soon becoming a magnet for the largely underprivileged children of the Nueva Pompeya area. Selling the property to Swiss Italian shoe manufacturer Félix Bernasconi, Moreno's dream for a landmark school at the site was included by the Swiss industrialist in his will. Bernasconi's death in 1914 was followed by lobbying for federal contributions to the project on the part of Moreno, who leveraged the prestige he earned in his role in the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina and as Assistant Director of the National Education Council to secure funding for the new school.|$|E
50|$|The {{reconstruction}} of unknown proto-languages is inherently subjective. In the Proto-Algonquian example above, {{the choice of}} *m as the parent phoneme is only likely, not certain. It is conceivable that a Proto-Algonquian language with *b in those positions split into two branches, one which preserved *b and one which changed it to *m instead; and while the first branch only developed into Arapaho, the second spread out wider and developed into all the other Algonquian tribes. It {{is also possible that}} the nearest common ancestor of the Algonquian languages used some other sound instead, such as *p, which eventually mutated to *b in one branch and to *m in the other. While examples of strikingly complicated and even circular developments are indeed known to have occurred (such as PIE *t > Pre-Proto-Germanic *þ > PG *ð > Proto-West-Germanic *d > Old High German t in <b>fater</b> > Modern German Vater), {{in the absence of any}} evidence or other reason to postulate a more complicated development, the preference of a simpler explanation is justified by the principle of parsimony, also known as Occam's razor. Since reconstruction involves many of these choices, some linguists prefer to view the reconstructed features as abstract representations of sound correspondences, rather than as objects with a historical time and place.|$|E

40|$|Introduction A {{system of}} {{differential}} equations is stiff {{when there are}} two or more very different scales of the independent variable. Different steps of integration correspond {{to each of these}} scales, and if the system is solved through traditional methods and accuracy and stability have to be maintained, the smallest of all steps should be chosen. This might lead to very slow and inefficient integration. Alternative methods have been investigated in which the step of integration can be much larger and the integration much <b>fater.</b> Most of the methods proposed are generalizations of traditional techniques like Runge-Kutta schemes, the Bulirsch-Stoer method and predictorcorrector algorithms. Typically, implicit integration is chosen, because explicit methods often suffer stability problems in stiff sets of equations. Furthermore, elaborate step adaptation schemes are provided to accomodate all possible scales of the independent variable. 2 Overview of methods T...|$|E

Among desirable improvements are the ability to use total nucleic acids (TNA) extracts from infected hosts (to bypass viral purification limitations) for the direct one-step amplification of large FL-cDNAs, the possibility to inoculate plants with uncloned FL-cDNAs and the simplified cloning of these large molecules. Results: Using the 7. 55 kb genome of Apple chlorotic leaf spot trichovirus (ACLSV) approaches allowing the rapid generation from TNA extracts of FL-cDNAs {{under the control of the}} T 7 promoter and the successful inoculation of plants using in vitro transcripts obtained from these uncloned amplification products have been developed.

Proceedings of the 10 th International Workshop on Boolean Problems, Freiberg, Germany, Sept. 19 - 21, 2012, pp. 225 - 232, 2011 Algebraic immunity (Al) is a property of a Boolean function f that measures its susceptibility to an alebraic attack. If f has a low algebraic immunity and f is used in an encryption protocol, then there are ways to successfully cyrptanalyze the system. As a result, {{it is important to have}} an efficient means to compute the alebraic immunity of Boolean functions. Unfortunately, algebraic immunity is one of the most complex cryptographic properties to compute. For example, it is significantly more difficult to compute than nonlinearity. Here, we show the advantage of a reconfigurable computer in computating a function's algebraic immunity. For example, we show that a reconfigurable computer is 4. 9 times faster than a conventional computer in this computation for 5 -variable computer is 4. 9 times <b>fater</b> than a conventional computer in this computation for 5 -variable functions. Indeed, we compute the distribution of functions to algebraic immunity for all 5 -variable functions, a computation that has not been previously accomplished.
