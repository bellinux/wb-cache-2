50|$|An {{instance}} of cheating on screening tests occurred in 2006, where DHS officials found TSA agents cooperating with workers of Covenant Aviation Security in the San Francisco International Airport, {{in which the}} TSA gave the private security firm an early notice of upcoming inspections. Covenant Aviation Security went on to set off the screeners {{to make it seem}} as though they were properly <b>inspecting</b> <b>luggage.</b> All TSA officials, as well the security personnel from Covenant Aviation Security were disciplined, but none ended up losing their jobs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Inspecting</b> <b>luggage</b> of {{passengers}} that {{get across the}} important passageway (such as airdrome, dock, depot etc.) has become broad safety precaution in the world. However, these inspected images have a large size of the datasets. In general, the useful and useless information in the luggage X-ray inspection image sequence don’t be distinguished, so much computation resource and storage space are wasted. Considering the speciality of this sequence, we researched a compression method based on interesting region detection using ridgelet. The hybrid method was composed of ridgelet transform and background subtraction, which could detect the image with interesting region change efficiently. First, judge the present image whether with interesting luggage change or not. If having, compress the image with low loss or lossless. Else, compress the image with high compression ratio. The experiment showed the effectiveness of our compression method. Keywords: X-ray inspection, compression, ridgelet, background subtraction 1...|$|E
5000|$|Beagle Brigade {{is a team}} of beagles {{and their}} human {{handlers}} who, {{as part of the}} United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), <b>inspect</b> <b>luggage</b> at U.S. airports searching for agricultural products. [...] According to the USDA, the Beagle Brigade program averages around 75,000 seizures of prohibited agricultural products a year.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the Palestinian National Authority, {{according}} to Oslo Accord assigned by PLO and the Israeli government, became a partial supervisor over the Rafah Border Crossing to Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority {{was responsible for}} issuing passports to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, Israel remained the major responsible party for this crossing point. According to the agreement, Israel {{has the right to}} independently <b>inspect</b> <b>luggage</b> and to maintain security. In addition, it can prevent anyone from using the crossing.|$|R
50|$|In general, a port {{of entry}} (POE) {{is a place where}} one may {{lawfully}} enter a country. It typically has a staff of people who check passports and visas and <b>inspect</b> <b>luggage</b> to assure that contraband is not imported. International airports are usually ports of entry, as are road and rail crossings on a land border. Seaports can be used as ports of entry only if a dedicated customs presence is posted there. The choice of whether to become a {{port of entry}} is up to the civil authority controlling the port.|$|R
25|$|Fear of {{subversion}} {{was widespread}} throughout the state. In West and Middle Tennessee it was fear of pro-Union activism, which was countered proactively by numerous local Committees of Safety and Vigilance from 1860 to 1862. They emerged {{as early as}} the 1860 Presidential election, and when the war began activists developed an aggressive program to detect and suppress Unionists. The committees set up a spy system, intercepted mail, <b>inspected</b> <b>luggage,</b> forced the enlistment of men into the Confederate Army, confiscated private property, and whenever it seemed necessary lynched enemies of the Confederacy. The committees were disbanded by the Union Army when it took control in 1862.|$|R
50|$|Peng {{questioned}} Arnold, {{and began}} <b>inspecting</b> his <b>luggage,</b> noting {{a laptop computer}} and several computer accessories. Peng instructed Arnold {{to turn on the}} computer so she could see if it was functioning. CBP Officer John Roberts was called to assist with the inspection while the computer was booting up.|$|R

50|$|Under the German {{occupation}} of France during World War II, {{his work was}} condemned by the Nazis as degenerate. With the assistance of Varian Fry in Marseille, Masson escaped the Nazi regime on a ship to the French island of Martinique from where {{he went on to}} the United States. Upon arrival in New York City, U.S. customs officials <b>inspecting</b> Masson's <b>luggage</b> found a cache of his erotic drawings. Living in New Preston, Connecticut his work became an important influence on American abstract expressionists, such as Jackson Pollock. Following the war, he returned to France and settled in Aix-en-Provence where he painted a number of landscapes.|$|R
50|$|Spontaneous fission gives {{much the}} same result as induced nuclear fission. However, like other forms of {{radioactive}} decay, it occurs due to quantum tunneling, without the atom having been struck by a neutron or other particle as in induced nuclear fission. Spontaneous fissions release neutrons as all fissions do, so if a critical mass is present, a spontaneous fission can initiate a self-sustaining chain reaction. Radioisotopes for which spontaneous fission is not negligible {{can be used as}} neutron sources. For example, californium-252 (half-life 2.645 years, SF branch ratio about 3.1 percent) can be used for this purpose. The neutrons released can be used to <b>inspect</b> airline <b>luggage</b> for hidden explosives, to gauge the moisture content of soil in highway and building construction, or to measure the moisture of materials stored in silos, for example.|$|R
5|$|Prior to federation, {{the various}} Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods {{from the other}} colonies, ostensibly for the {{protection}} of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts <b>inspecting</b> goods and <b>luggage</b> to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.|$|R
40|$|Arabic	Language Airports Security is {{becoming}} an important issue, because of the increasing of air piracy incidents, which use a number of tricks and methods, and this requires actions for safety and fluency of air traffic, {{as well as to}} increase the efficiency of the airport traffic. This book talks about Airport Security. It deals with the reasons of hijacking; it also delivers specific recommendations, orientations and policies about the necessary security procedures to face such incidents. The book points to the declining of hijacking because of the restricted inspections and sorting of suspected people. It also shows three general ideas related to the inspection process before getting on board, first; the cleaned junction which finds a central point for inspection in the beginning of each junction which can serve several gates where X-Ray can be used to <b>inspect</b> the <b>luggage.</b> Second, the boarding area to the cleaned plane, it’s considered as an alternative arrangement when the cleaned junction is not practical, and it’s distinguished by the inspection and sorting are done upon the travelers’ arrival to the exit gate to the plane. Third, the passengers’ sorting at the exit gate to the plane, the traveler who is spotted by the metal detector should go aside for further inspections where every metal object can be removed then go through the metal detector again. In addition to the previous, the book clarifies the security in dealing with luggage, how to handle a bomb threats, emergency plans and training the plane crew to cope with the emergency situations...|$|R
5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to <b>inspect</b> passengers and <b>luggage,</b> causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|R
