40|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the prices of}} <b>deposit</b> and loan <b>services</b> is to view the differentials between actual loan and deposit interest rates and appropriate “reference rates ” as the “indirectly measured prices of <b>deposit</b> and loan <b>services.</b> ” In fact, the ONS in the UK and the BLS in the US are considering the adoption {{of this type of}} estimation method for their measurements of <b>deposit</b> and loan <b>services</b> prices. This paper reviews the prior research at the ONS and BLS, identifies the problem points, and examines the feasibility of using published interest rate data “of a constant quality ” to indirectly measure <b>deposit</b> and loan <b>services</b> prices in Japan. The conclusions show: (1) published interest rate data that is indicative and “of a constant quality ” is not available for certain lending rates; and (2) there are logical inconsistencies between the published-interest-rate-data-based method for measuring <b>deposit</b> and loan <b>service</b> prices which is examined in this paper and the input-output tables, which are presently utilized to determine the weights of individual service prices in the Corporate Service Price Index (CSPI). Consequently, the paper concludes that {{it would be difficult to}} incorporate indirectly measured <b>deposit</b> and loan <b>service</b> prices in the CSPI. * The author would like to thank Professor Takanobu Nakajima of Keio University for his useful comments during th...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the degree of}} {{competition}} in the Hungarian household credit and deposit markets. We estimate discrete-choice, multinomial logit <b>deposit</b> <b>service</b> and loan demand functions for each bank and calculate the corresponding price elasticities. Two models of the banking industry are considered: a static, differentiated product Nash-Bertrand oligopoly (as non-collusive benchmark) and a cartel. With estimated marginal costs and observed interest rates we calculate the price-cost margins and compare these to the theoretically implied ones. We find that in our sample period the competition in the Hungarian banking sector is low, i. e. price-cost margins are high. Demand, discrete choice, product differentiation, banking, market power. ...|$|R
