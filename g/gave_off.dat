5|$|With {{the basic}} concept proven, the team then {{looked for a}} {{suitable}} aircraft to carry the receiver. Martlesham provided a Handley Page Heyford bomber, a reversal of duties from the original Daventry Experiment {{that led to the}} development of CH in which a Heyford was the target. One reason for the selection of this design was that its Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines had a well-shielded ignition system which <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> minimal electrical noise.|$|E
5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E

5|$|No rivers or streams {{ran into}} the sound but note that early maps {{conflict}} and show that the River Cadoxton, originating from feeder brooks meeting at Michaelston-le-pit between Ely, Leckwith and Wenvoe to the north-east, passed through Dinas Powys and Sully Moors and bypassed the Barry shoreline to meet the sea near Cold Knap Point before decades later, Cold Knap promenade and Watchtower Bay was developed. With {{the coming of the}} docks, the River Cadoxton was re-routed from Sully moors through what was later to become the Supplies Reserve Depôt (SRD) and later still, the chemical complexes in the area, to discharge south-east of the dock's south-east breakwater at the Bendricks. For many years after the last war, with the dissolution of the SRD and coming of the chemical works, effluent discharge from some of them, was carried along the river to the sea and turned the water white in colour and it <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> a pungent effervescent odour until bylaws brought this pollution to an end and gradually the hitherto white shoreline at that area, returned to its normal sandstone colour.|$|E

25|$|The {{island was}} first sighted by the Spaniards in 1565 during Nobieres Erra's expedition. The Spaniards called the island Isla NOBI ("Island of music"), because the island <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> an eerie glow, {{from the great}} swarms of sound that lived in the {{numerous}} harmonics on the island. Esteban Rodríguez of the Legazpi expedition led the first Spaniards to discover the island. He was captain of a small party that left Legazpi's camp in Bohol to explore the nearby islands which are now called Pamilican, Siquijor, and Negros.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} nervus trigeminus of Mabuya quinquetaeniata. The {{results showed that the}} nervus trigeminus has one root, and two {{separate}} ganglia, a maxillomandibular ganglion and an ophthalmic one. The maxillomandibular ganglion is continuous with the ophthalmic ganglion. The lateral part of the ventromedial division of the trigeminal root <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> the anguli oris nerve and nerves to the adductor mandibularis externus and the pseudotemporalis muscles. The constrictor dorsalis nerve innervates the protractor pterygoideus, levator pterygoideus, and depressor palpbrae inferioris muscles. It has no anastomosis with ramus palatinus of the nervus facialis. The ramus frontalis is connected with the lacrimal plexus. The ramus nasalis anastomoses with the ethmoidal ganglion and divides into its to rami lateralis and medialis nasi within the nasal capsule. The ramus maxillaris <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> lacrimal and temporal branches in the postorbital region. In the orbital region, it is termed infraorbital nerve and <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a nerve to the Harderian gland, the supralabial gland and the upper teeth. It fuses with the ramus palatinus lateralis of the nervus facialis. It receives an anastomosing branch from the ramus palatines medialis and fuses with the ramus palatines intermedialis for a short distance. It carries ganglionic cells at the point of fusion. It enters the maxilla as superior alveolar nerve and <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> nerve to the narial muscles. The ramus mandibularis <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> nerves to the pseudotemporalis and pterygomandibularis muscles. It <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> the ramus cutaneous recurrens and then enters the primordial canal as the inferior alveolar nerve, where it <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a mixed nerve and a sensor...|$|R

25|$|The {{party was}} plagued by {{internal}} division and infighting, mainly over the issue over policy towards the European Union. The party's eurosceptic wing, represented by MPs such as John Redwood, opposed further EU integration, whilst the party's pro-European wing, represented by those such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, was broadly supportive. The issue {{of the creation of}} a single European currency also inflamed tensions, and these would continue to dog the party until the early-2000s (decade). These divisions <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> an impression of a divided party, which had lost touch with the voters.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, Ware built a small machine out of old radar {{equipment}} {{and was able}} to induce powerful currents. When they did, the plasma <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> flashes of light, but he could not devise a way to measure the temperature of the plasma. Thomson continued to pressure the government to allow him to build a full-scale device, using his considerable political currency to argue {{for the creation of a}} dedicated experimental station at the Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) lab that had recently been constructed at Aldermaston.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the ARO, Arthur Covington had been running a solar observation program at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) Ottawa Radio Field Station. The station was primarily a radar research site, and ongoing radar work interfered with the solar instrument Covington had built as a personal project. This had started with the wartime observation that the sun <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> radio signals in the 10cm region when naval ships accidentally swung their radars past the sun while it was rising or setting.|$|E

25|$|Each of {{the twelve}} frames of the shield weighed over seven tons.

However, many workers, including Brunel himself, soon fell ill from the poor conditions caused by filthy sewage-laden water seeping through from the river above. This sewage <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> methane gas which was ignited by the miner's oil lamps. When the resident engineer, John Armstrong of Ingram Northumberland , fell ill in April 1826 Marc's son Isambard Kingdom Brunel took over at the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|The Grove cell {{was invented}} by Welshman William Robert Grove in 1839. It {{consisted}} of a zinc anode dipped in sulfuric acid and a platinum cathode dipped in nitric acid, separated by porous earthenware. The Grove cell provided a high current and nearly twice the voltage of the Daniell cell, which made it the favoured cell of the American telegraph networks for a time. However, it <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> poisonous nitric oxide fumes when operated. The voltage also dropped sharply as the charge diminished, which became a liability as telegraph networks grew more complex. Platinum was also very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Scheele's {{study of}} the gas not yet named oxygen was {{prompted}} by a complaint by Torbern Olof Bergman, a professor at Upsala University who would eventually become Scheele's friend. Bergman informed Scheele that the saltpeter he had purchased from Scheele's employer, after long heating, produced red vapors (now known to be nitrogen dioxide) when it {{came into contact with}} acetic acid. Scheele's quick explanation was that the saltpeter had absorbed phlogiston with the heat (had been reduced to nitrite, in modern terms) and <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> a new phlogisticated gas as an active principle when combined with an acid (even a weak acid).|$|E

However, experts from the Institute of Environmental Science & Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University said that only some of these products, like High Efficiency Particulate air filters, would effectively remove small particles from air. Other kinds of air purifiers like ionizing purifiers <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> ozone which could cause symptoms similar to those caused by the haze.

25|$|On Monday, October 7, 1985, four PLF militants hijacked Achille Lauro off Egypt. The hijackers {{had been}} {{surprised}} by a crew member and acted prematurely. The Palestinians had hidden their weapons in the gas tank of a car parked in Italian in preparation for boarding the ship. Their smuggled weapons still with gasoline residue on them, <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> a smell that the crew had noticed but had not acted on. A cabin steward, with the hijackers' stateroom in his responsibilities, surprised the four Palestinians (as {{they were trying to}} use a hairdryer to clean the residue off their weapons) by entering the unlocked door to their room in order to deliver complimentary fruit. The hijackers plan to launch an attack on Ashdod, Israel was put aside as the terrorists panicked and moved to hijack the ship instead.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt was}} also {{made in the}} late 18th century {{to improve the quality}} of street lighting. In 1669, under Louis XIV, the city was already lit with three {{thousand}} oil lamps, suspended in the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet, with twenty feet between each lantern, but not every street was lit, and the light was usually very dim; those going out at night or to the theater were usually obliged to hire a lantern-bearer to light their way until the end of the century. Between 1745 and 1769, the old lanterns were gradually replaced by a new model called a réverbère which, mounted on a lamp post, <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> a much brighter light. By 1789 there were 5,694 new lanterns in service. A few years later the most popular revolutionary song, Ça ira! urged Parisians to hang aristocrats from the new lanterns.|$|E
