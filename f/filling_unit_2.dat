40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} quantum ferromagnet {{filled with}} a liquid of skyrmions is studied theoretically {{in the context of}} the quantum Hall effect near electronic filling factor ν = 1. A cross-over between the classical ferromagnetic phase at ν = 1 and a classical paramagnetic phase at ν = 1 is obtained, which is consistent with recent Knight-shift measurements. A new collective mode associated with the skyrmion liquid that is of the cyclotron type is also identified. PACS Indices: 73. 40. Hm, 75. 10. Jm, 75. 40.

(2) Immediate values of dependent instructions are combined, if possible, which removes a step in the dependency chain. (3) Dependent pairs of shift and add instructions are combined into scaled add instructions. (4) Instructions are arranged within the trace segment to minimize the impact of the latency through the operand bypass network.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a maintenance policy {{for a system}} consisting of two units. Unit 1 is gradually deteriorating and is subject to soft failure. <b>Unit</b> <b>2</b> has a general lifetime distribution and is subject to hard failure. Condition of unit 1 {{of the system is}} monitored periodically and it is considered as failed when its deterioration level reaches or exceeds a critical level N. At the failure time of <b>unit</b> <b>2</b> system is considered as failed, and <b>unit</b> <b>2</b> will be correctively replaced by the next inspection epoch. <b>Unit</b> 1 or <b>2</b> are preventively replaced when deterioration level of unit 1 or age of <b>unit</b> <b>2</b> exceeds the related preventive maintenance (PM) levels. At the time of corrective or preventive replacement of <b>unit</b> <b>2,</b> there is an opportunity to replace unit 1 if its deterioration level reaches the opportunistic maintenance (OM) level. If <b>unit</b> <b>2</b> fails in an inspection interval, system stops operating although unit 1 has not failed. A mathematical model is derived to find the preventive and opportunistic replacement levels for unit 1 and preventive replacement age for <b>unit</b> <b>2,</b> that minimize the long run expected average cost per unit time.

40|$|This work {{examines}} dynamic cluster {{assignment for}} a clustered trace cache processor (CTCP). Previously pro-posed cluster assignment techniques run into unique prob-lems as issue width and cluster count increase. Realistic design conditions, such as variable data forwarding laten-cies between clusters and a heavily partitioned instruction window, increase {{the degree of}} difficulty for effective cluster assignment. In this work, the trace cache and <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> are used to per-form dynamic cluster assignment. The retire-time <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> analysis is aided by a dynamic profiling mechanism em-bedded within the trace cache. This mechanism provides information about inter-trace data dependencies, an ele-ment absent in previous retire-time CTCP cluster assign-ment work. The strategy proposed in this work leads to more intra-cluster data forwarding and shorter data forwarding distances. In addition, performing cluster assignment at re-tire time reduces issue-time complexity and eliminates early pipeline stages. This increases overall performance for in-teger programs by 11. 5 % over our base CTCP architecture. This speedup is significantly higher than a previously pro-posed retire-time CTCP assignment strategy. Dynamic clus-ter assignment is also evaluated for several alternate cluster designs {{as well as for}} media benchmarks. 1...|$|R
