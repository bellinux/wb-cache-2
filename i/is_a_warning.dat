5|$|The Parental Advisory label (abbreviated PAL) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> label first {{introduced}} by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1985 and later adopted by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 2011. It is placed on audio recordings in recognition of excessive profanities or inappropriate references, {{with the intention of}} alerting parents of potentially unsuitable material for younger children. The label was first affixed on physical 33 1/3 rpm records, compact discs and cassette tapes, and it has been included on digital listings offered by online music stores to accommodate the growing popularity of the latter platform.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{central theme}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> that, {{in times of}} strife and {{increased}} fear, {{there is a danger}} of repression and suppression of dissent by those in government who seek to limit freedom of speech. In an interview with the author, Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that his motivation for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> sign to predators.|$|E

25|$|The Black Dog of the Hanging Hills is an {{allegedly}} supernatural hound {{that appears}} in local folklore (see also Black dog for similar legends in other places). Folklore holds that it has haunted the region since the early 19th century and that it manifests as a small black dog, often gregarious in nature, which leaves no footprints and makes no sound. According to the legend, to see the Black Dog the first time results in joy while a second sighting <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning.</b> Seeing the Black Dog a third time {{is said to be}} a death omen.

[...] "Follow Me", a ballad with folk influences, is sung by Megan Garrett.

500|$|However, as Romanticist Jacqueline Labbe argues, Mary Shelley {{challenges}} {{the conventions of}} the Romantic travel narrative as well. For example, one reviewer wrote, [...] "now and then a French phrase drops sweetly enough from [...] fair mouth", and as Labbe explains, these phrases are supposed to lead the reader to imagine a [...] "beautiful heroine and her group passing easily from village to village". However, both French quotations in History of a Six Weeks' Tour undercut this Romantic image. The first describes the overturning of a boat and the drowning of its occupants; the second <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> not to travel on foot through France, as Napoleon's army has just been disbanded and the women {{are in danger of}} rape.|$|E

[...] "Don't Talk About Me" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> to a mouthy woman, while [...] "The Blues" [...] features the narrator's spiteful complaints about an ungrateful girlfriend. The latter song features aggressive bass, a funky break, doo-wop verses, a blues riff that the group's guitarist D'wayne Wiggins learned from his father, and ideas from pianist Vince Guaraldi's music for Peanuts television specials.|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics have}} {{described}} the 21st-century televised editions of the show as pornographic, [...] while others have described it as both [...] "outright commercialism" [...] and an infomercial. The Federal Communications Commission has received complaints regarding the broadcast, but no fines have been imposed, with the FCC, following the 2001 airing, citing the First Amendment and stating that [...] "sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium" [...] were not broadcast. [...] In the initial 2001 airing ABC blurred the screen on particularly sheer lingerie. [...] This enabled the show to pass muster with its internal Broadcast Standards and Practices department and to achieve the TV-14 rating. [...] In 2002, the National Organization for Women protested the show calling it a [...] "soft-core porn infomercial." [...] They were joined in protest by the Parents Television Council and other watchdog organizations. [...] CBS has given past shows TV-14 ratings, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> that the show may contain material unsuitable for children age 14 and under. [...] Nonetheless some affiliates {{have chosen not to}} air the show in past years including Fisher Broadcasting affiliates in Idaho. [...] In 2009, the American Decency Association organized email letters of protests to sponsors of the show including AT, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Netflix, Nikon, and Reebok. CBS has described the event to as [...] "the Super Bowl of fashion".|$|E
500|$|The Satanic Bible {{has also}} {{received}} {{a large amount of}} criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of [...] "Satanic panic," [...] when Satanic ritual abuse was feared to be epidemic. Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as [...] "uncritical and sensationalized." [...] Tom Harpur condemns the book as [...] "blasphemous" [...] and [...] "socially seditious," [...] and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts. Critics have also accused The Satanic Bible of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable. Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted. Possession of The Satanic Bible has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are antisocial, and some warn that possession of the book <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> sign of emotional issues. The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of The Satanic Bible. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for The Satanic Bible in their children's bedrooms, saying, [...] "You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction" [...] and [...] "It's like giving drugs to a kid who is already on the edge." [...] Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world, and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court. However, opposition to The Satanic Bible has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare. The book was banned in South Africa from 1973 to 1993.|$|E
