5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly <b>disavow</b> allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.|$|E
5|$|In 1998's A Clash of Kings, Mormont leads a {{party of}} Night's Watch rangers beyond the Wall to {{investigate}} the disappearance of Jon's uncle Benjen, assess {{the intentions of the}} wildling leader Mance Rayder and learn more of the threat posed by the Others. Jon is sent out with a scouting party led by Qhorin Halfhand. On the journey, Jon comes upon a wildling lookout and takes the warrior girl Ygritte captive; though told to kill her, Jon lets her escape. Jon and Qhorin are subsequently captured by the wildlings. Qhorin, who faces certain execution at Mance's hands, commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans, at any cost. Jon pretends to <b>disavow</b> the Night's Watch, and the wildlings force him to fight Qhorin to the death to earn their trust. With Qhorin's silent consent, Jon kills him with the aid of Ghost.|$|E

50|$|In May 2006, Romain Goulon (Aggressor, Arsebreed) joined <b>Disavowed</b> {{as the new}} drummer. After doing summer festivals, <b>Disavowed</b> {{started the}} {{recording}} of Stagnated Existence, the successor of Perceptive Deception. Robbert Kok www.audiovisualz.com {{took the lead in}} the recording and production of the new album, with assistance of the well-known Excess Studios. This new album shows the growth of <b>Disavowed</b> musically, without compromising brutality and aggressiveness. Disavowed’s goal was to make a CD that is diverse, catchy, well produced and fast, and according to many reviewers these goals have been achieved. To promote Stagnated Existence, <b>Disavowed</b> joined Cannibal Corpse in March 2007 for a 5-week European tour. The energetic shows were received with great enthusiasm by the European crowds and fed Disavowed’s hunger for more shows and tours.|$|R

5|$|The Rudd Concession, {{a written}} {{concession}} for exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and other adjoining territories {{in what is}} today Zimbabwe, was granted by King Lobengula of Matabeleland to Charles Rudd, James Rochfort Maguire and Francis Thompson, three agents {{acting on behalf of}} the South African-based politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes, on 30 October 1888. Despite Lobengula's retrospective attempts to <b>disavow</b> it, it proved the foundation for the royal charter granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes's British South Africa Company in October 1889, and thereafter for the Pioneer Column's occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, which marked the beginning of white settlement, administration and development in the country that eventually became Rhodesia, named after Rhodes, in 1895.|$|E
5|$|The {{concession}} conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to <b>disavow</b> the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The truce of Hudaybiyyah was {{enforced}} for two years. The {{tribe of}} Banu Khuza'a had {{good relations with}} Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans. A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'a, killing a few of them. The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also {{took part in the}} fighting. After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they <b>disavow</b> themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null.|$|E

25|$|A {{serious matter}} of {{conflict}} in Turkish-Greek relations since the 1950s has been Cyprus; at the time, it was a British colony with a Greek-Cypriot population share of 82% of the island's total. Some of the Greek Cypriots wanted unity (enosis) with Greece and, as early as 1931, there were nationalist riots in Nicosia. The Greek government was, due to its financial and diplomatic dependence on Britain, forced to <b>disavow</b> any aims for unification with Cyprus.|$|E
25|$|Metternich {{also tried}} to {{undermine}} the Russian foreign minister, Ioannis Kapodistrias, who was of Greek origin. Kapodistrias demanded that Alexander declare war on the Ottomans in order to liberate Greece and increase the greatness of Russia. Metternich persuaded Alexander that Kapodistrias was in league with the Italian Carbonari (an Italian revolutionary group), leading Alexander to <b>disavow</b> him.

25|$|Baptists {{subscribe}} to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and {{that it must be}} done by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists <b>disavow</b> this identity.|$|E

25|$|A {{short time}} later, Irving privately {{approached}} Penguin {{and offered to}} drop them from his lawsuit if they would pull the book from publication in the UK and destroy all of the remaining copies, publicly <b>disavow</b> all of Lipstadt's conclusions and make a charitable donation of £500 {{in the name of}} Irving's daughter (who is disabled). He also suggested to Penguin that they keep any terms confidential because {{he had no intention of}} settling with Lipstadt. Bays and Bateman made clear that the publisher rejected his terms. Three weeks later, Irving officially offered to settle with both parties, the terms being that the book be withdrawn from circulation, and both parties apologise and (each) make a £500 donation. Lipstadt instructed her lawyers to reject the offer.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the outset}} of his campaign, Trump was {{endorsed}} by various white nationalist and white supremacist movements and leaders. On February 24, 2016, David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, expressed vocal support for Trump's campaign on his radio show. Shortly thereafter {{in an interview with}} Jake Tapper, Trump repeatedly claimed to be ignorant of Duke and his support. Republican presidential rivals were quick to respond on his wavering, and Senator Marco Rubio stated the Duke endorsement made Trump un-electable. Others questioned his professed ignorance of Duke by pointing out that in 2000, Trump called him a [...] "Klansman". Trump later blamed the incident on a poor earpiece he was given by CNN. Later the same day Trump stated that he had previously <b>disavowed</b> Duke in a tweet posted with a video on his Twitter account. On March 3, 2016, Trump stated: [...] "David Duke is a bad person, who I <b>disavowed</b> on numerous occasions over the years. I <b>disavowed</b> him. I <b>disavowed</b> the KKK." ...|$|R
