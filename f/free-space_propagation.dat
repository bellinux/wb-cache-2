IRIS is applicable to adaptive sensing scenarios where the medium is illuminated and measured multiple times using different illiminator/sensor configurations, e. g., position, bandwidth, or polarization. These configurations are adaptively selected to minimize uncertainty in the image reconstruction. The IRIS algorithm has the following features: (1) use of a sparse Bayesian image model that captures the <b>free-space</b> dominated <b>propagation</b> characteristics of interiors of man-made structures such as caves and residences; (2) iterative reconstruction of both an image and an image confidence map from the posterior likelihood {{in the form of}} a thresholded Landweber recursion, (3) use of the Bayesian model to predict the best redeployment configuration of the illuminator platform given the current image and confidence map.

3000|$|We {{studied the}} problem of AOA-based {{localization}} using MIMO-OFDM channel state information as observation data. In particular, we derived a method to compute the CRLB which is a fundamental limit on the localization MSE and applied it to obtain fundamental insights into the problem. We found that the CRLB is independent {{of the strength of}} a reflection path. Therefore, we suggested that reflection paths with insignificant amplitude should not be included explicitly in the channel model. Provided that the mobile device-transmitted signal power is fixed, the following may be concluded from our investigation. The MSE localization performance can be improved by increasing the transmitted signal bandwidth B alone. However, there is a limit where further increasing B cannot further improve the performance. The limit is found to equal the performance virtually obtained from the <b>free-space</b> radio <b>propagation</b> assumption. The performance can be considerably improved also by increasing the base station antenna array size M alone, as, when M increases, not only does the free-space limit decrease but also the MSE gets closer to the decreasing limit.

Provided that the MSE is close to the free-space limit, the optimum unbiased estimator will be robust to variation on the number of multipaths N [...]...|$|R

We assume that the communication range is much larger than the radius of the sphere containing the antennas {{at both ends of the}} link, and we show that, in general, the capacity can only be achieved by transmitting multiple spatially-multiplexed data streams simultaneously over the channel. Furthermore, the lower bound on capacity can be approached asymptotically by transmitting the data streams between a pair of physically-realizable distributed antenna arrays at either end of the link. A consequence of this result is that, in general, communication at close to the maximum achievable data rate on a deep-space communication link can be achieved in practice if and only if the communication system utilizes spatial multiplexing over a distributed MIMO antenna array. Such an approach to deep-space communication does not appear to be envisioned currently by any of the international space agencies or any commercial space companies.
