40|$|Chapter of a {{multidisciplinary}} international book co-edited {{by the author}} {{in the framework of}} a large excellence 5 ys. project funded by the Austrian Research Fund (Forschungswissenschaftsfonds) on international tax coordination. The author pleads for a combined legal and economic methodology to alter the existing allocation rules in tax treaties with developing countries in order to preserve the international tax policy decisions of the developing countries and enhance international tax justice. The content analyses the criticism to tax sparing clauses, pleading for its reconsideration, and supports a more frequent use of <b>exclusive</b> allocation of <b>taxing</b> <b>powers.</b> The chapter critically reviews the reasons for the current structure tax treaty clauses and proposes for alternative solutions, which the author has also tested when drafting the Model Latin American Tax Convention with an international research group on behalf of the Instituto Latinoamericano de Derecho Tributario (ILADT). The chapter was drafted in the framework of research activities monitoring the development of European tax law for the European Science Foundation as Awardee of the European Young Investigator Award...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the actual constitutional, legislative and collecting <b>tax</b> <b>powers</b> {{in the hands}} of the Union. It proceeds first to unpack the very idea of <b>tax</b> <b>power,</b> and to distinguish its elements. On such a basis, I proceed to consider European norms and practices, and to reconstruct on such a basis the <b>tax</b> <b>powers</b> of the Union. It is then found that the Union’s <b>tax</b> <b>powers</b> are far wider than commonly asserted, especially on what concerns to the influence exerted on national and regional <b>taxing</b> <b>powers</b> by the Union’s constitutional and legislative <b>tax</b> <b>powers.</b> However, the Union still presents most of the features characteristic of a regulatory entity. Having said that, a dynamic reconstruction of these same powers indicates that the Union is moving towards a rights-based polity, also on what concerns its <b>taxing</b> <b>powers.</b> There are clear indications that the problem-solving conception of the Union is insufficient to explain and ground the <b>powers</b> to <b>tax</b> {{in the hands of}} the Union.

5000|$|The {{income tax}} is taken [...] "off the top", so the {{individual}} is left with $80 in after-tax money. Some tax laws impose taxes on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good's price. Unlike the income tax example above, these taxes do not include actual taxes owed {{as part of the}} base. A good priced at $80 with a 25% <b>exclusive</b> sales <b>tax</b> rate yields $20 in taxes owed. Since the sales tax is added [...] "on the top", the individual pays $20 of tax on $80 of pre-tax goods for a total cost of $100. In either case, the tax base of $100 can be treated as two parts—$80 of after-tax spending money and $20 of taxes owed. A 25% <b>exclusive</b> <b>tax</b> rate approximates a 20% inclusive tax rate after adjustment. By including taxes owed in the <b>tax</b> base, an <b>exclusive</b> <b>tax</b> rate can be directly compared to an inclusive tax rate.|$|R

40|$|The recent policy {{literature}} on fiscal federalism in China has {{concentrated on the}} large “vertical fiscal gap” resulting in inadequate local provision of public goods and services. Thus there is an evident interest in giving local governments more <b>taxing</b> <b>powers.</b> After a brief historical survey, the article discusses a 1993 State Council directive that centralized <b>taxing</b> <b>power.</b> This has led local governments {{to make use of}} their control over tax administration to alter effective tax rates, and to the practice of “refund after collection”, whereby local governments disguise tax cuts as expenditures, following a logic opposite to tax expenditures. This study concludes, firstly, that the allocation of <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> is still done outside the framework of the law, and secondly, that the government {{has not been able to}} settle on a stable allocation.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2012 decision in National Federation of Business v. Sibelius (NFIB).

The result in the case was not necessarily a surprise, but the reliance on the <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> was. This article discusses the understanding of the <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> reflected in NFIB; describes what Chief Justice Roberts did not say about the scope of that power; and considers what the decision means for future exercises of congressional power; concluding that NFIB is unlikely to cause Congress to abuse the <b>taxing</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Constitutional {{framework}} for the <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> is coherent. The prior reference in the literature to a “flaw” in the apportionment of income taxes is an ancillary issue. A Summary Table of the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Power</b> is provided here with examples that differentiate various tax levy methods from tax types. The individual mandate penalty at issue in Sebelius is categorized as a “capitation”-type tax. A Federal capitation tax is barred by Article 1, Section 2. The mention of capitation taxes in Section 9 merely clarifies that direct taxes must be apportioned according to the Census. The mandated purchase of insurance is also a new category of “tax” separate from the penalty. Following the holding in Sebelius, future cases {{will be needed to}} further clarify the limits of the <b>taxing</b> <b>power.</b> Given the trend in tax policy toward increased rates of Federal taxation of wage earnings, the issue of whether the Congressional <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> is solely a matter of Federalism or whether taxes levied on persons also limit individual liberty is likely to be of major significance going forward. Since the Affordable Care Act did not provide specifics on the penalty qua tax, many of the details were left to the Internal Revenue Service to determine in practice, albeit with some restrictions placed on its method of collections. If history is any guide, the Internal Revenue Service is unlikely to administer the mandate in a way that safeguards individual liberty...|$|R
