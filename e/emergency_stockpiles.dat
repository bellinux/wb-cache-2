5000|$|The {{outbreak}} of yellow fever in Angola in January 2016 has {{raised concerns about}} whether the global supply of vaccine is adequate to meet the need during a large epidemic or pandemic of the disease. Routine childhood immunization has been suspended in other African countries to ensure an adequate supply in the vaccination campaign against the outbreak in Angola. <b>Emergency</b> <b>stockpiles</b> of vaccine diverted to Angola, which consisted of about 10 million doses {{at the end of}} March 2016, had become exhausted, but were being replenished by May 2016. [...] However, in August it was reported that about 1 million doses of 6 million shipped in February had been sent to the wrong place or not kept cold enough to ensure efficacy, resulting in shortages to fight the spreading epidemic in DR Congo. As an emergency measure, experts have suggested using a fractional dose (1/5 or 1/10 of the usual dose) to extend existing supplies of vaccine. Others have noted that switching manufacturing processes to modern cell-culture technology might improve vaccine supply shortfalls. Manufacture of the current vaccine is slow and laborious. A new vaccine under investigation is made by a different means. On June 17, the WHO agreed to the use of 1/5 the usual dose as an emergency measure during the ongoing outbreak in Angola and the DR Congo. The fractional dose would not qualify for a yellow fever certificate of vaccination for travelers.|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{emergencies}} {{caused by}} earthquake, tornado, pandemic flu, terrorism attacks {{and so on}} can wreak havoc to communities. In order to mitigate {{the impact of the}} events, <b>emergency</b> <b>stockpiles</b> of food, water, medicine and other materials have been set up around the US to be delivered to the affected areas during relief operations. One type of stockpile is called the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The SNS logistics network is designed to have multiple stages of facilities, each of which is managed by different levels of governmental authorities - federal, state and local authorities. The design of a logistics network for delivery of the SNS materials within a state are explored in this dissertation. There are three major areas of focus in this dissertation: (1) the SNS facility location model, which is used to determine sites for locating Receiving, Staging and Storage (RSS) and Regional Distribution Nodes (RDNs) to form a logistics network to deliver relief material to Points of Demand (PODs), where the materials are directly delivered to the affected population; (2) the SNS Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is used to assist the SNS staff in determining the numbers of various types of trucks, and the routing schedules of each truck to develop an operational plan for delivering the required relief materials to the assigned PODs within the required duration; (3) the location-routing analysis of emergency scenarios, in which the facility location model and the VRP solution are integrated {{through the use of a}} computer program to run on several assumed emergency scenarios. Using real data from the department of public health in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a transshipment and location model is formulated to determine the facility locations and the transshipment quantities of materials; a multiple-vehicle routing model allowing split deliveries and multiple routes per vehicle that must be completed within a required duration is formulated to determine the routing and scheduling of trucks. The facility location model is implemented using Microsoft Solver Foundation and C#. An algorithm combining the Clark and Wright saving algorithm and Simulated Annealing is designed and implemented in C# to solve the VRP. The algorithm can determine whether there is shortage of transportation capacity, and if so, how many of various types of trucks should be added for optimal performance. All the solution algorithms are integrated into a web-based SNS planning tool. In the location-routing analysis of emergency scenarios, a binary location model and an algorithm for solving VRP solution are integrated as a computer program to forecast the feasibility of distribution plans and the numbers of required trucks of various types. The model also compares the costs and benefits of direct and indirect shipment. A large-scale emergency scenario in which a specific type of vaccine is required to be delivered to the entire state of Kentucky is considered. The experiments are designed based on the real data provided by the Kentucky state government. Thus the experimental results provide valuable suggestions for future SNS preparedness planning...|$|E

40|$|Background Substantial {{outbreaks}} of yellow fever in Angola and Brazil {{in the past}} 2 years, combined with global shortages in vaccine stockpiles, highlight a pressing need to assess present control strategies. The aims {{of this study were}} to estimate global yellow fever vaccination coverage from 1970 through to 2016 at high spatial resolution and to calculate the number of individuals still requiring vaccination to reach population coverage thresholds for outbreak prevention. Methods For this adjusted retrospective analysis, we compiled data from a range of sources (eg, WHO reports and health-service-provider registeries) reporting on yellow fever vaccination activities between May 1, 1939, and Oct 29, 2016. To account for uncertainty in how vaccine campaigns were targeted, we calculated three population coverage values to encompass alternative scenarios. We combined these data with demographic information and tracked vaccination coverage through time to estimate the proportion of the population who had ever received a yellow fever vaccine for each second level administrative division across countries at risk of yellow fever virus transmission from 1970 to 2016. Findings Overall, substantial increases in vaccine coverage have occurred since 1970, but notable gaps still exist in contemporary coverage within yellow fever risk zones. We estimate that between 393 · 7 million and 472 · 9 million people still require vaccination in areas at risk of yellow fever virus transmission to achieve the 80 % population coverage threshold recommended by WHO; this represents between 43 % and 52 % of the population within yellow fever risk zones, compared with between 66 % and 76 % of the population who would have required vaccination in 1970.

40|$|BackgroundFollowing {{successful}} {{eradication of}} wild polioviruses and planned globally-coordinated cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), national and global health leaders {{may need to}} respond to outbreaks from reintroduced live polioviruses, particularly vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). Preparing outbreak response plans and assessing potential vaccine needs from an <b>emergency</b> <b>stockpile</b> require consideration of the different national risks and conditions as they change with time after OPV cessation. MethodsWe used an integrated global model to consider several key issues related to managing poliovirus risks and outbreak response, including the time interval during which monovalent OPV (mOPV) can be safely used following homotypic OPV cessation; the timing, quality, and quantity of rounds required to stop transmission; vaccine stockpile needs; and the impacts of vaccine choices and surveillance quality. We compare the base case scenario that assumes aggressive outbreak response and sufficient mOPV available from the stockpile for all outbreaks {{that occur in the}} model, with various scenarios that change the outbreak response strategies. ResultsOutbreak response after OPV cessation will require careful management, with some circumstances expected to require more and/or higher quality rounds to stop transmission than others. For outbreaks involving serotype 2, using trivalent OPV instead of mOPV 2 following cessation of OPV serotype 2 but before cessation of OPV serotypes 1 and 3 would represent a good option if logistically feasible. Using mOPV for outbreak response can start new outbreaks if exported outside the outbreak population into populations with decreasing population immunity to transmission after OPV cessation, but failure to contain outbreaks resulting in exportation of the outbreak poliovirus may represent a greater risk. The possibility of mOPV use 20 generating new long-term poliovirus excretors represents a real concern. Using the base case outbreak response assumptions, we expect over 2520...|$|R
