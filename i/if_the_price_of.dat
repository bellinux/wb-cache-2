5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

The table below is an incomplete list of acquisitions, with each acquisition listed being for the respective company in its entirety, unless otherwise specified. The acquisition date listed is {{the date of the}} agreement between Google and the acquisition subject.

Google itself was re-organized into a subsidiary of a larger holding company known as Alphabet Inc. in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E
25|$|Relative {{changes in}} output goods prices drive the {{relative}} {{prices of the}} factors used to produce them. If the world price of capital-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative rental rate and decreases the relative wage rate (the return on capital as against the return to labor). Also, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> labor-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative wage rate and decreases the relative rental rate.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{short selling}} (also known as {{shorting}} or going short) is {{the practice of}} selling securities or other financial instruments that are not currently owned (usually borrowed), and subsequently repurchasing them ("covering"). In {{the event of an}} interim price decline, the short seller profits, since the cost of (re)purchase is less than the proceeds received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the short position closes out at a loss <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a shorted instrument rises prior to repurchase.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of the market share offers some insights into the intermodal competition. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> reduction and competition between operators E 01 and E 02 results in a constant reduction of the market share of the operator Er. Therefore, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> established operator E 01 have to rise due to the specific constant, <b>the</b> equilibrium <b>prices</b> always remain below <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> operator Er (€ 70), attracting more passengers.

25|$|In {{relation}} to American depositary receipts (ADRs), a local custodian bank (also {{known as a}} sub-custodian or agent bank) is a bank in a country outside the United States that holds the corresponding number of shares of stock trading on the home stock market represented by an ADR trading in the USA, with each multiple representing some multiple of the underlying foreign share. This multiple allows the ADRs to possess a price per share conventional for the US market (typically between $20 and $50 per share) even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the foreign share is unconventional when converted to US dollars directly. This bank acts as custodian bank for the company that issues the ADRs in the US stock.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide area}} {{fronting}} St Martin's Church formed the marketplace. The Street Commissioners {{decided that a}} sheltered market hall was needed. They bought the market rights from {{the lord of the}} manor and, by 1832, all properties on site had been purchased, with exception of two, whose owners demanded a higher price. To fund the purchase of these properties, two buildings were constructed either side of the market hall and the leases sold at auction. Construction of the Market Hall, designed by Charles Edge (an architect of Birmingham Town Hall), began in February 1833. It was completed by Dewsbury and Walthews at a cost of £20,000 (£44,800 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> acquiring the land is included) and opened on 12 February 1835 and contained 600 market stalls. The building was grand and the façade consisted of stone mined from Bath, Somerset. Two grand Doric columns supported both wide entrances. At the end of the market day, metal gates were pulled in front of the entrances.|$|E

25|$|The {{holder of}} an American style call option can sell his option holding {{at any time}} until the {{expiration}} date, and would consider doing so when <b>the</b> stock's spot <b>price</b> is above <b>the</b> exercise <b>price,</b> especially <b>if</b> he expects <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> option to drop.

Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, [...] "an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously."

2500|$|Some economists {{believe that}} Standard Oil {{was not a}} monopoly, and also argue that the intense free market {{competition}} resulted in cheaper oil prices and more diverse petroleum products. Critics claimed that success in meeting consumer needs was driving other companies {{out of the market}} who were not as successful. An example of this thinking was given in 1890 when Rep. William Mason, arguing in favor of the Sherman Antitrust Act, said: [...] "trusts have made products cheaper, have reduced prices; but <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent a barrel, it would not right the wrong done to people of this country by the trusts which have destroyed legitimate competition and driven honest men from legitimate business enterprise".|$|E
2500|$|The {{price of}} natural gas varies greatly {{depending}} on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet (about 25 cents per m3) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value {{of natural gas}} is roughly 1,000 British thermal units (BTU) per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU, or around $7 per gigajoule. In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per [...] ($10/MMBTU). The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12–$16 per 1000 cubic feet (about 50 cents per m3). Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Each contract is for 10,000MMBTU (~10,550 gigajoules), or 10 billion BTU.
