5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} disturbing {{and have been}} used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned <b>in</b> <b>media</b> coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included <b>in</b> <b>media</b> portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience.

30|$|Trametes versicolor showed higher laccase and MnP {{activity}} when growing <b>in</b> NS <b>media,</b> but {{showed more}} humic removal <b>in</b> NL <b>media.</b> When comparing the final concentration of HA after recovery in NL and NS media of T. versicolor, the HA concentration is higher <b>in</b> NS <b>media,</b> suggesting higher HA degradation <b>in</b> NL <b>media,</b> {{regardless of the}} higher enzyme activity <b>in</b> NS <b>media.</b> P. chrysosporium did not show any significant laccase activity, although it showed high MnP activity especially after 12  days of incubation <b>in</b> NS <b>media.</b> When comparing Figs.  3 and 4, for P. chrysosporium, {{it seems that the}} humic acid removal correlates with the MnP activity. Also, the SEC results after the recovery of sorped humics show higher recovery of large HA molecules (blue) <b>in</b> NL <b>media</b> than <b>in</b> NS <b>media,</b> suggesting higher degradation of HA <b>in</b> NS <b>media.</b> This correlates with the higher enzyme activity of P. chrysosporium growing <b>in</b> NS <b>media.</b>|$|R
