40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset of trades and limit orders for S&P 500 futures, we {{decompose}} the aggregate risk into a component {{driven by the}} impact of net market orders and a component unrelated to net orders. The first component [...] <b>flow-driven</b> risk [...] is large, accounting for approximately 50 % of market variance, {{and it is not}} transient. This risk represents the joint effect of net trade demand and the price impact of that demand [...] i. e., illiquidity. We find that flows are largely unpredictable, and lagged flows have no price impact. <b>Flow-driven</b> risk is time varying because price impact is highly variable. Illiquidity rises with market volatility, but not with flow uncertainty. Net selling increases illiquidity, which amplifies downside <b>flow-driven</b> risk. The findings are consistent with <b>flow-driven</b> shocks resulting from fluctuations in aggregate risk-bearing capacity. Under this interpretation, investors with constant risk tolerance should trade against such shocks (i. e., "supply liquidity") to achieve substantial utility gains.

My research investigates the concept of <b>flow-driven</b> interactions as a prominent and innovative model for goal-driven activities carried out by users in the pervasive computing setup. <b>Flow-driven</b> interaction model is aimed at overcoming problems such as interaction consistency, losing orientation, context switching and interface adaptation, resulted from user interaction with multiple pervasive applications, devices and objects. 1 Problem Statement and Research Question My research is investigating the impact of the flow concept on human interactions in pervasive computing applications. A flow is a sequence of goal-driven activities carried out to achieve certain motives. Hypothesis: <b>flow-driven</b> interactions are naturally compatible with the adaptive and dynamic nature of pervasive computing applications; as such interactions adapt according to the environment and preserve the interaction consistency across multiple pervasive applications in the physical surroundings.

40|$|A {{mechanism}} of self-heating of solar corona is pointed out. It is {{shown that the}} free energy available {{in the form of}} sheared flows gives rise to unstable electrostatic waves which accelerate the particles and heat them. The electrostatic perturbations take place through two processes (a) by purely growing sheared <b>flow-driven</b> instability and (b) by sheared <b>flow-driven</b> drift waves. These processes occur throughout the corona and hence the self-heating is very important in this plasma. These instabilities can give rise to local electrostatic potentials φ of the order of about 100 volts or less within 3 × 10 ^- 2 to a few seconds time if the initial perturbation is assumed to be about one percent that is eφ/T_e≃ 10 ^- 2. The components of wave lengths in the direction perpendicular to external magnetic field B_ 0 vary from about 10 m to 1 m. The purely growing instability creates electrostatic fields by sheared flows even if the density gradient does not exist whereas the density gradient is crucial for the concurrence of drift wave instability.

40|$|Many {{differential}} {{methods for}} {{the recovery of}} the optic flow field from an image sequence can be expressed in terms of a variational problem where the optic flow minimizes some energy. Typically, these energy functionals consist of two terms: a data term, which reqires e. g. that a brightness constancy assumption holds, and a regularizer that encourages global or piecewise smoothness of the flow field. In this paper we present a systematic classification of rotation invariant convex regularizers by exploring their connection to diffusion filters for multichannel images. This taxonomy provides a unifying framework for data-driven and <b>flow-driven,</b> isotropic and anisotropic, as well as spatial and spatio-temporal regularizers.

When a viscous solution is stretched by an external immiscible fluid, a low 100 ppm polymer concentration strongly affects the breakup process, {{compared to the}} Newtonian case.

Measurements of filament thickness show two main temporal regimes: flow- and capillary-driven. At early times both polymeric and Newtonian fluids are <b>flow-driven,</b> and filament thinning is exponential. At later times, Newtonian filament thinning crosses over to a capillary-driven regime, in which the decay is algebraic.

40|$|Collapsible channel flows that {{originated}} from physiological applications have many intriguing dynamic system behaviours. In this thesis, {{the stability of}} a two-dimensional collapsible channel flow is studied numerically. Three approaches are adopted to investigate the fluid-structure interaction problem: an in-house Finite Element Method (FE) based Fluid-Beam model (FBM), a commercial FE based code, ADINA, and an eigensolver derived from the FBM (linear analysis). Two types of inlet boundary conditions are considered. One is the <b>flow-driven</b> system where the inlet flow rate is specified, {{and the other is}} the pressure-driven where the pressure drop is given. It turns out that these two systems yield very different dynamical features even though the steady solutions are the same. For the <b>flow-driven</b> system, a range of steady solutions are studied with both zero and non-zero initial wall tension by means of both FBM (using initial stress configuration) and ADINA (equipped with both initial strain and initial stress configurations). As expected, the FBM agrees with ADINA when using the initial stress configuration, but not when the initial strain configuration is adopted. This established the importance of the initial configuration. The effects of different wall thicknesses on the steady wall performance have also been shown as significant. Fully-coupled unsteady simulations have also been performed with FBM (Bernoulli-Euler beam) and ADINA (Timoshenko beam) to demonstrate significant influences of modelling assumptions on the dynamical behaviour. In addition to unsteady simulations, linear stability analysis is also carried out to identify the critical parameter values that occur when the system is in the neutrally stable state. Using the faster Fourier transform, the unsteady results are then compared with the linear stability analysis results. Excellent agreements are achieved in terms of frequencies of modes of instabilities. Finally, we focus on the dynamical behaviour of collapsible channel flows in a pressure-driven system, and the differences with those of the <b>flow-driven</b> system (Luo et al. 2008). It is found that the stability structure for the pressure-driven system is no longer cascade as in the <b>flow-driven</b> case. Instead, the mode- 1 instability is the dominating unstable mode in the pressure-driven system. In the pressure drop and wall stiffness space, neutrally stable mode- 2 curve is completely enclosed by the mode- 1 neutral curve, and there is no purely mode- 2 unstable solution in the parameter space investigated. Interesting mode-switch is also observed. By analysing the energy budgets at the neutral stable points, we confirmed that in the high tension region (on the upper branch of the mode- 1 neutral curve), the stability mechanism is {{the same as that of}} Jensen & Heil (2003). Namely, self-excited oscillations can grow by extracting kinetic energy from the mean flow, with exactly two thirds of the net kinetic energy flux dissipated by the dissipations and the remainder balanced by increased dissipation in the mean flow. However, the mechanism doesn’t apply for the lower branch of the mode- 1 neutral curve. In addition, energy balance changes further for the mode- 2 curves in the <b>flow-driven</b> system. It is clear that different mechanisms are operating in different regions of the parameter space, and for different boundary conditions...|$|E
40|$|The term ``dynamo'' means {{different}} things to the laboratory fusion plasma and astrophysical plasma communities. To alleviate the resulting confusion and to facilitate interdisciplinary progress, we pinpoint conceptual differences and similarities between laboratory plasma dynamos and astrophysical dynamos. We can divide dynamos into three types: 1. magnetically dominated helical dynamos which sustain a large scale magnetic field against resistive decay and drive the magnetic geometry toward the lowest energy state, 2. <b>flow-driven</b> helical dynamos which amplify or sustain large scale magnetic fields in an otherwise turbulent flow, and 3. <b>flow-driven</b> nonhelical dynamos which amplify fields on scales at or below the driving turbulence. We discuss how all three types occur in astrophysics whereas plasma confinement device dynamos are of the first type. Type 3 dynamos requires no magnetic or kinetic helicity of any kind. Focusing on type 1 and 2 dynamos, we show how different limits of a unified set of equations for magnetic helicity evolution reveal both types. We explicitly describe a steady-state example of a type 1 dynamo, and three examples of type 2 dynamos: (i) closed volume and time dependent; (ii) steady-state with open boundaries; (iii) time dependent with open boundaries.

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} in {{this paper}} LocFaults, a new <b>flow-driven</b> and constraint-based approach for error localization. The input is a faulty program for which a counter-example and a postcondition are provided. To identify helpful informa-tion for error location, we generate a constraint system for the paths of the control flow graph for which at most k con-ditional statements may be erroneous. Then, we calculate Minimal Correction Sets (MCS) of bounded size {{for each of these}} paths. The removal of one of these sets of constraints yields a maximal satisfiable subset, in other words, a max-imal subset of constraints satisfying the post condition. To compute the MCS, we extend the algorithm proposed by Liffiton and Sakallah [21] in order to handle programs with numerical statements more efficiently. The main advantage of this <b>flow-driven</b> approach is that the computed sets of suspicious instructions are small, each of them being asso-ciated with an identified path. Moreover, the constraint-programming based framework of LocFaults allows mix-ing Boolean and numerical constraints in an efficient and straightforward way.

Its reliable computation constitutes {{one of the}} main challenges in computer vision, and variational methods belong to the most successful techniques for achieving this goal. Variational methods recover the optic flow field as a minimiser of a suitable energy functional that involves data and smoothness terms. In this paper we present a survey on different model assumptions for each of these terms and illustrate their impact by experiments. We restrict ourselves to rotationally invariant convex functionals with a linearised data term. Such models are appropriate for small displacements. Regarding the data term, constancy assumptions on the brightness, the gradient, the Hessian, the gradient magnitude, the Laplacian, and the Hessian determinant are investigated. Local integration and nonquadratic penalisation are considered in order to improve robustness under noise. With respect to the smoothness term, we review a recent taxonomy that links regularisers to diffusion processes. It allows to distinguish five types of regularisation strategies: homogeneous, isotropic image-driven, anisotropic image-driven, isotropic <b>flow-driven,</b> and anisotropic <b>flow-driven.</b> All these regularisations can be performed either in the spatial or the spatiotemporal domain.

Helical <b>flow-driven</b> dynamos which amplify or sustain large scale magnetic fields in an otherwise turbulent flow.

All three types occur in astrophysics whereas laboratory plasma dynamos in fusion devices are of type 3. Type 1 dynamos requires no helicity of any kind.

The use of nanoparticles in pseudostationary phase capillary electrochromatography and open-tubular capillary electrochromatography are thoroughly discussed. The stationary and pseudostationary phases that are described include polymer nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
