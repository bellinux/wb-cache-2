A fire started in a nearby barn, <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> with smoke and hindering the German's advance. Eventually the anti-tank platoon was forced to withdraw to Aabenraa.

The Germans lost two armoured cars and three motorcycles, while the Danes suffered one dead and one wounded.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond BIR 7, {{the front}} was defended by BIR 14, which {{received}} no artillery support despite firing SOS flares and was broken through.
