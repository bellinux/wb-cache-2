5|$|Roswell {{also did}} theater. In 1986 she {{appeared}} in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb's Theatre, in which the actors were given characters and situations by the audience members. In 1988 she {{had a role in}} Julia Sweeney's play Mea's Big Apology at Groundling Theatre in Los Angeles. She played Eunice, a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character. The company people do <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to dismiss her because {{they do not want to}} pay her retirement benefits, which are about to take effect. Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play, also at Groundling Theatre.|$|E
25|$|Amongst the {{individual}} villages, religious beliefs also vary greatly. Although {{there are the}} thirty-seven main nats that are commonly and communally worshiped, there are also many local nats, differing in every village. To add on to this, the idea that after death one may become a nat also implies {{that there are many}} nats that can be worshiped. For some villages nats are in nearly <b>everything.</b> <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be any ancestors, in nature, found guarding objects etc. For others nats are less prominent, but still play some role in the village society.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Dumbledore is demoted from Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, voted {{out of the}} Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost {{stripped}} of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort, although it is reported that he is unconcerned {{as long as he}} is not taken off the Chocolate Frog cards. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic does <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to discredit him and Harry – mainly through the Daily Prophet. At the beginning of the book, Dumbledore enrages Fudge when he stops by at Harry's hearing with a witness (Arabella Figg) to ensure that he is not expelled. While Harry feels better when Dumbledore assists him, he becomes annoyed {{to the point of being}} angry that the headmaster refuses to speak to or even look at him.|$|E

25|$|The {{remainder}} of Book One describes which Armenians decide on resistance and which on {{cooperating with the}} deportation order. Bagradian camps out {{with his family and}} friends on Musa Dagh, to ensure that it is the right place to make a stand. Those who decide to resist, dig up a cache of rifles left over from the revolution of 1908, when they were allies of the Young Turks and subsequently bury their church bells, so that these do not fall into Turkish hands. Eventually the Ottoman military police, the dreaded saptiehs, arrive led by the red-haired müdir. They instruct the Armenians to prepare for deportations—- and then leave after beating Ter Haigasun and Bagradian. Instead of complying, the 6,000 Armenians march with <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> carry, their animals and their weapons to a plateau on Musa Dagh. Bagradian hangs behind and observes the wailing women and the other graveyard folk—- who represent the old ways and sympathetic magic of pagan Armenia—- sacrifice a goat. Its meaning is propitious as well as cautionary. The chapter ends with Bagradian helping Krikor carry the last volumes of his magnificent if eclectic library to the Damlayik, the plateau the Armenians have chosen as their refuge.|$|E

[...] Metacritic gave it a score of 51 (out of 100) from 28 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that moviegoers gave the film an average grade of A– on an A+-to-F scale, compared to The Expendables B+.|$|E
500|$|That same day, Bloomsbury {{cancelled}} all Asda's {{orders of}} Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills {{from the company}} totalling £38,000 ($70,000) for unauthorised returns of the sixth Harry Potter book. [...] "The two matters are completely unrelated", said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, [...] "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody." [...] The dispute had been [...] "going on a while – going on for weeks actually." [...] Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ($224,000) ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them") and that, as one company spokesman claimed, [...] "It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to stop kids getting hold of Harry Potter at a price they can afford." ...|$|E

The problem here is a plant that is doing <b>everything</b> wrong <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do wrong". In 2006 the Orthodox Union, Temple Grandin and Agriprocessors had reportedly resolved their problems. In 2008, though, Grandin reported that Agriprocessors had again become [...] "sloppy" [...] in their slaughter operation and was [...] "in the bottom 10%" [...] of slaughterhouses.|$|R

500|$|Bart plays a prank when {{he lowers}} a radio down a well and speaks through {{it with the}} microphone, tricking the townspeople into {{thinking}} an orphan named Timmy O'Toole has fallen down the well. Although {{they are unable to}} get [...] "Timmy" [...] out, as the well is too small for any adult to fit in, the entire town offers moral support and do <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to give him hope. Krusty even gets musician Sting to join other celebrities in recording a charity single, [...] "We're Sending Our Love Down the Well". However, Lisa catches Bart in the act and reminds him he put a label with his name on the radio. Bart falls into the well while trying to retrieve it after Eddie and Lou untie his rope. When the townspeople find him, he admits that Timmy O'Toole does not exist. Angry at being tricked, the townspeople leave Bart in the well.|$|E
2500|$|George Stevens, Jr. {{notes that}} while many {{directors}} rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films {{while they were}} being shot: [...] "I don't even know the editor of my films most of the time," [...] Huston said. Actor Michael Caine also observed the same technique: [...] "Most directors don't {{know what they want}} so they shoot <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> think of— they use the camera like a machine gun. John uses it like a sniper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ground {{itself is}} on land owned by Swindon Borough Council {{to which the}} club pays rent. Swindon {{have in the past}} {{considered}} a move to a club owned stadium to generate more revenue, but have not had the financial backing to do so.

40|$|Parents, faculty, {{and staff}} have preached the {{importance}} of the student 2 ̆ 7 s first year in college. Critical as this time is, many students view their freshman year as a time to experience <b>everything</b> that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get involved in that is associated with college life. Unfortunately, some of these experiences are not as productive and can lead to a difficult first year which they will constantly battle the rest of their college days...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} people in the world that have never been the victim, but yet are far from being {{carefree}} and are highly concerned with doing <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> possibly <b>can</b> to avoid a tragic instance, such as rape. A particular quote by Jessica Valenti in her book Full Frontal Feminism stated, [...] "When I was in college, a teacher once said all women live by a 'rape schedule.'" [...] This goes to show that men see women as easier targets and thus they fall victim more easily to rape and live in constant fear.|$|R

[...] Neoconservative media pundit Bill Kristol called the report [...] "an evasion" [...] and [...] "not a serious document". Rush Limbaugh asserted that the members of the [...] "Iraq Surrender Group" [...] are [...] "doing <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to unite the American people" [...] in [...] "defeat" [...] and [...] "surrender"; and Glenn Beck called the report [...] "Operation White Flag." ...|$|E

5000|$|About Arab bedouins, he wrote: The Arab bedouins {{dominate}} {{only of the}} plains, {{because they}} are, by their savage nature, people of pillage and corruption. <b>They</b> pillage <b>everything</b> that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> take without fighting or taking risks, then flee to their refuge in the wilderness, and do not stand and do battle unless in self-defense. So when they encounter any difficulty or obstacle, they leave it alone and look for easier prey.

60|$|The young labourers over a {{great part}} of the south and east, at least of England--though never so well off, for several generations, as they are now--are growing up thriftless, shiftless; inferior, it seems to me, to their grandfathers in <b>everything,</b> save that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> usually read and write, and their grandfathers could not; and that they wear smart cheap cloth clothes, instead of their grandfathers' smock-frocks.|$|R
