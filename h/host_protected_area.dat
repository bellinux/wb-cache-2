Quantitative results show {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of municipal and national PA designations following Portugal’s EFT introduction. The analysis furthermore places emphasis on the importance of relevant municipal conservation competencies and the role of local decision makers’ motivations for PA designations.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} certain {{manufacturer}} hidden areas {{of a hard}} disk, specifically <b>Host</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Areas</b> (HPA) and Device Configuration Overlays (DCO). These areas can be problematic for computer forensic investigators, {{since many of the}} common industry tools cannot detect the presence of the HPA and DCO. A review of the ATA specifications and recent white papers indicate that these areas can be accessed, modified, and written to by end users using specific open source and freely available tools, allowing data to be stored and/or hidden in these areas. This greatly increases the risk that image acquisitions may not be a true copy of the physical drive in question. This also could result in the obfuscation of data, leading to incomplete or erroneous investigative conclusions. The paper provides an introduction to these commonly used manufacturer areas and discusses their implication to the computer forensics investigative process. Suggestions for future study and testing are also provided...|$|R

40|$|The African {{continent}} {{is hosting}} {{some of the}} richest ecosystems on the planet. Because of the particularly large number of species they are <b>hosting,</b> forests <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> (FPAs) play {{an essential role in}} conservation programs {{as well as in the}} sustainable use of these natural resources. The contribution of FPAs as a means to reduce climate change impact further highlights the fundamental role played by these ecosystems and so the need to monitor changes to these habitats. Fragmentation is one of the various pressures on FPAs. It refers to spatial pattern processes with ecosystem loss and isolation (reduced connectivity) which leads to biodiversity loss. In this work, the isolation of the main African FPAs and the pattern characterization of habitats in and around the FPAs are at focus in view to assess threats and identify the areas that are most vulnerable (Hartley et al, 2007).

50|$|Device {{configuration}} overlay (DCO) is {{a hidden}} area {{on many of}} today’s hard disk drives (HDDs). Usually when information is stored in either the DCO or <b>host</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> (HPA), it is not accessible by the BIOS, OS, or the user. However, certain tools {{can be used to}} modify the HPA or DCO. The system uses the IDENTIFY_DEVICE command to determine the supported features of a given hard drive, but the DCO can report to this command that supported features are nonexistent or that the drive is smaller than it actually is. To determine the actual size and features of a disk, the DEVICE_CONFIGURATION_IDENTIFY command is used, and the output of this command can be compared to the output of IDENTIFY_DEVICE to see if a DCO is present on a given hard drive. Most major tools will remove the DCO in order to fully image a hard drive, using the DEVICE_CONFIGURATION_RESET command. This permanently alters the disk, unlike with the <b>host</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> (HPA), which can be temporarily removed for a power cycle.|$|E
50|$|This {{register}} however can {{be changed}} using the SET MAX ADDRESS ATA command. If the value in the register is set to less than the actual hard drive size then effectively a <b>host</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> is created. It is protected because the OS will work with only the value in the register that is returned by the IDENTIFY DEVICE command and thus will normally be unable to address {{the parts of the}} drive that lie within the HPA.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} many {{overwriting}} programs, only those capable of complete data erasure offer full security by destroying the data on all areas of a hard drive. Disk overwriting programs that cannot access the entire hard drive, including hidden/locked areas like the <b>host</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> (HPA), device configuration overlay (DCO), and remapped sectors, perform an incomplete erasure, leaving some of the data intact. By accessing the entire hard drive, data erasure eliminates the risk of data remanence.|$|E
50|$|The WDPA {{uses the}} IUCN's {{definition}} of a <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> as the main criteria for entries {{to be included in}} the database.The database contains comprehensive information on the different types of <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> ranging from those strictly protected for conservation purposes to those where sustainable use of natural resources is allowed; and includes government, co-managed, private and community managed areas. The IUCN's World Commission on <b>Protected</b> <b>Areas</b> gives international guidance on the categorisation of <b>protected</b> <b>areas,</b> through its <b>Protected</b> <b>Area</b> Management Categories. These categories are recognised worldwide and facilitate a global system for defining and recording <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> Within the WPDA the IUCN Management Category of a <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> is listed (if one has been assigned/reported) as part of the information on a <b>protected</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R

40|$|For <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> {{that are}} {{extensively}} forested, {{the rate of}} deforestation is one indicator of {{the integrity of the}} <b>protected</b> <b>area,</b> and the effectiveness of <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> management. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the deforestation rate in <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in Central Africa. Using remote sensing techniques, I measured levels of deforestation in 87 <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in five countries in Central Africa from 1990 - 2000. To examine possible causes of deforestation I also measured the level of access in these <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> A lack of access to remote areas can limit deforestation, forest degradation, and the resulting loss of biodiversity while decreasing development in rural areas. Access was defined either as natural (rivers) or constructed (e. g. roads or transmission lines). The annual net deforestation rate for <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in Central Africa, among the <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> studied, was 0. 05 %. This is lower than the annual rate of forest loss found by other studies for the entire Congo Basin forest. Based on the rates of deforestation in the entire Congo Basin and the assumption that <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> are trying to avoid deforestation, this suggests that Central African <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> may be effective safeguards against deforestation. Five of the 87 <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> exhibited zero deforestation, while one forest reserve, Kaga Bandoro in the Central African Republic, showed a five percent net increase in forest cover since 1990. Cameroon's <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> had significantly higher levels of deforestation than those in the other countries in Central Africa. Within <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in each country studied there was a similar level of reforestation of 5 %. Deforestation in a 10 km <b>area</b> around <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> was not significantly higher than that found within the <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>areas</b> that border other <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> had significantly lower levels of deforestation than <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> that were isolated from each other. The increased disturbance caused by increasing access to the forest seems to be of an ephemeral nature, initially resulting in forest loss, but leading to reforestation. There was no difference in deforestation rates when a road or river bordered a <b>protected</b> <b>area,</b> or crossed through a <b>protected</b> <b>area.</b> Only the density of roads or rivers had an effect on the deforestation rates. The secondary impacts of human use on both the forest structure and the wildlife inhabiting the forest are likely to be detrimental, and worthy of further study...|$|R

40|$|Nearly {{two hundred}} transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> {{comprise}} {{a portion of}} the global conservation landscape the size of India, with further expansion anticipated. Proponents claim that transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> outperform isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in achieving conservation objectives, while regional case studies have led critics to challenge this claim. Empirical investigation into the relative performance of transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> is fundamentally limited since these areas cannot be directly compared to the isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> that might otherwise have emerged in the same location. This paper develops a game theory model of park formation to compare counterfactual transboundary and isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> The model suggests that under certain conditions, transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> can achieve greater conservation and production objectives, {{even in the absence of}} international cooperative park management.

40|$|Historically, <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> {{were often}} {{designated}} using criteria other than biodiversity conservation {{as the primary}} objective. With {{the emergence of the}} science of systematic conservation planning, the designation of new <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> is increasingly made with explicit conservation objectives in mind. However, assessments of the performance of <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> systems typically include all <b>protected</b> <b>areas,</b> regardless of when they were designated, potentially obscuring recent improvements in conservation planning decisions. Thus, it is often unclear to what extent systematic conservation planning principles have influenced the placement of new <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> Here, we compare recently designated <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in Australia with the <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> system that existed prior to the introduction of systematic conservation planning guidelines in 2000. We ask whether {{there is a difference between}} past and recent protection in terms of (i) the size and spatial distribution of <b>protected</b> <b>areas,</b> (ii) the characteristics of broad regions in which protection is concentrated, and (iii) the extent to which <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> represent ecosystems and threatened species in comparison with selecting <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> at random. We find that the <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> system was historically biased toward areas with steep slopes and low human populations. In contrast, recent protection is more likely to be allocated to regions with high human population and high numbers of threatened species; we show that this effect is not simply a result of biases in the places now available for conservation. Despite this successful realignment of practice, we find that the increase in <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> coverage in poorly protected regions has occurred more slowly than expected if <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> selections were fully guided by systematic conservation planning principles.
