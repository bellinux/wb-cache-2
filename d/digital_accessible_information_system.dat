50|$|DAISY {{stands for}} <b>Digital</b> <b>Accessible</b> <b>Information</b> <b>SYstem.</b> It is a format {{based on the}} W3C defined SGML {{applications}} XHTML 1.0 and SMIL 1.0. Using this framework, a talking book format is presented that enables navigation within a sequential and hierarchical structure consisting of (marked-up) text synchronized with audio.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Digital</b> <b>Accessible</b> <b>Information</b> <b>SYstem</b> (DAISY) is an XML-based open {{standard}} {{maintained by}} the DAISY Consortium for people with print disabilities. DAISY has wide international support with features for multimedia, navigation and synchronization. A subset of the DAISY format has been adopted by law in the United States as the National Instructional Material Accessibility Standard (NIMAS), and K-12 textbooks and instructional materials are now required to be provided to students with disabilities.|$|E

In knowledge era, data can be easy and cheap, information may be available real time, knowledge discovery from different sources of information for decision and accurate prediction can be rather complex and costly without a statistical <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> This paper introduces the knowledge discovey process and the statistical learning paradigm yielding to buil up a conceptual model for a <b>Digital</b> <b>Accessible</b> Statistical <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> for Monitoring of Tourism (DASISMT). Statistical methods for {{monitoring of}} tourism are described to answer specific questions: to provide a summary view of the tendency of tourism demand and supply using official data; to support revenue management in benchmarking and yield analysis using private data from hotel informative systems as well as sharing data systems; to analyse the incoming and tourist satisfaction by identifying the consensus ranking on the prioritary actions to improve the tourist supply using data from direct surveys; to identify the market segmentation and the brand value or sentiment using web data. Nowadays, this represents a necessity condition for all players, {{inside and outside the}} production chain, to be adequate to the international competitiveness and for increasing the “value of a territory” as an integrated touristic destination system...|$|R

5000|$|DAISY (<b>Digital</b> <b>Accessible</b> <b>Information</b> <b>SYstem)</b> is a {{technical}} standard for digital audiobooks, periodicals and computerized text. DAISY {{is designed to}} be a complete audio substitute for print material and is specifically designed for use by people with [...] "print disabilities", including blindness, impaired vision, and dyslexia. Based on the MP3 and XML formats, the DAISY format has advanced features in addition to those of a traditional audio book. Users can search, place bookmarks, precisely navigate line by line, and regulate the speaking speed without distortion. DAISY also provides aurally accessible tables, references and additional information. As a result, DAISY allows visually impaired listeners to navigate something as complex as an encyclopedia or textbook, otherwise impossible using conventional audio recordings.|$|E
50|$|Brewster Kahle {{founded the}} Archive in 1996 at {{around the same}} time that he began the for-profit web {{crawling}} company Alexa Internet. In October 1996, the Internet Archive had begun to archive and preserve the World Wide Web in large quantities, though it saved the first pages in May 1996. The archived content wasn't available to the general public until 2001, when it developed the Wayback Machine. In late 1999, the Archive expanded its collections beyond the Web archive, beginning with the Prelinger Archives. Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software. It hosts a number of other projects: the NASA Images Archive, the contract crawling service Archive-It, and the wiki-editable library catalog and book information site Open Library. Soon after that, the Archive began working to provide specialized services relating to the information access needs of the print-disabled; publicly accessible books were made available in a protected <b>Digital</b> <b>Accessible</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (DAISY) format.|$|E

The most common are confusion {{on the part}} of users as to what file type they need and what the file type means, as well as how to download it properly to their devices. The sheer number of vendor interfaces also cause technical difficulties due to format variety and instructions for use. In fact, in October 2012, Library Journal Patron Profiles reported that 23 % of library patrons were unsuccessful in borrowing ebooks due to technical difficulties. Library users, faced with a variety of ebook formats on a regular basis, are probably unaware of the format they are using. The EPUB 3 standard was written with accessibility at its forefront. By incorporating the DAISY (<b>Digital</b> <b>Accessible</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System)</b> format into EPUB 3, support for full ebook accessibility is now mainstream.

40|$|The Documents in the {{financial}} services, insurance, utilities, and government sectors typically require a high volume of PDF documents to be generated which are stored for presentment or archived for legal purposes. As high volume transactional output (HVTO) demands put increasing pressure on online presentment capabilities, accessibility has become a growing concern. In particular, access to these files proposes significant challenges when these documents are presented to visually impaired people using assistive technologies (i. e. screen readers). Since it is rare that all recipients are prepared to accept electronic delivery of their documents, {{a large portion of}} the documents is still printed as PDFs. In an online billing system, bills are sent to customers’ email accounts as attached PDF files or HTML links. These bills in the most cases are neither accessible through assistive technologies nor useable by vision-impaired customers.

As a consequence, computer technicians install W 3 -servers ad hoc. This may be acceptable for academic research prototypes. However, implementing a useful W 3 -server is a project by itself and requires traditional project management and software engineering methods. For the initial installation and maintenance of the data, new methods have to be found. Designing publicly <b>accessible</b> and distributed <b>information</b> structures and coordinating distributed authors is a major challenge for most organizations. This paper presents a scaleable reference architecture for multi-author World-Wide Web (W 3) servers, one important type of a distributed and publicly <b>accessible</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> We introduce the paradigm of "lean production of information" and discuss some problems of data quality regarding W 3 -servers.

To equitably serve users with disabilities, stronger technology and a mindset toward accessibility must become the standard in electronic collections. Librarians {{are expected to have}} a strong working knowledge of the library’s collections but receive little training in best practices for assisting patrons with disabilities. We cannot wait for the e-book landscape to change on its own. Instead, we must recognize how to develop usable collections for all and how to respond to those whose access has been limited. This research is the product of both current research and earlier findings of the user experience research team from the Mellon-funded Charlotte Initiative project. This paper focuses on the accessible e-book landscape and provides librarians with tools to better assist users working independently in discovery systems as they interact with the library’s current acquisitions.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{empirical}} studies regarding the use of digital talking books (<b>Digital</b> <b>Accessible</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (DAISY) books) as well as the possibilities and limitations that users with print disabilities encounter when using these books. Upon fulfilment of this purpose, it is also possible to identify research needs in the area of talking books. Design/methodology/approach An analysis of 12 empirical studies concerning the use of DAISY books is conducted. The concept of affordances is employed in the analysis, which focuses on: users of talking books, talking books as objects, and the social settings in which talking books are used. Findings First, the reviewed literature indicates that the navigational features of the DAISY talking book appear to provide unprecedented affordances in terms of the users’ approaches to reading. However, the affordances of talking books depend, to some extent, on whether the users have visual impairments or dyslexia/reading and writing difficulties. Second, the reviewed literature illustrates that the affordances provided by talking books depend on the settings in which they are used, both in terms of specific social situations and wider socio-political contexts. Originality/value Although the need for assistive reading technologies, such as digital talking books, is large, research in this area is scarce, particularly from a user perspective. This paper describes the results of those studies which have actually been conducted on this topic and highlights areas that require further study. This paper is part of the research project “Learning to read talking books: The documentary practices of children with print disabilities”, funded by the Curtin Senior Research Fellowship, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia.

The continuous growth and the heterogeneity of these devices induce diverse user experiences depending on the device and challenge designers to creating methods and tools for engineering usable, yet <b>accessible,</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Instead of repeating a similar development life cycle, design patterns concentrate design solutions with embedded usability and accessibility. Once a pattern is selected, the developer is responsible for adequately program the pattern code, which is a tedious and error-prone task.

This implies that the rate of alignment of reference frames, measured by the (linearized) <b>accessible</b> <b>information</b> per <b>system,</b> is equal to the regularized, linearized G-asymmetry. The latter quantity is equal to the number variance in the case where G=U(1).

Data collected by remote sensing has been identified as a partial solution to this problem, and is becoming a feasible option, since increasing quantities of satellite data in particular are becoming available to conservationists. When suitably classified, satellite imagery can be used to delineate land cover types such as forest, and to identify any changes over time. However, the conservation community lacks (a) a simple tool appropriate to the needs for monitoring change in all types of land cover (e. g. not just forest), and (b) an easily <b>accessible</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> which allows for simple land cover change analysis and data sharing to reduce duplication of effort. To meet these needs, we developed a web-based <b>information</b> <b>system</b> which allows users to assess land cover dynamics in and around protected areas (or other sites of conservation importance) from multi-temporal medium resolution satellite imagery. The system is based around an open access toolbox that pre-processes and classifies Landsat-type imagery, and then allows users to interactively verify the classification. These data are then open for others to utilize through the online <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> We first explain imagery processing and data accessibility features, and then demonstrate the toolbox and the value of user verification using a case study on Nakuru National Park, Kenya.
