5000|$|A brayer is a {{hand-tool}} used historically in {{printing and}} printmaking {{to break up}} and [...] "rub out" [...] (spread) ink before it was [...] "beaten" [...] using inking balls or composition rollers. The word {{is derived from the}} verb to [...] "bray", meaning [...] "to break, pound, or grind small, as in a mortar". A brayer consists of a short wooden cylinder with a handle fitted to one end; the other, flat end is used to rub the ink. In the late nineteenth century the term was mis-applied in the United States to a small hand-roller, [...] "used for spreading ink on the <b>inking</b> <b>table,</b> and for applying it to the distributing plates or rollers connected with presses". Such small rollers were sold as [...] "brayers" [...] from at least 1912 and later in the century the term was applied in the U.S.A. to hand-rollers of all sorts and sizes. It retains its original meaning in Europe.|$|R

After a little {{she was able to}} remove her upper clothing. This done she took the manuscript inscribed, [...] "My Confession," [...] out of the secret pocket of her stays--turned to the last leaf as before--and wrote another entry, under the entry made on the previous night.|$|R

In all my {{experience}} along the dirtiest ways of this dirty little world, I have never met with {{such a thing as a}} trifle yet.

5000|$|The {{fourteen}} books {{present a}} Complete Practice Course for Practical Agriculture for Italy. The books feature a simple structure, consisting of an introduction and twelve distinct sections which represent {{the months of}} the year. The introduction is the fulcrum because it {{emphasizes the importance of}} [...] "chestnut" [...] flour. This flour has allowed many people to survive. The central part of the work presents two important themes: products that can be obtained through tree wood and chestnuts and the explanation of what the farmer must do to allow to chestnut forest to grow. The following products are: <b>ink</b> flour, <b>tables,</b> baskets, coal and fodder. With this final function, people were allowed to have a more varied diet that included meat products. The most important processing procedures are done in April through [...] "grafting". During May and June, the grafts and pruning must be reviewed. From July to August, the water flow channels must be investigated. In the autumn months from September to October, farmers are assigned to collect chestnuts.|$|R

We have implemented a mechanism to capture the process of producing Japanese calligraphy using MERLâ€™s DiamondTouch (DT) table. We add a very thin metal wire {{along the length of the}} brush to carry an electric signal from the writer's body through the brush tuft and <b>ink</b> to the <b>table.</b> As the brush tuft is touches a sheet of paper placed on the surface of the DT <b>table,</b> the <b>ink</b> in the tuft carries the signal from the users to DT. We capture the movement of the brush tuft to produce the visual and auditory representations of the writing process and for later replay. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if there is a proper press sequence for a specific set of process inks on a specified type of paper. In the past, the literature on this subject has been of a qualitative and generalized nature. This study attempts to put the matter on a quantative basis under strict controls. A standard set of process proofing inks for web offset are chosen to be printed onto a coated type of offset paper by an IGT Printability Tester. Various techniques are devised for printing solid strips of the inks with minimum density variation across each strip and from strip to strip. The density range of each ink is found by employing various techniques devised by the manufacturer of the IGT, and by using mathematical formulas. The density of each ink is plotted against its ink quantity, as read by each of three filters on a densitometer: Green, Yellow and Blue. The GATF formulas for determining the color characteristics of process inks are then employed. The results are <b>tables</b> for each <b>ink</b> showing the theoretical density of each filter reading at specified ink quantities, with the GATF Hue Error, Grayness and Efficiency factors included for those <b>ink</b> quantities. These <b>tables</b> allow for the predicted result of any overprints at specified ink quantities by adding the density of each filter reading at the desired ink quantity of each ink. In order to be as accurate as possible, a special technique is devised to read both single and overprint densities of ink films printed on the IGT. Overprints are made using an IGT Printability Tester, and a densitometer to compare actual to predicted values. Under controlled trapping, all conditions are kept constant, but the sequence is reversed. The sequence that comes the closest to the predicted values is the preferred sequence. This is found to be: Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. Although a preferred color sequence does exist for the set of inks used in this study, it is pointed out that a change in this sequence may help the overall result in certain cases...|$|R
