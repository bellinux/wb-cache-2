40|$|Over {{the past}} few years {{revolving}} <b>green</b> <b>loan</b> funds have been implemented at about fifty schools all across the country to help fund sustainability projects on their campus. These green revolving funds are used to invest in sustainability projects that lower operating expenses, for example, energy bills. The savings that these projects produce then get sent back to the fund and are reinvested in additional projects. These loan funds have been incredibly helpful in furthering the sustainability goals of colleges, while also helping to save the universities money. My research included looking into how other universities are implementing these revolving loan funds, with a focus on universities in our peer group, to determine how Southern Illinois University can best implement one of these funds on our campus. I also spoke to stakeholders on campus to find out their ideas or opinions on the fund. Finally, I looked at examples of projects other universities have funded to gain insight on the best kinds of projects to fund in the future at SIU, once the loan fund is implemented. The goal of my research is to educate others on campus <b>green</b> <b>loan</b> funds and sustainability projects and {{to do everything possible to}} get a loan fund implemented on our campus...|$|E
40|$|These are {{challenging}} times for new entrepreneurial firms. The {{development of the}} Global Financial Crisis shook the very foundations of global markets and institutions that most firms relied on to do business (Claessens, et al., forthcoming). In the midst of institutional flux and resource constraints, entrepreneurial firms, which {{have been shown to}} make a range of contributions to the economy (van Praag & Versloot 2007) faced increasing constraints. The Australian Federal Government quickly implemented the <b>Green</b> <b>Loan</b> program in response to the financial crisis. Unfortunately, the green loans program was flawed with obsolete processes and information (Faulkner, 2011), further constraining new firms. Prior research provides few clues regarding how resource-constrained entrepreneurial firms deal with these institutional flaws within institutional change and how they might overcome these challenges and prosper. One promising theory that evaluates behavioural responses to constraints and institutional flaws is bricolage (Levi Strauss, 1967). Bricolage aligns with notions of resourcefulness: defined here as “making do by applying combinations of the resources at hand to new problems and opportunities” (Baker and Nelson 2005 : 333). Using three case studies, we consider how institutional flaws impact firm behaviours and illustrate the use of bricolage in attempts to reinforce, shape and change the GL program further extending bricolage domains of Baker and Nelson (2005) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of green credit in maintaining economic sustainability, we develop theoretical hypotheses including expectation, supervision and capital allocation channels to explain the impacts of green credit. Then, we use hybrid econometric models by using Chinese-listed enterprises in the energy-saving and environmental sectors from 2007 to 2015 as the research sample to verify the above hypotheses. The empirical results show that: (1) the average value of financial performance and operational efficiency is relatively low, and the endogenous abilities of those enterprises {{have not yet been}} established; (2) the issuance of <b>green</b> <b>loans</b> does not improve public expectations of enterprises in the green industry, thus the expectation channel is not supported; (3) the issuance of <b>green</b> <b>loans</b> does not necessarily improve the enterprise’s operational efficiency and financial performance, thus the supervision channel hypotheses are not supported; and (4) <b>green</b> <b>loans</b> lead to an increase in financing costs, management costs, operation costs, and expenditure on R&D, thus, the capital allocation hypothesis is partly supported. Based on the empirical analysis, we also provide some countermeasures to strengthen the roles of green credit to support the development of energy-saving and environmental enterprises...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a major {{contemporary}} issue. In response, financial institutions offer green financing to fund low-carbon investments to those organizations who want to help mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, a lack of green credit remains the case. Therefore, {{to learn how to}} close this financing gap, this empirical study explores China’s green finance through the lens of the Chinese banks who are the providers of such <b>loans.</b> <b>Green</b> finance has been growing rapidly in China since the Chinese government issued the Green Credit Policy. Previous studies have posited that banks have incentives in the form of credit risk management, new business opportunities, corporate reputation, and compliance risk to offer <b>green</b> <b>loans.</b> The objective of this thesis is to ascertain whether <b>green</b> <b>loans</b> provide better risk management and more business opportunities in practice. As a part of the research, this thesis explores China’s banking system and the development of, and current research into, China’s Green Credit Policy. This study identifies a distinct characteristic of the Chinese banking system (i. e., heavy government involvement) and posits how the government may influence the development of green finance in China. A dataset with a panel design was collected to perform the quantitative tests. The dataset contains financial and green finance data from 24 banks in China between 2009 and 2015. Panel regression techniques, such as Two-stage Least Square Regression Analysis (2 sls) and Random-effect Panel Regression (RE), were used to examine whether the banks’ green finance practices lead to better financial performance. The results reveal that <b>green</b> <b>loans</b> grow at a faster rate than do other types of loans, and that allocating more <b>green</b> <b>loans</b> to the total loan portfolio reduces a bank’s NPL ratio. The findings imply that green financing is a less risky investment with increasing demand. Through empirical evidence, this thesis contributes to the existing green finance literature and fills the literature gap on the Green Credit Policy in China through its study of the policy’s implementation from the banks’ perspective...|$|R

50|$|Recorded as Loans, Lones, or Lons, {{the name}} of the village may have no {{connection}} with lending and be derived from the <b>green</b> <b>loans</b> or loaning (a piece of soft, rough ground) around the Bushie and Craiksland Burns, which joined each other at the foot the old orchard at Crossburn. A 'loan' can simply refer to a 'lane' and as such is a common placename element, which would be particularly appropriate to Loans, which is at a crossroads. Before the encloser of fields, a loan or strip of grass was left that ran through the arable part of a farm or farms, linking it with the common grazing ground of a clachan, serving both as a pasture and a driving road.
