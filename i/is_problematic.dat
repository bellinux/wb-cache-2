5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt <b>is</b> <b>problematic.</b> Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn's mature symphonies are {{numbered}} approximately {{in the order}} that they were published, rather than {{the order in which}} they were composed. The order of actual composition is: 1, 5, 4, 2, 3. The placement of No. 3 in this sequence <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> because he worked on it for over a decade, starting sketches for it soon after beginning work on No. 5, but completing it after both Nos. 5 and 4.|$|E
5|$|Robert's {{theology}} {{is expressed in}} his three surviving works, the Quaestiones de divina pagina, Quaestiones de epistolis Pauli, and the unfinished Sententiae. The dating of the works <b>is</b> <b>problematic,</b> {{but it appears that}} the first two works were composed between 1145 and 1157. The Sententiae was revised twice, probably during the 1150s and the 1160s. His works, especially the Sententiae, cover the entire subject of theology and are strictly orthodox in Christian doctrine.|$|E

5|$|The Madagascar women's {{national}} football team is the FIFA recognised senior women's A team for Madagascar. The team played their first FIFA matches in 2015. The {{development of a}} national team in the country <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> because of issues found on the continent and on the island, specifically the lack of popularity of women's football as a participation sport in Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> because passing freight trains often {{result in}} delays both on Route 126, {{as well as}} Route 135 which crosses it {{just south of the}} tracks. The frequent blockage of the crossing by passing trains reduces capacity in the intersection by 21% during the morning rush and 16% in the afternoon, resulting in delays and traffic jams in the downtown area. Increased service levels planned by the MBTA would result in morning capacity reduction of 34% and afternoon reduction of 28%.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of her visions <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> {{since the}} main source of {{information}} on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{existence}} of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains to be explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E

5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources <b>is</b> <b>problematic,</b> but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Past {{surveys are}} suspect, as Grimm (1981) and Hubricht (1985) no longer believe that Novisuccinea ovalis even occurs in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat at Chittenango Falls. They surmise, rather, that earlier {{reported}} specimens of Novisuccinea ovalis were instead immature Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. However, {{a review of}} photographic records showed shells of Novisuccinea ovalis that were collected at the Falls when the type specimens of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were collected. Apparently, Novisuccinea ovalis occurred {{at or near the}} Falls historically but is no longer encountered there or is only located in adjacent habitats. Therefore, relative comparisons between the two species' abundance <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> and confusing.|$|E

5|$|The horizon problem {{results from}} the premise that {{information}} cannot travel faster than light. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the particle horizon—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in causal contact. The observed isotropy of the CMB <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions {{to have the same}} temperature.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{account of the}} life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor Hadrian (117–138). His De Vita Caesarum is the source of much of what is known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror. The biography <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent libertine.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes <b>is</b> <b>problematic</b> {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms {{insoluble}} layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
