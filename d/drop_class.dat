40|$|A {{spray drift}} model called RTDrift was {{developed}} to estimate drift caused by ground sprayer machines. The sprayer was equipped with sensors measuring operational parameters namely spray pressure, boom height and movements, and geolocalization. Climatic parameters, including wind speed and direction, were measured using a 2 -D ultrasonic anemometer mounted on the sprayer. The nozzles spray drop size spectra were characterized using Phase Doppler Interferometer measurements. At every successive boom position, a diffusion-advection Gaussian tilted plume model computed the spray drift deposits for each <b>drop</b> <b>class</b> taking into account evaporation. The contribution of a single nozzle was calculated by integration of the individual puffs with respect to time and summation of the contributions of individual drops classes. The overall drift generated by the sprayer machine was obtained adding the contributions of all the nozzles. Field trials were performed on a fallow field with water and on crops with pesticides in various wind conditions. The ground drift was measured at different drift distances using fluorometric methods. When comparing {{the results of the}} model with experimental measurements of deposits, the model produced realistic maps of drift deposits. Some further improvement is needed in the presence of large scale eddies. The model offers potential benefits for the farmer as a real time drift estimator embedded on a sprayer machinePeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} describing {{perceived social support}} {{and its relation to}} academic achievement in a sample of 760 Argentinean college students. Perception of social support was assessed in terms of four possible sources: parents, teachers, classmates, and boyfriend/girlfriend or best friend. Academic achievement was measured using three different indicators: the rate of passed, failed and <b>dropped</b> <b>classes</b> in the time since the academic career was initiated. The main hypothesis posed was that a higher perception of social support would be related to a better academic achievement (a bigger rate of passed classes, and a smaller rate of failed and <b>dropped</b> <b>classes).</b> Findings showed that women perceived significantly more support than men from all sources, except from teachers. Both males and females perceived more support from best friends or boyfriends/girlfriends, and identified teachers as the less supportive source. A higher perception of social support was associated with better academic achievement but only for females. Limitations of the study and implications for the set in motion of different interventions in the academic field, which could be specific to certain type of students, are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Student debt {{is a form}} of {{debt that}} is owed by an attending, {{withdrawn}} or graduated student to a lending institution. The lending is often of a student loan, but debts may be owed to the school if the student has <b>dropped</b> <b>classes</b> and withdrawn from the school. Withdrawing from a school, especially if a low- or no-income student has withdrawn with a failing grade, could deprive the student of the ability of further attendance by disqualifying the student of necessary financial aid. Student loans also differ in many countries in the strict laws regulating renegotiating and bankruptcy. Due payments may be a retroactive penalty for services rendered by the school to the individual, including room and board.|$|R
