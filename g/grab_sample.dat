50|$|<b>Grab</b> <b>sample</b> UPW {{analyses}} are either complimentary to the on-line testing or alternative, {{depending on the}} availability of the instruments and the level of the UPW quality specifications. <b>Grab</b> <b>sample</b> analysis are typically performed for the following parameters: metals, anions, ammonium, silica (both dissolved and total), particles by SEM (scanning electron microscope), TOC (total organic compounds) and specific organic compounds.|$|E
50|$|In {{the open}} seas marine {{environment}} grab samples can establish {{a wide range}} of base-line parameters such as salinity and a range of cation and anion concentrations. However, where changing conditions are an issue such as near river or sewage discharges, close to the effects of volcanism or close to areas of freshwater input from melting ice, a <b>grab</b> <b>sample</b> can only give a very partial answer when taken on its own.|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of passive samplers (Chemcatcher) {{as an alternative}} to <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> in estimating time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations and total loads of herbicides was assessed. <b>Grab</b> <b>sampling</b> complemented deployments of passive samplers in a tropical waterway in Queensland, Australia, before, during and after a flood event. Good agreement was observed between the two sampling modes in estimating TWA concentrations that was independent of herbicide concentrations ranging over 2 orders of magnitude. In a flood-specific deployment, passive sampler TWA concentrations underestimated mean <b>grab</b> <b>sampler</b> (n = 258) derived concentrations of atrazine, diuron, ametryn, and metolachlor by an average factor of 1. 29. No clear trends were evident in the ratios of load estimates from passive samplers relative to <b>grab</b> <b>samples</b> that ranged between 0. 3 and 1. 8 for these analytes because of the limitations of using TWA concentrations to derive flow-weighted loads. Stratification of deployments by flow however generally resulted in noticeable improvements in passive sampler load estimates. By considering the magnitude of the uncertainty (interquartile range and the root-mean-squared error) of load estimates a modeling exercise showed that passive samplers were a viable alternative to <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> since between 3 and 17 <b>grab</b> <b>samples</b> were needed before <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> results had less uncertainty.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is the final}} report for tank 241 -S- 304 <b>grab</b> <b>samples.</b> Four <b>grab</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from riser 4 on July 30, 1998. Analyses were performed {{in accordance with the}} Compatibility <b>Grab</b> <b>Sampling</b> and Analysis Plan (TSAP) (Sasaki, 1998) and the Data Quality Objectives for Tank Farms Waste Compatibility Program (DQO). The analytical results are presented in the data summary report (Table 1).

50|$|Although {{particles}} and TOC are usually measured using on-line methods, {{there is significant}} value in complimentary or alternative off-line lab analysis. The value of the lab analysis has two aspects: cost and speciation. Smaller UPW facilities that cannot afford to purchase on-line instrumentation often choose off-line testing. TOC {{can be measured in}} the <b>grab</b> <b>sample</b> at a concentration as low as 5 ppb, using the same technique employed for the on-line analysis (see on-line method description). This detection level covers the majority of needs of less critical electronic and all pharmaceutical applications. When speciation of the organics is required for troubleshooting or design purposes, liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) provides an effective analysis. This method allows for identification of biopolymers, humics, low molecular weight acids and neutrals, and more, while characterizing nearly 100% of the organic composition in UPW with sub-ppb level of TOC.|$|E
50|$|Continuous or quasi-continuous {{monitoring}} involves {{having an}} automated analytical facility {{close to the}} environment being monitored so that results can, if required, be viewed in real time. Such systems are often established to protect important water supplies {{such as in the}} River Dee regulation system but may also be part of an overall monitoring strategy on large strategic rivers where early warning of potential problems is essential. Such systems routinely provide data on parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity and colour but it is also possible to operate gas liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry technologies (GLC/MS) to examine a wide range of potential organic pollutants. In all examples of automated bank-side analysis there is a requirement for water to be pumped from the river into the monitoring station. Choosing a location for the pump inlet is equally as critical as deciding on the location for a river <b>grab</b> <b>sample.</b> The design of the pump and pipework also requires careful design to avoid artefacts being introduced through the action of pumping the water. Dissolved oxygen concentration is difficult to sustain through a pumped system and GLC/MS facilities can detect micro-organic contaminants from the pipework and glands.|$|E
5000|$|Sampling of coal is an {{important}} part of the process control in the CPP. A <b>grab</b> <b>sample</b> is a one-off sample of the coal at a point in the process stream, and tends not to be very representative. A routine sample is taken at a set frequency, either over a period of time or per shipment. Coal sampling consists of several types of sampling devices. A [...] "cross cut" [...] sampler mimics the [...] "stop belt" [...] sampling method specified by a standard originally published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). A cross cut sampler mounts directly on top of the conveyor belt, the falling stream sampler is placed at the head section of the belt. There are several points in the wash plant that many coal operations choose to sample. The raw coal, before it enters the plant. The refuse, to see what the plant missed. Then the clean coal, to see exactly what is being shipped. The sampler is set according to Tons per hour, Feet per minute and top size of the product on the actual belt. A sample is taken then crushed, then sub sampled and returned to the main belt. The sample is sent to an Independent lab for testing where the results will be shared with the buyer as well as the supplier. The buyer in many cases will also sample the coal again once it is received to [...] "double check" [...] the results. Continuous measurement of ash, moisture, kCal (BTU), sulfur Fe, Ca, Na, and other element constituents of the coal are reported by cross belt elemental analyzers. This information can be calibrated periodically to the lab data per ASTM methods.|$|E

5000|$|SPI {{has been}} used to model the {{integrity}} and performance of capped dredge-spoil sites (NOAA 2003) and containment sites (e.g. Parliamentary-Commissioner 1995; Gowing et al. 1997). Detailed acoustic surveys of spoil disposal sites are inherently limited to a vertical resolution of ca. 10 cm (Ramsay 2005). There is considerable evidence that spoil overburden of less than 10 cm affects macrofaunal species (Chang and Levings 1976; Maurer et al. 1982; Maurer et al. 1986; Chandrasekara and Frid 1998; Schratzberger et al. 2000; Cruz-Motta and Collins 2004). Backscatter and high-frequency side-scan sonar techniques may provide faster characterisation of spoil extent, but only when the spoil’s acoustic reflectivity or topology is sufficiently distinct from native sediments. SPI devices produce imagery of the sediment/water interface with sub-millimetre resolution. SPI therefore offers the capability to examine dredge spoil mound morphology, compaction, winnowing, integration with native sediments, and, potentially, biological activity at a scale relevant to the macrofaunal assemblages under study. SPI can be applied to other, perhaps more common, benthic disturbance investigations as well (...) [...] To illustrate, consider a benthic ecological impact study for a hypothetical shellfish mariculture facility. There are an enormous variety of study approaches. Existing information and the available resources inevitably constrain every design. With little information on bottom type, a simple, one-off, spatial impact study like that shown in Figure 5 with eight sites along an isobath, taking three replicate grabs from each, is fairly common and moderately powerful. Prior data gathering including bathymetric, diver, towed-camera, ROV, or side-scan sonar observations would probably alter site placement and greatly enhance overall information and value. Collecting such data over even a small site such as this one requires considerable resources and will probably cause a gap of several days to allow data processing between the first field days and the grab sampling events (It is this delay that precludes, or reduces, the value of studying transient events in hydrodynamically energetic areas). Collecting a large number of point data from an SPI device is easily done where the resulting snapshots of the benthic character are automatically placed on a map of the study area in real time. This approach allows rapid categorisation according to one or more variables of interest. In waters <30 m deep it is not unreasonable to expect to collect the 170 SP images indicated in Figure 6 and produce a rough benthic classification map in a single field day. The categories may be based on sediment texture, overburden, specific detritus, biota, etc. Sampling effort can then be allocated to focus on the variability of communities among the gross habitat differences by using grabs as habitat replicates with varying lag. This type of approach produces a broader understanding of the system and permits more informed decisions by increasing the generality of the <b>grab</b> <b>sample</b> data. The SPI evidence can effectively increase the extent from one dimension to at least two. Correlation between physical and biological data collected from the grabs also allows more data to be extracted from the SP imagery by identifying specific features (infaunal species, tubes, mounds, etc.). Furthermore, a detailed analysis of ARPD depths can then be presented as geochemical environment contours.|$|E
