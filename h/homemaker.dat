40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{interaction}} of two groups of physically disabled <b>homemakers</b> with the surrounding community. One group of <b>homemakers</b> used devices to aid in mobility. The second group of <b>homemakers,</b> although disabled, did not use mobility devices. It was {{the purpose of this}} study to: (1) Determine if the community and home involvement of disabled <b>homemakers</b> who use devices to aid in mobility differs from that of disabled <b>homemakers</b> who do not use devices to aid in mobility. (2) Determine if certain personality characteristics are related to community and home involvement. (3) Collect descriptive material concerning community and home involvement, transportation, and accessibility of public facilities for physically disabled women. Each of the 55 <b>homemakers</b> included in the study had a physical disability of some type. Thirty of the women used mobility devices and 25 did not.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Since the {{management}} of family meals {{has been a major}} task in most homes throughout the United States and because of its importance to family members, this study was undertaken to examine {{the management}} practices used by <b>homemakers</b> in preparing and serving meals. A questionnaire, developed by the researcher {{with the assistance of the}} Home Management Department staff was sent to 300 <b>homemakers</b> in the Willamette Valley of Oregon randomly selected from telephone directories. A total of 136 questionnaires were returned, 105 of which were coded and analyzed. Thirty-one questionnaires were omitted from the study either because they were incomplete or received too late to tabulate. All <b>homemakers</b> reported they lived with their husbands except one who was a widow. <b>Homemakers</b> ranged in age from 20 to over 60 years; however 81 were under 50 years of age. Seventy-six families in the sample had children living at home and the average number of children in these families was 2. 5. Eighty percent of the <b>homemakers</b> and their husbands had completed 12 years of school. Twelve percent of the <b>homemakers</b> and 20 percent of the husbands had completed four years of college, and over 40 percent of the <b>homemakers</b> and their husbands had received some post high school education. Thirty-four percent of the <b>homemakers</b> were employed full time and seven percent had part-time employment. Full-time <b>homemakers</b> composed 58 percent of the group. Eighty-eight percent of the employed <b>homemakers</b> did not have preschool age children at home. Thirty percent of the husbands were employed as skilled laborers, 17 percent as professionals, and 14 percent in farming and related occupations. Ten percent of the husbands were either retired or attending college. Findings from this study show that about 90 percent of the families eat the evening meal together, about 60 percent eat breakfast together, and less than 30 percent eat the noon meal together during the week. Families ate more meals together on Sunday than any other day of the week. Families had a set hour for mealtimes during the week, but the weekend mealtimes tended to be flexible. When meals were eaten away from home, 37 percent of the families dined at restaurants and 25 percent dined with relatives. Husbands and older children often carried sack lunches and ate in cafeterias. All families members indicated eating with friends. Most <b>homemakers</b> felt it was important for family members to eat meals together. The main reasons given by <b>homemakers</b> for eating meals together were convenience, companionship, and communication. Few families viewed television regularly during mealtime, Most meals were served in the kitchen; however 57 percent of the <b>homemakers</b> had more than one room where meals could be served. Seventy percent of the <b>homemakers</b> entertained guests at least once a month, Most <b>homemakers</b> entertained four to six guests for a meal at one time; however about one-fourth of the <b>homemakers</b> entertained 15 to 30 guests on holidays and family get-togethers. <b>Homemakers</b> were responsible for about 90 percent of the meal preparation and estimated spending an average of 11 hours and 56 minutes per week on food preparation. More time was spent preparing the evening meal than any other meal, and more time was spent on meal preparation on the weekend than during the week. About 70 percent of the <b>homemakers</b> used country-style service in which food was placed in serving bowls and passed around the table for the evening meal and 40 percent used plate service for the morning meal. Plate service was not used for evening and guest meals, The results indicate that most <b>homemakers</b> in this study do not use any type of table covering regularly. Paper napkins are used regularly by <b>homemakers</b> on both weekdays and weekends. <b>Homemakers</b> did the major food shopping for the family, usually on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. Over half of the <b>homemakers</b> reported shopping once a week. Other <b>homemakers</b> shopped several times during the week, every two weeks, or monthly. Most <b>homemakers</b> enjoyed preparing meals. While many <b>homemakers</b> did not like help preparing meals, they wanted help with table setting and clean up...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of work {{conditions}} in mediating the effect of employment status on married women's psychological well-being. Employed wives and full-time <b>homemakers</b> are compared on characteristics of their daily work activities {{and the consequences of}} these work conditions for psychological well-being. Using data from a national survey of employed wives and <b>homemakers,</b> I find that full-time housework involves more autonomy, more interruptions, greater physical effort, more routine, fewer time pressures, and less responsibility for matters outside one's control than paid work. Differences in work activities between employed wives and <b>homemakers</b> also have direct implications for well-being. Two of the dimensions examined-the extent to which the worker is responsible for things outside her control, and the amount of routine entailed-are associated with greater depressive symptoms among women, regardless of work status. It appears that, as compared to employed wives, full-time <b>homemakers</b> benefit from having less responsibility for things outside their control. Employed wives appear to benefit from having less routinized work than <b>homemakers.</b> As a result of the different configurations of their work characteristics, employed wives and <b>homemakers</b> experience on average similar levels of depressive symptoms...|$|R

In Summer lawn mowers are used at high cutting for cool season grass, and lower cutting for warm season lawns.

Cool season lawns are planted in the autumn with adequate rainfall. Lawn care in the winter is minimal, requiring only light feedings of organic material, such as green-waste compost, and minerals to encourage earthworms and beneficial microbes.|$|R
