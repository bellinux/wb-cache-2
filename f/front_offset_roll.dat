40|$|The {{quality of}} a product {{fabricated}} by direct writing methods will depend greatly on {{the properties of the}} printing material and its compatibility with the printing process. Although multiple advances in developing printing inks and pastes with novel properties are being made, the potential those can bring to electronics is hindered by their stability and performance during the printing process. In this study a UV-LED curable acrylic material was used to test the optimization of inks and pastes for three of the most common direct writing systems: Piezo-type Inkjet, Reverse <b>Offset</b> <b>Roll</b> to Plate, and Micro Deposition. The viscosity of the photosensitive acrylic matrix was controlled by either the addition of diluents or electronically functional reinforcement material. The contact angle of the optimized solutions on 16 different Polyester, Polyimide, and Paper films was observed. Solutions with larger contact angles showed better line definition for the Inkjet and the Micro Dispense systems. In addition to the contact angle differential, the rheological properties showed to be a determinant factor for the feasibility of a solution to undergo the reverse offset printing process. The UV curable acrylic demonstrated electrical conductivity when 2 % (wt.) MWCNT were ultrasonically mixed in the matrix and then cured with a 385 nm wavelength for 3 seconds. Only the micro deposition system was capable of printing the acrylic-MWCNT paste and the relationship between the contact angle, pattern accuracy, substrate selection, and electrical conductivity, was determined. ...|$|R

30|$|By {{detecting}} the onsets and offsets and forming the onset and <b>offset</b> <b>fronts,</b> the modulation spectrogram domain of speech signal is segmented. Since the speaker's pitch range is [60, 350] Hz (for men, women, and children), only the segments with modulation frequencies in this range are accepted. Now, {{we describe the}} grouping procedure for the segments.|$|R
30|$|After {{finding the}} onsets and offsets, those with close {{modulation}} frequencies {{are connected to}} the onset and <b>offset</b> <b>fronts,</b> because the frequency components of onsets and offsets with close modulation frequencies probably correspond to the same source. Onset and <b>offset</b> <b>fronts</b> are vertical contours across acoustic frequency in the modulation spectrogram domain. The proposed system connects an onset candidate from a filter channel to an onset candidate in the above adjacent filter channel, provided that their distance in the modulation frequency is less than a certain threshold relative to the latter filter channel. In each filter channel, this threshold is defined as the mean of the distances in the modulation frequency direction between two-by-two adjacent onsets. This definition for the threshold is provided from experiments and is validated as a good choice in the data. The same applies to the offset candidates. Notice that a threshold with a too small value may prevent onsets or offsets from the same event to joint; while a threshold with a too large value may cause some onsets from different events to connect together [20].|$|R

30|$|At first, the {{proposed}} system performs a multipitch range estimation of target and interference speech {{based on the}} segmentation of modulation spectrogram domain. The segmentation is done using an onset and offset algorithm similar to that proposed by Hu and Wang [20]. In {{the proposed}} method, the noisy signal is divided into 200 ms time frames and then, the proposed speech separation algorithm is applied to each individual frame. Pitch range estimation method works in three stages: the first stage computes the modulation spectrogram; the second stage decomposes the modulation spectrogram into segments using an onset and offset algorithm. In this stage, at first, the peaks and valleys of derivative smoothed intensity of modulation spectrogram are detected and marked as onset and offset candidates. Any onset bigger than a certain threshold is accepted for which the smallest offset between two onsets is selected. Then, onset and <b>offset</b> <b>fronts</b> are produced by connecting the common onsets and offsets. Finally, the segments are formed by matching the onset and <b>offset</b> <b>fronts.</b> The third stage determines the range of pitch frequency by selecting and grouping the desired segments.|$|R
