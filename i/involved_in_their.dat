5|$|For {{the film}} score, Mizoguchi relied on {{composer}} Fumio Hayasaka and the assistant directors, {{and was not}} <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> creative process. Fumio Hayasaka was a strong proponent of using Japanese music in Japanese films. For Ugetsu, he employed geza music, common in Kabuki theatre. Additional, uncredited composers were Ichiro Saito and Tamekichi Mochizuki, whose music was blended with Hayasaka's, and could provide accurate music reflective of the period.|$|E

Mark initially lived in Whittier and Pico Rivera; when he was six, his father moved with the children to Rancho Santa Margarita, a predominantly white city in Orange County.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{building}} {{was carried out in}} the 12th century. The abbot successfully appropriated the nearby Perry Moor and surrounding areas and was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> drainage and management. Around 1308 the abbey built The Priest's House for the parish priest. It is now owned by the National Trust. It has been designated as a grade II listed building. Much of the abbey was rebuilt under abbots William Wyke (1489-1504) and Thomas Broke (1505-1522) with the funding being provided by the leasing of the Demesne farm.|$|E
5|$|Stone Sour is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Stone Sour. It was {{recorded}} and {{produced by the}} band and Tom Tatman at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and was released on August 27, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Writing for the album began in 2000 while vocalist Corey Taylor and guitarist Jim Root were still actively <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> other band, Slipknot. Work began on the album after Slipknot had gone on hiatus following touring in support of their second album Iowa.|$|E
5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides are not <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E

5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|Journalists often {{visited the}} set and wrote {{positively}} about the production. The film was shot almost chronologically in Sologne and again in Joinville, Val-de-Marne, which Renoir considered important for the actors' performances. Renoir {{said he did not}} need to do much directing since the actors were so <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> roles. When directing himself, Renoir arranged the performers movements first then acted in the scenes. Jay pushed Renoir to finish filming in Sologne and move the production to sets erected at the Pathé studios in Joinville. Renoir finally agreed and left Zwobada, Cortegganni and Cartier-Bresson in Sologne to shoot B-roll footage of the rabbit hunting sequence. Hundreds of animals were killed during filming and local people were used as stand-ins for the actors.|$|E
5|$|Lochner is {{associated}} with three surviving books of hours; in Darmstadt, Berlin and Anholt. The extent of his association in each is debated; workshop members were probably heavily <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> production. The most famous is the early 1450s Prayer book of Stephan Lochner now at Darmstadt; the others are the Berlin Book of Prayers of c. 1444, and the Anholt Prayerbook, completed in the 1450s. The manuscripts are very small (Berlin: 9.3cm x 7cm, Darmstadt: 10.7cm x 8cm, Anholt: 9cm x 8cm) and similar in layout and colourisation and are each extensively decorated in gold and blue. The borders are ornamented in bright colours and contain acanthus scrolls, gold foliage, flowers, berry-like fruits and round pods. The Darmstadt book includes a complete cycle of the Martyrdom of the Apostles. Its illustrations contain Lochner's characteristic application of deep blue, reminiscent of his Virgin in the Rose Garden.|$|E

The sons created a memorial to their parents in St Erasmus' Chapel in Chester cathedral. This consists of a backcloth to the altar inscribed to their parents' memory, and a bust of their father {{to the north of}} the altar. The memorial is by Sir Arthur Blomfield and the bust by M. Wagmiller. There is also a bust of Thomas in Chester's Grosvenor Museum and plaques to his memory in Chester station. Streets named after him in Chester are Brassey Street and Thomas Brassey Close (which is off Lightfoot Street).|$|E
5|$|Temples and cults in Egypt itself {{declined}} as the Roman economy deteriorated in {{the third}} century AD, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians suppressed the veneration of Egyptian deities. The last formal cults, at Philae, died out in the fifth or sixth century. Most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years, remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries. But many of the practices <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> worship, such as processions and oracles, were adapted to fit Christian ideology and persisted {{as part of the}} Coptic Church. Given the great changes and diverse influences in Egyptian culture since that time, scholars disagree about whether any modern Coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion. But many festivals and other traditions of modern Egyptians, both Christian and Muslim, resemble the worship of their ancestors' gods.|$|E
