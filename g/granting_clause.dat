50|$|The {{provisions}} of the habendum clause must agree with those stated in the <b>granting</b> <b>clause.</b> For example, if the grantor conveys a time share interest or an interest less than fee simple absolute, the habendum clause would specify the owner's rights {{as well as how}} those rights are limited (a specific time frame or certain prohibited activities, for instance). Many states, such as Pennsylvania, require a deed to have a habendum clause in order for the deed to be officially recorded and recognized by the Recorder of Deeds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The article starts by {{considering}} principle arguments pro and contra conditional and unconditional cash grants. It continues by reviewing empirical {{evidence about the}} effects and costs of such schemes. The results of six recent meta-studies and six recent single project studies are reviewed and assessed. Overall, the results are not unanimous, but a certain pattern of effects emerges. The conclusion is: If {{the aim is to}} immediately contribute to a reduction of poverty, unconditional cash transfers are a reasonable instrument. If the aim is to induce behavioral changes in order to overcome current and future poverty, conditional income <b>grants</b> with exit <b>clauses</b> may be preferable, not least because they are more effective, more efficient and more affordable...|$|R
25|$|The First Clause of Section Three, {{also known}} as the Admissions <b>Clause,</b> <b>grants</b> to Congress the {{authority}} to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. It also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of the affected states and Congress. This latter provision was designed to give Eastern states that still had claims to Western lands (e.g., Virginia and North Carolina) to have a veto over whether their western counties (which eventually became Kentucky and Tennessee) could become states. It would later be applied with regard to the formation of Maine (from Massachusetts) and West Virginia (from Virginia).|$|R
50|$|A <b>clause</b> <b>granting</b> the Supreme Court {{the power}} to issue writs of {{mandamus}} under its original jurisdiction was declared unconstitutional by Marbury v.

The Supreme Court held that Section 13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional because it purported to enlarge the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court beyond that permitted by the Constitution. In Marbury, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot pass laws that are contrary to the Constitution, {{and that it is}} the role of the judicial system to interpret what the Constitution permits. Thus, the Judiciary Act of 1789 was the first act of Congress to be partially invalidated by the Supreme Court.|$|R
