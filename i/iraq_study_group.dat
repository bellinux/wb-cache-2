Unfortunately, the country’s economic recovery has received considerably less attention. Yet the country’s economic situation is quite dire. The ISG correctly notes that: (a) instead of meeting {{a target of}} 10 percent growth for 2006 only 4 percent was attained, (b) inflation is above 50 percent, (c) estimates of unemployment range from 20 to 60 percent, and (d) foreign investment is less than 1 {{percent of gross domestic}} product.

On the same day, Captain Patriquin was killed by a roadside bomb in Ramadi along with Major Megan McClung, the first female Marine officer to die in Iraq. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein, Saddam's family considered interring him in Ramadi because of the improved security situation.

500|$|More than 20 nations (most {{notably the}} United Kingdom), {{designated}} the [...] "coalition of the willing" [...] joined the United States in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared {{the end of}} major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] speech was later criticized as premature. From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing {{that there was a}} full-scale civil war in Iraq. Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan <b>Iraq</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group,</b> led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was [...] "grave and deteriorating". While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy.

The report's apparent recognition {{of many of the}} failures of the US-led invasion, especially in security terms, and its recommendation of a changed approach to American foreign policy in the Middle East generally, also received support from significant sections of the academic community in the US who had increasingly grown more critical of the nature of American involvement in Iraq (albeit from varying perspectives) as the situation in the country appeared to be deteriorating further.|$|R

2500|$|Critics of {{ties between}} <b>Iraq</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> members and oil {{companies}} were {{highly critical of}} the report's recommendations to privatize the Iraqi oil industry.

[...] Similarly, activist Tom Hayden noted that the <b>Iraq</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> represents the interests of the US oil industry. James A.
