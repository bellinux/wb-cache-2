40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to compare the {{performance}} of two coating systems applied on steel specimens. The first of them demands sandblasting pretreatment of the metal surface while the second one, which does not need it, leads to rust transformation. These systems were examined in three corrosive environments i. e. a geothermal fluid of low enthalpy, a 3. 5 wt per cent NaCl solution and a 5 wt per cent NaCl in a salt spray cabinet. The anticorrosive capability of the two coating systems was evaluated at predetermined exposure times by mass loss measurements of the steel substrate, by potentiodynamic polarization curves and by the half-cell potential time evolution. Visual examination of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rusting</b> and blistering was also carried out. The results indicate that both coating systems exhibit almost similar protective behavior under the same conditions of pretreatment. In all cases, the corrosion rate increases {{with the increase of}} the surface roughness. © MCB University Press...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} work {{is aimed at}} evaluating first, {{the effect of a}} solution simulating the geothermal fluid of the field in Sousaki, New Korinthia, on the corrosion of bare steel, and, second, the protective performance that certain combinations of organic coatings provide. This evaluation resulted from corrosion potential measurements, mass loss measurements, corrosion rate estimates by the Tafel method, and visual ranking of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rusting</b> and blistering. Six combinations of organic coatings were tested. Four of them consisted of water-based paints as primer, as well as intermediate and topcoat. Of the two remaining combinations, the first comprised a water-based primer, including dispersed tannin and a two-component epoxy resin topcoat, while the second consisted of a two-component acrylic primer, containing chromate pigments and the same epoxy resin topcoat as above. All coating combinations tested exhibited protective performance. The results of the water-based coatings were less satisfactory than those of the two combinations containing the epoxy resin topcoat. © 1997 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringRobert J. PetermanAn {{experimental}} {{testing program}} {{was conducted at}} Kansas State University (KSU) to test the bond characteristics of various 5. 32 -mm-diameter steel wires and smaller diameter (less than 0. 5 in.) strands used in prestressed concrete railroad ties. A total of 13 wires and six strands produced by seven different steel manufacturers were used during this testing. Since no wire bond pullout test currently exists, one was developed and its validity tested. This un-tensioned pullout test {{could serve as a}} quality control test similar to the standard test for strand bond (ASTM A 1081) that has been developed for pretensioned strands. This strand test is currently not verified for strands less than 0. 5 -in. in diameter, so the procedure was also scrutinized using strands common in the concrete railroad tie industry. Some of the wires and strands contained surface indentations. It is generally accepted that indentations in the reinforcements improve the bond between the steel and concrete. To further complicate the issue, reinforcements with different surface conditions (rust, oils, lubricants) are allowed {{to be used in the}} concrete ties which further affects the bond quality of the reinforcements. However, no standardized indentation patterns (shape, size, depth of indent, etc.) or surface conditions (<b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rusting,</b> amount of surface lubricants, etc.) are utilized by all wire and strand manufacturers. Thus, the corresponding bond behavior of these different reinforcements when placed in various concrete mixtures, in terms of average transfer lengths and typical variations, is essentially unknown. The purpose of this testing program was to develop (in the case of wires) or verify/develop (in the case of strands) a pullout testing procedure predictive of the reinforcement’s bond performance in a prestressed application. The test should be relatively inexpensive, demonstrably repeatable, and easily reproducible. Results from the un-tensioned pullout tests were compared to transfer length measurements from accompanying pretensioned concrete prisms in the lab. Additionally, pullout tests and transfer length measurements were obtained at an actual concrete railroad tie manufacturing plant. The obtained data was compared to the lab data and analyzed to further understand the relationship between un-tensioned pullout tests and pretensioned concrete members...|$|E

40|$|Previously no {{immunity}} or high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> {{resistance to}} soybean rust has been reported. The tests described {{have demonstrated that}} strong resistance to rust does exist in soybean genotypes, and in particular in one accession of P 1200492 (Q 12956) and the cultivars derived from it (Tainung 3 and Tainung 4) and in lines P 1227268, PI 227687 and HY 2217. However, these resistances may not be effective against the whole rust population, {{as evidenced by the}} identification of a second race <b>of</b> <b>rust</b> which is virulent on the previously immune line P 1200492. <b>Rust</b> <b>of</b> soybeans, caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi Syd., is reported to be widely distributed throughout Asia from China south to Australia (1, 6, 10). The rust causes premature defoliation of plants, with a subsequent increase in the numbers of unfilled pods per plant. Disease loss has not been accurately determined, but the data available show that this disease can cause serious yield loss. In Taiwan it is estimated that, due to rust, production is reduced by 20 - 30 % (8), whilst in individual fields as much as 70 - 80 % of potential yield may be lost (4). In Japan, losses of 15 - 40 % in individual fields are reported (7), and in Thailand losses are estimated to range from 10 - 30 % in individual fields (8). No accurate measures of yield loss have been reported for Australian crops. Screening tests of soybean accessions have been carried out in several countries where the rust is indigenous, to identify sources <b>of</b> resistance to <b>rust.</b> The tests have shown that accessions differ in the severity <b>of</b> <b>rust</b> development that occurs on them, and show varying amounts of field resistance.

At the end of the lease, the body was in excellent condition, which we documented with a set of detailed photographs before the vehicle was returned to Ford.

40|$|White blister rust in the Brassicaceae is {{emerging}} as a superb model for exploring how plant biodiversity has channeled speciation of biotrophic parasites. The causal agents <b>of</b> white <b>rust</b> across a wide breadth of cruciferous hosts currently are named as variants of a single oomycete species, Albugo candida. The most notable examples include a major group of physiological races that each are economically destructive in a different vegetable or oilseed crop of Brassica juncea (A. candida race 2), B. rapa (race 7), or B. oleracea (race 9); or parasitic on wild crucifers such as Capsella bursa-pastoris (race 4). Arabidopsis thaliana is innately immune to these races of A. candida under natural conditions; however, it commonly hosts its own molecularly distinct subspecies of A. candida (A. candida subsp. arabidopsis). In the laboratory, we have identified several accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana (e. g.,. Ws- 3) that can permit varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>rust</b> development following inoculation with A. candida races 2, 4, and 7, whereas race 9 is universally incompatible in Arabidopsis thaliana and nonrusting resistance is the most prevalent outcome of interactions with the other races. Subtle variation in resistance phenotypes is evident, observed initially with an isolate of A. candida race 4, indicating additional genetic variation. Therefore, we used the race 4 isolate for mapbased cloning {{of the first of}} many expected white rust resistance (WRR) genes. This gene was designated WRR 4 and encodes a cytoplasmic toll-interleukin receptor-like nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein that confers a dominant, broad-spectrum white rust resistance in the Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia to representative isolates of A. candida races 2, 4, 7, and 9, as verified by transgenic expression of the Columbia allele in Ws- 3. The WRR 4 protein requires functional expression of the lipase-like protein EDS 1 but not the paralogous protein PAD 4, and confers full immunity that masks an underlying nonhypersensitive incompatibility in Columbia to A. candida race 4.

40|$|Recently, in {{the civil}} {{engineering}} domain, digital image processing methods have been applied in various areas for advanced infrastructure inspections and assessment. Conventional inspection methods mostly consist of visual human assessment. While a careful visual inspection can provide valuable information, it has inherent limitations in assessing the structural integrity {{and the level of}} damage to a facility. Therefore, many problems can be neglected until they become serious and require costly repair. One of the current computerized technologies for advanced infrastructure inspection methods is the application of digital image processing, and this research addressed the application of digital image processing to steel bridge coating inspection methods. ^ Through the use of digital image processing methods, rust percentages on steel bridge coating surfaces can be objectively computed. Automated rust defect assessment methods can assist in the evaluation of the conditions of steel bridge painting surfaces accurately and quickly. In addition, machine vision-dependent inspections can provide more consistent inspection results than human visual inspections. The reliable results from the application of digital image processing methods can facilitate for bridge managers to develop long-term cost-effective maintenance programs. With these goals in mind, digital image processing methods have been developed for objective rust defect recognition in the past few years. However, previous research efforts have shown that these methods have some limitations in processing coating images under particular environmental conditions, such as non-uniform illuminations, low-contrast digital images, and noises on painting surfaces. ^ Therefore, a rust defect assessment method was proposed in this research by exploring a digital color imaging system to effectively deal with those environmental conditions. Also, this research developed an automated processor to recognize the existence <b>of</b> bridge painting <b>rust</b> defects since most previous research projects solely focused on the computation <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>rust</b> defects on the steel surfaces. The rust defect recognition method was created by characterizing a digital color space for statistical data acquisition and applying a multivariate statistical analysis. The recognition method can be combined with the rust defect assessment method, while creating an integrated system for objective painting surface condition processing and assessment. ...|$|R

40|$|Rust fungi {{cause serious}} yield {{reductions}} on crops, including wheat, barley, soybean, coffee, and represent real threats to global food security. Of these fungi, the flax rust pathogen Melampsora lini {{has been developed}} extensively over the past 80 years as a model to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin pathogenesis. During infection, M. lini secretes virulence effectors to promote disease. The number of these effectors, their function and their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> conservation across <b>rust</b> fungal species is unknown. To assess this, we sequenced and assembled de novo the genome of M. lini isolate CH 5 into 21, 130 scaffolds spanning 189 Mbp (scaffold N 50 of 31 kbp). Global analysis of the DNA sequence revealed that repetitive elements, primarily retrotransposons, make up at least 45 % of the genome. Using ab initio predictions, transcriptome data and homology searches, we identified 16, 271 putative protein-coding genes. An analysis pipeline was then implemented to predict the effector complement of M. lini and compare it to that <b>of</b> the poplar <b>rust,</b> wheat stem rust and wheat stripe rust pathogens to identify conserved and species-specific effector candidates. Previous knowledge of four cloned M. lini avirulence effector proteins and two basidiomycete effectors was used to optimise parameters of the effector prediction pipeline.

Clusters containing at least one member from M. lini were further analysed and prioritized based on features including expression in isolated haustoria and infected leaf tissue and conservation across rust species.

Host-pathogen compatibility in remaining lines facilitated the assessment <b>of</b> slow <b>rusting</b> trait and it was assessed through the epidemiological parameters viz., Final Rust Severity (FRS), Area Under Rust Progress Curve (AURPC) and Infection Rate (IR). Maximum FRS of 70 % was rated in five lines while in the remaining 13 lines it ranged between 10 to 60 %. Relative AURPC values up to 30 % of the susceptible check were recorded for 10 lines while up to 70 % for eight lines, showing desirable and good slow rusting behavior, respectively. Relative infection rate values ranged from 0 for NIA- 7 to 1100 - 1300, recorded for eight lines.
