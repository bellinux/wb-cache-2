40|$|International audienceThe Katanga Copperbelt {{region of}} the Democratic Republic of Congo hosts {{world-class}} cobalt deposits accounting for similar to 50 % of the world reserves. <b>Heterogenite</b> (CoOOH) is the most abundant Co-bearing secondary mineral in the region. Its occurrence {{is the result of}} oxidation of Cu-Co-sulfides and associated Co reprecipitation in the uppermost part of the deposits, during the Pliocene. In addition to sediment-hosted copper and cobalt ore deposits, the Katanga Copperbelt also hosts numerous uraniferous mineral occurrences and deposits, which can be associated with <b>heterogenite.</b> Within these deposits, <b>heterogenite</b> can have high concentrations of U (up to 3. 5 %) and Pb (up to similar to 4 %). In situ SIMS U-Pb ages were obtained for <b>heterogenite</b> samples from the U deposits of Shinkolobwe, Kalongwe and Kambove. These analyses yield distinct Neoproterozoic ages, at similar to 876 Ma, similar to 823 Ma and in the similar to 720 to similar to 670 Ma age range. As the geological context prevailing at those times was not favorable for <b>heterogenite</b> formation, these ages most probably record geological events that are not the formation of the mineral itself. For instance, the heterogenites could have inherited the U-Pb signature of a U-rich mineral, most likely uraninite, formed and/or yet reworked at similar to 876 Ma, similar to 823 Ma and in the similar to 720 to similar to 670 Ma time interval and spatially associated with primary Co-sulfides. In this hypothesis, the ages obtained in this paper are significant for understanding the cycling and re-deposition of U at given moments in the regional geological history. In such context, the similar to 876 Ma and the similar to 823 Ma age are consistent with syn-early diagenetic concentration of uranium in sediments of the Katanga basin. The similar to 720 to similar to 670 Ma ages are interpreted as a phase of U remobilization related to hydrothermal fluid circulation induced by late Nguba proto-oceanic rifting or by early stages of Congo-Kalahari craton convergence, and associated hydrothermal circulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of malachite and <b>heterogenite</b> was investigated {{during the process}} water recycling in flotation of copper-cobalt oxide ores from the deposit of Luiswishi located in Haut-Katanga province (DRC). A synthetic mill wastewater (SMWW) was utilized as feed water alone and in mixture with water recovered from the flotation tails in view to achieve at the laboratory scale the locked-cycle recycling of the industrial mill wastewater (IMWW). To simulate the chemical species presence in the pulp and their effects on the flotation of malachite and <b>heterogenite,</b> calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate ions {{were added to the}} feed water and the recoveries of copper and cobalt followed during the roughing flotation stage. The concentrate XRD and SEM analysis together with the floated minerals microanalyses by EDX spectroscopy, leaching tests of mono-minerals followed by the Pourbaix diagrams construction and DRIFT spectroscopy analyses, have enabled identifying changes in the surface properties of malachite and <b>heterogenite</b> interfering on the recovery of copper (40 %) and cobalt (58 %) with a significant drop in their concentrate grades (7. 3 % Cu and 2. 7 % Co). The deterioration of the concentrate characteristics results also from the gangue minerals entrainment. A better description of the valuable minerals behaviour in the SMWW presence could enable designing strategies in view enhancing their floatability during the locked-cycle recycling of water.

Reactions at the interface of solid materials {{have a significant}} role in many fields of study, ranging from environmental science to industrial manufacturing. Identifying and quantifying the reactive surface area of these materials is vital to understanding the reactions in which they participate. The most basic effect of reactive surface area is governing the reaction rate at the surface but, in some cases, it is necessary to have a far more detailed understanding of the surface structure. Many reactions occur most efficiently, or even exclusively, at specific types of surface site. The ability to identify and measure these sites could dramatically improve the design of many applications, such as heterogeneous catalysts or waste remediation systems. One proposed method of measuring reactive surface area is the use of carefully selected probe molecules that are specifically reactive with the surface sites of interest. This work focuses on the development of a method for analyzing the surface characteristics of <b>heterogenite</b> (β-CoOOH) using the ligand iminodiacetic acid (IDA) as a probe. To investigate this system, first a range of model materials were necessary. The method of <b>heterogenite</b> synthesis was explored, revealing that a surprising amount of control can be exerted over the final particle morphology by altering simple factors such as reaction temperature or choice of oxidizing agent. The ligand-assisted dissolution of <b>heterogenite</b> by IDA produces a mixture of sfac and u-fac isomers of Co(IDA) 2 –, and the relative amount of each isomer depends upon the surface characteristics of the <b>heterogenite.</b> When <b>heterogenite</b> particles were aged in suspension at room temperature, a rapid evolution of the number and type of surface site present was observed. This change was tracked by reacting the particles with IDA then separating and quantifying the resulting Co(IDA) 2 – isomers. Through this method, {{it was found that the}} surface evolution occurs more slowly when aged in lower pH buffer. The connection between particle morphology and reactivity was strengthened when a link was found between the height of cylindrical <b>heterogenite</b> plates and the ratio of isomers formed during the dissolution reaction. From this, an empirical relationship between particle height and the relative amount of s-fac isomer was derived. This relationship allowed the tracking of particle growth via dissolution reactions rather than direct measurements. The final connection between morphology and reactivity was discovered when kinetic and thermodynamic studies were undertaken. The rate of reaction when the reactant concentrations are altered suggests that both surface diffusion and product desorption processes are involved in determining the overall reaction rate. Finally, it was hypothesized that the reactivity of some sites varies with temperature. Thus, the ratio of products produced depends not only on the number and type of surface site present, but also on the temperature of the reaction. Additional work is necessary to quantify this temperature dependence...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} cobalt {{mineralization}} present in weathered ultramafic rocks from New Caledonia revealed the follow-ing minerals: <b>heterogenite</b> (2 H and 3 R polytypes), asbo-lan (with cobalt and nickel), lithiophorite, intermediare phases between asbolan and lithiophorite, cryptomelane, ramsdellite and todorokite; only lithiophorite and cryptome-lane {{had previously been}} characterized in New Caledonia. Cryptomelane, ramsdellite and todorokite contain only traces of cobalt. The other minerals, the main cobalt bearers, occur not only as cryptocrystalline aggregates but also as crystals or fibers up to several hundred pm long. They form concretions, but more often occur as pseudo-morphs after silicates and plant roots, which are habits not previously documented for these minerals. Microprobe ana-lyses show that (l) the <b>heterogenite</b> is much more nickelifer-ous (up to 7. 5 t/ 0 NiO) and the lithiophorite, more cobal-tiferous (up to I 1. 5 q 0 Co 2 O 3), than those found elsewhere;(2) the asbolan shows more variable compositions than those described elsewhere, rangrng from purely cobaltifer-ous to purely nickeliferous end-members; and (3) new phases exist with compositions between those of asbolan and lithiophorite.

40|$|Reductive {{leaching}} of cobalt (III) from a <b>heterogenite</b> bearing ore {{has been}} performed. Pyrite {{was added to}} the system and simultaneously bioleached in order to provide ferrous iron as reducing agent. Within such arrangement the iron ions are continuously re-circulated inside a Fe 3 +/ Fe 2 + loop. As a result Co(III) is solubilized in the presence of Fe 2 + ions in concentrations well below the stoichiometric requirement. The ore has been initially subjected to acid pre-leaching in order to guarantee that the available Co (II) has been entirely removed. Two technological parameters have been studied to show influence on the degree of cobalt leaching: concentration of ferric iron in the inoculum and the presence of bacteria. The bacterial role could be mainly viewed in supplying ferric ions in the system which chemically react with the pyrite to generate ferrous ions used as Co(III) reducing agent. Co(III) dissolution has been less efficient when the concentration of total iron in the system was low, but also when microorganisms were absent. SEM observations on leached <b>heterogenite</b> have evidenced bacterial attack on the mineral; however the precise role of bacterial presence on cobalt (III) leaching is still to be elucidated.

40|$|International audienceThe Katanga province, Democratic Republic of Congo, hosts {{world-class}} cobalt deposits {{accounting for}} ~ 50 % {{of the world}} reserves. They originated from sediment-hosted stratiform copper and cobalt sulfide deposits within Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks. <b>Heterogenite,</b> the main oxidized cobalt mineral, is concentrated as "cobalt caps" {{along the top of}} silicified dolomite inselbergs. The supergene cobalt enrichment process is part of a regional process of residual ore formation that also forms world-class "manganese cap" deposits in western Katanga, i. e., the "black earths" that are exploited by both industrial and artisanal mining. Here, we provide constraints on the genesis and the timing of these deposits. Ar­Ar analyses of oxidized Mn ore and in situ U­Pb SIMS measurements of <b>heterogenite</b> yield Mio­Pliocene ages. The Ar­Ar ages suggest a multi-phase process, starting in the Late Miocene (10 ­ 5 Ma), when the metal-rich substratum was exposed to the action of meteoric fluids, due to major regional uplift. Further oxidation took place in the Pliocene (3. 7 ­ 2. 3 Ma) and formed most of the observed deposits under humid conditions: Co- and Mn-caps on metal-rich substrata, and coeval Fe laterites on barren areas. These deposits formed prior to the regional shift toward more arid conditions in Central Africa. Arid conditions still prevailed during the Quaternary and resulted in erosion and valley incision, which dismantled the metal-bearing caps and led to ore accumulation in valleys and along foot slopes...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{flotation}} {{tests with}} copper–cobalt oxidized ore from the Luiswishi deposit in the Katanga province were done using process water being recycled to different degrees. Grade and recovery of copper and cobalt {{were followed by}} 10, 20 and 80 % process to fresh water addition with the results from these conditions being compared to those without water recycling. When process water was recycled at 10 %, 83. 7 % copper and 84. 1 % cobalt were recovered at the rougher stage bringing the cleaner stage to a concentrate with recovery of 53 and 60 % for copper and cobalt, respectively. However, recycling process water, up to 20 and 80 %, has reduced the recovery of copper in the final concentrate to 23 and 6 %, respectively, and of cobalt to 46 and 27 %, respectively. Monitoring of dissolved oxygen content, pulp pH and Es potential during flotation, coupled with thermodynamic estimation of the predominant chemical compounds in the system, has enabled to evaluate the effects on flotation from the undesirable compounds’ formation during process water recycling. DRIFT spectroscopy was used to identify {{the nature of the}} chemical compounds formed on malachite and <b>heterogenite</b> surface during their sulphidisation in the presence of thiosulphate ions.

40|$|Solubilisation of Co(III) from a <b>heterogenite</b> met in copper cobaltiferous oxide ore {{has been}} {{realized}} through reductive leaching using ferrous iron generated via bio-oxidation of pyrite. Biotic and abiotic experiments at various pulp densities and redox potentials {{have been performed}} and results compared. Cobalt leaching at elevated redox potential is possible, offering cost reduction benefits due to reduced consumption of ferrous iron. At elevated potential of 625 mV, however, the initial rate of cobalt leaching has been found as 115 mg/(g ore) ⋅(24 h), lower than the rate of 865 mg/(g ore) ⋅(24 h) registered at 505 mV. Less stochiometric amount of ferrous iron was required when cobalt leaching was coupled to pyrite bioleaching, with 75 % of cobalt recovered for 12 h at the optimally found conditions.

40|$|Formaldehyde oxime, CH 2 =NOH, has for a {{long time}} been {{recognized}} as a sensitive colorimetric reagent for manganese, copper and metals of the iron group. In alkaline medium, the oxime dissociates, forming the CH 2 =NO- anion which bonds to multivalent metals, giving complexes of the general formula M(CH 2 NO) 6 (6 -n) -, where n is the oxidation state of the metal 1, 2. Here I report the results of experiments which show that aqueous formaldehyde oxime constitutes a new and effective leaching agent for several types of ores, such as pyrolusite, malachite, <b>heterogenite</b> and deep-sea manganese nodules. The reagent seems particularly attractive for nodules, as the leaching is rapid, in acid as well as in neutral and or alkaline media, and at ambient and lower temperatures.

40|$|Lab-scale {{flotation}} {{of copper}} and cobalt oxidized ore from the Luiswishi deposit in the Katanga province (DRC) {{has been done}} focusing {{on the influence of}} the degree of process water recycling on metals recovery. Results have shown that at 20 % recycling rate, the recovery of copper and cobalt in the cleaner stage have been respectively reduced to 23 % and 45 % in comparison to 53 % Cu and 63 % Co if process water has not been recycled. At 10 % recycling rate however, the system could still tolerate the effect from recycling, since Cu and Co recovery has remained respectively at acceptable levels of 52 % and 60 %. In order to explain the reasons for the observed worsening of flotation results if process water was recycled at rate higher than 20 %, electrochemical investigation of the pulp has been performed. It has been established that the chemical compounds formed in the pulp when process water was recycled, do influence the sulfidization of malachite and <b>heterogenite</b> and impact further collector adsorption. To confirm these assumptions, the effect from thiosulphate ions presence during the sulfidization of high purity malachite has been studied. It has been found, that thiosulphate ions depending on their concentration in water induce variations in pulp properties such as DO content, pH, Es and contribute to formation of undesirable chemical compounds on mineral surface as identified by DRIFT spectroscopy.

40|$|M. Tech. Recent {{studies have}} {{explored}} {{the capabilities of}} sulphur dioxide (SO 2), a reducing agent that shows great potential to enhance the leaching efficiency of cobalt from mixed Co-Cu oxidized ores. The research study reported in this dissertation was conducted to further explore the efficacy of SO 2 as a suitable reagent to improve the cobalt yield in solution from mixed Co-Cu oxidised ores. Four mixed Co-Cu oxidised ores were used in this study; namely, high cobalt ore (34 % Co), low cobalt ore with mica (4 % Co), low cobalt ore without mica (3 % Co) and high copper ore (0. 5 % Co). The mechanistic leaching pathways of cobalt from these ores with and without SO 2 were investigated and monitored using Ultra-Violet/Visible spectroscopy. Mineralogical studies of these ores {{was carried out by}} X - ray diffraction (XRD), X - ray fluorescence (XRF) and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Microwave processing of these ores prior to leaching experiments was also investigated. The experimental work was carried out on a laboratory scale and highlights of results obtained are summarized as follows:  Although not much information pertaining to Co 2 + bearing minerals in mixed Co-Cu oxidised ores was derived from XRD results, two forms of <b>heterogenite</b> minerals (CoOOH- 2 H and CoOOH- 3 R), which bear cobalt as Co 3 + were noted in the low cobalt ores.  High percentage cobalt dissolutions (85 % to 95 %) were achieved when leaching mixed Co-Cu oxidised ores in the presence of SO 2.  UV/Visible spectroscopy confirmed concentrations of Co 3 + and Co 2 + before and after SO 2 treatment of mixed Co-Cu oxidised ores.  Percentage cobalt dissolutions improved by 10 % to 20 % in microwave irradiated mixed Co-Cu oxidised ores  The presence of iron and copper in leach solutions can limit the dissolution of cobalt from mixed Co-Cu oxidised ores to a certain extent...|$|E

The exploration licence was granted by the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to First Quantum Minerals Ltd through its Congolese subsidiary Compagnie Minière de Sakania Sprl (CoMiSa Sprl) under certificate N˚ CAMI/CR/ 70 / 2003 on the 10 th of October 2003 for a period of 5 years with a possibility of renewal for 3 years in respect to the new Congolese mining code. The PR 851 area lies on fragments of Mines Subgroup rocks of the Roan Group in the Congolese Copperbelt where most of the Cu-Co and stratiform-stratabound deposits such as Kipushi, Ruashi-Etoile, Kinsevere, Kipoi, Luishya, Luswishi, Shituru, Kamoya, Kambove, Tenke- Fungurume, Shinkolobwe, Swambo, Mindingi and Kamoto among others are found. During the 20 th century, the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (U. M. H. K.) undertook mineral exploration in the Congolese Copperbelt and numerous copper- and cobalt-occurrences were identified (for instance Kibamba copper occurrence in PR 851 area). From 2003, the Compagnie Minière de Sakania Sprl initiated a grassroots exploration program in PR 851 area and geochemical exploration survey as one of the mineral exploration tools was implemented to aim at detecting copper and cobalt concentration in soil. The B horizon of the thick tropical soil in the area was sampled and soil samples were sent to Genalysis laboratories in Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa for main chemical analysis of Cu and Co only, whereas 10 % of analyzed samples were dispatched to Perth, Western Australia for quality control analysis. Thresholds for anomalies of copper and cobalt were defined by literature comparison, standard deviations and spatial analysis. The anomalies were tested at a later stage by reverse circulation / diamond drilling during the year of 2005 to 2008 and the Cu-Co resources were estimated by Digital Mining Services of Harare, Zimbabwe in the year of 2008. Geological logging of chips from reverse circulation and diamond drill cores revealed that copper mineralization is represented by malachite, chrysocolla, chalcopyrite and bornite whereas cobalt mineralization appeared in form of <b>heterogenite.</b> The source of supergene mineralization remains unknown. Recommendations have been made to undertake more geological exploration work in order to fully investigate the geological setting and structural architecture of the region, which may result in {{a better understanding of the}} Cu-Co mineralization system and ore genesis. The latter has been no consensus up-to-date and different theories have been proposed to discuss the ore genesis, including syn- and dia- genetic, synorogenic and sulphide remobilization to late-to-post- orogenic Cu-Zn-Pb Kipushi-type deposit.

40|$|Delmulle Delmulle Architects for Architects in Residence, Programme Estonia Assemblage. In 1900 only 13 % of the world's {{population}} {{lived in}} cities. Today 54 %. It {{is expected that}} in 2050 up to 80 % of the population will live in cities. It is important {{to think about how}} we can organize our cities and societies to keep them habitable today and in the future. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fresh architectural and urban strategies. Deleuze and Guattari defined a way for handling this phenomenon of a new, dense and internationalised world: “agencement”. Gilles Deleuze was a French philosopher, in English the word doesn’t really exist. It must be something like “arrangement”. Agencement means collecting a huge amount of information and ideas from different cultures, and assembling it in different combinations, resulting in a totally new appreciation of architecture and urban design. The task of an architect is listening, seeing, observing, registering. To estimate the physical and human context of a site and/or city. Bringing together seemingly not reconcilable elements in a narrow frame called “design”. Design as an interface between creators and users. The architect as a crafty moderator. Developing plans which are syncretic assemblies of social and cultural networks, mobility, communications, education, health, work, relaxation. Without segregation between zoning, use, age, gender, race, ancestry, religion or language. We want to develop multifunctional, autarchic projects that have the smallest possible footprint, both physical and environmental. No monofunctional spectacular architecture but fundamental, inspirational living environments, architectural concepts and strategies that allow people to live with dignity and in community. Projects with “gestalt”, a whole which is {{more than the sum of}} its parts, to make its urban environment habitable and liveable. "Architecture is the ability to work simultaneously with inseparable forces: affect (more than just feeling, overwhelm, experience), perfect (sensations, perceptions), concept (always beyond defined limits). It should be handled simultaneously with basic concepts: connexion (relation, connection), <b>hétérogénité</b> (diversity), multiplicity (multiplicity, plurality); asignifiante rupture (without certainties); cartography (maps, plans, routes), décalcomani (disharmonious without structure) ” (Mille plateaux, Deleuze & Guattari, 1980) Besides handling the physical and human context, our challenge is evidently modelling physical and noticeable qualitative space. To rationalise, research and evaluate (our) ‘spaces’ we defined 33 criteria (ingredients) assisting us for making fascinating architecture, a basis for a stimulating approach. From a holistic research via a pragmatic academic terminology, we aim to evolve to an architecture and urban planning that optimizes the available space and sublimates the physical and human context.

40|$|The {{sediment-hosted}} stratiform Cu-Co mineralization of the Luiswishi and Kamoto {{deposits in}} the Katangan Copperbelt is {{hosted by the}} Neoproterozoic Mines Subgroup. Two main hypogene Cu-Co sulfide mineralization stages and associated gangue minerals (dolomite and quartz) are distinguished. The first is an early diagenetic, typical stratiform mineralization with fine-grained minerals, whereas the second is a multistage syn-orogenic stratiform to stratabound mineralization with coarse-grained minerals. For both stages, the main hypogene Cu-Co sulfide minerals are chalcopyrite, bornite, carrollite, and chalcocite. These minerals are in many places replaced by supergene sulfides (e. g., digenite and covellite), especially near the surface, and are completely oxidized in the weathered superficial zone and in surface outcrops, with malachite, <b>heterogenite,</b> chrysocolla, and azurite as the main oxidation products. The hypogene sulfides of the first Cu-Co stage display delta S- 34 values (- 10. 3 aEuro degrees to + 3. 1 aEuro degrees Vienna Canyon Diablo Troilite (V-CDT)), which partly overlap with the delta S- 34 signature of framboidal pyrites (- 28. 7 aEuro degrees to 4. 2 aEuro degrees V-CDT) and have a dagger S- 34 (SO 4 -Sulfides) {{in the range of}} 14. 4 aEuro degrees to 27. 8 aEuro degrees. This fractionation is consistent with bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). The hypogene sulfides of the second Cu-Co stage display delta S- 34 signatures that are either similar (- 13. 1 aEuro degrees to + 5. 2 aEuro degrees V-CDT) to the delta S- 34 values of the sulfides of the first Cu-Co stage or comparable (+ 18. 6 aEuro degrees to + 21. 0 aEuro degrees V-CDT) to the delta S- 34 of Neoproterozoic seawater. This indicates that the sulfides of the second stage obtained their sulfur by both remobilization from early diagenetic sulfides and from thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR). The carbon (- 9. 9 aEuro degrees to - 1. 4 aEuro degrees Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB)) and oxygen (- 14. 3 aEuro degrees to - 7. 7 aEuro degrees V-PDB) isotope signatures of dolomites associated with the first Cu-Co stage are in agreement with the interpretation that these dolomites are by-products of BSR. The carbon (- 8. 6 aEuro degrees to + 0. 3 aEuro degrees V-PDB) and oxygen (- 24. 0 aEuro degrees to - 10. 3 aEuro degrees V-PDB) isotope signatures of dolomites associated with the second Cu-Co stage are mostly similar to the delta C- 13 (- 7. 1 aEuro degrees to + 1. 3 aEuro degrees V-PDB) and delta O- 18 (- 14. 5 aEuro degrees to - 7. 2 aEuro degrees V-PDB) of the host rock and of the dolomites of the first Cu-Co stage. This indicates that the dolomites of the second Cu-Co stage precipitated from a high-temperature, host rock-buffered fluid, possibly under the influence of TSR. The dolomites associated with the first Cu-Co stage are characterized by significantly radiogenic Sr isotope signatures (0. 70987 to 0. 73576) that show a good correspondence with the Sr isotope signatures of the granitic basement rocks at an age of ca. 816 Ma. This indicates that the mineralizing fluid of the first Cu-Co stage has most likely leached radiogenic Sr and Cu-Co metals by interaction with the underlying basement rocks and/or with arenitic sedimentary rocks derived from such a basement. In contrast, the Sr isotope signatures (0. 70883 to 0. 71215) of the dolomites associated with the second stage show a good correspondence with the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios (0. 70723 to 0. 70927) of poorly mineralized/barren host rocks at ca. 590 Ma. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The metal cobalt is {{essential}} in creating a sustainable society, as {{it is an important}} component in lithium- ion batteries and wind energy turbines. About half of the Earth’s land-based cobalt reserves {{can be found in the}} Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This study focusses on characterising cobalt-bearing copper ore from a DRC based mining operation and linking characteristic ore properties to the comminution behaviour. Portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) is used to determine the geochemistry, while QEMSCAN, CT scan and InfraRed (IR) spectroscopy are used to assess mineralogy on different length scales. In terms of geotechnical properties, the surface hardness of the ore is determined using a rebound hardness tester. The comminution behaviour is assessed by crushing selected ore samples below 3. 35 mm and by grinding the crushed samples for 21 minutes using a ball mill. The energy consumption required for different ore types is quantified using the crushing and sieving simulation package Bruno. The chemical characterisation of ore samples showed significant variation in cobalt content, as the cobalt grade measured in the samples using pXRF varied from 0 % to 33. 5 %. By applying QEMSCAN analysis to samples coming from different locations within the deposit, two different mineralogical zones have been identified: a weathered, and a sulphide zone, with large differences in modal mineralogy. In the weathered zone kolwezite and <b>heterogenite</b> are the principal cobalt bearing minerals, in the sulphide zone carrollite is the only mineral containing cobalt. The CT scan confirmed the unique mineralogy of certain samples, as the mineralogy of pure carrollite nodules found using QEMSCAN showed to continue in 3 D. Both QEMSCAN and CT scan were able to detect differences in mineral texture of the studied samples. In terms of geotechnical properties, differences between surface hardness of the samples were observed using the rebound hardness tester. An empirical formula has been derived to adjust the measured surface hardness of drill core samples with a mass below 300 grams. This formula aided in identifying the differences in surface hardness for the distinct mineral textures of the sulphide zone. Influence of mineralogy on the sur- face hardness has been observed, as areas containing only carrollite showed to have a lower surface hardness than areas with a mixture of Mg silicates, quartz and carrollite. Fourier Transformed IR (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to identify a range of gangue minerals within the samples. Carrollite could be identified if it was present in significant proportions and no other IR active minerals were present. FTIR spectroscopy also allowed to refine mineralogical data, as it was possible to differentiate between talc or serpentine and muscovite or illite in the studied samples, which was not possible using QEMSCAN. In total 8 minerals were identified using IR spectroscopy. The relative proportions of the modal mineralogy showed to be in agreement with the mineralogy found through QEMSCAN. The comminution experiments led to the identification of three different comminution classes. These three classes can again be linked to the identified mineral texture types. The surface hardness showed to be correlated to the p 80 of samples with the same mineral texture. After 21 minutes of milling, the samples with a higher surface hardness had a coarser p 80. Simulation showed that the crushing energy requirements differ up to a maximum of 27 % for different comminution classes. This research provides a foundation towards identification of geometallurgical domains in the sulphide section of the investigated cobalt-bearing copper deposit. This MSc thesis was carried out at Camborne School of Mines (University of Exeter) as part of the NERC funded Cobalt: Geology, Geomicrobiology and Geometallurgy (CoG 3) project. <br/...|$|E
