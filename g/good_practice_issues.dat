30|$|The {{quest for}} good {{practices}} {{is an ongoing}} process of which the IPCC Assessment Reports, e.g., IPCC (2001 a; 2001 b) or IPCC (2007) have been exhibiting a growing degree of awareness. Carter et al. (2007) comprehensively deals with overall quality and <b>good</b> <b>practice</b> <b>issues</b> with respect to vulnerability and adaptation assessments. En route to the IPCC’s 5 th Report an Expert Meeting on Assessing and Combining Multi Model Climate Projections took place in Boulder, CO, in January 2010 (Stocker et al. (Eds), 2010 b) where the Good Practice Guidance Paper (Knutti et al., 2010) was consolidated. It provides a treatment of numerous relevant issues including sets of recommendations for (i) ensembles, (ii) model evaluation, (iii) model selection, averaging and weighting, (iv) reproducibility and (v) regional assessments. Of particular importance when building ensembles which aim at the description of regional climate change is the correction of biases which occur in the individual participating models (see, i.e., Christensen et al. (2008)).|$|E
40|$|Metadata {{has long}} been {{understood}} as a fundamental component of any Spatial Data Infrastructure, providing information relating to discovery, evaluation and use of datasets and describing their quality. Having good metadata about a dataset is fundamental to using it correctly and to understanding the implications of issues such as missing data or incorrect attribution on the results obtained for any analysis carried out. Traditionally, spatial data was created by expert users (e. g. national mapping agencies), who created metadata for the data. Increasingly, however, data used in spatial analysis comes from multiple sources and could be captured or used by nonexpert users – for example academic researchers ‐ {{many of whom are}} from non‐GIS disciplinary backgrounds, not familiar with metadata and perhaps working in geographically dispersed teams. This paper examines the applicability of metadata in this academic context, using a multi‐national coastal/environmental project as a case study.

40|$|Most {{people who}} die in {{hospital}} {{do so with}} a DNACPR order in place, these orders {{are the focus of}} considerable debate. Aim: To identify factors, facilitators and barriers involved in DNACPR decision-making and implementation. Methods: All study designs and interventions were eligible for inclusion. Studies were appraised guided by CASP tools. A qualitative analysis was undertaken. Data sources: Included electronic databases: Medline, Embase, ASSIA, Cochrane library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, the King’s Fund Library and scanning reference lists of included studies. Results: Four key themes were identified: Considering the decision – by senior physicians, nursing staff, patients and relatives. Key triggers included older age, co-morbidities, adverse prognostic factors, quality of life and the likelihood of success of CPR. Discussing the decision – levels, and combinations, of physician and nursing skills, patient understanding and family involvement produced various outcomes. Implementing the decision – the lack of clear documentation resulted in a breakdown in communications within health teams. Staff knowledge and support of guidelines and local policies varied. Consequences of a DNACPR decision – inadequate understanding by staff resulted in suboptimal care, and incorrect withdrawal of treatment. Conclusion: Significant variability was identified in DNACPR decision-making and implementation. The evidence base is weak but the absence of evidence does not indicate an absence of <b>good</b> <b>practice.</b> <b>Issues</b> are complex, and dependent on a number of factors. Misunderstandings and poor discussions can be overcome such as with an overall care plan to facilitate discussions and reduce negative impact of DNACPR orders on aspects of patient care. ce...|$|E

Materials and methodsLiterature studies, opinion polls and discussions among consortium members and stakeholders. ResultsBy January 2012, through 3 years of team building, the GP-TCM consortium had grown into a large collaborative network involving ∼ 200 scientists from 24 countries and 107 institutions. Consortium members had worked closely to address <b>good</b> <b>practice</b> <b>issues</b> related to various aspects of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and acupuncture research, the focus of this Journal of Ethnopharmacology special issue, leading to state-of-the-art reports, guidelines and consensus on the application of omics technologies in TCM research. In addition, through an online survey open to GP-TCM members and non-members, we polled opinions on grand priorities, challenges and opportunities in TCM research. Based on the poll, although consortium members and non-members had diverse opinions on the major challenges in the field, both groups agreed that high-quality efficacy/effectiveness and mechanistic studies are grand priorities and that the TCM legacy in general and its management of chronic diseases in particular represent grand opportunities. Consortium members cast their votes of confidence in omics and systems biology approaches to TCM research and believed that quality and pharmacovigilance of TCM products are not only grand priorities, but also grand challenges.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} and quantifies {{a potential}} error associated with using information {{on sales of}} chemical and equipment to estimate {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} from longlived, pressurized equipment, such as air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment, fire suppression equipment, and SF 6 -containing electrical equipment. In the <b>Good</b> <b>Practice</b> Guidance <b>issued</b> by the IPCC (Reference 1), the sales-based, or mass-balance, method is recommended as a relatively accurate method for estimating emissions from these types of equipment. Indeed, as will be shown, the sales-based method yields a very good estimate of emissions when equipment stocks are growing (or declining) at a steady pace. However, the sales-based approach should be applied carefully when equipment stocks are growing or declining very rapidly. This is because many types of equipment may leak for more than one year before they must be refilled with gas, and therefore demand for new gas lags actual emissions. The error resulting from this lag is most pronounced during the first few years after a chemical is introduced into the equipment, when much of the equipment has leaked, but none (or very little) has required refilling. In general, the error decreases as more equipment containing the new chemical is introduced into the field, finally reaching a constant, low level when the equipment containing the new chemical begins to retire...|$|R
40|$|The Government’s Foresight obesity {{report and}} other key {{documents}} have identified the built environment as having {{a significant impact on}} public health. The RTPI too is identifying this as an important area for planners and launched <b>Good</b> <b>Practice</b> note 5 : Delivering Healthy Communities’ in 2009. The ability and willingness of the population to be active and reduce the risks of diseases such as obesity and heart disease through using walking and cycling as regular means of travel is determined by availability of suitable connections and environments. Mental health and social inclusion are also affected by our surroundings through the ease of social interaction and availability and attraction of congenial places. Built environment practitioners thus are essential in promoting and securing healthy communities through planning and design of urban areas, their green spaces and connectivity. Education institutions training the planners, architects, landscape and transport professionals of the future need to make these professionals ‘health aware’. The ‘Education Network for Healthier Settlements’ project has been initially funded by the Department of Health to bring together higher education institutions making the essential connections between health and the built environment for their students. The network is preparing case studies of best practice in education and drawing out key issues and priorities in teaching. It is also helping to make the links between research and policy and fast-tracking these into the classroom. Core members are collating evidence into usable and searchable web-based resources and helping to make relevant material more easily available to a wider teaching audience, with a London conference further developing materials, sharing experiences and expanding the network.
