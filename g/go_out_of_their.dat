5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It {{does not make}} any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when {{they are more likely to}} step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E

25|$|Combining open {{defecation}} {{with other}} activities: Some people walk {{early in the}} morning to look after their farms. Some consider it as a social activity, especially women who like to take some time to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> homes. While {{on their way to the}} fields for open defecation they can talk to other women and take care of their animals.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts {{have arisen}} in the United States on federally-designated beaches, which are {{nevertheless}} patrolled by local police, {{since there is}} no federal law against nudity in these areas, but there may well be local ones. Skinny-dippers generally deal with this by keeping an eye out for local patrols, who generally do not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to find violators, {{as long as it is}} not flagrant.|$|E

25|$|For reasons unknown, {{mountain}} gorillas {{that have}} been studied appear to be naturally afraid of certain reptiles. Infants, whose natural behavior is to chase anything that moves, will <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to avoid chameleons and caterpillars. They are also afraid of water and will cross streams only {{if they can do}} so without getting wet, such as by crossing over fallen logs. Dian Fossey observed and noted the mountain gorilla's obvious dislike of rain, as well.|$|E
25|$|The Shiba is a {{relatively}} fastidious breed and feels {{the need to maintain}} itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much like a cat. They generally <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to keep their coats clean. Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to housebreak and in many cases will housebreak themselves. Having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the Shiba the appropriate method of toileting.|$|E
25|$|Polistes {{species are}} known to use stings and venom {{as a means of}} colony defense. However, this venom seems to be costly to produce as they only release it after the sting in certain situations. Dangerous stimuli must first be {{perceived}} before they <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way, leaving a nest unattended, to attack. In some situations, P. gallicus ise known to exhibit aggressive behavior to wasps of a foreign colony. While venom from a basic standpoint is used by solitary species to capture prey, it has served a greater purpose of defense in social colonies against colony vertebrate and invertebrate offenders.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{research}} has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group. In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members. Other {{research has}} also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially willing to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees {{were more likely to report}} having “blown the whistle” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found that students who were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.|$|E
25|$|When two of Liza's female {{teachers}} (who live together) go {{on vacation}} during spring break, she volunteers {{for the job of}} taking care of their home and feeding their cats. The two girls stay at the house together, but in an unexpected turn of events a Foster Academy administrator discovers Liza and Annie together. Liza is forced to tell her family about her relationship with Annie, and the headmistress of her school organizes a meeting of the school's board of trustees in order to expel Liza. The board rules in favor of Liza staying at Foster, and she is allowed to keep her position as student president. However, the two teachers, who in the process are discovered to be gay, are fired. After their initial shock at discovering the girls together, the teachers are very supportive and <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to reassure Liza not to worry about their dismissal, but a few ignorantly insensitive responses end up pushing Liza to leave Annie.|$|E

500|$|Hummus is a {{cornerstone}} of Israeli cuisine, and consumption in Israel has been compared by food critic Elena Ferretti to [...] "peanut butter in America, Nutella in Europe or Vegemite in Australia".

500|$|Tony {{left the}} soap on 12 December 2008, after his true nature was exposed. It was {{announced}} on 7 September 2009 {{that he would}} return to EastEnders to be put on trial. Coghill was pleased to return, believing it right that Tony's story arc should conclude realistically, giving closure to the storyline and continuing to raise awareness of the issue. Santer commented: [...] "One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years. Chris agreeing to come back for these episodes will enable us to continue showing the long-term consequences of Tony's abuse of Whitney and – I hope – continue to do justice to the issue of child sex abuse." [...] Grounds praised Tony's trial, stating that it demonstrated the importance for children of having their abusers brought to justice. Palmer felt that: [...] "If one person out there who's been abused saw that [...] <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. But I hope by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw [...] <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Bianculli, {{writing in}} the New York Daily News, stated {{that the idea of}} putting Monk in New York [...] "sound great" [...] on paper but it did not take {{advantage}} of what could be [...] "a delightful study in contrasts." [...] Bianculli called it a [...] "misstep", criticizing its premise and how it was not able to keep the balance between comedy and drama that made it [...] "too outrageous." [...] A review for The Beaver County Times considered it a [...] "stunt episode" [...] and its humor [...] "uncharacteristically forced", saying it [...] "really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms." [...] Steve Johnson of Chicago Tribune affirmed that while the premise is funny, [...] "the writers <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to play the city against his condition." [...] He continued by saying it [...] "wouldn't be so bad" [...] if he went to solve crimes [...] "but Friday's first case is a real stretch." [...] Although excited for the episode's premise prior its broadcast, Austin Smith of the New York Post was very critical of it. Smith said in this episode [...] "the producers have him [...] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming our hero into a full-blown mental patient." [...] He also criticized the [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York" [...] scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions [...] "caricature". Stasi wrote, [...] "It's one thing to be an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain." [...] As Smith, Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the jokes [...] "predictable" [...] and said [...] "If you aren't a Monk fan, these devices may strike you as altogether shopworn." ...|$|E
