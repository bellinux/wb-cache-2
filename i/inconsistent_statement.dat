25|$|Prior {{inconsistent}} statements: Many {{states have}} {{departed from the}} approach of the federal rules with respect to inconsistent statements. Under current law in these jurisdictions, a prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> made by a witness (even when not made under oath at a judicial proceeding or deposition) is admissible as substantive evidence provided the declarant signed the statement.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{found in}} Harris v. New York, , that a {{confession}} obtained {{in violation of}} the Miranda standards may nonetheless be used for purposes of impeaching the defendant's testimony: that is, if the defendant takes the stand at trial and the prosecution wishes to introduce the defendant's confession as a prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> to attack the defendant's credibility, the Miranda holding will not prohibit this.|$|E
50|$|The cross-examining {{attorney}} {{need not}} disclose or show {{the contents of}} a prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> to a witness prior to the moment he is questioned. If the witness's attorney asks to see the prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement,</b> however, the questioning attorney must show or disclose its contents.|$|E
50|$|The {{witness is}} induced to {{contradict}} the own testimony during the present proceeding. That differs from <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> above. <b>Inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> involve statements made out-of-court (hearsay) or in prior proceedings. Contradiction involves the witness saying two different things in the same testimony.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{judicial}} activity {{in the field of}} prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> in Singapore. This discussion identifies two major themes in judicial attempts {{to make sense of the}} major amendments of 1976 which made prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> substantively admissible - the need to draw the line between legitimate statutory interpretation and judicial legislation, and the need to respond adequately to the reality that the use of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> (together with other like developments) has shifted the criminal process in Singapore far beyond the traditional adversarial system which was inherited from the English common law...|$|R

50|$|R v B (KG), 1993 1 S.C.R. 740, {{popularly known}} as the KGB case, is a leading Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} on the admissibility of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> as proof of the truth of their contents. Prior to this case, prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> made by a witness other than an accused could merely be used to impeach the witness's credibility, not for substantive purposes. Here, the Court held that if the statements could be found to be both necessary and reliable then the statements could be admitted as {{an exception to the}} hearsay rule.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} part {{one of a}} two-part series on prior {{statements}} in Montana. In part one, the article explores Montana 2 ̆ 7 s approach to prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> under M. R. E. 801. The article states that prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> are clearly admissible in Montana state court trials. Once a witness has testified on the stand, anything else said on the same subject, anywhere, any time, to anyone, which outright contradicts trial testimony, or serves to fill a memory lapse on the stand, is admissible [...] not just for impeachment, but also to prove the fact earlier asserted...|$|R
50|$|A {{party may}} impeach a witness by {{introducing}} {{those of his}} prior statements that are inconsistent with his current testimony at trial.

50|$|However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801 and the {{minority}} of U.S. jurisdictions that have adopted this rule, a prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> may be introduced {{as evidence of}} the truth of the statement itself if the prior statement was given in live testimony and under oath as part of a formal hearing, proceeding, trial, or deposition.|$|E

5000|$|If the {{opponent}} {{shows that the}} witness made a prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> and implies that after that statement and prior to trial the witness was [...] "gotten to" [...] or otherwise developed a motive to lie in court, rehabilitation can be attempted by showing that the witness made a prior consistent statement (consistent with the testimony) before the alleged events {{that gave rise to}} the alleged motive to lie. The jury is left with two pretrial statements that are inconsistent with each other, but only one is inconsistent with the testimony, and both were made before the witness was allegedly gotten to. Thus, there might be softening of the accusation that the testimony flows from such as a bribe. Also, there is always a case for allowing a prior consistent statement made at any time before trial to help explain away what is arguably only a seemingly <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> that is subject to interpretation, such as if it was lifted out of the context that would explain the statement.|$|E
50|$|Prior {{consistent}} {{statements and}} prior inconsistent statements, {{in the law}} of evidence, occur where a witness, testifying at trial, makes a statement that is either consistent or inconsistent, respectively, with a previous statement given at an earlier time such as during a discovery, interview, or interrogation. The examiner can impeach the witness when an <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> is found, and may conversely bolster the credibility of an impeached witness with a prior consistent statement.|$|E
40|$|How well do hearsay rules {{function}} {{under the}} current Federal Rules of Evidence? One issue, dormant yet pulsating beneath the surface for decades, involves the admissibility of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> by witnesses. The long-standing “orthodox” rule admitted the prior statement only to impeach the witness’s trial testimony; {{it could not be}} used as substantive evidence of the facts asserted. In 1972, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence (“the Advisory Committee” or “the Committee”) proposed an innovative rule permitting all prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> to be used both for impeachment and as substantive evidence—a sea change in practice. Congress, however, torpedoed the proposal for reasons that rang hollow in the mid- 1970 s and which remain so today. Experience has proven the Committee’s wisdom...|$|R

K.G.B. was acquitted and the decision was upheld on appeal.|$|R
40|$|The {{common law}} {{has come a}} long way since Sir Walter Raleigh was convicted of treason on the basis of accusations {{contained}} in unproduced letters and the hearsay declarations of unproduced witnesses. However, despite the painstaking development and innumerable formulations and reformulations of the hearsay rule over the past several centuries, there are areas of that body of law which are as yet unsettled and the subject of heated controversy. One such area is that of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> of witnesses, the controversy over which has continued over the years and has surfaced once again with promulgation of the new Federal Rules of Evidence. Legal theories, like social and cultural philosophies, often follow marked trends and patterns. A few years ago exclusionary rules were on the ascendancy, especially in the area of criminal law, while today it is increased admissibility which is in vogue. Both had their advocates throughout common law history, and will probably always find support. It is a reflection of this current trend that the traditional rules governing substantive use of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements,</b> once unquestioningly accepted, have since been roundly criticized by authorities from Wigmore to the Supreme Court. The purpose of this article is to attempt to redress the balance just slightly, by setting out some of the counterarguments which lie behind the traditional substantive exclusion of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements.</b> An attempt will be made to emphasize practical, rather than merely theoretical, considerations...|$|R
5000|$|Impeachment of {{the credit}} of ones own witness is dealt with in section 190(2), and in R v Loofer and S v Muhiaba. Proof of a {{previous}} <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> does not make that statement evidence against the accused. Other points of the witnesss evidence {{not covered by the}} deviation may still be accepted by the court. The fact that a witness has lied on one point does not prevent the court from accepting his evidence on another point.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, {{the term}} 'unfavourable witness' {{is defined by}} section 38 of the Evidence Act which permits the {{prosecution}} to cross-examine their own witness. For example, if the prosecution calls all material witnesses relevant to a case before the court, and any evidence given is not favourable to, or supports the prosecution case, or a witness has given a prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement,</b> then the prosecution may seek leave of the court, via section 192, to test the witness {{in relation to their}} evidence.|$|E
