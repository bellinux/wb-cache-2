5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, <b>hard</b> <b>rubber,</b> metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. <b>Hard</b> <b>rubber,</b> such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of <b>hard</b> <b>rubber.</b> Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> {{or plastic}} cover which fits over {{the base of}} a diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E
25|$|Uncured rubber is {{used for}} cements; for adhesive, insulating, and {{friction}} tapes; and for crepe rubber used in insulating blankets and footwear. Vulcanized rubber has many more applications. Resistance to abrasion makes softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor belts, and makes <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> valuable for pump housings and piping used in the handling of abrasive sludge.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the rubber duck {{is linked to the}} {{emergence}} of rubber manufacturing in the late 19th century.

5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, <b>hard</b> <b>rubbers,</b> wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|R

These instruments would otherwise be carried somewhere else such as strapped to the wrist or forearm or in a pocket and are only regulator accessories for convenience of transport and access, and {{at greater risk of}} damage during handling.|$|E
25|$|While still {{closely related}} to the German nine-pin game Kegeln, the modern version of ten-pin bowling that became a popular {{participant}} sport worldwide was an American creation. German immigrants were instrumental in fostering the game's popularity in America as they formed their own bowling clubs {{both before and after the}} American Civil War. The first indoor bowling alley was Knickerbockers of New York City, built in 1840. The Brunswick Corporation's addition of bowling equipment to their product line also served to increase the sport's popularity. In 1914, Brunswick replaced their line of wooden bowling balls, mostly made with lignum vitae, with <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> Mineralite bowling balls. The change was met with great approval.|$|E
25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The present work {{describes}} the frictional behaviour of ceramic tiles as flooring materials when soft and <b>hard</b> <b>rubbers</b> slide against them. The values of friction coefficient displayed by sliding of rubber against {{different types of}} flooring materials would be compared to that obtained from ceramic tiles under different sliding conditions: dry, water, water/detergent dilution, oil and water/oil dilution. Based on the experiments {{carried out in the}} present work, it was found that at dry sliding soft rubber slid against ceramic tiles showed higher friction coefficient than hard one. The difference might be attributed to the extra deformation offered by soft rubber. The same trend was observed when sliding against ceramics wetted by water. The difference in friction coefficient displayed by <b>hard</b> and soft <b>rubber</b> significantly increased as the load increased. Soft rubber displayed lowe...|$|R
50|$|Speed glue {{needs to}} be reapplied several times to have an optimal effect. The nature of speed glue is very unpredictable, so several coats are {{needed to make the}} bounce of the paddle more predictable. When {{professionals}} are seen applying speed glue to their paddles before a tournament, they have applied speed glue to it several times before that time. Softer sponge rubbers will gain a larger performance boost from speed glue than <b>harder</b> <b>rubbers.</b> The use of speed glue will, over time, degrade the quality of the rubber so persistent use will mean the rubbers will need to be replaced sooner.|$|R

25|$|A modern beginner's bassoon is {{generally}} made of maple, with medium-hardness types such as sycamore maple and sugar maple preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of {{materials such as}} polypropylene and ebonite, primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons {{were made in the}} past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected {{at the bottom of the}} instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also stained and varnished. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or ivory. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{there is}} no tread pattern, slick tyre tread does not deform much under load. The reduced {{deformation}} allows the tyre to be constructed of softer compounds without excessive overheating and blistering. Modern day slick tyres have now developed particular performance qualities in a specific window of temperatures, becoming [...] "sticky" [...] when accumulating enough heat, and thus give much greater adhesion to the road surface, {{but it also has}} a lower treadwear rating; i.e. it wears out much more quickly than the <b>harder</b> <b>rubber</b> tyres used for driving on the streets.

It would only last one lap however, as Kubica pitted on lap twelve, the final driver to change his first stint super-softs. Out front, Button continued to lead by 4.3 seconds from Vettel with Rosberg third, Barrichello fourth and Nakajima fifth. Lap 16 saw both Vettel and Rosberg pit, with Vettel remaining in second and Rosberg fell to 12th. Rosberg was delayed by a slow left front tyre change, which was a major contribution to his nine-place fall in the race.|$|R

40|$|High Damping Rubber (HDR) {{is used in}} the {{manufacturing}} of elastomeric bearing for seismic isolation of building and structures. In service rubber bearings are subjected to a permanent vertical load which may change at the occurrence of the earthquake, and potential shear deformation induced by the seismic ground motion. This study investigates the response of five commercial elastomeric compounds used in the manufacture of HDRB with shear modulus between 0. 4 MPa and 1. 4 MPa, and equivalent viscous damping between 0. 06 and 0. 16 under combined compression and shear, with compressive stresses ranging from 0 up to 18 MPa. Soft rubbers seem to be more sensitive to the compression load than <b>hard</b> <b>rubbers</b> as far as the damping factor is concerned, whereas the influence of the compression load on the shear modulus seems to be peculiar of every mixture and not apparently related on the hardness, which can explain the inconsistencies found in literature relevant to the studies on full scale rubber bearings...|$|R
50|$|Track or Slick - these {{tires are}} for track days or races. They {{have more of}} a {{triangular}} form, which in turn gives a larger contact patch while leaned over. These tires are not recommended for the street by manufacturers, and are known to have a shorter life on the street. Due to the triangulation of the tire, there will be less contact patch in the center, causing the tire to develop a flat spot quicker when used to ride on straightaways {{for long periods of time}} and have no tread so they lose almost all grip in wet conditions. Racing slicks are also made of a <b>harder</b> <b>rubber</b> compound and do not provide as much traction as street tires until warmed to a higher internal temperature than street tires normally operate at. Most street riding will not put a sufficient amount of friction on the tire to maintain the optimal tire temperature, especially in colder climates and in spring and fall.|$|R
