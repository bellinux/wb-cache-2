5|$|The Courtier-Liberal {{alliance}} held near absolute {{sway over}} Brazilian politics for several years. By 1847, however, PedroII had carefully removed {{members of the}} Courtier Faction from key positions. Aureliano Coutinho's influence was destroyed after the Emperor implicitly banned him <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> in political decision making. The monarch then moved against the Liberals. From 1844 through 1848, the country saw several successive Liberal cabinets, all plagued by internal divisions. PedroII called upon the Party of Order {{to form a new}} cabinet in September 1848.|$|E

BAC modified the specification to solely satisfy Royal Air Force (RAF) needs, reconfiguring the design as the UKVG and sought out new partners to procure the aircraft, which ultimately emerged as the Anglo-German-Italian consortium-funded MRCA (Panavia Tornado), a variable-geometry wing fighter/strike aircraft.|$|E

5|$|To {{art critic}} Robert Hughes, the {{painting}} represents {{the theme of}} family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water. Historian Lizabeth Cohen says that by depicting this freedom as a celebration in the private family home rather than a worker with a job or a government protecting the hungry and homeless, Rockwell suggests that ensuring this freedom was not as much a government responsibility as something born <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> in the mass consumer economy.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
5|$|HSA {{formed an}} {{agreement}} with the German Focke-Wulf aircraft company to collaborate on a joint study that looked into the issue of equipping the P.1150 with two additional lift engines. However, in October 1961, West Germany elected to entirely withdraw <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> in the programme. This was a blow that was directly felt not only by HSA and the development team, but by the British Air Ministry, who had been also seeking to collaborate with its West German counterparts on the matter of VTOL aircraft. Meanwhile, further studies served to confirmed fears that the P.1150 would be too small to meet customer specifications, and thus Camm initiated work on an enlarged derivative design. In conjunction with HSA's redesign, Bristol worked to enlarge the original PCB engine and raised the exhaust heat to increase thrust to 146.8kN (30,000lbf). It could have theoretically reach speeds of up to Mach1.7–2.|$|E

5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E
5|$|The 1943 Alabama Crimson Tide {{football}} team was {{to represent the}} University of Alabama in the 1943 college football season; however, the season was canceled due {{to the effects of}} World War II. In February 1943, the Army instituted a policy that prohibited their cadets <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> in intercollegiate athletics. Unsure if a season would occur, head coach Frank Thomas proceeded through spring practice as if it would be played. By summer, only two Alabama players were available to compete on the squad {{as a result of the}} Army prohibition on its trainees competing in intercollegiate athletics, and on August 23, 1943, the University announced its decision to cancel the 1943 season.

5|$|The P.1154 {{was judged}} to be {{technically}} superior, however, the Mirage acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, which spread work across a number of member nations. Protracting political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection. The P.1154 was ultimately selected to meet NBMR-3, however this {{did not lead to}} orders being placed. The French government subsequently withdrew <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> once the Dassault design had not emerged victorious. NATO lacked any central budget, relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, and the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded by all of these nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole project was terminated.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} between PedroII and Teresa Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience and their first child, Afonso, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina {{gave birth to}} more children: Isabel, in 1846; Leopoldina, in 1847; and lastly, Pedro, in 1848. However, both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor. Beyond suffering as a father, {{his view of the}} Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. PedroII excluded Isabel <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> in government business and decisions.|$|E
5|$|Women in the Middle Ages were officially {{required}} to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed much {{control over their own}} lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted <b>from</b> <b>participation</b> in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests.|$|E
