50|$|Modern nations {{engage in}} a two-step {{procedure}} for <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> treaties. <b>The</b> first step is signing the treaty. Being a signatory to a treaty means that a country intends to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> agreement. The second step is ratifying the treaty. A country that has ratified a treaty has gone beyond merely intending to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> agreement, and is now bound by it. This is a critical distinction, and sometimes a point of confusion. A nation may be a signatory to a treaty for many years without ever having ratified it.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{persistence}} and pathogenicity of pathogenic bacteria {{are dependent on}} the ability of the species to survive in adverse conditions. During the infectious process, the organism may need to pass through certain hostile anatomical sites, such as the stomach. Under various environmental stresses, many bacteria <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, where they are ‘alive’ or metabolically active, but will not grow on conventional media. Escherichia coli bacteria encounter several diverse stress factors during their growth, survival and infection and thus may <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> VBNC state. Objectives: This review discusses various general aspects of the VBNC state, the mechanisms and possible public health impact of indicator and pathogenic E. coli <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> VBNC state. Method: A literature review was conducted to ascertain the possibleimpact of E. coli <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> VBNC state. Results: Escherichia coli <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> VBNC state by means of several induction mechanisms. Various authors have found that E. coli can be resuscitated post-VBNC. Certain strains of pathogenic E. coli are still able to produce toxins in the VBNC state, whilst others are avirulent during the VBNC state but are able to regain virulence after resuscitation. Conclusion : Pathogenic and indicator E. coli <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> VBNC state could have an adverse effect on public health if conventional detection methods are used, where the number of viable cells could be underestimated and the VBNC cells still produce toxins or could, at anytime, be resuscitated and become virulent again. </p...|$|R
