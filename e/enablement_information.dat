40|$|Most {{decisions}} {{involve a}} spatial component, though few people realize its significance. Technology {{is about to}} bring the spatial component to the forefront. A place on earth can be defined with precision {{on the ground and}} in computers. Digital data can be attached to a location as never before. Spatial identification and location enablement applications are now available in every significant type of software (word processing, spread sheets, professional applications, Web systems, GIS and databases). Use of appropriate computers with interpretative software capacity now transforms computer language into understandable descriptions of places, Governments, business and communities can potentially use computers to identify “where ” their policies and activities are happening. More significantly, the “where ” component can be used as an organizing structure for most human activities and information. The challenge of these new technological and organizational opportunities is large. A nation’s ability to reap the benefits of the spatial <b>enablement</b> of <b>information</b> requires the highest level input from its government and private sectors. Land administration systems (LAS) are the traditional means of spatial organisation of information: they are the obvious starting point for assessing new technologies in the context of different demands for land information for modern governments This potential to transform the ability of LAS to inform governments, business and citizens about their world led to the concept of iLand, a concept of spatially enabled information for modern government...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an insight to the drivers, design elements and {{issues associated with}} spatially enabling the management of coastal zones, in particular coastal property rights, restrictions and responsibilities. Coastal zones are encumbered by hundreds of property rights, restrictions, and responsibilities. These are created to manage coastal population increases, climate change, and to deliver good governance. Currently, the interests are managed disparately across and between governments: sustainability requires these interests to be managed in an integrated fashion. Spatial <b>enablement</b> can deliver <b>information</b> integration and minimizes the need for redesigning legal, institutional and administrative frameworks. This is recognized in international, regional, and national coastal forums. Emerging concepts including Marine Cadastres, Marine SDI, Seamless SDIs, and Property Objects will inform the solution, however, this paper suggests further research is required to fully understand the complete legal, administrative and technical arrangements in the coastal zone. Moreover, methods for streamlining the integration of property and non-property information are required, particularly the harmonization vertical datums. Finally, the feasibility of spatially enablement needs to be assessed...|$|R
40|$|The {{vision of}} a {{spatially}} enabled government involves establishing an enabling infrastructure to facilitate use of place or location to organise information about activities of people and businesses, and about government actions, decisions and polices. Once the infrastructure is built, spatial <b>enablement</b> allows government <b>information</b> and services, business transactions and community activities to be linke d to places or locations. Given the potential of new technologies, use of place or location will facilitate the evaluation and analysis of both spatial and non-spatial relationships between people, business transactions and government. Most governments already have considerable infrastructure and administrative systems for better management of land and resources. Basic information creating processes are cadastral surveying that identifies land and running a digital cadastral database (DCDB) providing the spatial integrity and unique land parcel identification, registering land that supports simple land trading (buying, selling, mortgaging and leasing land); running land information systems (LIS); and geographic information systems (GIS) that provide mappin g and resource information. For modern governments at all stages of development, one question is how best to integrate these processes, especially to offer them in an Internet enabled eGovernment environment...|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{facilitation}} (FF), comprising a {{rapid and}} multiple-fold {{increase in the}} magnitude of evoked field potentials, is elicited by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) at mossy fiber [...] CA 3 synapses. Here, we show that in freely behaving rats, FF reliably occurs in response to 1 and 2 Hz but not in response to 0. 25 -, 0. 3 -, or 0. 5 -Hz LFS. Strikingly, prolonged (~ 600 s) FF was tightly correlated to the induction of longterm depression (LTD) in freely moving animals. Although LFS at 2 Hz elicited unstable FF and unstable LTD, application of LFS at 1 Hz elicited pronounced FF, as well as robust LTD that persisted for over 24 h. This correlation of prolonged FF with LTD was absent at stimulation frequencies that did not induce FF. The adenosine-A 1 receptor appears to participate in these effects: Application of adenosine-A 1, but not adenosine-A 3, receptor antagonists enhanced mossy fiber synaptic transmission and occluded FF. Furthermore, adenosine-A 1 receptor antagonism resulted in more stable FF at 1 or 2 Hz and elicited more potent LTD. These data support the fact that FF contributes to the <b>enablement</b> of long-term <b>information</b> storage at mossy fiber [...] CA 3 synapses and that the adenosine-A 1 receptor may regulate the thresholds for this process...|$|R
