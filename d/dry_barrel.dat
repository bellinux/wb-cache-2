Wet barrel hydrant outlets are typically individually controlled, while a single stem operates all the outlets of a <b>dry</b> <b>barrel</b> hydrant simultaneously. Thus, wet barrel hydrants allow single outlets to be opened, requiring somewhat more effort, but simultaneously allowing more flexibility.|$|E

40|$|The top {{priority}} of car-tire suppliers {{is to improve}} wetland grip force of the using tires, reduce the rolling resistance and the rolling noise of tires. It is urgent for the tire industry to research and develop high-performance tires to solve the above problems. They must use the high- performance synthetic rubber and auxiliary rubber to develop the most advanced manufacturing technologies and equipment. Silica, a kind of important tire auxiliary rubber, can significantly reduce the rolling resistance of tires, improve the grip force and properties resistant to ice, wetness or slippery of tires. In this paper, based on the conventional tire rubber forming technologies of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding, a study is made on the conical screw, the dewatering <b>barrel,</b> the <b>drying</b> <b>barrel,</b> the pin layout scheme, the expanding die head, cutter and the control system. The nonlinear pin rubber forming equipment integrating the functions of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding is designed and applied to tire auxiliary rubber forming. The experiment shows that the forming device can realize the one-step forming, with high forming efficiency, low cost and less labor. ...|$|R

40|$|Fluted-core {{sandwich}} composites {{consist of}} integral angled web members spaced between laminate face sheets, {{and may have}} the potential to provide benefits over traditional sandwich composites for certain aerospace applications. However, fabrication of large autoclave-cured fluted-core cylindrical shells with existing autoclaves will require that the shells be fabricated in segments, and joined longitudinally to form a complete barrel. Two different longitudinal fluted-core joint designs were considered experimentally in this study. In particular, jointed fluted-core-composite panels were tested in longitudinal compression because longitudinal compression is the primary loading condition in <b>dry</b> launch-vehicle <b>barrel</b> sections. One of the joint designs performed well in comparison with unjointed test articles, and the other joint design failed at loads approximately 14 % lower than unjointed test articles. The compression-after-impact (CAI) performance of jointed fluted-core composites was also investigated by testing test articles that had been subjected to 6 ft-lb impacts. It was found that such impacts reduced the load-carrying capability by 9 % to 40 %. This reduction is dependent on the joint concept, component flute size, and facesheet thickness...|$|R

5000|$|... "Muscat Bailey-A" [...] (マスカットべリーA) is a {{red wine}} grape hybrid {{developed}} by Zenbei Kawakami (Kawakami Zenbei) (1868-1944) at the Iwanohara Winery (岩の原わいん) in Niigata Prefecture. Kawakami's goal {{was to develop a}} grape for wine adapted to Japan's climate. He did this by mixing the [...] "Bailey" [...] (ベーリー) type grape with [...] "Muscat Hamburg" [...] type grape to give birth to a red wine grape that is widely used in Japan. Also developed by Kawakami was the variety known as [...] "Black Queen" [...] (ブラッククイーン). The characteristics of Muscat Bailey-A are a very grape juice-like flavor and it is most widely used in sweet amakuchi wines. However, in recent years, <b>drier</b> varieties and <b>barrel</b> aged varieties have also been developed. Muscat Bailey-A has been blended with western grapes creating a very full bodied, Bordeaux style flavour. In addition, different blending has led to smoother Bourgogne/Burgundy varieties.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, fiber-reinforced {{composites}} {{have become}} more accepted for aerospace applications. Specifically, during NASA s recent efforts to develop new launch vehicles, composite materials were considered and baselined {{for a number of}} structures. Because of mass and stiffness requirements, sandwich composites are often selected for many applications. However, {{there are a number of}} manufacturing and in-service concerns associated with traditional honeycomb-core sandwich composites that in certain instances may be alleviated through the use of other core materials or construction methods. Fluted-core, which consists of integral angled web members with structural radius fillers spaced between laminate face sheets, is one such construction alternative and is considered herein. Two different fluted-core designs were considered: a subscale design and a full-scale design sized for a heavy-lift-launch-vehicle interstage. In particular, axial compression of fluted-core composites was evaluated with experiments and finite-element analyses (FEA); axial compression is the primary loading condition in <b>dry</b> launch-vehicle <b>barrel</b> sections. Detailed finite-element models were developed to represent all components of the fluted-core construction, and geometrically nonlinear analyses were conducted to predict both buckling and material failures. Good agreement was obtained between test data and analyses, for both local buckling and ultimate material failure. Though the local buckling events are not catastrophic, the resulting deformations contribute to material failures. Consequently, an important observation is that the material failure loads and modes would not be captured by either linear analyses or nonlinear smeared-shell analyses. Compression-after-impact (CAI) performance of fluted core composites was also investigated by experimentally testing samples impacted with 6 ft. -lb. impact energies. It was found that such impacts reduced the ultimate load carrying capability by approximately 40 % on the subscale test articles and by less than 20 % on the full-scale test articles. Nondestructive inspection of the damage zones indicated that the detectable damage was limited to no more than one flute on either side of any given impact. More study is needed, but this may indicate that an inherent damage-arrest capability of fluted core could provide benefits over traditional sandwich designs in certain weight-critical applications...|$|R
