500|$|The live {{performance}} received positive reviews from most music critics; Jason Kaufman from NY Rock commented, [...] "Her constant nationality morphing <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> With her geisha-girl-gone-club-hopping outfit last night, [...] the woman proved she's a walking Epcot Center, long on fashion and short on culture. And what were those women dancing behind {{her in her}} musical number holding? The objects looked like fetuses from last week's The X-Files". Bradley Stern from Idolator hosted a poll, asking viewers what was their best Madonna Grammy performance. Alongside the 1999 Grammys, Stern listed Madonna's performances of [...] "Music" [...] at the 2001 ceremony, [...] "Hung Up" [...] at the 2006 ceremony, and [...] "Same Love" [...] and [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] at the 2014 ceremony. [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] came third in the poll with 102 votes. InStyle staff highlighted the performance {{as one of the}} best Grammy performances to date.|$|E

6000|$|... "No; let me sleep if I can. I can get {{something}} when I wake up. I'll come down if I can't sleep. Life <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. It does when there's {{a death in}} the house, and this is only a little worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, my dear Lord, but I have an {{appointment}} in the city. I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Temple, and I am already behind my time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Mrs. Deering, [...] "I don't know as {{we shall}} trouble him, after all. Mr. Deering isn't very well, and I guess we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't do to kill one's {{love and}} live on oneself," [...] I {{answered}} hoarsely. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> together," [...] and I cocked both barrels of the pistol.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} {{he is going to}} hurt Dave when he is away off in Boston," [...] was Ben's comment. [...] "The chances are he <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to work and earn his living. Probably his father is sick of putting up money for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. I nearly screamed when I {{saved my}} first German from living. I never {{felt the same}} again. They say the human race <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on, but I say they've first got {{to prove that the}} human race wants to. Would you rather be alive or dead? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Draw off, lads, I expect it's that accursed captain," [...] {{another voice}} exclaimed. [...] "He's always riding about, with nobody but that black fellow with him. He <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down, that fellow has, or {{he will give}} us no end of trouble; but draw off from that window, for a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In fact," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "so far as I'm {{concerned}} {{it ought to}} run, 'Here beginneth Aunt Maria.' You see, I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and live with her to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> {{although}} I don't like it," [...] Jim {{replied with}} a puzzled look. [...] "Something pulls and I resist. However, come along. We're going to the park." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll play you're Miss Lacy {{till the}} proper time comes. What's the {{shortest}} limit {{for people to get}} engaged? S'pose we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through all the fuss of an engagement, haven't we?" ...|$|R
6000|$|So the two {{brothers}} went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters, blankets, hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. 'I hope you're a good hand at pinning and tying strings?' Tweedledum remarked. 'Every {{one of these things}} <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on, somehow or other.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} to stop in that town and send some help here-- a police official, or a constable, or some men. Crabtree <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to jail, and I {{think we ought to}} have Pelter and Japson locked up, too-- {{although}} that may depend upon what father may have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{accompanying}} notes I {{have suggested}} that you vastly modify the first visit to hell, and leave out the second visit altogether. Nobody would, or ought to print those things. You are not advanced enough in literature to venture upon a matter requiring so much practice. Let {{me show you what}} a man <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Style {{kicks the}} ass of {{substance}} in this showdown. The writing team, wardrobe designer and acting coach (if there even is one) <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{if there is}} to be any future for Team Epic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't wish poppa {{to give up}} his ticket!" [...] said Ellen. [...] "He {{must get}} it again. I shall die if I stay here, momma. We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Can't you {{understand}} that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{down and}} see Tod," [...] he said. [...] "I like that wife of his; but she has no sense of humor. How much better {{principles}} are in theory than in practice!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{just comes}} to this," [...] he said. [...] "Torrance and the cattle-men have done their best to starve us and freeze us out, and, since he has made it plain that there's no room for both of us, {{somebody}} <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Now, we {{have come a long}} way and we mean to stay. We're not looking for trouble, but we want our rights." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Down {{with the}} blank fool' would have suited your case better," [...] said Keogh, with fiery emphasis. [...] "You tear up ten {{thousand}} dollars like an old rag because the way you've spread on five dollars' worth of paint hurts your conscience. Next time I pick a side-partner in a scheme the man <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before a notary and swear he never even heard the word 'ideal' mentioned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can make}} another trip or not, {{just as you}} please. Now, I think you will be very foolish, if you don't agree; for you will make {{three times as much}} as I offer you, every thirty boxes of fruit that you can take in there; but the boat <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there now, and you have got to take your choice whether you go in her, or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{must not}} know; keep them out!" [...] gasped the contractor. [...] "Get me some brandy and ring for the steward--quick. You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and {{convince}} those fellows, Thurston. Good Lord!--this is agony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{and meet}} Helena at Wimbledon,' {{he said to}} himself, and {{instantly}} he felt a peculiar joy, {{as if he had}} laughed somewhere. 'But I must be getting ready. I can't disappoint her,' said Siegmund.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't whether I {{want to stay}} or not," [...] Ellen {{spoke into}} her pillow. [...] "You know that. You know that I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> You know that if I saw him--Oh, why do you make me talk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The whole {{question}} is," [...] continued Cicely, as the silence became oppressive, [...] "whether {{one is to}} mope and hold aloof from the national life, or take our share in it; the life <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on whether we participate in it or not. It {{seems to me to}} be more patriotic to come down into the dust of the marketplace than to withdraw oneself behind walls or beyond the seas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is out of the question, mamma. It has never {{occurred}} to me for a moment as otherwise. He <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Oxford and take his degree before he thinks of such a thing. I shall be quite an old woman by that time, and he will have forgotten me. You may be sure, mamma, that whatever I did say to him was quite plain. I wish you could have been here and heard it all, and seen it all." ...|$|E
60|$|I knew, of course, that I had to. Every tourist in Paris <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and see Versailles. Otherwise {{the superiority}} of the others becomes insufferable, with foreigners it is different. If they worry one about palaces and cathedrals and such--the Château at Versailles, and the Kaiserhof and the Duomo at Milan--I answer them in kind. I ask them if they have ever seen the Schlitzerhof at Milwaukee and the Anheuserbusch at St. Louis, and the Dammo at Niagara, and the Toboggo at Montreal. That quiets them wonderfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, so {{much the}} worse for the Indian village if it interferes with us," [...] Harry said grimly; [...] "there is one thing certain, we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through. Probably most of the braves are away up in the hills." ...|$|R
60|$|Reddy {{looked up}} with a sickly grin. There sat Unc' Billy Possum in a pine tree right over his head. He knew now {{that there was no}} backing out; he <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. He tried to swagger and look very bold and brave.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no {{use your}} objecting, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with me; {{and if you}} are a wise woman you had better make the best of it. After all I am not very terrible, and you had better marry me than the guillotine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reckon {{the boys}} won't hang about old Harcourt's Free Library {{to see the}} girls home from lectures and singing-class much this year," [...] said Wingate. [...] "Wonder if Harcourt ever thought o' this the day he opened it, and made that rattlin' speech o' his about the new property? Clark says {{everything}} built on that made ground <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after the water falls. Rough on Harcourt after all his other losses, eh? He oughter have closed up with that scientific chap, Grant, and married him to Clementina while the big boom was on"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Maggie had had {{a sudden}} attack of the hedges. I guess {{everybody}} <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on a spree once in their life. A man spends his on highballs, and a woman gets woozy on clothes. But with forty million dollars--say, I'd {{like to have a}} picture of--but, speaking of pictures, did you ever run across a newspaper artist named Lathrop--a tall--oh, I asked you that before, didn't I? He was mighty nice to me at the dinner. His voice just suited me. I guess he must have thought I was to inherit some of Aunt Maggie's money.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Champney," [...] said Miss Sally plaintively, [...] "I've lost my glove {{somewhere near}} pooah Brooks's tomb in the hollow. Won't {{you go and}} fetch it, and come back here to take me home? The co'nnle <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and see his sick niggers in the hospital." [...] Champney lifted his hat, nodded genially to Courtland, and {{disappeared}} below the cypresses on the slope. [...] "Yo' mustn't be mad," [...] she said, turning in explanation to her companion, [...] "but we have been here too long already, and it's better that I should be seen coming home with him than yo'." ...|$|E
60|$|She set {{off at a}} good pace up the High Street, {{attended}} by her faithful follower, and passing through the small suburbs, struck out into the country beyond. After four miles the boatswain, who was no walker, reminded her that they <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you want}} {{when you are}} goin' to take a journey with a horse," [...] said he, [...] "is stayin' power. Your fast trotter is all very well for a mile or two, but if I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the country in winter, give me a horse like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{come this}} way sometimes. I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the farther side of the wood {{this time of the}} year, and am obliged to get there before four o'clock in the morning, to begin heating the oven for the early baking. I have passed by here often at this time." ...|$|R
