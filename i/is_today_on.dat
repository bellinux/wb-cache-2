25|$|The Rawk {{is a large}} boulder {{donated by}} members of Alpha Phi Omega in 1973 and painted nearly every day by {{students}}, who {{use it as a}} giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain <b>is</b> <b>today,</b> <b>on</b> the hill in front of the Dining Hall.|$|E
25|$|Lanier's campus {{has been}} {{expanded}} numerous times {{since it was}} first built. The most notable expansion was {{the addition of the}} area of the building housing the cafeteria and gymnasium. This expansion has resulted in some quirks in the building that are still visible today, most notably a door leading to stairs to the basement that is only half-exposed above the floor of the hallway. These stairs are no longer in service, though the door can be opened even though it's blocked by the hallway floor. Students aren't allowed to open the door and/or go down those stairs. Prior to this expansion, the cafeteria was located where the library <b>is</b> <b>today,</b> <b>on</b> the third floor. A dumbwaiter, located where the elevator is today, carried food to the cafeteria.|$|E

25|$|Timothy Jackson {{operated}} a horse boarding stable {{near where the}} intersection of Park Drive East and Union Turnpike, or the Kew Gardens Interchange <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> <b>On</b> {{what is now the}} Jamaica subway yard was previously a horse race course, built by Timothy Jackson, and was known as Whitepot Race & Track. Although the train yard is not in Jamaica, it is named Jamaica because the yard feeds the subway lines which begin (or end) in Jamaica. This area was an extension of Timothy Jackson's Willow Glen Farm for which the farmhouse was located south of Union Turnpike in the neighborhood of Jamaica that is now called Briarwood. In the 1750s, William Furman was the owner of the farm he named Willow Glen. Today Willow Lake, {{at the southern end of}} Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, retains the Willow name.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Restoration, the Paris Opera was located in the Salle Montansier on rue de Richelieu, where the square Louvois <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> <b>On</b> 13 February 1820, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry was assassinated {{at the door of the}} opera, and King Louis XVIII, in his grief, had the old theater demolished. In 1820-1821, the opera performed in the Salle Favart of the Théâtre des Italiens, then in the salle Louvois on rue Louvois, and, beginning on 16 August 1821, in the new opera house on rue Le Peletier, which was built out of the material of the old opera house. It was intended to be a temporary home until a new opera house was built; it was neither elegant nor well-located, but it was large and had modern lighting and stage equipment, with gas lights installed in 1822, and the first electrical lighting in 1849. It remained the primary opera venue of Paris for a half century, until the opening of the Palais Garnier.|$|E

Ownership shifted to the Earl of Eglinton when James V presented the land to Hugh Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Eglinton on the marriage of his son in 1530. The area of the estate was farmed {{until the end of}} the 18th century and, in 1858, the estate was purchased by local merchant Walter Crum. Alexander Crum inherited the estate in 1879 and is responsible for the layout of Rouken Glen as it <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> <b>On</b> his sudden death in August 1893, the house passed into the hands of his brother, William Graham Crum, who later sold the estate to Archibald Cameron Corbett, MP (later Lord Rowallan) on 19 May 1905. In 1906 the estate was given to the City of Glasgow by Lord Rowallan, with the provision that it be for the [...] "citizens of Glasgow for all time". Rouken Glen Park was officially opened on Saturday, 25 May 1906 by Lord Rowallan.|$|E

[...] The aircraft slowly took form at his home, then in Poughkeepsie, New York, through the early 1980s, when it was completed, then brought to the nearby Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome and flown once there successfully, ending in a slight mishap without injury.

2500|$|The Romans {{built an}} entirely new city {{as a base for}} their {{soldiers}} and the Gallic auxiliaries intended {{to keep an eye on}} the rebellious province. The new city was called Lutetia (Lutèce) or [...] "Lutetia Parisiorum" [...] ("Lutèce of the Parisii"). The name probably came from the Latin word luta, meaning mud or swamp Caesar had described the great marsh, or marais, along the right bank of the Seine. [...] The major part of the city was on the left bank of the Seine, which was higher and less prone to flood. It was laid out following the traditional Roman town design along a north-south axis (known in Latin as the cardo maximus). On the left bank, the main Roman street followed the route of the modern day Rue Saint-Jacques. It crossed the Seine and traversed the Île de la Cité on two wooden bridges: the [...] "Petit Pont" [...] and the [...] "Grand Pont" [...] (today's Pont Notre-Dame). The port of the city, where the boats docked, was located on the island where the parvis of Notre Dame <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> <b>On</b> the right bank, it followed the modern Rue Saint-Martin. [...] On the left bank, the cardo was crossed by a less-important east-west decumanus, today's Rue Cujas, Rue Soufflot and Rue des Écoles.|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{art forms}} in Indian culture, Indian {{classical}} music {{is believed to}} be a divine art form which originated from the Devas and Devis (Hindu Gods and Goddesses), and is venerated as symbolic of [...] Ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the swaras, or notes, to the sounds of animals and birds and man's effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception. The Sama Veda, which is believed to have laid the foundation for Indian classical music, consists of hymns from the Rigveda, set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during Vedic yajnas. The Yajur-Veda, which mainly consists of sacrificial formulae, mentions the veena as an accompaniment to vocal recitations. References to Indian classical music are made in many ancient texts, including epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Yajnavalkya Smriti mentions vīṇāvādana tattvajñaḥ śrutijātiviśāradaḥ tālajñaścāprayāsena mokṣamārgaṃ niyacchati ("The one who is well versed in veena, one who has the knowledge of srutis and one who is adept in tala, attains salvation without doubt"). Carnatic music is based as it <b>is</b> <b>today</b> <b>on</b> musical concepts (including swara, raga, and tala) that were described in detail in several ancient works, particularly the Bharata's Natya Shastra and Silappadhikaram by Ilango Adigal.|$|E

It is now the centre of attraction for the adventurous of all countries. The excitement throughout the Canadas and Northern States of America is universal. In fact, the whole interior of North America is quite in a ferment--the entire floating population being either [...] "on the move," [...] or preparing to start; while traders, cattle-dealers, contractors, and all the enterprising persons in business who can manage to leave, are maturing arrangements to join the general exodus. Persons travelling in the mining regions reckon that, in three months, 50,000 souls will have left the State of California alone. The rapidity and extent of this emigration has never been paralleled.|$|E
