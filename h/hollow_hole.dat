40|$|Various {{tests and}} {{analysis}} on hydrodynamics and mass transfer properties show that, the newly invented spherical metal mesh packing (SMMP) has excellent properties from three aspects: (i) high void space (similar to 99 %) and lower material cost; (ii) high mass transfer efficiency; (iii) easy installation, good liquid distribution, {{and prevention of}} wall flow. Moreover, SMMP {{is a type of}} isotropic spherical unit with numerous <b>hollow</b> <b>holes,</b> which realizes the regularization of random packing. The results indicate the potential of developing high-efficiency and energy-saving SMMP-based equipment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a developed process for fabrication of hollow silicon microneedle arrays. The inner <b>hollow</b> <b>hole</b> and the fluidic reservoir are fabricated in deep reactive ion etching. The profile of outside needles {{is achieved by}} the developed fabrication process, which combined isotropic etching and anisotropic etching with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etcher. Using the combination of SF 6 /O 2 isotropic etching chemistry and Bosch process, the high aspect ratio 3 D and high density microneedle arrays are fabricated. The generated needle external geometry can be controlled by etching variables in the isotropic and anisotropic cases. 1...|$|E
40|$|Deep nanoindentation of {{a copper}} {{substrate}} by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has been analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. Three categories of SWCNTs {{and their relationship}} with temperature and nanotube length have been extensively investigated. The results of this comprehensive quantitative analysis for deep indentation demonstrate that only SWCNTs with relatively short lengths can indent into a substrate up to a desired depth without buckling. Most notably, a permanent <b>hollow</b> <b>hole</b> with a high aspect ratio will be produced on the copper substrate, while copper atoms {{in close proximity to}} the hole are only slightly disordered.

50|$|William Reed (1830 - 1920) was {{the author}} of Phantom of the Poles, {{published}} in 1906, in which he proposed his theory that the Earth is in fact <b>hollow,</b> with <b>holes</b> at its poles.|$|R

50|$|The Phantom of the Poles is a {{book written}} by William Reed, and {{published}} in 1906. It attempts to explain certain mysterious phenomena reported by polar explorers by postulating that the Earth is in fact <b>hollow,</b> with <b>holes</b> at its poles.|$|R
50|$|The species {{occupies}} crevices, <b>hollows,</b> and <b>holes</b> made {{by other}} creatures in termite mounds, the latter offering a controlled climate. Antaresia stimsoni is an ambush predator, spending {{much of its}} time waiting for prey, trapping and killing by constriction. They are often recorded at rocky hills or other habitat providing good cover.|$|R
30|$|The {{situation}} {{during a}} steady-state pore growth {{must be considered}} to explain the effect of self-organization. By applying voltage between the anode electrode and cathode electrode on the aluminum surface, a layer of flat oxide surface is produced and proceeds with the dissolution of some oxide area (surface defects) within the electrolyte, and with the dissolution tendency of the oxide layer of primary <b>hollow</b> points, <b>holes</b> are created on the surface.|$|R
60|$|On {{all sides}} arose bushes and rocks, and, {{although}} the road might be close at hand, Matt {{thought it best}} to return {{the way they had}} come. He wished to take no more chances, feeling that it would be the easiest thing in the world to get lost, or to run the turn-out into some <b>hollow</b> or <b>hole</b> from which it would be next to impossible to extricate it.|$|R
60|$|In saying this, our hero, almost unintentionally, took {{command of}} the little party, which at once tacitly accorded him the position. Leading them--as every leader ought--he {{proceeded}} to {{the centre of the}} clump of bushes, where, finding a natural <b>hollow</b> or <b>hole</b> in the sand, at the root of a mimosa bush, three of them went down on hands and knees to scoop it out deeper, while the others cut branches with Molloy's clasp-knife.|$|R

50|$|Toucans are {{arboreal}} {{and typically}} lay 2-21 white eggs in their nests. They make their nests in tree <b>hollows</b> and <b>holes</b> excavated by other {{animals such as}} woodpeckers—the toucan bill has very limited use as an excavation tool. When the eggs hatch, the young emerge completely naked, without any down. Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks. They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists hypothesize they do to establish dominance hierarchies.|$|R
50|$|Helenton Loch was {{situated}} in a low lying area between the farms and dwellings of Helentongate, Mains, and Burnbank in the Parish of Symington, South Ayrshire, Scotland. The loch was natural, sitting in a <b>hollow,</b> a kettle <b>hole,</b> created by glaciation. The loch waters ultimately drained via the Pow Burn.|$|R
25|$|The {{aboriginal}} people inhabited fixed village locations, and followed food sources seasonally, living near the coast in winter to harvest rich stocks of otter, mussels, abalone, and other sea life. In {{the summer and}} fall, they traveled inland to gather acorns and hunt deer. The native people <b>hollowed</b> mortar <b>holes</b> into large exposed rocks or boulders which they used to grind the acorns into flour. These can be found throughout the region. Arrows were of made of cane and pointed with hardwood foreshafts. The tribes also used controlled burning techniques to increase tree growth and food production.|$|R
50|$|A captive {{breeding}} pair regularly had litters of two young.Gestation periods last about 70 days. Females make nests in <b>hollow</b> trees, in <b>holes</b> or among boulders. The young open their eyes 10 days after birth, their canine teeth break through {{at the age}} of four weeks. They are weaned at about 2.5 months and hunt on their own when about seven months old.|$|R
60|$|The cove was a <b>hole</b> <b>hollowed</b> out {{by running}} water. At its head, where the {{perpendicular}} wall curved, the height was {{not less than}} forty feet. The walls became higher as the cove deepened toward the canyon. It had a length of perhaps a hundred yards, and a width of perhaps half as many. The floor was mass on mass of splintered rock.|$|R
5000|$|A tree <b>hollow</b> or tree <b>hole</b> is a semi-enclosed cavity {{which has}} {{naturally}} {{formed in the}} trunk or branch of a tree. These are predominantly found in old trees, whether living or not. Hollows form in many species of trees, and are a prominent feature of natural forests and woodlands, and act as a resource or habitat {{for a number of}} vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|R

5000|$|They {{seek shelter}} {{in places that}} offer {{thermoregulation}} and protection from predators. Treefalls are a favored site, as are debris piles, burrows (especially those of the armadillo (Dasypodidae family) and agouti (Dasyprocta species)), <b>hollow</b> logs, <b>holes,</b> and heavy vegetation cover. They generally try to find tight-fitting resting places, and will occasionally 'wedge' themselves between roots and trunks but remain otherwise exposed. Burrows and holes are often flooded and the tortoises will rest {{in the water and}} mud with just their nostrils and eyes exposed. In warmer weather, they press up against moister, cooler surfaces in shelter areas. The tortoises show personal preferences with many individuals always seeking out a specific type of shelter.|$|R
5000|$|It {{often will}} cohabit with gopher {{tortoises}} in their underground burrows, although it will settle for armadillo <b>holes,</b> <b>hollow</b> logs, and debris piles when gopher tortoise burrows can't be found. Hunters, hoping {{to flush out}} rattlesnakes, often wind up accidentally killing indigo snakes when they illegally pour gasoline into the burrows of gopher tortoises (a practice referred to as [...] "gassing"), even though the tortoises themselves are endangered and protected.|$|R
60|$|They were {{to divide}} the pass between them, Service to range the upper half and Neale the lower. As there were but few trees up in that locality, and these {{necessary}} for a large supply of fire-wood, they decided not to attempt building a cabin for Service, but to dig a dugout. This was a <b>hole</b> <b>hollowed</b> out in a hillside {{and covered with a}} roof of branches and earth.|$|R
50|$|After {{this they}} see on the horizon {{what appears to be}} a very similar object to Spearpoint, but with no signs that anyone ever lived on its surface. Ricasso and Quillon elect to take a closer look at the {{building}} in a balloon as normal airships can't reach the top of the object. They see that unlike Spearpoint this object was never colonised as thoroughly and is <b>hollow</b> with a <b>hole</b> at the top.|$|R

"In {{this same}} city of Coimbra, {{where we find}} {{ourselves}} today, it is customary for groups of children {{to walk on the}} streets, on the 31st October and 1st and 2nd November, at nightfall, with a <b>hollow</b> pumpkin with <b>holes</b> that were cut out pretending to be eyes, nose and mouth, {{as if it was a}} skull, and with a stump of candle lit from within, to give it a more macabre look." ...|$|R
60|$|Swimming {{cautiously}} {{along for}} a short distance close to the rocks, {{he came to the}} entrance of a cavern which was filled by the sea. The inner end of this cave opened into a small <b>hollow</b> or <b>hole</b> among the cliffs, up the sides of which Ruby knew that he could climb, and thus reach the top unperceived, but, after gaining the summit, there still lay before him the difficulty of eluding those who watched there. He felt, however, that nothing could be gained by delay, so he struck at once into the cave, swam to the inner end, and landed. Wringing the water out of his clothes, he threw off his jacket and vest in order to be as unencumbered as possible, and then began to climb cautiously.|$|R
6000|$|On the {{day when}} he mysteriously {{disappeared}} he had come upon a great <b>hollow,</b> or <b>hole,</b> of about sixty yards in diameter, which appeared to descend into the very depths of the earth. The sides of the hollow sloped towards the centre, and were covered with bushes. Noting this, our romantic friend resolved to explore the spot. He descended cautiously till he came to a place where the hole had narrowed to about twenty feet in diameter, and the herbage ceased because of the absence of the earth to sustain it. Filled with eager curiosity, the reckless man held on to a branch and stretched his head {{over the edge of the}} hole. He saw nothing but blackness. He soon felt something, however, for the branch suddenly broke off, and John went headlong down into that hole! ...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{assessment}} of the peculiarities of erythrocyte morphology by applying scanning electron microscopy and light-optics methods gives valuable information on the age characteristics, functional failures of the erythrocyte, pathogenesis of anaemia, and also diagnosis. In toxic anaemia caused by the chronic effect of lead and chlorobenzene there is accumulation of aging erythrocytes in blood that are spherical with rough and folded surfaces, fragmented with protuberances, processes, crypt-like <b>hollows,</b> and <b>holes.</b> In lead intoxication there is increased destruction of erythrocytes; anaemia caused by chlorobenzene is mainly due to a decreased entry of the young forms of the erythrocyte into the blood. Light-optics investigation combined with scanning electron microscopy allows a quantitative calculation of erythrocytes with abnormalities of form and surfaces. This {{may be used as}} an additional diagnostic test as part of the haematological examination of patients with anaemia...|$|R
5000|$|Threaded inserts are {{commonly}} used in plastic casings, housing, and parts to create a metal thread (typically: Brass or Stainless Steel) to allow for screws {{to be used in}} the assembly of many consumer electronics and consumer products. These may be cast in place in injection molded parts or they may be added by thermal insertion. In the latter, the insert is heated and then pressed into a hollow in the plastic part. The heat causes local melting in the plastic. [...] Ultrasonic Insertion is the process used to apply vibration and pressure to install the threaded insert into a molded <b>hollow</b> boss (<b>hole)</b> of a plastic part. The ultrasonic vibrations melt the plastic where the metal insert is in contact, and pressure is applied to press it into position. The plastic material typically reforms around the knurled body of the threaded insert to ensure a good retention.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} {{known as}} “Antioch” {{began at the}} convergence of Antioch Pike,Hickory <b>Hollow</b> Parkway, Blue <b>Hole</b> Road, and Mt. View Road. The originaltown of Antioch began as a church located by Mill Creek in 1810. Antiochwas a commuter town because workers traveled to and from downtownNashville. From the beginning, the town provided immediate services likea post office and general store. For planning purposes, the community wasgiven the name Antioch-Priest Lake because the study area encompassedareas near J. Percy Priest Lake and the neighborhoods that grew from theheart of Antioch in the early 1800s.|$|R

They are well modified to live in any water clogged place for the survival, which includes natural habitats like <b>hollow</b> logs, rock <b>holes,</b> tree holes, bamboo, Pandanus axils, sago palm and banana stumps, fruit shells and husks, fallen leaves and spathes, flower bracts, pitcher plants, and artificial containers having organic matter and small collections of ground water made by humans. Adults are more confined to dark forested areas and active mostly in crepuscular periods. Females are primarily human-biters.|$|R
