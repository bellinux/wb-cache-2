5|$|The {{long neck}} of Dinocephalosaurus {{probably}} served a functional role. In particular, {{the length of}} the neck places a long distance between the head and the remainder of the body. This would have allowed Dinocephalosaurus to approach potential prey without the majority of its bulk being detected, which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> in the murky waters of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether the defences would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> in invasion is vexed. In mid-1940, the preparations relied heavily upon field fortifications. The First World War made it clear that assaulting prepared defences with infantry was deadly and difficult, but similar preparations in Belgium had been overrun by well-equipped German Panzer divisions in the early weeks of 1940 and with so many armaments left at Dunkirk, British forces were woefully ill-equipped to take on German armour. On the other hand, while British preparations for defence were ad hoc, so were the German invasion plans: a fleet of 2,000 converted barges and other vessels had been hurriedly made available and their fitness was debatable; in any case, the Germans could not land troops with all their heavy equipment. Until the Germans captured a port, both armies would have been short of tanks and heavy guns.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E

It seems Hamas was “forced to operate at reduced levels of efficiency” and was eventually forced to agree to a Tahadiyeh, likely due to targeted killings.|$|E

25|$|Arguably, {{the sack}} of Wexford was {{somewhat}} counter-productive for the Parliamentarians. The {{destruction of the}} town meant that the Parliamentarians could not use its port {{as a base for}} supplying their forces in Ireland.

25|$|Various {{attempts}} for refloating {{the ship}} were suggested.

No vaccine is available for scabies. The simultaneous treatment of all close contacts is recommended, even if they show no symptoms of infection (asymptomatic), to reduce rates of recurrence. Since mites can survive for only two to three days without a host, other objects in the environment pose little risk of transmission except in the case of crusted scabies, thus cleaning is of little importance. Rooms used by those with crusted scabies require thorough cleaning.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Welsh Law {{is a term}} {{applied to}} the body of primary and {{secondary}} legislation generated by the National Assembly for Wales, according to devolved authority granted in the Government of Wales Act 2006.

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} first HPV vaccine was approved, bills to make the vaccine {{mandatory}} for school attendance were introduced in many states.

Mandates <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> at increasing uptake of other vaccines, such as mumps, measles, rubella, and hepatitis B (which is also sexually transmitted). However most such efforts developed for five or more years after vaccine release, while financing and supply were arranged, further safety data was gathered, and education efforts increased understanding, before mandates were considered. Most public policies including school mandates have not been effective in promoting HPV vaccination while receiving a recommendation from a physician increased the probability of vaccination.|$|E

25|$|In 1619 Ferdinand {{was elected}} the Holy Roman Emperor {{and moved to}} Vienna with the court and the musicians of the Graz chapel. Valentini served as {{imperial}} court organist in Vienna for several years, then became court Kapellmeister in 1626, succeeding Giovanni Priuli, and accepted the post of choral director at the Michaelerkirche in Vienna in 1627/8. Valentini {{seems to have had}} an exceptional reputation and was favoured by both Ferdinand II and Ferdinand III (whom he tutored in music), as evidenced by several large monetary gifts from the former and financial support for Valentini's widow from the latter. In this respect, Valentini is similar to Johann Jakob Froberger, who also was a close personal friend of Ferdinand III. Valentini also seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> as Kapellmeister, managing to significantly increase the salaries for the court chapel musicians.|$|E
25|$|Females start {{breeding}} {{when they}} are 1 to 6 years old, while males start breeding {{when they are}} 2 to 6 years old. There is very limited natal dispersal, meaning that young pairs do not move far from their original natal nests for their own first reproduction, leading to the congregation of hundreds of boobies in dense colonies. The benefit of limited dispersal is that by staying close to their parents' nesting sites, the boobies {{are more likely to}} have a high quality nest. Since their parents had successfully raised chicks to reproductive age, their nest site must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>effective,</b> either by providing cover from predation and parasitism, or by its suitability for taking off and landing. Bigamy has been observed in the species, and there are known cases where two females and one male all share a single nest.|$|E
25|$|The USN had forward-basing {{arrangements}} for its Atlantic-based Polaris fleet {{with both the}} United Kingdom and Spain, permitting the use of bases at the Holy Loch in Scotland (established in 1961) and at Naval Station Rota (Polaris base established 1964) in the Bay of Cadiz. The forward deployment bases were much closer to patrol areas than U.S. East Coast bases, avoiding the necessity for lengthy transit times. In the Pacific, a Polaris base was also established at Guam in 1964. The Regulus missile program was deactivated {{with the advent of}} Polaris in the Pacific. The forward-basing arrangement was continued when Poseidon replaced Polaris, starting in 1972, in what by then were the 31 Atlantic Fleet SSBNs. The 10 older SSBNs that could not use Poseidon were assigned to the Pacific Fleet in the 1970s. Polaris was not accurate enough to destroy hardened targets, but would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>effective</b> against dispersed surface targets, such as airfields, radar and SAM sites, as well as military and industrial centers of strategic importance. The military authorities, however, regarded Polaris as but one part of a nuclear triad including ICBMs and bombers, each with its own function. The task allotted to Polaris of 'taking out' peripheral defenses was well-suited to its characteristics and limitations.|$|E
