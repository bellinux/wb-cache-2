30|$|As {{a result}} of {{facilitated}} cross-border knowledge exchanges between France and the UK, where participants explained their research and commercial thinking, the BRIDGE project partners were able to challenge {{their understanding of the}} sustainable agenda (people, profit and planet) and <b>re-assess</b> their <b>position</b> and future direction from a more informed perspective. The exchanges between the UK and the French commercial and educational communities challenged and invigorated the business and research teams through many eco events focusing on lifecycle analysis, production and disposal methods; concepts around ‘make local’, ‘supply local’, sell local’ and ‘dispose of local’, as opposed to a global manufacturing supply chain process. These concepts led to heated discussions between designers, engineers, entrepreneurs and scientists about material value and environmental benefits versus simply price and a true cost calculation of goods.|$|R
40|$|The leading Iranian {{intellectual}} and nationalist Hasan Taqizadeh has been roundly condemned by posterity for his call to Iranians to embrace European civilisation {{in its entirety}} without qualification or compromise. Taqizadeh himself later conceded that the form of words he had used were injudicious, but he added, his intention had been to galvanise Iranians out of their self destructive political stupor and it remains a reality that many of Taqizadeh’s contemporaries were supportive of his call to arms. This paper <b>re-assesses</b> Taqizadeh’s <b>position</b> {{in the context of}} his historical environment and intellectual environment which it is argued drew heavily from a ‘Whig’ reading of Enlightenment progress. It shows that Taqizadeh was not alone in drawing on this narrative while maintaining an important distinction between the positive aspects of British political thought and the shortcomings of British policy.

40|$|Since levodopa-induced peak dyskinesias (LIDs) may reflect, in part, {{a disproportionate}} phasic release of {{dopamine}} from synaptic vesicles, {{we examined the}} ability of the vesicular depletor tetrabenazine (TBZ) to reduce LIDs in 10 dyskinetic advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients.

40|$|Optical {{observations}} of pulsars {{are crucial to}} study the neutron star properties, from the structure and composition of the interior, to the properties and geometry of the magnetosphere. Historically, X and gamma-ray observations have paved {{the way to the}} pulsar optical identifications. The launch of Fermi opened new perspectives in the optical-to-gamma-ray studies of neutron stars, with the detection of more than 80 pulsars. Here, we aim to search for optical emission from two Fermi pulsars which are interesting targets {{on the basis of their}} spin-down age, energetics, and distance: PSR J 1357 - 6429 and PSR J 1048 - 5832. The two pulsars and their pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are also detected in X-rays by Chandra and XMM. No deep optical {{observations of}} these two pulsars have been reported so far. We used multi-band optical images (V,R,I) taken with the VLT and available in the European Southern Observatory (ESO) archive to search for, or put tight constraints to, their optical emission. We <b>re-assessed</b> the <b>positions</b> of the two pulsars from the analyses of all the available Chandra observations and the comparison with the published radio coordinates. For PSR J 1357 - 6429, this yielded a tentative proper motion mu= 0. 17 +/- 0. 055 "/yr (70 +/- 15 deg position angle). We did not detect candidate counterparts to PSR J 1357 - 6429 and PSR J 1048 - 5832 down to V~ 27 and ~ 27. 6, respectively, although for the former we found a possible evidence for a faint, unresolved object at the Chandra position. Our limits imply an efficiency in converting spin-down power into optical luminosity < 7 x 10 ^{- 7 } and < 6 x 10 ^{- 6 }, respectively, possibly close to that of the Vela pulsar.

40|$|US counter-narcotic {{policies}} towards Burma have {{possessed a}} singular-focus. In other words, {{they have been}} based on the traditional bilateral triumvirate strategies of eradication, education, and interdiction. Eradicate the crops used to produce illicit narcotics, interdict the flow of illicit drug traffickers, and educate the general population on the dangers of continual drug usage. In the country of Burma though, there are other US policies which also have a singular focus, which have undermined the effectiveness of these policies. Since the Burmese military regime's brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1988, the US has severed all economic relations with the country. The Burmese economy, which was already far from stable, fell into a downward spiral {{as a result of these}} US-led policies. This did not result in a democratic transition. Over seventeen years since these economic sanctions have been in place, the US has not achieved a peaceful regime change in Burma. Furthermore, the attempts to remove the significant flow of illicit narcotics from the country have failed as well. The reason these two singular-oriented policies have failed is that they are targeted at a country much more complex than these strategies have been designed to handle. First of all, there are 135 ethnicities in Burma, while only a small portion of the Burman population maintains political and economic control. Although this would result in ineffective policies with little collateral impact, the ruling Tatmadaw regime has manipulated these policies to commit ethnic genocide upon the ethnic minorities within their territory. Unless a re-assessment of these policies is undertaken by the US and its allies, the only result of their policies will be the elimination of millions of ethnic minorities in this totalitarian state. Therefore, the US must <b>re-assess</b> its <b>position</b> of isolating the Myanmar regime, and focus on a policy of engagement. Only if a structured and progressive incentive policy of economic development is created in conjunction with the regime, can the separate triumvirate policies of counter-narcotics against the ethnic minorities in Burma become effective.

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of the evolutionary relationships amongst the wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) is based on assessment of morphological similarity or phylogenetic analysis of {{a small number of}} taxa. In order to enhance the current understanding of lycosid relationships, phylogenies of 70 lycosid species were reconstructed by parsimony and Bayesian methods using three molecular markers; the mitochondrial genes 12 S rRNA, NADH 1, and the nuclear gene 28 S rRNA. The resultant trees from the mitochondrial markers were used to assess the current taxonomic status of the Lycosidae and to assess the evolutionary history of sheet-web construction in the group. The results suggest that a number of genera are not monophyletic, including Lycosa, Arctosa, Alopecosa, and Artoria. At the subfamilial level, the status of Pardosinae needs to be <b>re-assessed,</b> and the <b>position</b> of a number of genera within their respective subfamilies is in doubt (e. g., Hippasa and Arctosa in Lycosinae and Xerolycosa, Aulonia and Hygrolycosa in Venoniinae). In addition, a major clade of strictly Australasian taxa may require {{the creation of a new}} subfamily. The analysis of sheet-web building in Lycosidae revealed that the interpretation of this trait as an ancestral state relies on two factors: (1) an asymmetrical model favoring the loss of sheet-webs and (2) that the suspended silken tube of Pirata is directly descended from sheet-web building. Paralogous copies of the nuclear 28 S rRNA gene were sequenced, confounding the interpretation of the phylogenetic analysis and suggesting that a cautionary approach should be taken to the further use of this gene for lycosid phylogenetic analysis.
