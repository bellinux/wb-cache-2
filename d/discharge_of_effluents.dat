It can hold up to [...] of water and is designed to provide Jordan with water for both human consumption and agriculture. Water from the reservoir is diverted through a diversion weir at Addassiyah downstream of the Al-Wehda dam to the King Abdullah Canal where it is mixed with other freshwater sources. Some of the water from the canal is then pumped to Amman to be used as drinking water, after being treated in the Zai water treatment plant. The <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>effluents</b> from adjacent agricultural lands has caused algae growth and eutrophication especially in spring. Construction was funded by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (80%), the Abu Dhabi Development Fund (10%) and the Government of Jordan (10%). In February 2004 King Abdullah II of Jordan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched the construction of the dam.

40|$|Water is an {{essential}} part of all living organisms. In this connection water plays a most valuable and important role in the natural cycle. Among the whole water availability, only 3 % fresh water is available on the earth. In the available fresh water sources, entries of pollutants have been significantly increased from industries and domestic/anthropogenic activities. In this scenario the conservation strategies plays an important role in the conservation of fresh water bodies as well as water quality. Huge quantity of fresh water will be consumed for the production process which will be held in the industry.

The lack of piped water and sewage can exacerbate the water pollution problem through excessive contamination from excrements.

Moreover, the WFD suggests combining Lines of Evidence, whereby EBM results can be combined with other approaches such as emission inventories, pollutant concentration measurements and ecological monitoring data.|$|E
