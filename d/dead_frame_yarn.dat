50|$|Qualifying was {{introduced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 and, with 9 entries, two players were chosen to play a qualification match to reduce the field to 8. The two were Fred Davis, Joe's younger brother and Bill Withers, an unknown Welsh professional. Withers won the match 17-14, a defeat that Fred put down to ignoring his worsening eyesight. Unfortunately for Withers he met Joe in the quarter-finals. Davis won the first two frames before Withers won the third, doubling the final black to win the frame. This was to be Withers last frame as Davis won the next 14 to win the match 16-1. Davis then won the remaining 14 <b>dead</b> <b>frames,</b> to win 28 frames in succession. Davis and Horace Lindrum were not troubled in reaching the final, which was a repeat of 1936. Lindrum led 17-13 at the half-way stage, but Davis recovered to win the match 32-29. Davis made a break of 103 in the final, the first championship century in live play.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 {{the format}} was changed. All evenings {{in the league}} stage {{featured}} three matches: two semi-finals and a final. All matches were best of 5 <b>frames,</b> with no <b>dead</b> <b>frames</b> played, points were awarded for every frame won. Meaning that {{the maximum number of}} points a player can obtain was 24 and the minimum was 0. All frames were subject to a 20-second shot clock and the miss rule was changed; meaning that a player had three attempts to make legal contact with a ball or otherwise ball in hand was given to the incoming player anywhere on the table. The final frame of any match was played under shoot out rules. Each player appeared on 4 nights and was seeded to determine who they face. The play-offs were played to the rules used in previous editions. In 2012 the format of the event was changed back to the format used before 2011.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the championship, snooker had been seen, in the {{professional}} game, as secondary to billiards but from the mid-1930s snooker dominated. The 1935 Championship introduced some significant changes. It was the first to incorporate [...] "world" [...] in its name, being called the World's Professional Snooker Championship. There was also a change in the organisation of the event with the matches being played consecutively at the same venue, Thurston's Hall in London. Previously the draw had been made early in the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue of matches. The change in format proved a great success and Thurston's Hall became the primary venue for professional snooker matches. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, <b>dead</b> <b>frames</b> were played out, whatever the state of the game. This had often been the case in the early championships but now became universal.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{belongs to}} the field of textile machinery, and discloses weaving equipment and a weaving method of three-dimensional negative-poisson-ratio fabric. The weaving equipment of the three-dimensional negative-poisson-ratio fabric comprises a base, a yarn laying mechanism, an X-direction <b>yarn</b> storage <b>frame,</b> a Y-direction <b>yarn</b> storage <b>frame,</b> a laying <b>yarn</b> compaction mechanism and a Z-direction yarn binding mechanism. The weaving method comprises the steps that multi-layer yarns capable of forming a negative-poisson-ratio effect are laid in an X direction and a Y direction; the laid yarns in the X direction and the Y direction are bound by yarns in a Z direction; and an integral three-dimensional negative-poisson-ratio fabric structure is formed. The weaving equipment is simple in structure and convenient to operate, and damages the yarns less; the weaving method is flexible in technology; the edge of the fabric structure is closed; the integrity is good; the fabric laying thickness can be adjusted; the three-dimensional fabric with the negative-poisson-ratio performance can be woven; and positive-poisson-ratio fabric can also be woven. 本发明属于纺织机械领域，并公开了一种三维负泊松比织物的织造设备及其织造方法，该三维负泊松比织物的织造设备包括：基座、纱线铺层机构、X向纱线存储架及Y向纱线存储架、铺层纱线压紧机构和Z向纱线捆绑机构；该制作方法包括：先沿X和Y方向铺好能够形成负泊松比效应的多层纱线，然后通过Z向纱线对X和Y方向铺好的纱线进行捆绑形成整体三维负泊松比织物结构。本发明的织造设备机构简单，操作方便，对纱线损伤小；本发明的织造方法工艺灵活，织物结构边缘闭合，整体性好，织物铺层厚度可以调节，不但可以织造具有负泊松比性能的三维织物，也可以织造正泊松比三维织物。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 胡红Inventor name used in this publication: 张征凯Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種三維負泊鬆比織物的織造設備及方法Chin...|$|R

25|$|This is a later {{development}} of the ring spinning frame. The passage of the yarn from the front rollers to the paper tube - used {{in place of a}} bobbin - is different from other types of spinning <b>frames.</b> When the <b>yarn</b> leaves the rollers it passes direct to the top of an elongated spindle and coils round it two or three times before forming a balloon to the ring traveller. This enables the twist to be imparted between the spindle top and roller nip, thus helping to produce a smoother yarn.|$|R
5000|$|The final between Davis and Smith was {{originally}} planned for 6 days with 8 frames per day (9 {{on the final}} day). Davis won all four afternoon frames {{on the first day}} but Smith won three in the evening to leave Davis 5-3 ahead. On the second day Smith won all four afternoon frames to lead 7-5. At this point it seems that the match was reduced to five days since six frames were played in the evening. Davis won five of these to lead 10-8. He had a break of 53 in frame 14. On the third day Smith won three of the five afternoon frames while each player won three frames in the evening to leave Davis 15-14 ahead. Davis won three of the five frames on the fourth afternoon to leave the score at 18-16. Davis then won four of the five in the evening to extend his lead to 22-17. He had a break of 55 in frame 37. On the final afternoon Davis made a break of 72 to win frame 40, the highest of the match. He then won the next to lead 24-17 and, although Smith won the third, Davis won the last in the afternoon to take the match 25-18.

5000|$|The first {{championship}} {{was held}} in 1927 and was called the Professional Snooker Championship. It was the first important professional snooker tournament although the English Amateur Championship has been contested since 1916. Ten professionals entered including most of the leading billiards players. The draw was made {{at the start of}} the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue for the matches, although it was decided in advance that the semi-finals and final would be in Birmingham. Matches were over 15 frames with the semi-finals over 23 frames and final over 31 frames. The first match played was between Melbourne Inman and Tom Newman at Thurston's Hall, Leicester Square in London. The snooker was played as an added extra to the main event, a billiards match played over two weeks. The match started on Monday 29 November 1926 and one frame of snooker was played at the end of each session. Inman won 8-5, the match finishing on the Monday afternoon, a week after it started. One other match was played in connection with a billiards contest but the remaining matches were snooker-only matches. With minimal prize money, players mainly made money from their share of the gate receipts. Because of this it was common for [...] "dead" [...] frames to be played after the result of the match had been decided. The final between Joe Davis and Tom Dennis was played over four days in early May at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham. Davis won the first seven frames and led throughout, taking a winning 16-7 lead on the third day, eventually winning 20-11. The highest break of the tournament was 60, made by Albert Cope in his semi-final match against Davis, in a <b>dead</b> <b>frame</b> after Davis had won the match.
