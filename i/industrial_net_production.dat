To test these hypotheses, samples were fractionated by colony size with a sieving procedure {{during the summer of}} 2000. Each colony size class was analyzed for cell numbers, the proportion of microcystin-producing genotypes, and microcystin concentrations. The smallest size class of Microcystis colonies (100 μm) showed the highest proportion of microcystin-producing genotypes, the lowest proportion of non-microcystin-producing cells, and the highest microcystin cell quotas. The microcystin <b>net</b> <b>production</b> rate was nearly one to one positively related to the population growth rate for the larger colony size classes (> 100 μm); however, no relationship could be found for the smaller size classes. It was concluded that the variations found in microcystin <b>net</b> <b>production</b> between colony size classes are chiefly due to differences in genotype composition and that the microcystin <b>net</b> <b>production</b> in the lake is mainly influenced by the abundance of the larger (> 100 -μm) microcystin-producing colonies...|$|R

Although raloxifene {{is known to}} have anti-inflammatory properties, its effect on human neutrophils, the primary phagocytic leukocytes of the immune system, remain poorly understood. Here, through a screen of pharmacologically active small molecules, we find that raloxifene prevents neutrophil cell death in response to the classical activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA), a compound known to induce formation of DNA-based neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Inhibition of PMA-induced <b>NET</b> <b>production</b> by raloxifene was confirmed using quantitative and imaging-based assays. Human neutrophils from both male and female donors express the nuclear estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, known targets of raloxifene. Like raloxifene, selective antagonists of these receptors inhibit PMA-induced <b>NET</b> <b>production.</b> Furthermore, raloxifene inhibited PMA-induced ERK phosphorylation but not reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, pathways known to be key modulators of <b>NET</b> <b>production.</b> Finally, we found that raloxifene inhibited PMA-induced, NET-based killing of the leading human bacterial pathogen, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

The figure approximates the fraction of energy available after each stage of energy loss in a typical ecosystem, although these fractions vary greatly from ecosystem to ecosystem and from trophic level to trophic level. The loss of energy by a factor of one half from each of the steps of non-predatory death, defecation, and respiration is typical of many living systems.
