50|$|Media reports {{stated that}} due to Jones <b>default</b> <b>on</b> <b>payment,</b> Stevenson seized the {{property}} and offered to present the land to the city. While many focus {{on the lack of}} mortgage payments, it appears to be several years of unpaid city taxes that forced the issue. Both of Jones' sons had died, which brought this to light. The land reverted to the Callister estate, and Stevenson donated it to the city in lieu of paying the taxes on it.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{matching}} principle of accounting, revenues and expenses should be {{recorded in the}} period in which they are incurred. When a sale is made on account, revenue is recorded along with account receivable. Because there is an inherent risk that clients might <b>default</b> <b>on</b> <b>payment,</b> accounts receivable have to be recorded at net realizable value. The portion of the account receivable that is estimated to be not collectible is set aside in a contra-asset account called Allowance for doubtful accounts. At the end of each accounting cycle, adjusting entries are made to charge uncollectible receivable as expense. The actual amount of uncollectible receivable is written off as an expense from Allowance for doubtful accounts.|$|E

50|$|In finance, {{negative}} amortization (also {{known as}} NegAm, deferred interest or graduated payment mortgage) occurs whenever the loan payment for any period {{is less than}} the interest charged over that period so that the outstanding balance of the loan increases. As an amortization method the shorted amount (difference between interest and repayment) is then added to the total amount owed to the lender. Such a practice would have to be agreed upon before shorting the payment so as to avoid <b>default</b> <b>on</b> <b>payment.</b> This method is generally used in an introductory period before loan payments exceed interest and the loan becomes self-amortizing. The term is most often used for mortgage loans; corporate loans with negative amortization are called PIK loans.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{challenges}} facing Chitomborwizi have already been discussed. The roads in Chitomborwizi have not improved in the past decades or so but indeed the opposite has happened. The maintenance of is a responsibility shared between the government run DDF(District Development Fund under Ministry of Transport) and the rural district council. Both organisations are badly funded and managed. The latter relies on tax from farmers which is not enough and some farmers simply <b>default</b> <b>on</b> <b>payment.</b> Another element which is affecting Chitomborwizi is lack of funds. Farming is a business, time and again businesses need access to cheap/affordable capital to fund their business {{and this is not}} available to Chitomborwizi farmers. Farmers need to have boreholes so as to utilise their farms throughout the season and not rely on seasonal field crops only. Another problem facing farmers is skills shortage.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{concern on}} the {{security}} of the infrastructure, primarily that involving communications technology. Concerns chiefly center around the communications technology {{at the heart of the}} smart grid. Designed to allow real-time contact between utilities and meters in customers' homes and businesses, there is a risk that these capabilities could be exploited for criminal or even terrorist actions. One of the key capabilities of this connectivity is the ability to remotely switch off power supplies, enabling utilities to quickly and easily cease or modify supplies to customers who <b>default</b> <b>on</b> <b>payment.</b> This is undoubtedly a massive boon for energy providers, but also raises some significant security issues. Cybercriminals have infiltrated the U.S. electric grid before on numerous occasions. Aside from computer infiltration, there are also concerns that computer malware like Stuxnet, which targeted SCADA systems which are widely used in industry, could be used to attack a smart grid network.|$|E

50|$|During the Great Depression, land values {{plummeted}} {{and many}} of the large landholders (lumber companies) <b>defaulted</b> <b>on</b> <b>payment</b> of taxes rather than continue to maintain unprofitable investments in the land.

Mingo District was one of these.|$|R
