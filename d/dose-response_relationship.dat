5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationship</b> (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationship</b> between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E

30|$|In {{external}} beam radiotherapy, patient-specific treatment planning {{is a common}} practice because treatment planning is based on absorbed dose distributions and <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> for both tumor and normal tissues are relatively well known. However, for RIT, <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> have not been rigorously established and dose estimation has been less accurate and focused on calculating mean absorbed doses. In radionuclide therapy, the mean absorbed dose may not be useful for predicting tumor response and, in some cases, for predicting normal organ toxicity. Therefore, further investigation of <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> and development of dosimetry methods that provide dose-volume histograms and that incorporate radiobiological modeling for the clinical practice of radioimmunotherapy are highly desirable.|$|R

25|$|In Phase I {{clinical}} trials, curcumin had poor bioavailability, {{was rapidly}} metabolized, retained low levels in plasma and tissues, and was extensively and rapidly excreted, factors that make its in vivo bioactivity unlikely {{and difficult to}} accurately assess. Curcumin appears to reduce circulating C-reactive protein in human subjects, although no <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationship</b> was established. Factors that limit the bioactivity of curcumin or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution, extensive metabolism, and potential for toxicity.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of tissue}} residue allows an {{investigator}} to: account for multiple routes of exposure, account for toxicokinetic differences between species, account for factors that alter bioavailability and potentially address exposure of an organism to a chemical mixture. Tissue residue {{also has the}} ability to represent temporal and spatial exposure or an organism, as well as clarify the cause-effect relationship of chemicals. These relationships are often distorted by uncertainty in chemical bioavailability. The mechanism of action for a chemical depends on the internal tissue concentration, thus tissue residue gives researchers a more direct estimate of the residue-effect (<b>dose-response)</b> <b>relationship.</b> Tissue residue is also less variable than other measures of chemical exposure.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect sizes}} of very-low-dose doxepin in the {{treatment}} of insomnia range from small to medium. These include subjective and objective measures of sleep maintenance, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. Conversely, very-low-dose doxepin shows relatively weak effects on sleep initiation and does not significantly separate from placebo on this measure. This is in contrast to benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine (Z-drug) hypnotics, which are additionally effective in improving sleep onset latency. However, it is also in contrast to higher doses of doxepin (50 to 300mg/day), which have been found to significantly reduce latency to sleep onset. A positive <b>dose–response</b> <b>relationship</b> on sleep measures was observed for doses of doxepin between 1 and 6mg in clinical studies, whereas the incidence of adverse effects remained constant across this dose range in both young and older adults. However, the incidence of adverse effects appeared to increase with longer treatment duration. A dose of doxepin as low as 1mg/day was found to significantly improve most of the assessed sleep measures, but unlike the 3 and 6mg/day doses, was not able to improve wake time during sleep. This, along with greater effect sizes with the higher doses, was likely the basis for the approval of the 3 and 6mg doses of doxepin for insomnia and not the 1mg dose.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} study {{was performed to}} evaluate <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> and no-effect levels for sensitization and elicitation in skin- and respiratory allergy. With respect to the skin, <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> and no-effect levels were found for both intradermal and topical induction, {{as well as for}} intradermal and topical elicitation of allergenic responses in epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies. Skin damage or irritation may result in a significant reduction of the no-effect level for a specific compound. With respect to the respiratory tract, <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> and no-effect levels for induction were found in several human as well as animal studies. Although <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> for elicitation were found in some epidemiological studies, concentration-response relationships were present only in a limited number of animal studies. Reported results suggest that especially relatively high peak concentrations can induce sensitization, and that prevention of such concentrations will prevent workers from developing respiratory allergy. Moreover, induction of skin sensitization may result in subsequent heightened respiratory responsiveness following inhalation exposure. The threshold concentration for the elicitation of allergic airway reactions in sensitized subjects is generally lower than the threshold to induce sensitization. Therefore, {{it is important to consider}} the low threshold levels for elicitation for recommendation of health-based occupational exposure limits, and to avoid high peak concentrations. Notwithstanding the observation of <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> and no-effect levels, due to a number of uncertainties, no definite conclusions can be drawn about absolute threshold values for allergens with respect to sensitization of and elicitation reactions in the skin and respiratory tract. Most predictive tests are generally meant to detect the potential of a chemical to induce skin and/or respiratory allergy at relatively high doses. Consequently, these tests do not provide information of <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> at lower doses such as found in, for example, occupational situations. In addition, the observed <b>dose-response</b> <b>relationships</b> and threshold values have been obtained by a wide variety of test methods using different techniques, such as intradermal exposure versus topical or inhalation exposure at the workplace, or using different endpoints, which all appear important for the outcome of the test. Therefore, especially with regard to respiratory allergy, standardized and validated dose-response test methods are urgently required in order to be able to recommend safe exposure levels for allergens at the workplace.

40|$|Modelling-based {{studies to}} assess the extent and {{magnitude}} of ozone (O 3) risk to agriculture in Asia suggest that yield losses of 5 – 20 % for important crops may be common in areas experiencing elevated O 3 concentrations. These assessments have relied on European and North American <b>dose–response</b> <b>relationships</b> and hence assumed an equivalent Asian crop response to O 3 for local cultivars, pollutant conditions and climate. To test this assumption we collated comparable dose–response data derived from fumigation, filtration and EDU experiments conducted in Asia on wheat, rice and leguminous crop species. These data are pooled and compared with equivalent North American <b>dose–response</b> <b>relationships.</b> The Asian data show that at ambient O 3 concentrations found at the study sites (which vary between w 35 – 75 ppb 4 – 8 h growing season mean), yield losses for wheat, rice and legumes range between 5 – 48, 3 – 47 and 10 – 65 %, respectively. The results indicate that Asian grown wheat and rice cultivars are more sensitive to O 3 than the North American <b>dose–response</b> <b>relationships</b> would suggest. For legumes the scatter in the data {{makes it difficult to}} reach any equivalent conclusion in relative sensitivities. As such, existing modelling-based risk assessments may have substantially underestimated the scale of the problem in Asia through use of North American derived <b>dose–response</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R
