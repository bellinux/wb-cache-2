50|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} are {{primarily}} {{controlled by the}} amount of fuel supplied to the combustion chambers. With this in mind, the very simplest fuel control for a turbine engine is a fuel valve operated by the pilot. Many pre-production models of early turbojet engines featured just that, but it was soon found that this kind of control was difficult and dangerous in actual use. Closing the valve too quickly while trying to reduce power output could cause a lean <b>die-out,</b> where the airflow through the engine blows the flame out of the combustion chamber and extinguishes it. Adding fuel too quickly to increase power can damage the turbines due to excessive heat, or the sudden rise in combustion chamber pressure may cause a compressor stall. Another danger of too much fuel is a rich blow-out, where soaking the fire with fuel displaces the oxygen and lowers the temperature enough to extinguish the flame. The excess fuel may then be heated on the hot tailpipe and ignite, possibly causing damage to the aircraft. For an aircraft engine, changes in airspeed or altitude cause changes in air speed and density through the engine, which would then have to be manually adjusted for by the pilot.|$|E

40|$|Many {{systems in}} biology and {{chemistry}} are oscillatory, with a stable, spatially homogeneous steady state {{which consists of}} periodic temporal oscillations in the interacting species, and such systems have been extensively studied on infinite or semi-infinite spatial domains. We consider {{the effect of a}} finite domain, with zero-flux boundary conditions, on the behaviour of solutions to oscillatory reaction-diffusion equations after invasion. We begin by considering numerical simulations of various oscillatory predator-prey systems. We conclude that when regular spatiotemporal oscillations are left in the wake of invasion, these die out, beginning with a decrease in the spatial frequency of the oscillations at one boundary, which then propagates across the domain. The long-time solution in this case is purely temporal oscillations, corresponding to the limit cycle of the kinetics. Contrastingly, when irregular spatiotemporal oscillations are left in the wake of invasion, they persist, even in very long time simulations. To study this phenomenon in more detail, we consider the lambda-omega class of reaction-diffusion systems. Numerical simulations show that these systems also exhibit <b>die-out</b> of regular spatiotemporal oscillations and persistence of irregular spatiotemporal oscillations. Exploiting the mathematical simplicity of the lambda-omega form, we derive analytically an approximation to the transition fronts in r and theta(x) which occur during the <b>die-out</b> of the regular oscillations.

40|$|A dynamic {{population}} model of Hyalomma marginatum, the vector of several pathogens {{in the western}} Palearctic, was developed to simulate effects of temperature and water vapour deficit (VD) on tick survival, development rates and seasonality. Base tick survival and development rates were obtained from laboratory-controlled experiments or calculated from reported data. These rates were modelled as temperature-dependant time delays or accumulated mortality by temperature and water VD stress. Using daily data derived from a gridded data set at 10 -min resolution, the model reached stable and cyclical equilibria {{in an area that}} corresponds largely with the reported distribution of the tick in western Palearctic. The model did not identify a potential range of suitable climate for the tick out of the known distribution area, implying that under current climate conditions, there is no potential to spread at the spatial scale of the model. Tick <b>die-out</b> at northern latitudes was attributed to a steady increase in duration of the development rates of engorged nymphs to adults and hence increased mortality in this stage. Low developmental rates in northern latitudes produced the accumulation of most of the nymphal stock in late summer and early autumn, which cannot moult to adults because of the low temperatures of late autumn and winter. The tick did not produced selfsustained populations in areas where yearly accumulated temperatures were below 3000 – 4000 C, a limit roughly found at latitudes north of 47 ºN. Tick <b>die-out</b> in sites southern to 34 ºN was attributed to the mortality rates of engorged nymphs, which moult in late spring and summer, in the season where temperatures and water vapour stresses were highest.

The primary causal agent is the root rot fungi Phytophthora cinnamomi, although other soil pathogens play a role. Littleleaf is a disease of mature / overmature pines on eroded, compacted, and poorly drained sites {{with little or no}} effective A horizon containing organic matter. Symptoms are often mis-identified as a nutritional problem. Symptoms include needle yellow-ing, less than full needle elongation, and shorter shoot growth. Over time the root damage leads to crown decline (sparse, tip-concentrated needles on short shoots) which limits diameter growth. Ex-pected survival once symptoms arise can range up to 15 years. This disease is typically associated with shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata). The literature does have a number of citations where loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) declines under this disease complex.

The onset of the Holocene is marked by the reappearance of trees (mainly Alnus incana) within a fern and shrub dominated landscape. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) features shifting vegetational communities dominated by Alnus shrubs, diverse forb species, and locally abundant aquatic plants. The HTM is further defined by the first appearance of stone birch forests (Betula ermanii) – Kamchatka's most abundant modern tree species.

We then repeat this numerical study using piecewise linear spatial variation of parameters, rather than random variation, which also gives formation of target patterns under certain circumstances, which we discuss.

The distribution of microbial enemies was spatially and temporally variable, both among and within sampling sites. Obligate parasites, either with low host-specificity or having the ability to form an environmentally resistant propagule, are favoured in these ecosystems and are more frequent and abundant than facultative parasites. Three microbial enemies correlated, either positively or negatively, with PPN population size: Catenaria spp., Hirsutella rhossiliensis and Pasteuria penetrans. Microbial-enemy supported links in the food-web may be involved in the control of PPN populations through indirect effects. The endospore-forming P. penetrans was the most successful top-down control agent, and was implicated in the direct control of Meloidogyne spp. and indirect facilitation of Pratylenchus spp. Overall, our findings suggest strong and diverse top-down control effects on the nematode community in these natural ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} USJGOFS-AESOPS program, we {{deployed}} {{an array}} of moored sediment traps and determined the composition and vertical flux of particulate matter through the water column of the continental shelf environment of the Ross Sea. We deployed two moorings, with two traps each. One mooring was located in the southcentral Ross Sea {{along the line of}} AESOPS process studies; the other mooring was located in the northcentral Ross Sea. The flux in the southern Ross Sea was generally double that in the north, and there was a significant increase in flux into the deep traps indicating horizontal transport and possible focusing of particulate matter. The particles are primarily biogenic although lithogenic contributions can increase to over 30 % of the flux in the near-bottom trap nearer to the ice shelf. The fluxes collected by the traps were generally low but within the range of previous observations. Several unique observations stand out from these data: (1) The export of organic matter to 200 m during the spring and summer was extremely low, consistent with observations that the ongoing phytoplankton bloom was being stored or recycled in the upper-water column; (2) A major pulse of biogenic silica export occurred in the fall, just as ice was reforming. The correlation of this event with lithogenous particles, excess Fe, and with the early breakout of katabatic winds suggests that this event might be related to Fe fertilization of diatom production and export; (3) The largest flux of organic matter during 1996 - 1997 was carried by the pteropod Limacina helicina and was observed at both moorings under the ice in the late fall, just after the diatom pulse. Although it is difficult to estimate the proportion of these organisms that were swimmers contaminating the flux, we believe that a significant fraction settled into the traps and may represent the <b>die-out</b> of this herbivore population after the suspended POM concentration had dropped to very low levels. Fluxes to the upper traps were much lower than estimates of export flux made by other methods during synoptic ship studies. These differences are discussed and the fluxes are compared with preliminary data from the ROAVERRS trap program, which was simultaneously deployed in the Ross Sea...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Nosema disease, tracheal mites and the “pseudo-parasitic” behaviour of Cape honeybee workers when placed amongst African honeybees – {{known as the}} Cape Bee Problem – were studied over a 18 month period. Three surveys, approximately 6 months apart were done. The aims {{of this study were}} to establish the distribution and severity of the diseases and compare the disease with the presence of the Cape Bee Problem. Before this survey commenced European Foul Brood disease, Sacbrood (virus), Nosema, Brood nosema, and Tracheal mite have sporadically been reported in the summer rainfall region of South Africa. In the first survey 1005 colonies in 61 apiaries were surveyed, 803 colonies in 57 apiaries in the second, and 458 colonies in 41 apiaries in the third. Samples for disease and parasite analysis were taken at 4 colonies per apiary. Ten colonies per apiary were inspected for Cape Problem Bees, and samples of workers were collected and dissected at each of these colonies. Even with the addition of apiaries to 'fill-up' lost colonies during the second survey, 63 % of all colonies were lost by the third survey. There was only a small difference in colony loss between sedentary and migratory beekeepers of 22 % compared to 27 %. Nosema was more prevalent amongst commercial beekeepers and increased in migratory operations during the survey period. The percentage of colonies infected increased during the survey period from 23 % to 32 % to 34 %. The placement of colonies in Eucalyptus plantations may boost infection. Trachea mites seem to have spread quite rapidly in South Africa since its discovery. This parasitic mite was present in all regions, although in low numbers in three most northern regions. Sedentary colonies had higher levels of infestation than migratory colonies. The number of colonies infested diminished over the survey period, which may be a result of general colony loss. The Cape Problem Bee was less of a problem than anticipated. Colonies succumbed to Cape Problem Bees in all regions. When beekeepers reported high levels of infestation in their bee stocks the colonies would be dead within six months. In apiaries with low infestation the <b>die-out</b> was slower...|$|E
40|$|The {{explicit}} use {{of networks}} in modelling stochastic {{processes such as}} epidemic dynamics has revolutionised research into understanding the impact of contact pattern properties, such as degree heterogeneity, preferential mixing, clustering, weighted and dynamic linkages, on how epidemics invade, spread and how to best control them. In this thesis, I worked on mean-field approximations of stochastic processes on networks with particular focus on weighted and dynamic networks. I mostly used low dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and explicit network-based stochastic simulations to model and analyse how epidemics become established and spread in weighted and dynamic networks. I begin with a paper presenting the susceptible-infected-susceptible/recovered (SIS, SIR) epidemic models on static weighted networks with different link weight distributions. This work extends the pairwise model paradigm to weighted networks and gives excellent agreement with simulations. The basic reproductive ratio, R 0, is formulated for SIR dynamics. The effects of link weight distribution on R 0 and on {{the spread of the}} disease are investigated in detail. This work is followed by a second paper, which considers weighted networks in which the nodal degree and weights are not independent. Moreover, two approximate models are explored: (i) the pairwise model and (ii) the edge-based compartmental model. These are used to derive important epidemic descriptors, including early growth rate, final epidemic size, basic reproductive ratio and epidemic dynamics. Whilst the first two papers concentrate on static networks, the third paper focuses on dynamic networks, where links can be activated and/or deleted and this process can evolve together with the epidemic dynamics. We consider an adaptive network with a link rewiring process constrained by spatial proximity. This model couples SIS dynamics with that of the network and it investigates the impact of rewiring on the network structure and disease <b>die-out</b> induced by the rewiring process. The fourth paper shows that the generalised master equations approach works well for networks with low degree heterogeneity but it fails to capture networks with modest or high degree heterogeneity. In particular, we show that a recently proposed generalisation performs poorly, except for networks with low heterogeneity and high average degree...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} between people, technology and modern communication paradigms form large and complex human [...] machine networks. Complex network theory attempts {{to address the}} global and local behavior of such network structures. Of particular interest within the area of network theory is understanding the dynamic behavior of spreading processes on complex networks. In this work, we examine a variety of models covering the intersection of spreading processes and complex network theory, and although we study a large range of problem formulations, we find that [...] surprisingly [...] a single parameter effectively summarizes the topology. We begin by examining the effect that topology has on spreading processes in dynamic networks. Dynamic networks are becoming more common due to our increased reliance on and the functionality of mobile devices, smartphones, etc. Specifically, we ask, given discrete information spread through a proximity-based communication channel across dynamic network of mobile end-users, what criteria is required such that the information will ultimately die-out; that is, can we determine the tipping point between information survival and <b>die-out?</b> We show analytically that yes, such a threshold exists, yet it is computationally infeasible to calculate. To avoid such computationally intensive methods, we go on to provide two approximation methods for determining the tipping point. Next, we analyze the effect of topology on the propagation of competing information. Using a novel graph structure we refer to as a composite network, we model the intertwined propagation of competing information {{across a variety of}} underlying network layers. Through a combination of analytical and empirical methods, we show how the topology affects the competing information, and ultimately, using topology, we predict the winner of competition. Building on the success of the previous analyses, we formulate a model describing the spread of non-categorical information. Unlike our previous models, the information in this system is represented by a continuous value. We determine the phase transitions of the overall system, relate them to the tipping points in our previous models, and show both analytically and empirically how the structure of the network affects those phase transitions. Ultimately, for each of these models, a single topological parameter, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, is all that is necessary to characterize the effect of topology on the spreading process...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe endgame for polio {{eradication}} involves coordinated global {{cessation of}} oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) with cessation of serotype 2 OPV (OPV 2 cessation) implemented in late April and early May 2016 and cessation of serotypes 1 and 3 OPV (OPV 13 cessation) currently planned for after 2018. The logistics associated with globally switching all use of trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bivalent OPV (bOPV) represent a significant undertaking, which may cause some complications, including delays {{that lead to}} different timing of the switch across shared borders. MethodsBuilding on an integrated global model for long-term poliovirus risk management, we consider the expected vulnerability of different populations to transmission of OPV 2 -related polioviruses {{as a function of}} time following the switch. We explore the relationship between the net reproduction number (Rn) of OPV 2 {{at the time of the}} switch and the time until OPV 2 -related viruses imported from countries still using OPV 2 can establish transmission. We also analyze some specific situations modeled after populations at high potential risk of circulating serotype 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV 2) outbreaks in the event of a non-synchronous switch. ResultsWell-implemented tOPV immunization activities prior to the tOPV to bOPV switch (i. e., tOPV intensification sufficient to prevent the creation of indigenous cVDPV 2 outbreaks) lead to sufficient population immunity to transmission to cause <b>die-out</b> of any imported OPV 2 -related viruses for over 620 months after the switch in all populations in the global model. Higher Rn of OPV 2 at the time of the switch reduces the time until imported OPV 2 -related viruses can establish transmission and increases the time during which indigenous OPV 2 -related viruses circulate. Modeling specific connected populations suggests a relatively low vulnerability to importations of OPV 2 -related viruses that could establish transmission in the context of a non-synchronous switch from tOPV to bOPV, unless the gap between switch times becomes very long (> 620 months) or a high risk of indigenous cVDPV 2 s already exists in the importing and/or the exporting population. ConclusionsShort national discrepancies in the timing of the tOPV to bOPV switch will likely not significantly increase cVDPV 2 risks due to the insurance provided by tOPV intensification efforts, although the goal to coordinate national switches within the globally agreed April 17 -May 1, 2016 time window minimized the risks associated with cross-border importations. 2016 - 05 - 26 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 27230071 PMC 488082...|$|E
40|$|In Southern Asia the {{proportion}} of the population without access to improved sanitation facilities (sanitation facilities that “ensure hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact”) is below 50 % (WHO & UNICEF 2010). In Nepal, a country where only 31 % of the population has access to improved sanitation facilities, and 52 % practice open defecation, the situation is severe. Because of this, a location in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, was chosen for a case study for this thesis. The aim of this thesis is to give an overview of the condition of the treatment system at this location, and analyze the factors affecting sustainability, both from a technical and a social aspect. Various approaches are used in the attempts to improve the sanitation challenges, but not all are equally sustainable as the approaches to implementation and choice of facilities are diverse, and not always adjusted to local conditions. Examples of site-specific factors to consider when choosing an approach to implementation might be: economics, water availability, local culture, management, operation and maintenance and so on. The system studied in this thesis is a decentralized wastewater treatment system consisting of an ABR, two parallel horizontal flow constructed wetlands, and finally two parallel vertical flow constructed wetlands. In the constructed wetland the wastewater is treated by naturally occurring processes. Examples of such processes are; settling and straining of suspended solids and organic material, nitrification and denitrification of ammonia, <b>die-out</b> and predation of microorganisms. Among the advantages of a constructed wetland are low requirement of skilled labor for operation and maintenance and low construction costs. In order to identify the factors affecting the sustainability of a decentralized wastewater treatment system in Nepal, several investigations concerning treatment efficiency, knowledge, operation and maintenance were carried out. The factors are, for simplicity, divided into technical and social factors. The technical investigations consisted of analyzing samples from different stages in the treatment process; the samples were collected since startup of the system. The social investigations consisted of interviews with key persons connected to the system. The results from the technical investigations show that the treatment efficiency is fairly high, but the effluent values are not according to neither Nepali nor EU standards. The treatment system is not being operated and maintained in the optimal way, and some simple improvements may give better treatment efficiency. From the interview it is clear that there is great potential of improving knowledge and involvement of the user’s committee as well as the community...|$|E
