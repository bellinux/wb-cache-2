In that case the population field potential may be entrained by the rhythmic input, whereas the individual neurons are phase desynchronized both mutually and with their field potential.

40|$|Abstract. Neuroscience studies how a large {{collection}} of coupled neurons combines external data with internal memories into coherent patterns of meaning. Such a process is called “feature binding”, {{insofar as the}} coherent patterns combine together features which are extracted separately by specialized cells, but which do not make sense as isolated items. A powerful conjecture, with experimental confirmation, is that feature binding implies the mutual synchronization of axonal spike trains in neurons which can be far away and yet contribute to a well defined perception by sharing the same time code. Based on recent investigations of homoclinic chaotic systems, and how they <b>mutually</b> <b>synchronize,</b> a novel conjecture on {{the dynamics of the}} single neuron is formulated.

In this work, we propose to use two stacks of junctions shunted in parallel to achieve synchronization. The two stacks are <b>mutually</b> <b>synchronized</b> in the whole IV curve, and there is a phase shift between the plasma oscillation in the two stacks. The phase shift is nonzero when the number of junctions in different stacks is the same, while it can be arbitrary when the number of junctions is different. This phase shift can be tuned continuously by applying a magnetic field when all the junctions are connected by superconducting wires. Comment: 6. 2 pages and 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{prototype}} to <b>synchronize</b> the Peer-to-Peer <b>network</b> Kad is presented. The approach bases on a deterministic algorithm, which {{is required for}} hard real-time applications, to <b>synchronize</b> the <b>network</b> in a decentralized manner. Existing industrial Ethernet solutions include and support real-time capable machine-to-machine communication in automation sce-narios. However, the coordination of the communication and the synchronization to achieve hard real-time are managed by a central instance, leading to deficient resilience and scalability. Additionally, a centralized or hierarchical synchronization is required to enable the communication per se. The presented decentralized synchronization instead benefits from nodes helping to <b>synchronize</b> the <b>network</b> and bases on the decentralized structured Peer-to-Peer network Kad. However, the higher the number of helping nodes the higher is the time deviation on the nodes of the network, which contrary results in a higher time error. Therefore, a trade-off between synchronization performance and time error has to be determined to meet predefined constraints depending on the application scenario. Moreover, the individual clock drift of every device needs to be considered to define necessary re-synchronization intervals of the network. Theoretical values are compared to the measured values determined in experiments with 15 nodes. As {{a result of these}} experiments, the measured synchronization performance, which is the time needed to <b>synchronize</b> the complete <b>network,</b> confirms the theoretical worst case values.
