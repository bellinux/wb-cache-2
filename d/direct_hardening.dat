40|$|In {{this work}} the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} wear parts {{with respect to the}} different heat treatments applied have been investigated. Two different alloys and a total of nine different heat treatment procedures were tested. Alloy 35 M 13 B have been tested with respect to tempering temperature and represents one wear part. The other wear part 30 M 12 CB have been tested with respect to both tempering temperatures and effect of <b>direct</b> <b>hardening.</b> The main goal of this work has been to improve the understanding of how the steel alloys used for the wear parts responds to different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. During this work both alloys were tested using the following test methods; charpy impact testing, tensile testing and Vickers hardness testing. From production, wear part 30 M 12 CB as currently produced and when directly hardened was to be investigated for its mechanical properties, thus alloy 30 M 12 CB was heat treated at different temperatures with the aim to find two heat treatments that would match the wear parts pulled from production. The two chosen temperatures for 30 M 12 CB were 850 *C representing the current production and 1100 *C representing <b>direct</b> <b>hardening.</b> Then, wear parts 30 M 12 CB and 35 M 13 B was heat treated accordingly and tempered. The current tempering temperature of 220 *C was compared with 180 *C and no tempering. Charpy test specimens and tensile test specimens for 35 M 13 B and 30 M 12 CB were then tested with three parallels. The results recorded was then compared with respect to mechanical properties for the different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. For all parts the strength increased slightly by lowering tempering temperature from 220 *C to 180 *C. No tempering did not affect the ductility of 35 M 13 B and improved the strength and hardness for this alloy, in contrast no tempering left 30 M 12 CB- 850 very brittle. Directly hardening wear part 30 M 12 CB will result in a slight reduction in quality, however the difference in quality will likely be slightly greater than the results from this work indicates. It is reasonable to say that reducing the temperature of tempering for 35 M 13 B may be preferable as it saves space, reduces production time and cost, while maintaining or increasing the hardness and strength of the material. Further, the slight reduction in ductility should not lead to brittle fractures and thus may not affect the end product negatively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSteel alloys are the {{material}} that is most used in protective constructions today. The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. Case hardening is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. Case hardened products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. Case hardening is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by case hardening. Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by case hardening did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the case hardened steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the case hardening process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum case hardening process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce case hardened steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of case hardening courses. A total of 11 case hardening courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including <b>direct</b> <b>hardening,</b> a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple hardening. Before the case hardening the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the case hardened and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the case hardened samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the case hardening did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the case hardened target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|E

40|$|Press {{hardening}} of MnB steels to high-strength {{body parts}} {{is a key}} technology in the automotive industry for improving passenger safety and reducing car weight. The dominant method in automotive production is <b>direct</b> press <b>hardening,</b> which comprises the austenitizing of pre-cut 22 MnB 5 sheets in a roller hearth furnace and immediate hot forming, with simultaneous hardening (martensite formation due to rapid cooling). A metallic AlSi coating protects the steel sheets from scaling. Since, however, it melts at 600 °C, the coating is transferred onto the mullite conveyor rollers through the constant mechanical contact. Beside the formation of process-disturbing residues baked onto the rollers, this melt infiltrates the microstructure of the furnace rollers. The mullite phase of the roller material is dissolved, and a zonal microstructure is formed, leading to uncontrolled roller fractures and hence to production downtimes. The approach chosen for preventing this corrosive process and increasing plant availability of the roller-hearth furnace is a sol-gel composite coating using a transitory aluminum oxide sol as the binder phase. The suitability of various ceramic filler powders is tested {{in a variety of}} laboratory-scale tests imitating industrial service conditions.

40|$|Goal: The {{goal of this}} {{monograph}} is {{development of}} the tool materials being {{the outcome of the}} concept of merging the surface engineering as the domain of knowledge with technology which is the powder metallurgy. The result are the fabricated materials with the gradient, high-speed steels matrix composites (HSSMC) surface layers on steel substrate, combining the mutually exclusive mechanical properties like the high surface hardness and ductility of a tool. Project/methodology/approach: Modern powder forming technologies were used for fabrication of the developed tool materials, e. g., powder injection moulding, pressureless forming, and classic compacting. Sintering was carried out in the vacuum or protective atmosphere conditions, which makes <b>direct</b> material <b>hardening</b> possible from the sintering temperature. Testing of mechanical properties encompassed hardness testing, bending strength testing, and determining the abrasion wear resistance. Detailed structural examinations were carried out to determine the effect of temperature and atmosphere during sintering on type and size of the carbide- and carbonitride precipitations. Moreover, retained austenite portion was determined after hardening and tempering. Achievements: The original achievement is development of the method of the polymer-powder slurry moulding for fabrication of coatings which, because of the binding agent degradation and sintering, form the homogeneous or gradient HSSMC surface layers on the steel substrate - completed or fabricated in the same technological process. Tool materials fabricated with this method are characteristic of high ductility of the steel core and high hardness of the surface layer. Limitations of research/applications: The assumption of the powder injection moulding technique is forming of the small elements with complex shapes and, therefore, this technology is not designed for fabrication of tools with the big overall dimensions. In case of the pressureless forming of the surface layers from HSSMC on the steel core or in case of regeneration of the tool worn out, the limitations come only from the heating device chamber size and the necessity to heat up the entire treated element. Practical applications: It is anticipated that the worked out and fabricated tool materials of the new generation will fill a gap in respect of the mechanical properties between the relatively ductile high-speed steels and the brittle sintered carbides. The newly developed method may be used in the mass- or piece production conditions making, e. g., regeneration possible of the costly tools’ surfaces.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{relative}} freezing {{resistance of}} tissues in the stem, foliage and buds of terminal twigs from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) was investigated at about ten-day intervals from summer {{until the following}} spring. Tissues from growing twigs collected before development of dormancy had no freezing resistance and were killed immediately after subcooling. Tissues {{at the base of}} inner bud scales and in the pith of stems at the base of buds were among the last to harden in autumn. Pith parenchyma and pith rays of the interfascicular region of the bud trace and the transfusion tissue in needles were most susceptible to injury after development of freezing resistance. Abaxial mesophyll was more susceptible to injury than adaxial mesophyll of hardened needles. The cortex was more resistant than other tissues during development of freezing resistance but parenchyma of the pith lost freezing resistance more slowly and was more resistant after growth processes resumed in the spring. The phloem-cambium region of the stem lost freezing resistance earlier and became more susceptible to injury than other tissues of the twig after midwinter 0 Survival of the vegetative apex depended on the ability of its water to subcool. Heat of fusion of water on freezing produced a sharp exotherm that was a precise index of the temperature at death and freezing resistance of the vegetative apex. Prolonged subfreezing temperatures after development of freezing resistance in late autumn increased hardiness of twigs beyond that induced by the natural environment 6 Both formation of ice in the pith of stems enclosed by coriaceous bud scales, and artificial dehydration reduced water content and promoted subcooling and freezing resistance of vegetative apices. Moisture content was reduced from 200 to 70 percent on a dry weight basis after three days at _ 90 C in early February and freezing resistance of apices increased 0 0 0 from - 16 C to - 20 C when cooled at 1 C per minute 0 These findings suggested that diffusion of water from the protoplasm to sites of extracellular ice, and not low temperature, was the <b>direct</b> cause of <b>hardening</b> at subfreezing temperatures 0 The basic freezing curve for Douglas-fir is characteristic of plant tissues in general but was modified by exotherms associated with freezing and death of vegetative apices from November until April. A decline n length of the plateau after the second subcooling temperature during hardening, and increase in length of the plateau during loss of hardiness reflected probable seasonal change in quantity of intracellular water. Unhardened tissues survived freezing of extracellular water but were injured before intracellular water was completely frozen. Hardened tissues, on the other hand, were not injured until after most of the intracellular water was frozen and the cooling rate of the stem returned to normal. Observations suggested a definite relationship between time of acquisition and loss of freezing resistance and number of days to bud burst after March 31. Trees which developed freezing resistance earliest in fall broke buds earliest in spring. Trees which broke buds latest in spring were also those which were the last to deharden, Ready availability of potassium appears to enhance early development and loss of freezing resistance. Trees with the highest content of potassium in the current season's foliage burst buds earliest and those with the lowest content of potassium were the last to burst buds. Night temperatures of 20 C delayed but did not prevent loss of hardiness when day temperatures were 250 C in March. However, continuous temperature of 2 ° C failed to reharden twigs that had lost freezing resistance at 25 ° C. Injury to all tissues, except the vegetative apex, declined at 250 C in March when moisture stress exceeded a critical level. These observations suggest that environ mental conditions unfavorable for growth enable Douglas-fir to maintain resistance to injury from spring frosts...|$|R
