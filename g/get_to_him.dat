25|$|By this time, Konnan was {{beginning}} to distrust B.G. {{to the point of}} not even recognizing him as a member of 3LK. Ron Killings, however, still trusted B.G.

James was upset that Konnan had let The Outlaw <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> so badly, and left the Impact! Zone alone.|$|E

500|$|As a side-effect of the Orochi's curse, {{the flames}} of the Yagami have a bluish tint. The curse also causes each heir to die young and each mother to die in childbirth. Iori suffers from an {{additional}} curse - [...] - when he becomes faster, more powerful, wilder, and tends to attack anybody near him indiscriminately. In this state Iori is commonly named [...] "Wild Iori" [...] or [...] Iori hates the Kusanagi clan because of this curse, but later becomes obsessed with killing its heir Kyo, disregarding their clans' past.

2500|$|King {{made a great}} {{start to}} his Premier League career as he opened up with an 8–1 victory over Sky {{wildcard}} Wayne Mardle. He {{then went on to}} record three more victories on the bounce beating James Wade 8–1, John Part 8-2 and Jelle Klaasen 8–4. He then faced defending champion Phil Taylor in Newcastle, recording a 7–7 draw despite leading 7–5 with both players averaging over 100. King's form then dropped, only winning two more games in Birmingham and Glasgow against Mardle and Wade respectively. King was also a controversial figure during the tournament, often letting the crowd <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and affect his mood and darts. During a 2009 Premier League match with Taylor, he threw a dart over Taylor as he stooped down to pick up his flight. During the post-match interview, neither of them would look at each other. Another Premier League crowd at Newcastle in 2010 appeared to shake him with taunts that resulted in him stopping mid-throw and making gestures towards the fans. Five-time world champion Eric Bristow claimed that King [...] "needs a strait jacket" [...] after the performance. His final position of 4th in the league was influenced by the illness of Mardle, as he was withdrawn from the competition. Therefore, all results that included Mardle were annulled, including King's two victories over Mardle. King's fourth place in the overall league meant that he faced Taylor in the play-off semi-finals at the Wembley Arena. King won 10–6 to end Taylor's winning streak in Premier League competitions. Despite this victory he was to finish runner-up as he lost the final 13–8 to Wade, who beat Raymond van Barneveld 10–8 in the other semi-final. Wade led King 8–2 before a mini comeback from King but Wade was able to see the game out to claim his maiden Premier League Darts title.|$|E
