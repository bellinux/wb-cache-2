40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a machine {{learning}} approach to title extraction from <b>general</b> <b>documents.</b> By <b>general</b> <b>documents,</b> we mean documents that can belong {{to any one}} of a number of specific genres, including presentations, book chapters, technical papers, brochures, reports, and letters. Previously, methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from <b>general</b> <b>documents.</b> As a case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from <b>general</b> <b>documents.</b> Precision and recall for title extraction from Word is 0. 810 and 0. 837 respectively, and precision and recall for title extraction from PowerPoint is 0. 875 and 0. 895 respectively in an experiment on intranet data. Other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain, and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to another language. Moreover, we can significantly improve search ranking results in document retrieval by using the extracted titles...|$|E

40|$|As the {{structure}} of organizations which developed {{in the direction of}} the needs of the society has become more complicated, the problems stemming from human factor increased and there arose a need o investigate these problems. Employees spend a period of eight hours at their workplaces. Therefore, the personel considentions of employees about their jobs becomes an important issue to be looked into. Inadequate organization of the State's archival units in Turkey is a by-product of their ineffective status in the institutions to which they are attached. Further more, it seems that the qualifications and professional formation of the personnel employed in these units are not adequately taken into account. This study aims at establishing how the personal qualifications and lack of professional formation of the staff employed in the public archival institutions affect their assessment of job satisfaction. In the light of this, our hypothesis is as follows: In our country, the expectations of staff working in public institutions and organization archives in relation to job satisfaction in the out of the criteria which consist of "belief in the significance of the work done", "finding the work done worth doing", "appropriateness of the work to the knowledge and skills", individual properties and work safety. These criterias are (physical) working conditions, wages, appreciation, possibility of promotion, the facility of obtaining information about work from administrator and colleageus, group work and individual work, social facilities provided by the institution (such as nursery, camp, consumption cooperation, etc.), distribution of authority and responsibility and participation in decision-making. It can be looked for the reasons of that situation in the staff working in public institutions and organizations archives have not taken enough education of archives studies. In our study 197 out of 234 members of staff in seven public institution archives, were surveyed the institutions are Turkish Republic Prime Ministry Undersecretariat of Treasury, <b>General</b> <b>Documents</b> and Branch Directorate; Turkish Republic Prime Ministry, Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade, <b>General</b> <b>Documents</b> and Branch Directorate; Foundations General Directorate Culture and Registration Office Directorate Archives; State Planning Institution <b>General</b> <b>Documents</b> and Branch Directorate; Ministry of Agriculture <b>General</b> <b>Documents</b> and Branch Directorate, Hacettepe Hospital Medical Documentation Center and Archives). As a result of our study, it was established that the job satisfaction of personnel working in public institution archives was affected not by factors like individual properties (gender, age, marital status, education level, status, seniority in public work etc.) fear of losing one's job, belief in the significance of the work, the worth doing, but by wage, appreciation, the opportunity of obtaining information from administrator and colleagues, authority- responsibility balance, opportunity of promotion and the facilities provided by the institutions...|$|E
