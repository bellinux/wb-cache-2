A case study was undertaken in five companies with production facilities in the Netherlands, that want to make their business more sustainable: DSM Resins, Hermadix, Philips Electronics, Thermphos and Vliegenthart. All five companies monitor developments in (future) governmental regulation, not only in their home country, but also in other countries. Public debates on substances are also monitored. These are seen as indicators for future loss of exiting markets shares, and as early signal of new or upcoming markets. In all the cases, the innovations concerned only a part of the company’s business. Most innovations require some sort of co-operation in the production chain from suppliers and/or customers. The acceptance of the innovation by customers and the general public can greatly complicate and delay the innovation process.

40|$|This paper aims to {{make two}} {{conceptual}} contributions to the <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> literature. Firstly, we propose that the greening process can be conceptualized as an issue lifecycle dynamics with multi-dimensional struggles between ‘greening’ pressures and industry response strategies. To capture the endogenous dynamics, we develop a Dialectic Issue LifeCycle model with five phases, which conceptualize how these struggles play out over time. Secondly, we propose that issue lifecycle dynamics are also influenced by (external) alignments with contextual field-level developments. This proposition accommodates the notion that industries not only face ‘green’ issues but also other relevant pressures. We apply the model to a historical case study: air pollution problems and responses from American automakers (1943 – 1985). The case study presents a good match with the first three phases of the model, but shows deviations in {{the fourth and fifth}} phase, which are due to: a) decreasing pressure from public opinion; b) limited spillovers from air pollution to consumer demand; c) rise of competing issues; and d) strong resistance from the car industry. The findings underline that the <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> cannot be fully understood by looking only at the focal issue (e. g. air pollution).

40|$|Sustainability and <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> {{have become}} a part of the {{construction}} industry where environmental classification systems have become more common today. A case study research with qualitative interviews was conducted with a large construction company in Sweden in order to investigate the implementation of an environmental classification system, BREEAM, and how it affects the organization. By collecting the view from both top managers and construction projects, a broad view within the company is presented. The paper provides a discussion based on theories within sustainability, organizational change and standards. The overall view is that BREEAM adds an additional value to the buildings, and generates a more environmentally aware organization. The BREEAM process is not integrated into the construction process, which has contributed to a slow implementation process. This can be changed through increased support, evaluation of the system and clearer communication between different levels and business areas in the organization.

40|$|The {{focus of}} {{institutional}} theory is directed towards {{an understanding of}} situations such as those depicted in Rachel Carson's quote above – situations where context is strong and binding, yet subtly experienced; where agency is often diffuse, embodied in an arrangement or system of actors rather than in an individual; and where action and inaction both matter, if in often unpredictable ways. One area in which these phenomena are notably pronounced is {{research in the area}} of the interaction between institutional systems and the workings of the natural environment; the ways in which human societies both understand their interface with that environment, and the ways in which the actions of one impact the other. In this chapter, we offer an overview of that domain of research, tracing the evolution of efforts at combining the two since its beginnings in the early 1990 s, when the <b>Greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>Industry</b> Network initiated its environmental management research collection (1989), the Organizations and the Natural Environment special interest group of the Academy of Management was formed (1994) and the seminal Special Issue on environmental management was published in the Academy of Management Review (1995) ...|$|E

While the role played in this process by fiscal and industry policies (e. g. carbon taxes and other market-based incentives) is well understood (even if not pursued currently in Australia), the potentially powerful leverage to be exercised by trade policy is under-recognised. There are some positive developments such as a proposed Environmental Goods Agreement being discussed in Geneva, while there are negative developments embodied in various bilateral and regional trade agreements such as the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, to which Australia has committed itself. There are rising levels of conflict over trade and climate change mitigation measures, in actions brought at the WTO against countries looking to promote green industries through measures like local content requirements being attached to foreign direct investment, or by countries imposing border tax adjustments against exporters who allegedly fail to implement carbon taxes.

40|$|Green Growth and Climate {{mitigation}} have rapidly come {{to present}} {{one of the}} main grand societal challenges expected to have pervasive impacts on the global economy. However, theoretical and empirical insights into the greening of the economy are poor. Standard neoclassical economic research has failed to realize that markets are going green. But also evolutionary economics has neglected to address the role of environmental issues on economic evolution. The novel concept of eco-innovation is increasingly connected to green growth, but is in need of further clarification. This paper suggests that the concept of eco-innovation could represent the evolutionary economic analysis of the <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> and the economy. The paper seeks to {{contribute to the development of}} evolutionary eco-innovation theory starting with a fundamental discussion on defining eco-innovation. Hitherto eco-technologies or eco-innovations have been defined in technical terms. This paper suggests interpreting eco-innovation in economic terms. Eco-innovation is defined as innovations that attract green rents on the market. Hence the concept of eco-innovation reflects innovative changes in the economic system measuring the degree to which environmental issues are becoming integrated into the economic process. Following this definition the eco-innovation concept is inherently linked to green competitiveness and the greening of the economy.

Recent increases in EU activities and the proximity to market stage of the first plant-made pharmaceuticals, some of which from EU based companies, represent a call to action for EU regulators. Drawing on the North American debate on molecular farming it will be argued that both the rationale of and the risk issues associated with molecular farming will differ significantly from those of first generation GM crops. Based on these differences, the suitability of the existing regulatory framework, which essentially was developed in response to the arrival of insecticide and herbicide tolerant crops for food and feed use, is discussed. Possible options for adapting the already complex EU regulatory system to cater for molecular farming are examined. It will be argued that the policy challenges posed will inevitably spark a broader public debate. As an issue for debate, molecular farming is located at two crossroads: of the risk debate on agricultural biotechnology and the sustainability debate on renewables and <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> and of red and green biotechnology.

Perusing the range of literature on these subjects it quickly becomes clear that this interest stretches across previously clear defined academic (and also managerial) boundaries. Traditionally organisational identity has been the concern of the organisation and economic literature as a way of organising. Organisational studies literature has focused on internal aspects of both organisational identity and image (Albert & Whetten, 1985). Weber argued that bureaucracies [something about the control of bureaucracies]. More recently attention has turned towards organisational identity and image as a way of organising external stakeholders. A burgeoning literature on corporate branding (Balmer, 1995) and reputation management (Dowling, 1993) are witness to the role of image and identity in developing relations with the organisation's external publics. Building from product branding principles where products are imbibed with a brand identity (Aaker, 1996), focus has shifted towards to possibilities to develop corporate brands. In this way corporate image and identity are seen as both ways of organising and of ways of marketing; corporate branding in other words crosses the boundary between the internal and the external. The need to integrate communication to internal and external stakeholders is increasingly seen as a strategic necessity.
