25|$|While overall, India’s total {{volume of}} {{imported}} crude {{has only been}} rising slightly from 3.2 million b/d in 2009-10 to 3.44 million b/d in 2012-13, imports from Iran <b>have</b> <b>basically</b> been fluctuating around 250,000 b/d from 2012 to 2013 and thus rising proportionally due to a halt for Iranian exports to Europe. The recent detainment of an Indian tanker by Iranian officials is unrelated to the oil embargo, but {{in an effort to}} save over USD 8.5 billion in hard currency, and realising a 180-day waiver from US sanctions, India plans to increase Iranian imports by 11 million tons for 2014, in addition to the two million tons of crude oil shipped from Iran by June 2013, up 21.1% from last year.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we <b>have</b> <b>basically</b> achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing Shaved Fish, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks. He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him.

However, he did slightly criticize the episode's padding—specifically Nora Dunn's role as Fletcher's wife and the Duck Soup mirror gag—but argued that [...] "for every bit that doesn’t play in the episode, there are three that do." [...] Todd VanDerWerff, also from The A.V. Club, gave the second half of the episode a B– and wrote, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>basically</b> nothing to add to what Zack said about the first 'Dreamland' last week. 'Dreamland II' is a fairly unnecessary hour of television, and there’s no reason this logy two-parter couldn’t have become a much tighter one-hour episode." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote that [...] "my final judgement on 'Dreamland' [...] is that I enjoyed the entertainment value it presented. It was fun and I'm not one to begrudge a little romp now and then." [...] Kessenich, however, did note that the second part [...] "felt strung out". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson, however, saw the episode in a more positive light and said, [...] "Season six included some more excellent episodes only peripherally related to the main story arc, [...] Dreamland parts one and two". Kerry Fall from DVD Journal wrote positively of the episodes and described them, together as [...] "one of the best episodes in years". Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone gave {{the first part of}} the episode an 8 out of 10 rating and highlighted the [...] "strong story-telling, clever dialogue, and good acting". Earl Cressey from DVD Talk concluded that both [...] "Dreamland" [...] parts one and two were among the [...] "highlights of season six".
