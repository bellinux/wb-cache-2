5|$|Instead of copying {{traditional}} academic postures, Rodin preferred his {{models to}} move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast <b>in</b> <b>bronze</b> or carved from marble. Rodin's {{focus was on}} the handling of clay.|$|E

5|$|A {{piece of}} {{slightly}} later date, the Dardanelles Gun (see picture), was cast <b>in</b> <b>bronze</b> and made in two parts: the chase and the breech, which, together, weighed 18.4tonnes.

Created by Munir Ali in 1464, the Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 300 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation. Turkish forces loaded the ancient relics with propellant and projectiles, then fired them at the British ships. The British squadron suffered 28 dead through this bombardment.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took {{on their}} larger scale, which was {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. As {{a matter of}} practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work <b>in</b> <b>bronze</b> using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{a popular}} icon in South India, in {{contrast}} to North India, where it is of lesser importance. Though Bhikshatana {{does not have any}} temples dedicated to him as the primary deity, he is sculpted in stone temple walls, worshipped as a subsidiary deity, and cast <b>in</b> <b>bronze</b> as a temple festival processional icon in almost every major Tamil Shiva temple. Many Tamil language hymns sing of Bhikshatana's wanderings, often narrating of the pining of the love-smitten who are enamoured of him.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece <b>in</b> <b>bronze,</b> and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|I {{believe that}} my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast <b>in</b> <b>bronze</b> (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E
5|$|Images of Bhikshatana {{are found}} {{throughout}} Shaiva temples of South India, but are almost unknown in Northern India. Sculpted in stone adorning the temple walls {{of every other}} South Indian temple, images of Bhikshatana are also cast <b>in</b> <b>bronze</b> as processional icons. In South Indian temples, Bhikshatana is prescribed to be enshrined as an avarana-devata (a deity depicted on the circumambulatory path encircling the central shrine). Similarly in Orissan temples, Bhikshatana may be worshipped and depicted as parshva-devata (an attendant deity) or avarana-devata.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Bronze</b> Age Britain {{this was}} an {{important}} seaport. Eleven Bronze Age Britain round barrows sit on the promontory with two more a little further inland.
