Ten artefacts were investigated by scanning electron microscopy – energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM–EDS) to visualize the corrosion and characterize the heterogeneities in the metal and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) to determine separately the compositions of the intact metal and of the corrosion product. It is shown that the corroded surfaces are highly depleted in zinc but that representative concentrations can be determined by sampling the deeper, uncorroded metal. In contrast, lead values are highly variable because of the heterogeneous distribution of this metal within the bulk copper. Despite these problems, brass is easily identifiable and American native copper and <b>European</b> <b>smelted</b> copper can be unambiguously distinguished with LA–ICP–MS on unprepared artefacts using As, Ag, Ni and Sb trace elements...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 354 adult <b>European</b> <b>smelts</b> Osmerus eperlanus (L.) were tested {{for their ability}} to survive the screen system of the cooling water inflow of a power plant. With {{increasing}} number of musculature parasitic third-stage larvae of Pseudoterranova decipiens, the survival rate of O. eperlanus decreased while the total number of externally visible injuries as well as the number of seriously injured specimens increased. The results indicate that even a single specimen of P. decipiens influences resistance and stamina and affects overall mortality of 7 to 20 cm long smelts. The initial effect of the parasites is to reduce swimming speed of infested fish, which leads to more frequent contact of these fish with the fine meshed screen of the cooling water inlet before they are removed by the automatic cleaning system. If the separated fishes are returned to the main stream, it becomes apparent that the cooling water inflow selectively reduces the number of living parasitised smelt in the area. Thus, the number of parasitic third-stage P. decipiens larvae in the local smelt population which are able to complete their life-cycle is also reduced. P. decipiens makes infested smelt more susceptible to negative anthropogenic influences such as cooling water intake or trawl fisheries...|$|R
5000|$|During {{and after}} the Conquest, the working of the metal by the {{indigenous}} was disrupted. Many of the villages of the Pátzcuaro area were abandoned in large {{part due to the}} abuses by conquistador Nuño de Guzmán. The Spanish were soon aware of the copper deposits of this region and the indigenous’ ability to work it. Since they were necessary to exploit this wealth, the Spanish worked to bring them back into the area into settled communities under their control. Vasco de Quiroga brought various kinds of craftsmen from Spain to the Pátzcuaro area to develop the region’s economy. Santa Clara founded by friar Francisco de Villafuerte and put under the direct protection of the Spanish Crown. Its foundation would later be attributed to Vasco de Quiroga, probably due to his work establishing copper smithing. [...] The Spanish introduced <b>European</b> <b>smelting</b> techniques and organized the work by family owned workshops, passed down from generation to generation, which remains in effect to this day. Uses for copper during the colonial period was mostly for arms and for cooking utensils. It is not known when Santa Clara began to specialize in copper work as much of its records have been lost due to various fires over its history. The earliest surviving record is from 1748 and notes the working of the metal to be well-developed.|$|R

50|$|The third {{programme}} {{explores the}} growing influence {{of people on}} the land. After the last ice age, Europe's mild climate and virgin forests attracted human and animal immigrants, including moose, bear, deer and wild boar. The agreeable climate also attracted immigrant farmers from Mesopotamia to the eastern Mediterranean, and reliable food supplies encouraged permanent settlement. By 3000 BC, civilization had spread to western megalithic sites such as Stonehenge and Carnac. Bronze Age <b>Europeans</b> discovered the <b>smelting</b> process, leading to a period of conflict and conquest over valuable metal ores. The Roman Empire was born, and a massive road-building enterprise ensued, enabling a flow of trade, livestock, ideas and culture. A sudden cooling of the climate may have precipitated its collapse. In the Middle Ages, cultures such as the Vikings were influenced by the land and the sea, while in southern Spain the Moors introduced new irrigation canals. A fresh onslaught on Europe's forests supplied timber for boat-building, housing and fuel. Rats brought the Black Death into Europe's new towns and cities, killing half the human population. It would be 250 years before the numbers recovered, but this allowed wildlife some breathing space. The medieval voyages of discovery brought new plants and animals to the continent, including the potato. The Industrial Revolution made Europe rich, but at great cost to its natural resources. The birth of tourism encouraged a new appreciation of nature, and modern Europeans have switched their attitude from consumption to custodianship. As a result, wildlife is returning.|$|R
50|$|The Short-beaked garfish (Belone svetovidovi) is an {{uncommon}} species of needlefish {{in marine waters}} of the Eastern Atlantic ocean. It is a pelagic needlefish that is present in Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. It is possible Belone svetovidovi is thriving in the Mediterranean Sea as well. This species {{was thought to be}} the same as the Garfish (Belone belone) because they share the same waters. Belone svetovidovi matures at 30 cm (12 in) and can grow to a maximum of 65 cm (26 in) while Belone belone can be 95 cm (38 in). Like all needlefish, this one has an elongated body with beak-like jaws that are lined with razor sharp teeth. The Short-beaked garfishs' lower jaw is longer than the upper. Its body is silvery like most needlefish and has a black stripe running across its lateral line. The dorsal and anal fins are very close to the caudal peduncle. These fish are Oviparous. Eggs may be found attached to objects in the water by tendrils on the egg's surface. They are spherical eggs that are dispersed on the sea floor (demersal). There is not much known about this fish's feeding habits, or anything about this fish for that matter. It is likely it preys on small ocean going fish. It has been caught using mackerel before. Needlefish tend to be towards the surface so fish such as Atlantic Mackerel, <b>European</b> pilchard, Sand <b>smelt</b> etc. would be preyed on. The Short-beaked garfish is likely distributed in these countries: Algeria, Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.|$|R

The {{local and}} global {{dimensions}} of metaliferrous air pollution derived from a reconstruction of an 8 thousand year record of copper smelting and mining at a desert-mountain frontier in southern Jordan. Journal of Archaeological Science 34, 83 - 110 This paper establishes an eight thousand year history of anthropogenic metal pollution {{at one of the}} oldest, most important and longest sustained sites of the extraction and smelting of copper ores in the Old World: the Faynan Orefield in Jordan, which is located between the hyper-arid southern desert and the front of the wetter Mountains of Edom. The modern land surface is shown, in significant part, to be a complex palimpsest of archaeological sites, metal pollution of various ages and ore processing deposits. Quantitative and qualitative observations of the storage and cycling of heavy metals through the local natural and domestic systems have produced a body of information on processes with which the past has been interpreted. Heavy metal concentrations in semi-continuous sedimentary bodies indicate that over the last 1500 years, metals were removed by natural processes at a comparatively slow rate given the scale of the original anthropogenic metal burden: the proportions of lead with respect to copper have increased as the overall metal burden has been lowered. Distinctive anthropogenic metal-pollution signatures have been detected in ash- and charcoal-rich deposits that were discarded onto the banks of a perennial stream in the late Neolithic. At present, the nature of the human activities that might have produced these pollution signatures is unknown. Substantial metal pollution from industrial-scale smelting activity was present from the Early Bronze Age. The intensity of heavy metal pollution produced in Classical Times locally exceeded that recorded at major <b>European</b> copper <b>smelting</b> centres in the nineteenth century A. D. The pollution evidence indicates that intensive copper smelting at the immediate area took place until approximately the end of the Byzantine period; {{with the exception of one}} further minor episode of smelting radiocarbon dated to cal. BP 530 - 330. An observed partial, but perhaps significant, parallelism is also noted between this local record and the records of the metal burdens of the northern hemisphere determined at mire or ice-sheet sites at high-altitudes or high-latitudes. The paper discusses the extent to which this parallelism might be a geochemical indicator of the actual existence of ''economic systems'' of a geographical scope and scale to have both exercised substantial ''pull'' upon the resources of such isolated and difficult locations at the Wadi Faynan, and to have generated sufficient overall metal pollution to have materially altered the chemistry of the global atmosphere. The comparative absence of quantitative information upon the nature, spatial scale and impacts of human, industrial and natural processes affecting metal-pollution in other metal-rich arid lands provides a significant impediment to such approaches that seek to research ''locally and think globally''.

40|$|Concentrations {{of mercury}} (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) have been {{investigated}} in whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus, n = 41), <b>European</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus eperlanus, n = 29), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus, n = 27), perch (Perca fluviatilis, n = 26), brown trout (Salmo trutta, n = 22), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, n = 14), northern pike (Esox lucius, n = 11), tench (Tinca tinca, n = 4) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius, n = 2), in Lake Norsjø, southern Norway. In addition, the stable isotope ratios  15 N and  13 C have been analysed to reveal variations in trophic position and carbon source, both within and between fish species. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were far below the consumption limits in Norway, i. e. 0, 2 μg Cd/L; 1 μg Pb/L). Only 5, 6 % of the analyzed individuals had Pb-concentrations > the detection limit for Pb (0, 1 mg Pb/kg ww), while none of the individuals exceeded the detection limits for Cd (0, 005 mg Cd/kg ww). The Hg levels varied within and between the fish species. Totally 9 fish had Hg-concentrations above the consumption limit of 0, 5 μg Hg/L, 5 pikes, 2 Arctic char, 1 brown trout and 1 <b>European</b> <b>smelt.</b> The highest concentration, 1, 44 mg Hg/kg ww, was both measured in a brown trout and a northern pike. The δ 15 N and δ 13 C values varied from 7, 2 ‰ to 13, 6 ‰ and - 20, 2 ‰ to - 33, 5 ‰ respectively. The results on δ 15 N indicate a food web consisting of 4 consumer levels. The δ 13 C signatures indicate that Arctic char, <b>European</b> <b>smelt</b> and sub-populations of whitefish primarily feed in the pelagic zone ( 13 C between - 28 and - 34), while the  13 C in perch, brown trout and the other sub-population of whitefish had heavier  13 C signatures, indicating fish feeding in the littoral zone of the lake. All fish species (except Atlantic salmon) exhibit significant correlations (p < 0, 05) between Hg and age, weight and length. Only adult individuals of Atlantic salmon, returned from the sea to River Skienselva for spawning, were incorporated in the study. Low concentrations and minor variations in the Hg-levels (0, 07 – 0, 14 mg Hg/kg ww) in this marine derived individuals, are {{the main reasons for}} no correlation between Hg and age, weight and length for this species. Within each species, no significant correlations were found between Hg and  15 N, but a weak but significant (r 2 = 0, 074, p < 0, 001) positive linear relationship was found when plotting all the fish species together, indicating biomagnification along the food web. The high 15 N signature in the dwarf population of Arctic char is likely a consequence of low condition factor, as transamination and deamination normally occur during starvation. These processes imply isotope fractionation of nitrogen and consequently a heavier  15 N signature...|$|E

The use of Sr and Ba otolith profiles and their dissolved concentrations in the three aquatic systems provided a robust method for habitat classification and migration behaviour of the 111 individual smelts. No evidence was found of the migration of individuals from the Wadden Sea to the Ijsselmeer due to no marine Sr/Ba signal in the Ijsselmeer smelt. The Ba and Sr concentrations in the otoliths of Wadden Sea smelt suggest a mixture of two populations: juveniles that were born in the Wadden Sea and species that were born in Lakes IJsselmeer or Markermeer and migrated to the Wadden Sea. In the IJsselmeer different types of otolith profiles were observed depending on the migration history of the individuals in that lake: some individuals have probably not moved a lot, others may have used tributaries (e. g. the river IJssel) as spawning grounds or migrated from Markermeer to Ijsselmeer...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between poor {{water quality and}} migration opportunities for fish remains poorly documented, although it is an essential research step in implementing EU water legislation. In this paper, we model the environmental constraints that control the movements of anadromous and catadromous fish populations that migrate through the tidal watershed of River Scheldt, a heavily impacted river basin in Western Europe. Local populations of sturgeon, sea lamprey, sea trout, Atlantic salmon, houting and allis shad were essentially extirpated around 1900. For remaining populations (flounder, three-spined stickleback, twaite shad, thinlip mullet, European eel and <b>European</b> <b>smelt),</b> a data driven logistic model was parameterized. The {{presence or absence of}} fish species in samples taken between 1995 and 2004 was modelled as a function of temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, river flow and season. Probabilities to catch individuals from all diadromous species but three-spined stickleback increased {{as a function of the}} interaction between temperature and dissolved oxygen. The hypoxic zone situated in the freshwater tidal part of the estuary was an effective barrier for upstream migrating anadromous spawners since it blocked the entrance to historical spawning sites upstream. Similarly, habitat availability for catadromous fish was greatly reduced and restricted to lower brackish water parts of the estuary. The model was applied to infer preliminary dissolved oxygen criteria for diadromous fish, to make qualitative predictions about future changes in fish distribution given anticipated changes in water quality and to suggest necessary measures with respect to watershed management...|$|E

While no variation in single-stranded ITS- 1 and ITS- 2 profiles was detected among samples representing each of the species or populations (with the exception of slight microheterogeneity), SSCP analysis of the ITS- 2 amplicons allowed the unequivocal differentiation of all of the 5 sibling species of P. decipiens (s. l.) examined, which was supported by sequence differences in ITS rDNA. Samples representing the P. decipiens (s. l.) population from O. eperlanus had the same SSCP profile as those of P. decipiens (s. s.), which was supported by a lack of nucleotide difference in the ITS between them, suggesting that the former represented P. decipiens (s. s.). Based on SSCP results and ITS sequence data, P. decipiens (s. l.) from C. aceratus was genetically most distinct with respect to all other members of Pseudoterranova examined, which indicated that it may represent P. decipiens E (based on geographical origin) or a distinct species.

By this sampling strategy, we have obtained unique information about the seasonal use of the profundal habitat among > 15 fish species present in the lake. However, besides a very few individuals of perch (Perca fluviatilis, n = 4) and one individual of Nortern pike (Esox lucius) and brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), respectively, only Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), <b>European</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus eperlanus) and whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) were caught. While A. char was present in the profundal habitat all year, E. smelt were only absent in June, and whitefish was primarily present during the winter, December-March. The main reasons for searching to this poor, cold and dark habitat, are primarily predator avoidance, interspecific competition, hatching and subsequent feeding on row. The various use of the profundal habitat among fish species, have primarily been linked to age, length and weight, stomach analyses and stable isotope signatures, δ 13 C and δ 15 N, in fish muscle. By also comparing the number of gill rakers (NGR) in whitefish caught by gill nets in a nearby littoral area, we revealed two morphs of whitefish, a profundal morph (NGR = 26. 5 ± 0. 4) and a littoral morph (NGR = 32. 0 ± 0. 6). The varying degree of habitat use (profundal, pelagic, littoral) among fish species and morphs, has further been shown to have implication for the mercury (Hg) concentration in fish, as baseline Hg and fish growth differ between different lake habitats.

The main goal of this dissertation {{was to investigate the}} Hg content in fish from lakes with different environmental characteristics, including both natural and wildfire impacted lakes, and to discuss different factors affecting the Hg content in biota. The fieldwork of this thesis was conducted in several lakes: two relatively big lakes in Telemark county (Lake Norsjø and Lake Heddalsvatn) and in nine small boreal acidic lakes located in a wildfire impacted area in Mykland, southern Norway. Hg concentrations were investigated in various fish species as well as in macroinvertebrates. In addition, stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) were measured in fish and macroinvertebrates. The δ 15 N signatures were used for estimates of trophic position, while the δ 13 C signatures were used to estimate the relative contribution of food derived from littoral or pelagic habitats. For the wildfire study, water samples were collected monthly over four years and analyzed for the main water chemical parameters. Fish were also sampled during 2008, 2010 and 2012 to evaluate potential year differences on Hg, δ 13 C and δ 15 N. Food web transfer of total Hg (THg) was studied using trophic magnification slopes (TMS), i. e. slopes of the linear regression between log-transformed Hg and relative trophic position (stable nitrogen isotope, δ 15 N) in biota, and used as indicators of the biomagnifying potential of Hg in different aquatic ecosystems. The TMS values ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 25 and varied depending on the ecosystem characteristics and physico-chemical parameters such as temperature related processes, total organic carbon (TOC) or pH. These values indicated trophic magnification factors of Hg ranging from 3. 6 to 7. 1 per trophic level. Seasonal variations of Hg concentrations were investigated in Lake Heddalsvatn during December, May and September, in three fish species. Results showed that there were seasonal differences, but the causes varied depending on the fish species. Fish caught in December (European whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus; northern pike, Esox lucius) had the highest Hg concentrations, while the concentrations in May were higher than in September for all three species, statistically significant (p < 0. 0001) for European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and close to significant for pike (p = 0. 07). Somatic growth dilution was the most likely explanation for the perch population, whereas for whitefish and pike this mechanism could not be the explanatory factor as there was no measurable growth from May to September. We used the δ 13 C signatures of primary consumers from pelagic and littoral habitats in a simple two-source mixing model to estimate the relative dietary contribution in fish from food derived from the littoral or pelagic habitats in Lake Norsjø. Perch exhibited the highest zoobenthos reliance (89 ± 14 %), while <b>European</b> <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus eperlanus) exhibited the lowest (37 ± 7 %). The most intermediate δ 13 C signatures, i. e. supported by a mixed diet of littoral and pelagic food webs, were found in piscivore species with the highest trophic position, and the subsequent highest Hg concentrations both in Lake Norsjø and Lake Heddalsvatn. The changes in water chemistry in the wildfire affected area were studied for over 4 years (2008 - 2012) following the fire. There were large lake-to-lake variations and hydrological conditions such as heavy rain or snowmelt periods were the main reason for the most severe water chemical episodes. There was an initial drop in the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of the lakes two months after the fire, due to a faster mobilization of sulfate and chloride ions compared to base cations. An initial decrease in TOC and increase in nutrient runoff (nitrogen, N, and phosphorous, P) were observed in the initial post-fire period, followed by a gradual decrease in N and P, and increases in TOC. The water chemical conditions were almost re-established one year after the wildfire and had almost returned to pre-fire levels {{four and a half years}} after the fire. A water survey analysis was conducted in June 2012, four years after the fire, and the concentrations of THg and MeHg ranged between 1. 17 - 2. 63 ng L- 1 and 0. 053 - 0. 188 ng L- 1, respectively. Both variables were strongly and positively correlated to TOC and TOC-related variables such as color or UV absorbance, and with total-P and total iron. MeHg was also positively correlated with total-N and chlorophyll-a. There was no conclusive evidence that the fire affected the Hg concentrations in fish, but generally higher levels were found two years after the fire. Increased nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentration in the lakes might be key factors to explain this increment. Natural factors as yearto- year variations in thermocline depth or suboxic status in lakes make it difficult to draw any strong conclusions about direct wildfire effects on Hg in the biota from the investigated lakes...|$|E
40|$|The Schelde is a lowland river {{originating}} {{in the northern part}} of France (St. Quentin), and entering the North Sea near Vlissingen, The Netherlands. The estuary covers about half of its length (355 km) as the tidal influence is stopped by sluices near Gent 160 km upstream. We focused on the Zeeschelde, the estuarine part in Flanders comprising a mesohaline, an oligohaline and a freshwater tidal zone. The Zeeschelde is subject to severe eutrophication as it receives high inputs from domestic, industrial and agricultural activities. The ecological values and nature conservation interests of the Zeeschelde are taken into consideration by a series of (inter) national policy instruments, aiming at a sustainable management and conservation of this aquatic environment. As a result several management plans apply also to the Zeeschelde or to parts of it. The most far-reaching plans are the Long Term Vision for the Schelde estuary (LTVS) and the updated Sigmaplan which combine ecological rehabilitation and sustainable habitat creation with flood control measures and navigation requisites. Compliance with almost all national and international agreements requires monitoring of biota. In the WFD fish is one of the biotic quality elements to be used in order to assess the ecological status of transitional waters. Species composition, abundance and the proportion of disturbance-sensitive species should be quantified. Any distortion attributable to anthropogenic impact is calculated by means of the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR), representing the difference between monitored data and reference conditions. The fish-based assessment tool that we developed was designed to comply with these criteria. In addition it can be used on a metric level to assess fish species of special interest under the Habitats Directive. The fish assemblages in the Zeeschelde were described based on sampling results recorded over a period of 13 years. An overview was provided of the temporal and spatial variation in those assemblages along the salinity gradient in the Zeeschelde estuary (Chapter 2). The species richness and abundance increased over these years in the different salinity zones of the Zeeschelde. Between 1991 and 2008 a total of 71 fish species were recorded within this part of the estuary. Each salinity zone is characterised by a typical fish assemblage, although some species are shared between all three zones. The observed increase since 2007 in species richness in the freshwater and oligohaline zones coincides with a remarkable increase in dissolved oxygen. Guild specific qualitative Maximal and Good Ecological Potential (MEP/GEP) lists were composed for the different zones within the Zeeschelde estuary and its tidal tributaries (Chapter 3). The geographical range and ecological demands of the detected fish species were assessed. The outcome was decisive for acceptance within these lists, which served to develop a fish-based index for the Zeeschelde. In chapter 4 the ecological goals and associated habitat needs were described for fish populations in estuaries. The Zeeschelde was presented as a case study for the description of ecological goals for the fish species listed in the MEP/GEP lists. In order to make the method more widely applicable we first classified fishes into guilds, relevant for the formulation of ecological goals. Next we described guild-specific ecological goals and defined habitat needs linked with a proper functioning of the estuarine ecosystem. The habitat needs ensure the completion of all lifecycle stages: spawning, breeding, feeding and growth to maturity. A hierarchical approach was adopted to define the goals and habitat needs: from a regional scale to habitat level. On a regional and basin wide scale the essential habitat need is connectivity, on an estuarine scale this is space and on a habitat scale diversity is most important. The proposed ecological goals need further quantification. However in general the rehabilitation of marshes and mudflats and the enhancement of flood control areas as fish habitats, with special attention for connectivity with the estuary, will significantly increase the carrying capacity of the Zeeschelde for most of the relevant populations. In Chapters 5 and 6 two essential habitat needs are discussed in detail. In chapter 5, we modelled the environmental constraints controlling the movements of anadromous and catadromous fish populations that migrate through the tidal watershed of the river Schelde. For remaining diadromous populations (flounder, three-spined stickleback, twaite shad, thinlip mullet, European eel and <b>European</b> <b>smelt)</b> a data driven logistic model was parameterized. We modelled the presence/absence of fish species in samples taken between 1995 and 2004 as a function of temperature, dissolved oxygen, river flow and season. We demonstrated that it is possible to make acceptable predictions about the future spatiotemporal distribution of migrant fishes, even if only relatively limited information is available. An important management issue that derived from our study is that it is essential to avoid at all times DO concentrations below 5 mg l- 1 in the freshwater and brackish tidal estuary of the watershed. Restoration of habitats such as marshes and mudflat areas will enhance aeration of the water and help to avoid severe DO drops. The use of tidal marshes for fish and the influence of creek characteristics on the visiting fish assemblages were assessed (Chapter 6). As expected the influence of the salinity gradient is reflected in the different fish assemblages. We caught a high proportion of juveniles suggesting that the creeks are a juvenile habitat. The highest fish abundance was recorded in summer (after hatching) because then juveniles seek shelter in the creeks. It was also observed that the visit frequency was related to creek dimensions and inundation time. Larger creeks, lower in the tidal frame and with a more complex structure, as they include side creeks and permanent pools, are of higher interest for fish. We also observed a positive effect of rivulets on the mudflat adjoining the tidal marsh as they guide the fish towards the creeks. These observations are important for the design of tidal wetland restoration projects. In chapters 7 and 8 different approaches to define a fish-based evaluation tool to assess the ecological quality status of an estuary (the Zeeschelde) were described. The fish index comprises metrics which are ecologically relevant variables that are sensitive to human pressures. A first step in the selection of these metrics consisted in assessing how they evolve along a pressure gradient (graphical selection). In chapter 7 a new concept in the index development was introduced i. e. the balance between type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors. The magnitude of these errors was expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). Graphical screening assured the selection of metrics responsive to anthropogenic degradation. We scored metrics by judging the metric value variation in the best available site (quintiles). A forward stepwise regression selected the metric with the best balance between the type I and type II error. Metric selection was continued until the lowest AUC was obtained. To define the EBI thresholds we fixed the maximum type I error of each integrity class threshold at 10 %. It was a major concern that not all quality classes can be discriminated because of unbalanced pre-classification data. Secondly the final index had a high type II error, although we believe both types of error should be small. Therefore in the next chapter a different approach was used in order to obtain a better index. In chapter 8 we described the development of a Zone specific fish-based multimetric Estuarine index of Biotic Integrity (Z-EBI) based on fish surveys data from the Zeeschelde estuary (Chapter 2). Again we pre-classified sites using indicators of anthropogenic impact and selected metrics showing a monotone response with pressure classes for further analysis. Metric values were calculated using pooled annual data within one salinity zone and expressed as catch per unit effort. Metrics were selected using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with a redundancy test. We defined thresholds for the Good Ecological Potential (GEP) from salinity zone specific references developed in chapter 3. andapplied a modified trisection for the other thresholds (moderate, poor and bad). The Z-EBI is defined by the average of the metric scores calculated over a one year period within each zone and translated into an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) to comply with the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The indices integrate structural and functional qualities of the estuarine fish communities and can be used to assess the ecological quality of the Zeeschelde. We successfully validated the Z-EBI performances for habitat degradation in the various habitat zones. With this new index we encompass small temporal and spatial variations within the estuary. It accounts for the seasonal variation and covers the complete salinity zone, which is an improvement compared to the previous index. The developed indices are able to make the distinction between impacted and unimpacted (GEP) status. Our results showed that the ecological status of the Zeeschelde at present varies from bad to moderate. A comparison of the average scores obtained with EBI and Z-EBI indicated that in those cases where a different appreciation appeared, the EBI scores lower. This confirms our view that local and temporal appreciations are too sensitive to small variations, which do not necessarily represent an overall negative impact on the ecosystem functioning. Implementing rehabilitation and conservation measures will improve the ecological quality status of the Zeeschelde. At present the Z-EBI corresponds best with the demands from the different legislations and provides the most holistic information from an ecological point of view...|$|E
