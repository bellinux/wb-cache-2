50|$|One notable way {{in which}} <b>ISO</b> <b>{{character}}</b> sets differ from code pages is that the character positions 128 to 159, corresponding to ASCII control characters with the high-order bit set, are specifically unused and undefined in the ISO standards, though they had often been used for printable characters in proprietary code pages, a breaking of ISO standards that was almost universal.|$|E
50|$|Technical {{lettering}} is {{the process}} of forming letters, numerals, and other characters in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for an object. With the goals of legibility and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a Gothic sans-serif script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of machines. ISO Lettering templates, designed for use with technical pens and pencils, and to suit ISO paper sizes, produce lettering characters to an international standard. The stroke thickness is related to the character height (for example, 2.5mm high characters would have a stroke thickness - pen nib size - of 0.25mm, 3.5 would use a 0.35mm pen and so forth). The <b>ISO</b> <b>character</b> set (font) has a seriffed one, a barred seven, an open four, six, and nine, and a round topped three, that improves legibility when, for example, an A0 drawing has been reduced to A1 or even A3 (and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed &c). When CAD drawings became more popular, especially using US American software, such as AutoCAD, the nearest font to this ISO standard font was Romantic Simplex (RomanS) - a proprietary shx font) with a manually adjusted width factor (over ride) to make it look as near to the ISO lettering for the drawing board. However, with the closed four, and arced six and nine, romans.shx typeface could be difficult to read in reductions. In more recent revisions of software packages, the TrueType font ISOCPEUR reliably reproduces the original drawing board lettering stencil style, however, many drawings have switched to the ubiquitous Arial.ttf.|$|E
40|$|This {{study on}} {{legibility}} {{takes a different}} approach than the studies that precede it. Standardized test targets (<b>ISO</b> <b>Characters)</b> were used as the measurement device instead of the various means used previously. This was done to keep the test more objective. Twelve papers of different gloss and smoothness values were tested with two groups [...] college students and senior citizens. These experiments were done under controlled conditions with the only variable being the paper. The average results from the legibility readings were correlated against the physical properties of the paper samples. The {{results of this study}} showed a 2 and 4 % correlation between college students and smoothness and gloss respectively. No correlation could be obtained between senior citizens and gloss and smoothness. Here the <b>ISO</b> <b>Characters</b> did not work as a test of legibility but rather as a test of visual acuity...|$|R

40|$|The {{characters}} {{presented in}} this document are those from the PDAM ballot document plus some of the proposed characters from National Body comments. Characters that {{were not part of}} the ballot document have been highlighted. Most of the characters {{presented in this}} document have been reviewed by the Unicode Technical Committee — where they have been approved by UTC for addition to a future version of the Unicode Standard, that information is presented in a marginal note. A series of $$$ $ indicates the presence of a issue that needs to be resolved as part of synchronization. Manner of Presentation The characters have been presented in the same style that would be used for publishing the Unicode Standard, with the addition of marginal notes documenting the source of the characters. This was done deliberately {{in order to be able}} to document some of the draft annotations for the reviewers. The character names and code points shown are the ones that will be used in the FPDAM, with exception of any <b>ISO</b> <b>character</b> name comments and Annex P annotation ‘*’, which are suppressed in this style of presentation. Where such omission occurs, it has been noted in an annotation. Unlike the presentation style to be used for the actual FPDAM, but like document N 2676 which this document replaces, the new characters are not shown in the context of the existing characters. The existing characters will be shown in the actual PDAM document. The occasional use of the word in this draft is an artifact of the production proces...|$|E
40|$|Feedback {{provided}} by the Antarctic community has proven instrumental in positively influencing {{the direction of the}} GCMD's development. For example, in response to requests for a stand alone metadata authoring tool, a new shareable software package called docBUILDER solo will be released to the public in March 2006. This tool permits researchers to document their data during experiments and observational periods in the field. The international polar community has also {{played a key role in}} encouraging support for the foreign language character set in the metadata display and tools (10 % of the records in the AMD hold foreign characters). In the upcoming release, the full <b>ISO</b> <b>character</b> set, which also includes mathematical symbols, will be supported. Additional upgrades include the ability for users to search for data sets based on pre-selected temporal and spatial resolution ranges. Data providers are strongly encouraged to populate the resolution fields for their data sets, although these fields are not currently required. In prior versions, browser incompatibilities often resulted in unreliable performance for users attempting to initiate a spatial search using a map based on Java applet technology. The GCMD will offer an integrated Google map and date search, replacing the applet technology and enhancing the geospatial and temporal searches. It is estimated that 30 % of the records in the AMD have direct access to data. A growing number of these records can be accessed through data service links. Related data services are therefore becoming valuable assets in facilitating the use and visualization of data. Users will gain the ability to refine services using the same options as those available for data set searches. Data providers are encouraged to describe available data-related services through the directory. Future plans include offering web services through a SOAP interface and extending semantic queries for the polar regions through the use of ontologies. The Open Archives Initiative's (OAI) Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (PMH) has been successfully tested with several organizations and appears to be a prime candidate for sharing metadata within the community. The GCMD anticipates contributing to the design of the data management system for the International Polar Year and to the ongoing efforts in the years to come. Further enhancements will be discussed at the meeting...|$|E
