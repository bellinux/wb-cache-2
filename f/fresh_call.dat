40|$|In practice, many {{call center}} forecasters use the total inbound volume to make forecasts. In reality, besides the <b>fresh</b> <b>calls</b> (initial call attempts), {{there are many}} redials (re-attempts after abandonments) and reconnects (re-attempts after {{answered}} calls) in call centers. Neglecting redials and reconnects will inevitably lead to inaccurate forecasts, which eventually leads to inaccurate staffing decisions. However, most of the call center data sets do not have customer-identity information, which {{makes it difficult to}} identify how many <b>calls</b> are <b>fresh.</b> Motivated by this, the goal {{of this paper is to}} estimate the number of <b>fresh</b> <b>calls,</b> and the redial and reconnect probabilities. To this end, we propose a model to estimate these three variables. We formulate our estimation model as a minimization problem, where the actual redial and reconnect probabilities lead to the minimum objective value. We validate our estimation results via real call center data and simulated data. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a retrial queueing {{model for a}} base station in cellular networks where <b>fresh</b> <b>calls</b> and handover <b>calls</b> are available. <b>Fresh</b> <b>calls</b> are initiated from the cell of the base station. On the other hand, a handover call has been connecting to a base station and moves to another one. In {{order to keep the}} continuation of the communication, it is desired that an available channel in the new base station is immediately assigned to the handover call. To this end, a channel is reserved as the guard channel for handover calls in base stations. Blocked <b>fresh</b> and handover <b>calls</b> join a virtual orbit and repeat their attempts in a later time. We assume that a base station can recognize retrial calls and give them the same priority as that of handover calls. We model a base station by a multiserver retrial queue with priority customers for which a level-dependent QBD process is formulated. We obtain Taylor series expansion for the nonzero elements of the rate matrices of the level-dependent QBD. Using the expansion results, we obtain an asymptotic upper bound for the joint stationary distribution of the number of busy channels and that of customers in the orbit. Furthermore, we derive an efficient numerical algorithm to calculate the joint stationary distribution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates a multiserver infinite-source retrial {{queueing}} {{system for}} the performance modeling of cellular mobile communication networks. The objective is to demonstrate how performance tool MOSEL (Modeling, Specification and Evaluation Language) can be efficiently used in the modeling of cell based networks. In our analysis the blocked and dropped users are treated separately, that is they redial with different probabilities and different rates, with reducing the state space by maximizing the number of redialing customers with appropriately large values (i. e. when the ignored probability mass can be neglected). The guard channel scheme {{is included in the}} model, too. The novelty of our analysis is that not only the active but also both types of redialing customers are allowed to depart to other cells, which was not the case in the previous works. The model description is translated step by step into the description language of MOSEL, and then it is automatically converted into the other tool-specific system descriptions and analyzed by the appropriate tools. As the benefit of the tool the effects of various system parameters on the <b>fresh</b> <b>call</b> blocking probability, on the handoff call dropping probability and on the grade of service are displayed and analyzed graphically...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a mobile cellular communications system. Two types of call requests {{arrive to the}} base station of each cell: arrivals stream 1, that are those calls in progress that were originated in another cell and are subsequently handed over to our cell; and arrival stream 2, that are calls originated in our cell. Three new handoff prioritization schemes for channel assignment have been considered. In all of them, traffic stream 1 (handoff traffic) is treated with priority with respect to traffic stream 2 (<b>fresh</b> <b>calls).</b> New call requests are queued in case no channels {{are available at the}} arrival instant. Handover calls are treated according to a blocked call model. We apply the generating function method combined with spectral expansion tools to the analysis of the models. As a result, numerically efficient and stable closed-from expressions for performance evaluation are obtained. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In mobile {{cellular}} networks the handover (HO) {{algorithm is}} responsible for determining when calls of users that are moving from one cell to another are handed over from the former to the latter. The admission control (AC) algorithm, which is the algorithm that decides whether new (<b>fresh</b> or HO) <b>calls</b> that enter a cell are allowed to the cell or not, often tries to facilitate HO by prioritising HO calls in favour of <b>fresh</b> <b>calls.</b> In this way, a good quality of service (QoS) for calls that are already admitted to the network is pursued. In this paper, the effect of self-optimisation of AC parameters on the HO performance {{in a long term}} evolution (LTE) network is studied, both with and without the self-optimisation of HO parameters. Simulation results show that the AC parameter optimisation algorithm considerably improves the HO performance by reducing the amount of calls that are dropped prior to or during HO...|$|R
