5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather <b>Dunbar</b> (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from <b>Dunbar,</b> at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after <b>Dunbar,</b> Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

5|$|After the {{execution}} of the King in January 1649, England was declared a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at <b>Dunbar</b> in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied the country in 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at <b>Dunbar</b> the Kirk became deeply divided, partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as the Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and the more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|Charles Edward Greene {{was born}} September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas. He played high school {{football}} at <b>Dunbar</b> High School in Temple. Despite Greene's talents, the <b>Dunbar</b> Panthers had a mediocre record, {{and he was not}} heavily recruited by colleges. His options were limited further due to segregation of the Southwest Conference. He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas), where he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. He led the team to a 23–5–1 record during his three seasons. In his 29 games at defensive tackle, North Texas State held the opposition to 2,507 yards gained on 1,276 rushes, a per-carry average of less than two yards. Greene was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection.|$|E

5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} {{the front door of the}} jail and a few minutes later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John <b>Dunbar,</b> Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while <b>Dunbar</b> and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E

5|$|Between 21 and 23 April 1567, Mary {{visited her}} son at Stirling {{for the last}} time. On {{her way back to}} Edinburgh on 24 April, Mary was abducted, willingly or not, by Lord Bothwell and his men and taken to <b>Dunbar</b> Castle, where he may have raped her. On 6 May, Mary and Bothwell {{returned}} to Edinburgh and on 15 May, at either Holyrood Palace or Holyrood Abbey, they were married according to Protestant rites. Bothwell and his first wife, Jean Gordon, who was the sister of Lord Huntly, had divorced twelve days previously.|$|E
50|$|Anthropologist H. Russell Bernard and Peter Killworth and {{associates}} {{have done a}} variety of field studies in the United States that {{came up with an}} estimated mean number of ties, 290, which is roughly double <b>Dunbar's</b> estimate. The Bernard-Killworth median of 231 is lower, due to upward straggle in the distribution, but still appreciably larger than <b>Dunbar's</b> estimate. The Bernard-Killworth estimate of the maximum likelihood of the size of a person's social network is based on a number of field studies using different methods in various populations. It is not an average of study averages but a repeated finding. Nevertheless, the Bernard-Killworth number has not been popularized as widely as <b>Dunbar's.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the 2012 novel This Book is Full of Spiders, also by David Wong, the {{character}} Marconi explains to David the impact <b>Dunbar's</b> number has on human society. In Marconi's explanation, the limit <b>Dunbar's</b> number imposes {{on the individual}} explains phenomena such as racism and xenophobia, as well as apathy towards the suffering of peoples outside of an individual's community.|$|R
5|$|Dayton's ten {{historic}} neighborhoods — Oregon District, Wright <b>Dunbar,</b> Dayton View, Grafton Hill, McPherson Town, Webster Station, Huffman, Kenilworth, St. Anne's Hill, and South Park — feature mostly single-family {{houses and}} mansions in the Neoclassical, Jacobethan, Tudor Revival, English Gothic, Chateauesque, Craftsman, Queen Anne, Georgian Revival, Colonial Revival, Renaissance Revival Architecture, Shingle Style Architecture, Prairie, Mission Revival, Eastlake/Italianate, American Foursquare, and Federal styles of architecture. Downtown Dayton {{is also a}} large area that encompasses several neighborhoods itself and has seen a recent uplift and revival.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, {{split into}} four {{geographic}} sections, {{known as the}} Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. The Famous Five and South Stands are the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep {{within the boundaries of}} the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the stands were built, the Famous Five Stand was above pitch level and the South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed. Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before the stands were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and <b>Dunbar</b> End respectively. The southern end was called the <b>Dunbar</b> End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it.|$|E
5|$|Igbo Landing (alternatively {{written as}} Ibo Landing, Ebo Landing, or Ebos Landing) is a {{historic}} site at <b>Dunbar</b> Creek on St. Simons Island, Glynn County, Georgia. It was the setting of a mass suicide in 1803 by captive Igbo people who had taken control of their slave ship and refused to submit to slavery in the United States. The event's moral value as a story of resistance towards slavery has symbolic importance in African American folklore and literary history.|$|E
5000|$|Maya Angelou titled her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), from {{a line in}} <b>Dunbar's</b> poem [...] "Sympathy", at the {{suggestion}} of jazz musician and activist Abbey Lincoln. Angelou said that <b>Dunbar's</b> works had inspired her [...] "writing ambition." [...] She returns to his symbol of a caged bird as a chained slave in much of her writings.|$|R
5000|$|One {{academic}} outcome {{from this}} work was a challenge to <b>Dunbar's</b> number theorem. <b>Dunbar's</b> number theorem suggests a theoretical cognitive limit {{to the number of}} people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person. <b>Dunbar's</b> number is not derived from systematic observation of the number of relationships that people living in the contemporary world have. Killworth and his associates did a number of field studies in the United States that came up with an estimated mean number of ties - 290 - that is roughly double <b>Dunbar's</b> estimate. This was not an average of study averages or a theoretical hypothesis but a repeated finding. In 1997, Killworth and Bernard formed the keynote speakers at the International Network for Social Network Analysis annual [...] "Sunbelt" [...] meeting, presenting on this accumulated work.|$|R
