5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. <b>In</b> <b>reality,</b> <b>the</b> slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 <b>in</b> <b>reality.</b> <b>The</b> latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|As {{a general}} rule, since that time, {{the armed forces}} have not intervened in {{politics}} as a body, rather being tossed and turned as ambitious men have shaken the country. <b>In</b> <b>reality,</b> <b>the</b> larger problem has been the misuse and sometimes abuse {{of the military and}} police by political and ethnic leaders.|$|E

5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. <b>In</b> <b>reality,</b> <b>the</b> cause of injury has been open to debate. One theory is that Randy Savage punched Hogan because he believed that his ex-wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married (the couple divorced in September 1992).

5|$|In 1949 the Central Committee {{established}} the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). It differed from its predecessors in several respects.

5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. <b>In</b> <b>reality,</b> <b>the</b> forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury {{there were only two}} guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time for the government to improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop Tilbury Fort's defences further.|$|E

The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a method and practical {{application for a}} consistent data exchange between the virtual planning and the real production environment in cyber-physical assembly planning. In the virtual planning environment, the product's ability to be assembled is validated by comparing the product's requirements with the assembly module's capabilities. The information of this comparison is reused for the assembly of <b>the</b> product <b>in</b> <b>reality,</b> where <b>the</b> product requests services from different assembly modules. Changes to the assembly system configuration are identified <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> and <b>the</b> data of the model is updated in the virtual planning environment. Due to {{the application of the}} method, the virtual planning model is kept updated and assembly planning results are used <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> for <b>the</b> product assembly process...|$|R
5|$|Ammianus {{puts the}} Alamanni force at around 35,000. This is {{consistent}} with two other figures he gives for Alamannic armies elsewhere in his history: an army of 40,000 in 378; and in 366 an army divided in three, with one division 10,000 strong. Nevertheless, several historians regard Ammianus' figure as unrealistically high. It has been recently suggested that <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> <b>the</b> Alamanni at Strasbourg may have been only about 15,000, {{much the same as}} the Romans. This calculation {{is based on the assumption}} that the average reported size of Alamanni raiding-bands (800 men) represented the maximum manpower of a pagus. For various reasons, the midpoint figure between these two extremes (about 25,000 men) appears the most likely scenario.|$|E
5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders {{were not on the}} mat when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor out of the ring onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. <b>In</b> <b>reality,</b> <b>the</b> second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E

The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E

While Borislow maintained that his company's actions were not illegal, he reached a settlement on April 15, agreeing to pay the state of Florida $125,000 {{for the cost of}} the investigation.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>reality</b> <b>the</b> House of Hohenzollern, {{of which}} Albrecht was a member, the ruling {{family of the}} Margraviate of Brandenburg, had been {{actively}} expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current political expediency, Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the Brandenburg elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to inherit the Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with Brandenburg possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however careful to assert his supremacy. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even less able to counteract the growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns.|$|E

5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. <b>In</b> <b>reality</b> <b>the</b> particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> <b>the</b> Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
