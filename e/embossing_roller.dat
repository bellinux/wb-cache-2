40|$|Reel-to-reel {{processes}} like rotary hot embossing allow micro-patterning {{of flexible}} foil based polymer substrates. Such technologies {{have the potential}} to be the basis for extremely cheap micro-products. This is due to the low price for polymer foils {{as well as to the}} high throughput of reel-to-reel processes. An application field which could benefit of this technology is micro-fluidics. In this paper, a new type of reel-to-reel hot embossing machine will be presented. In contrast to commercially available reel-to-reel embossing machines, the machine described here is capable of doing continuous and discontinuous hot embossing.

40|$|Economically {{advantageous}} microfabrication {{technologies for}} lab-on-a-chip diagnostic devices substituting commonly used glass etching or injection molding processes {{are one of}} the key enablers for the emerging market of microfluidic devices. On-site detection in fields of life sciences, point of care diagnostics and environmental analysis requires compact, disposable and highly functionalized systems. Roll-to-roll production as a high volume process has become the emerging fabrication technology for integrated, complex high technology products within recent years (e. g. fuel cells). Differently functionalized polymer films enable researchers to create a new generation of lab-on-a-chip devices by combining electronic, microfluidic and optical functions in multilayer architecture. For replication of microfluidic and optical functions via roll-to-roll production process competitive approaches are available. One of them is to imprint fluidic channels and optical structures of micro- or nanometer scale from embossing rollers into ultraviolet (UV) curable lacquers on polymer substrates. Depending on dimension, shape and quantity of those structures there are alternative manufacturing technologies for the <b>embossing</b> <b>roller.</b> Ultra-precise diamond turning, electroforming or casting polymer materials are used either for direct structuring or manufacturing of roller sleeves. Mastering methods are selected for application considering replication quality required and structure complexity. Criteria for the replication quality are surface roughness and contour accuracy. Structure complexity is evaluated by shapes producible (e. g. linear, circular) and aspect ratio. Costs for the mastering process and structure lifetime are major cost factors. The alternative replication approaches are introduced and analyzed corresponding to the criteria presented.

40|$|Periodic {{patterned}} surfaces {{can be used}} {{to provide}} unique surface properties in applications, such as biomaterials[1], surface engineering, photonics[2] and sensor systems. Such periodic patterns can be produced using Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP). Laser processing tools are showing significant advantages due to a precise modification of the surfaces with remote and contact-less operation, high flexibility, precise energy deposition and without contamination. DLIP allows the rapid production of different periodic micron and submicron patterns on large flat but also on curved areas like <b>embossing</b> <b>rollers</b> used in the Roll-to-Roll (R 2 R) process. By using DILP seamless structured <b>embossing</b> <b>rollers</b> can be created which will lead to defect free imprints across the entire substrate length. During DILP the primary laser is typically split into two or more beams that later intercept with a certain angle and interfere resulting in a periodic intensity distribution. This variation of intensity minima and maxima is then transferred to the substrate surface by ablation processes resulting in e. g. line-, hole- or pillar-like micron/submicron structures. By using this technology structure sizes from 150 nm to 50 µm can be achieved.

The use of ultra-short pulsed lasers offers new possibilities in the manufacturing of high end products with extra high processing qualities.

40|$|Seventh International Symposium on Precision Mechanical Measurements, Xia'men, China, August 8, 2015 Precision roller with microstructures {{is the key}} tooling {{component}} in the precision <b>embossing</b> by <b>roller</b> process such as Roll-to-Roll to manufacture optical plastic plates or films with three dimensional (3 D) -microstructures. Measurement and analysis of 3 D-microstructures on a precision roller is essential before the embossing process is being undertaken {{to ensure the quality}} of the embossed surfaces. Different from 3 D-microstructures on a planar surface, it is difficult to measure and characterize the 3 D-microstructures on the cylindrical surface of a precision roller due to the geometrical complexity of such integrated surfaces such as V-groove microstructures on a cylindrical surface. This paper presents a study of method and algorithms for the measurement and characterization of 3 D-microstructures on a precision roller surface. A feature-based characterization method (FBCM) is proposed to analyze the V-groove microstructures. In this method, a normal template is generated based on the design specifications, and the measured data is fitted with the feature points. Hence alignment and matching of the measured data to the normal template based on the derived feature points are undertaken. After that the V-groove is characterized by some feature parameters such as pitch, depth, angle of the V-grooves. The method also provides an approach for the analysis of burs generated during the machining of Vgroove microstructures. A precision roller with V-groove microstructures has been machined by a Four-axis ultraprecision machine and the machined surface is measured by a contact measuring instrument. The measured data are then characterized and analyzed by the proposed FBCM. The results are presented and discussed, and they indicate the dominant and regular machining errors that are involved in the machining of the V-groove microstructures on roller surfaces.
