5|$|On 26 February 1793, another vote {{to abolish}} the slave trade was {{narrowly}} defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis {{and the threat of}} invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France, a stance that created a temporary breach <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> friendship with Pitt.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E

25|$|Gilles Mureau (also Mureue, as he spelled it himself) (c. 1450 – July 1512) was a French {{composer}} and {{singer of the}} Renaissance.

25|$|His playing {{style is}} that of the {{creative}} playmaker - picking out passes to his full forwards, as well as taking his own scores, usually at vital junctures of a game. The main key to his play that sets him apart from his contemporaries is his ability to control the pace, and direction of a match, through leading by example. Peter Canavan, whose influence since his retirement has been missed, has expressed he feels McGuigan's leadership is the key to any Tyrone success, and have struggled to take control of matches <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> absence.|$|E
