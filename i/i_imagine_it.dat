Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth." [...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has." ...|$|E
500|$|Commentators cited Jennifer Aniston's {{appearance}} as {{the highlight of}} the episode. Entertainment Weekly Annie Barrett lauded the interactions between Aniston and Cox; [...] "Their interactions were along the lines of what <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> would have been like if Rachel's character had suddenly decided she had become a wizard." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic echoed synonymous thoughts, and felt that Aniston's performance reminded the audience of her star power. Fallon wrote: [...] "Aniston's performance was delightfully weird and offbeat—and comedically sharp, a welcome change from the generic and bland film roles she's played in the years since Friends ended. Last night's performance spotlighted her gifts as a character actress—and served as a frustrating reminder of what we've been missing since she has [...] abandoned that niche of acting." [...] Sepinwall expressed that Aniston [...] "acquits herself just fine in the small role of Jules' eccentric new therapist. She's likable and daffy but never over-the-top." [...] Hollywood Life journalist Laura Schreffler was not as enthusiastic as the general consensus, avouching that Aniston's guest appearance was overhyped and a [...] "glorified cameo". Schreffler added that Cox overshadowed her, asserting that she [...] "is still way more hilarious".|$|E

500|$|In February 1984, Genesis took a {{break in}} {{activity}} to allow each member to continue with their solo careers. Rutherford formed his group Mike + The Mechanics, Banks worked on his solo album Soundtracks, and Collins released No Jacket Required which achieved worldwide success and increased his popularity as a result. The music press took note that Collins' success as a solo artist made him more popular than Genesis. Before the release of No Jacket Required, Collins insisted {{that he would not}} leave the band. [...] "The next one to leave the band will finish it," [...] Collins told Rolling Stone magazine in May 1985. [...] "I feel happier with what we're doing now, because I feel it's closer to me. I won't be the one." [...] Collins added, [...] "Poor old Genesis does get in the way sometimes. I still won't leave the group, but <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> will end by mutual consent." [...] In June, Collins spoke of the band's intention to start work on a new album that year, ending rumours to a false announcement that aired on BBC Radio 1 suggesting Genesis had split.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality {{and its role in}} his work: [...] "I'd say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America." ...|$|E

2500|$|Responding in The Daily Telegraph {{technology}} blog, Shane Richmond felt Arrington had a conflict-of-interest {{in writing}} the column: [...] "As for Mr Arrington's suggestion, which basically amounts to 'I wish everyone would be nicer', <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it's</b> largely motivated by the fact that, as he acknowledges in his post, he's a frequent target of Valleywag himself." ...|$|R
