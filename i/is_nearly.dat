5|$|Astronomical {{distances}} {{are sometimes}} expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> 10trillion kilometres or nearly 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E

5|$|For the 10metre air {{pistol and}} air rifle {{disciplines}} match diabolo pellets are used. These pellets have wadcutter heads, meaning the front <b>is</b> (<b>nearly)</b> flat, that leave clean round holes in paper targets for easy scoring. Match pellets {{are offered in}} tins and more elaborate packagings that avoid deformation and other damage that could impair their uniformity.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} {{to those of}} Tachyoryctes audax, the nasal bones are larger and have angles at the sides. T.annectens, which <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> as large, has smaller teeth and nasals; in T.rex, the basioccipital is broader, and the back part of the mandible (lower jaw) is better developed and has the capsule of the incisor placed further to the front.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> one so the intrinsic curvature <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E

5|$|Most wild bovids {{live for}} 10 to 15 years. Larger species tend to live longer; for instance, American bison can {{live up to}} 25 years and gaur up to 30 years.

I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied.|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E
