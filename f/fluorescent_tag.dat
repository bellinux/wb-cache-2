25|$|The {{vesicular}} transport assay detects the translocation {{of molecules}} by ABC transporters. Membranes prepared under suitable conditions contain inside-out oriented vesicles with the ATP binding site and substrate binding {{site of the}} transporter facing the buffer outside. Substrates of the transporter are taken up into the vesicles in an ATP dependent manner. Rapid filtration using glass fiber filters or nitrocellulose membranes are used to separate the vesicles from the incubation solution and the test compound trapped inside the vesicles is retained on the filter. The quantity of the transported unlabelled molecules is determined by HPLC, LC/MS, LC/MS/MS. Alternatively, the compounds are radiolabeled, fluorescent or have a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tag</b> so that the radioactivity or fluorescence retained on the filter can be quantified.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>tags,</b> {{including}} small {{organic molecules}} and fluorescent proteins, enable the localization of protein molecules in biomedical research experiments. However, {{the use of}} these labels may interfere with the formation of larger-scale protein structures such as amyloid aggregates. Therefore, we investigate the effects of some commonly used <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tags</b> on the morphologies of fibrils grown from the Alzheimer's disease-associated peptide Amyloid β 1 - 40 (Aβ 40) and the Parkinson's disease-associated protein α-synuclein (αS). Results Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we verify that N-terminal labeling of Aβ 40 with AMCA, TAMRA, and Hilyte-Fluor 488 tags does not prevent the formation of protofibrils and amyloid fibrils of various widths. We also measure the two-photon action cross-section of Aβ 40 labelled with Hilyte Fluor 488 and demonstrate that this tag is suitable for use with two-photon fluorescence techniques. Similarly, we find that Alexa Fluor 488 labelling of αS variant proteins near either the N or C terminus (position 9 or 130) does not interfere with the formation of amyloid and other types of αS fibrils. We also present TEM images of fibrils grown from αS C-terminally labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Near neutral pH, two types of αS-EGFP fibrils are observed via TEM, while denaturation of the EGFP tag leads to the formation of additional species. Conclusions We demonstrate that several small extrinsic <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tags</b> are compatible with studies of amyloid protein aggregation. However, although fibrils can be grown from αS labelled with EGFP, the conformation of the <b>fluorescent</b> protein <b>tag</b> affects the observed aggregate morphologies. Thus, our results should assist researchers with label selection and optimization of solution conditions for aggregation studies involving fluorescence techniques. </p...|$|R

The imide structure allows for two different substituent, so a single reactive group can be attached to this position.|$|E
