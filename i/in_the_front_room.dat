5|$|Phillips first sold {{bicycles}} and motorbikes, but later started selling and recharging batteries {{in a shop}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of his house in 1925. After a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s, he started selling electrical goods and popular records. In 1955, Phillips set up a recording studio called Phillips' Sound Recording Services.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due {{to a decline in}} demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E

25|$|When Dora {{was five}} years old, her father took up a {{position}} in Leipzig working as an engraver and illustrator for the Breitkopf printing and publishing firm, and his family followed him to Leipzig a few months later. The Stock family was not well off. They lived in fifth-floor attic rooms in a building whose lower floors were occupied by Breitkopf printing facilities. The father worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room,</b> where there was ample window lighting, surrounded by his family.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} center hall, the {{interior}} mostly retains its original four-on-four floor plan and many original finishes. That includes exposed heavy timber framing, wide floorboards and working fireplaces, with all but one having chimneys in the original diagonal configuration, as well as much vernacular Federal style woodwork. Most prominent among that is the fireplace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> on the east. Its mantelpiece has a surround featuring pilasters with square capitals and a frieze with floral motif. There is a large opening {{between it and the}} back room on that side, while the two rooms on the west remain entirely separate.|$|E
50|$|Situated {{on a hill}} {{overlooking}} Tuscumbia, {{the house}} has a double-height portico flanked by six-over-six sash windows on each floor. Twin entrance doors lead into separate <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> that were {{a portion of the}} house as originally built. Each room has an Adamesque mantel. A transverse rear hall was added around 1923, joining the main block with a detached kitchen. The main stairway to the second floor was moved to this hall, replacing separate stairhalls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Kohler Hall: A smaller, {{first used}} as the first Methodist Children’s Home until German Wallace College bought the {{building}} (and <b>the</b> surrounding land) <b>in</b> 1866 for a residence {{for the vice president}} of the college who lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> northeast wing while the rest of the building was used as a men’s dormitory.

The upstairs presently has three <b>rooms,</b> two in <b>front</b> and a single large one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back, although there is evidence that the room configuration has changed over the years.|$|R
500|$|... "You Really Got Me" [...] {{was written}} by Ray Davies, the Kinks' vocalist and main songwriter, {{sometime}} between 9 and 12 March 1964. Created on the piano <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of the Davies' home, the song was stylistically {{very different from the}} finished product, being much lighter and somewhat jazz-oriented. Ray said of the song's writing, [...] "When I came up with [...] I hadn't been writing songs very long at all. It {{was one of the first}} five I ever came up with." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1932 she met George Smith, {{who lived}} {{across from the}} {{hospital}} where she worked, and to which he delivered milk every morning. Smith and his brother, Frank Smith, operated a dairy farm and a shop in Woolton {{that had been in}} the Smith family for four generations. Smith started courting Mimi, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. Stanley would only allow the couple to sit in the back room at Newcastle Road when he or his wife were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room,</b> and before it grew too late he would burst into the back room and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting. After delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, [...] "or nothing at all!" ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney's {{father was}} a trumpet player and pianist, who had led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room,</b> {{encouraged}} his sons to be musical and advised Paul to take piano lessons, but Paul preferred to learn by ear. He gave Paul a nickel-plated trumpet for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, McCartney traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith (model17) acoustic guitar, since {{he wanted to be}} able to sing while playing. He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first song, [...] "I Lost My Little Girl", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced him, and Little Richard was his schoolboy idol; [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlin's Filey holiday camp talent competition.|$|E

5000|$|It is a pink stuccoed {{house built}} of {{concrete}} blocks. According to its NRHP nomination, its architecture [...] "borrows from severalMediterranean styles without being heavily in debt {{to any of}} them":The crested broken pediments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foyer, the scrolled brincaded entrance arch, and the red tile roof are attributable to the Spanish churrigueresque style. The groups of round arches set on Persian columns are attributable to the Byzantine style. The hooded classical style mantels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> are attributable to the Italian Renaissance. There are also bottle glass windows and heavily cut and paneled doors. The rear sunroom has a marble floor and arches which lead to the balustraded patio.|$|R
500|$|When {{other girls}} were {{thinking}} of marriage, Mimi Stanley talked of challenges and adventures. She once confided that she never wanted to get married, as she hated {{the idea of being}} [...] "tied to the kitchen sink". She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, to which Smith delivered milk every morning. Smith started seriously courting Mimi in the spring of 1932, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. George Stanley (Mimi's father) would only allow the couple to sit in the back room of the family home in Newcastle Road when he or his wife were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room,</b> and before it grew too late he would burst into the back room and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting, so after delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, [...] "or nothing at all!"

2500|$|Davies grew {{up playing}} skiffle, but soon bought an {{electric}} guitar and started experimenting with rock. The Davies brothers and friend Pete Quaife jammed together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of their house. Activities in the Davies household centred around this front room, culminating in large parties, where Davies' parents would sing and play piano together. The front room and these parties were musically nurturing to the Davies brothers, later influencing the Kinks' {{interpretations of the}} traditional British music hall style. Dave and his brother worked out the famous two-chord riff of their 1964 hit, [...] "You Really Got Me", on the piano <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On July 2 at midnight, Gen. Meade {{called for}} a council of war with his corps commanders. [...] It was held at his field {{headquarters}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of the Leister house. [...] He asked his commanders whether the Union Army should remain in its present position, or to retire to another position nearer its base of supplies. [...] Further, if the Army remained in its present position, should it attack or await the attack of the enemy. [...] It is then that Slocum gave his recommendation to “Stay and fight it out.” ...|$|E
25|$|Believed to {{have built}} before 1880, John Schandua {{purchased}} {{the house when}} he married Bertha Klein <b>in</b> 1883. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> served at a bedroom and living area, while the back room was the children's bedroom.

50|$|This small house, {{called the}} Wilson House, {{is one of}} <b>the</b> oldest <b>in</b> Oyster Bay still {{standing}} on its original site. It is named for Harry Wilson, who lived here for over sixty years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid 19th century. Mr. Wilson was a cooper, or barrel maker, and also a vestryman at nearby Christ Church. Although named for Wilson the house dates {{way back to the}} 1750s. It appears to be an example of classic saltbox architecture, a form which refers to south-facing houses with sloping rear sections ending at a height of three or four feet. These houses were constructed to take advantage of natural sunlight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> and would traditionally use the tapering northern room as a kitchen and cooking area.|$|R
2500|$|XL Capris was an indie-punk band {{formed in}} 1978 by Johanna Pigott (bass guitar, vocal, keyboard, guitar) aka 'Alligator Bagg', Tim Gooding (guitar, vocal) aka 'Errol Cruz', Julie Anderson (drums) aka 'Nancy Serapax' and Kimble Rendall (guitar, vocal) aka 'Dag Rattler'. Early {{practice}} sessions were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of a Birchgrove house where Gooding (and later Rendall) lived. Their first single was a punk version of Tommy Leonetti's [...] "My City of Sydney" [...] (1979), {{which had a}} promo video showing the four in bed together. Pigott was lead vocalist and bass guitarist in the video. The single received some radio airplay but was not a commercial success. Second 1979 single [...] "Skylab (Son of Telstar)" [...] was written by Rendall but had even less success.|$|E
2500|$|The Saints {{were formed}} in Brisbane in 1973, {{initially}} calling themselves Kid Galahad and the Eternals. They {{are considered to}} be one of the first and most influential punk groups. The Saints rehearsed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of the rented house on Petrie terrace, Brisbane, which happened to be opposite the local police headquarters. By 1975, contemporaneous with the Ramones, The Saints were employing the fast tempos, raucous vocals and [...] "buzzsaw" [...] guitar that characterised early punk rock. Guitarist Ed Kuepper explained that they played faster and faster as they were nervous in front of audiences. The police would often break up their performances, and arrests were frequent. They found it difficult to get bookings in Brisbane and so formed their own promotion company, their own club (Hay's place became the 76 Club) and their own record label.|$|E
2500|$|Garner {{was born}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of his grandmother's house in Congleton, Cheshire, on 17 October 1934. He grew up nearby, in Alderley Edge, a well-to-do village that had {{effectively}} become {{a suburb of}} Manchester. His [...] "rural working-class family", had been connected to Alderley Edge {{since at least the}} sixteenth century, and could {{be traced back to the}} death of William Garner in 1592. Garner claims that his family had passed on [...] "a genuine oral tradition" [...] involving folk tales about The Edge, which included a description of a king and his army of knights who slept under it, guarded by a wizard. In the mid-nineteenth century Alan's great-great grandfather Robert had carved the face of a bearded wizard onto the face of a cliff next to a well, known locally at that time as the Wizard's Well.|$|E

50|$|The Luppitt Inn is {{the only}} public house at Luppitt, Devon. Located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> of a farmhouse, the {{building}} is constructed from stone, rendered {{on one side and}} includes a tiled roof. The main house, still part of a working farm, was built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 19th century. The pub entrance is {{on the north side of}} the house, leading to a two-roomed pub. The serving room includes a simple counter made of matchboard, and some simple shelves, as well as a few seats, whilst the second room includes a brick fireplace. The toilets are outside, across the yard. <b>The</b> only table <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pub is covered <b>in</b> puzzles. <b>The</b> unique layout has meant that the pub is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.|$|R
