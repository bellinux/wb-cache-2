5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the <b>entrance</b> <b>hole).</b> The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E

40|$|African pit latrines produce prodigious {{numbers of}} the latrine fly, Chrysomya putoria, a {{putative}} vector of diarrhoeal pathogens. We set out to develop a simple, low-cost odour-baited trap for collecting C. putoria in the field. A series of field experiments {{was carried out in}} The Gambia to assess the catching-efficiency of different trap designs. The basic trap was a transparent 3 L polypropylene box baited with 50 g of fish, with a white opaque lid with circular <b>entrance</b> <b>holes.</b> We tested variations of the number, diameter, position and shape of the <b>entrance</b> <b>holes,</b> the height of the trap above ground, degree of transparency of the box, its shape, volume, colour, and the attractiveness of gridded surfaces on or under the trap. Traps were rotated between positions on different sampling occasions using a Latin Square design. The optimal trapping features were incorporated into a final trap that was tested against commercially available traps. Features of the trap that increased the number of flies caught included: larger <b>entrance</b> <b>holes</b> (compared with smaller ones, p, 0. 001), using conical collars inside the holes (compared with without collars, p = 0. 01), <b>entrance</b> <b>holes</b> {{on the top of the}} trap (compared with the side or bottom, p, 0. 001), traps placed on the ground (compared with above ground, p, 0. 001), the box having transparent sides (compared with being opaque, p, 0. 001), and with no wire grids nearby (compared with those with grids, p = 0. 03). This trap collected similar numbers of C. putoria to other common traps for blow flies.

25|$|This {{problem was}} studied {{by a group}} of professors from the Department of Biological Science in the University of Aarhus, Denmark and the School of Science at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia. They studied Camponotus anderseni in a series of {{experiments}} to determine varying carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in nests. During inundation, a soldier sacrifices herself to block the <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> with her head which effectively prevents flooding inside the nest. Once this occurs, the area can be very crowded, with the ants and coccids filling up to half the volume, and the conditions in the nests during a flood become hypercapnic and hypoxic.|$|E
25|$|R. romandi nests {{are often}} built under the eaves of buildings. When built {{on such a}} hard surface, the nest, entirely covered by an envelope, forms a {{compressed}} hemisphere with multiple horizontal, flat combs, the largest comb being near the bottom. These combs are connected to each other within the envelope by ribbon-like pedicles. Cells are hexagonal and regularly arranged. The envelope is mostly single layered, however it can be double layered in parts. It is made of plant fibers and fragments and is a uniform light gray color. It is possible for the envelope to be heavily coated in saliva {{to the extent that}} the fibrous material of the envelope itself is completely hidden. A round <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> is at the bottom of the hemispherical nest.|$|E
25|$|Cavity-dwelling {{species have}} to contend with the danger of predators {{accessing}} their nest, catching them and their young inside and unable to get out. They have a variety of methods for decreasing the likelihood of this happening. Red-cockaded woodpeckers peel bark around the entrance, and drill wells above and below the hole; since they nest in live trees, the resulting flow of resin forms a barrier that prevents snakes from reaching the nests. Red-breasted nuthatches smear sap around the entrance holes to their nests, while white-breasted nuthatches rub foul-smelling insects around theirs. Eurasian nuthatches wall up part of their entrance holes with mud, decreasing the size and sometimes extending the tunnel part of the chamber. Most female hornbills seal themselves into their cavity nests, using a combination of mud (in some species brought by their mates), food remains and their own droppings to reduce the <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> to a narrow slit.|$|E

25|$|Woodpeckers {{use their}} chisel-like bills to {{excavate}} their cavity nests, {{a process which}} takes, on average, about two weeks. Cavities are normally excavated on the downward-facing side of a branch, presumably {{to make it more}} difficult for predators to access the nest, and to reduce the chance that rain floods the nest. There is also some evidence that fungal rot may make the wood on the underside of leaning trunks and branches easier to excavate. Most woodpeckers use a cavity for only a single year. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is an exception; it takes far longer—up to two years—to excavate its nest cavity, and may reuse it for more than two decades. The typical woodpecker nest has a short horizontal tunnel which leads to a vertical chamber within the trunk. The size and shape of the chamber depends on species, and the <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> is typically only as large as is needed to allow access for the adult birds. While wood chips are removed during the excavation process, most species line the floor of the cavity with a fresh bed of them before laying their eggs.|$|E
500|$|Woodpeckers and piculets will {{excavate}} {{their own}} nests, but wrynecks will not, {{and need to}} find pre-existing cavities. A typical nest has a round <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> that just fits the bird, leading to an enlarged vertical chamber below. No nesting material is used, apart from some wood chips produced during the excavation; other wood chips are liberally scattered on the ground providing visual evidence of {{the site of the}} nest. Many species of woodpeckers excavate one hole per breeding season, sometimes after multiple attempts. It takes around a month to finish the job and abandoned holes are used by other birds and mammals that are cavity nesters unable to excavate their own holes.|$|E
500|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} is {{sexually mature}} when aged one year, and starts its courtship behaviour in the following December. It has a fluttering flight display in which the male flies with shallow wingbeats and a spread tail. He calls in flight and may land at a prospective nest-site. The [...] pair excavate a new hole at least [...] above the ground and usually lower than , although sometimes much higher. The chosen site is normally a tree, alive or dead, occasionally a utility pole or nest box. Old holes are rarely re-used, although the same tree {{may be used for}} nesting for several years. The nest cavity is [...] deep with an <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> [...] wide. It is excavated by both sexes, the male doing most of the chiselling.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} Crow shelter is the tipi or skin lodge {{made with}} bison hides stretched over wooden poles. [...] The Crow are historically known to construct {{some of the}} largest tipis. Tipi poles were harvested from the lodgepole pine which acquired its name from its use as support for tipis. Inside the tipi, mattresses and buffalo-hide seats were arranged around the edge, with a fireplace in the center. The smoke from the fire escaped through a hole or smoke-flap {{in the top of the}} tipi. At least one <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> with collapsible flap allowed entry into the tipi. Often hide paintings adorned the outside and inside of tipis with specific meanings attached to the images. Often specific tipi designs were unique to the individual owner, family, or society that resided in the tipi. Tipis are easily raised and collapsed and are lightweight, which is ideal for nomadic people like the Crow who move frequently and quickly. Once collapsed, the tipi poles are used to create a travois. Travois are a horse-pulled frame structure used by plains Indians to carry and pull belongings as well as small children. Many Crow families still own and use the tipi, especially when traveling. The annual Crow Fair has been described as the largest gathering of tipis in the world.|$|E
2500|$|The median wasp {{like many}} other species of wasps builds its nest out of pulp {{that comes from the}} {{digestion}} of wood. Their nests have been reported to be light yellow or light to dark grey in color depending on the material used to build the nest. These nests are about [...] tall and [...] wide with a [...] thick roof. Mature nests have 2-4 circular or oval shaped combs that are surrounded by a thick envelope. There are two types of elements connecting combs. One is a rigid column {{down the center of the}} nest and the other is thin ribbon like pieces between the combs. Both are made of pulp and help to give the nest support. The <b>entrance</b> <b>hole</b> is at the bottom of the nest and often has spiraled sheets of paper surrounding it. The entrance of young nests sometimes consists of a long , or entry compartment, whose function is unknown. This long vestibule has only been observed in D. media and D. maculata species and tends to disappear as the nest matures. It may function in thermoregulation or defense. This species lives in cooler temperate climates and nests in the open so thermoregulation is a plausible explanation, but so far no other vestibule of this length have been observed in species that live in similar climates. A mature nest will house about 800 mature adults between May and October. Come October the males and workers being to die off and the queen hibernates until next spring when she will begin a new nest.|$|E
25|$|Species {{which use}} natural {{cavities}} or old woodpecker nests sometimes line the cavity with soft material such as grass, moss, lichen, feathers or fur. Though {{a number of}} studies have attempted to determine whether secondary cavity nesters preferentially choose cavities with <b>entrance</b> <b>holes</b> facing certain directions, the results remain inconclusive. While some species appear to preferentially choose holes with certain orientations, studies (to date) have not shown consistent differences in fledging rates between nests oriented in different directions.|$|R
40|$|Cryogenic {{inertial}} confinement fusion targets at the National Ignition Facility and the Laser Megajoule {{will be protected}} from thermal infrared radiation by a cold shroud. As the shroud is removed just before the laser pulse, infrared radiation will heat and possibly degrade the symmetry of the solid hydrogen fuel layer. A lumped component mathematical model has been constructed to calculate how long an indirect drive target can be exposed to thermal radiation before the fuel layer degrades. The allowed exposure time sets the maximum shroud removal time and therefore {{has important implications for}} the design of the cryogenic shroud systems. The model predicts that the maximum exposure time is approximately 0. 18 s for plastic capsules inside hohlraums with transparent laser <b>entrance</b> <b>holes.</b> By covering the laser <b>entrance</b> <b>holes</b> with a partially reflective coating, the exposure time can be increased to approximately 1 s. The exposure time can be increased to about 2 s by using beryllium capsules. Several other design concepts could increase the exposure time even further. Lengthening of the allowed exposure time to 1 s or longer could allow a significant cost savings for the shroud system...|$|R

40|$|Orchid {{bees are}} {{increasingly}} applied on Neotropical biomonitoring and bioindication studies {{due to the}} relative easiness of sampling and identification {{when compared to other}} bee groups. A considerable number of orchid bee community studies have been adopting baited traps as a sampling method, especially for replication purposes. However, the trap attributes are variable, and hitherto no evaluation of different designs was carried out. Here, five attributes of baited traps were tested: trap volume, number of <b>entrance</b> <b>holes,</b> presence of landing platform, kind of landing platform, and fixation content. We use Mann-Whitney tests to access differences in richness and abundance capture rates for each trap design. We found that volume, number of <b>entrance</b> <b>holes,</b> and fixation content do not influence orchid bees capture. However, the design without landing platforms had a significantly higher capture rate for richness when compared with sanded landing platforms. On the other hand, analyzing the kind of landing platform, we detected a significantly higher richness and abundance for the trap with landing platforms glued with sand. Despite the fact that the effects of different designs tested here were very punctual, we consider that results from samples taken with different baited trap designs are comparable. Some adjustments on trap design can be done according to the particularities of future studies...|$|R
5000|$|Pityophthorus juglandis {{can easily}} be {{distinguished}} from other members of its genus. Curtis Utley, a researcher at Colorado State University, elaborates on these differences stating, [...] "Among these differences there are the 4 to 6 concentric rows of asperities on the prothorax, usually broken and overlapping at the median line. The declivity {{at the end of}} the wing covers is steep, very shallowly bisulcate, and at the apex it is generally flattened with small granules." [...] The walnut twig beetles' small size is common for its genus. Adult beetles average between 1.5 to 1.9 millimeters in length. Although little is known about the life-cycle of the walnut twig beetle, during experimentation with the beetle in a controlled environment, the lifespan of one generation of walnut twig beetles was seven weeks after logs of black walnut, Juglans nigra, were harvested from the wild in May, marking what scientists think is the beginning of the feeding season of the walnut twig beetle. Gatherings of the beetle in sections of the walnut tree are known as galleries. The outward appearance of the walnut above these galleries seemed normal except for small beetle <b>entrance</b> <b>holes.</b> In later stages of decline, beetle <b>entrance</b> <b>holes</b> and galleries were found scattered every 2 to 5 centimeters, essentially crippling the tree.|$|R
