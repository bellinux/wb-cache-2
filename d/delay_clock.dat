50|$|There {{are five}} main types of Time {{controls}}: (1) Fischer (invented by Bobby Fischer), (2) Bronstein (invented by David Bronstein), (3) Simple delay, (4) Overtime penalty and (5) Hourglass. The first three time controls implement {{some sort of}} <b>delay</b> <b>clock,</b> {{a small amount of}} time that is added for each move. The reason is that with a sudden-death time limit, all moves must be completed in the specified time, or the player loses. With a small delay added at each move, the player always has at least that much time to make a move. The three types of delay clocks differ in how the delay is implemented. The last two time controls are somewhat different, as they do not rely on time delay, as explained below.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively, the DTE {{can provide}} a clock signal, called {{transmitter}} timing (TT), on pin 24 for transmitted data. Data is changed when the clock transitions from OFF to ON, and read during the ON to OFF transition. TT {{can be used to}} overcome the issue where ST must traverse a cable of unknown length and <b>delay,</b> <b>clock</b> a bit out of the DTE after another unknown delay, and return it to the DCE over the same unknown cable delay. Since the relation between the transmitted bit and TT can be fixed in the DTE design, and since both signals traverse the same cable length, using TT eliminates the issue. TT may be generated by looping ST back with an appropriate phase change to align it with the transmitted data. ST loop back to TT lets the DTE use the DCE as the frequency reference, and correct the clock to data timing.|$|E
5000|$|On March 10, 1994, {{a patent}} {{application}} was filed by inventors Frank A. Camaratta Jr. of Huntsville, Alabama, and William Goichberg of Salisbury Mills, New York, {{for a game}} timer especially suitable for playing the game of chess, which employed a [...] "delay" [...] feature. The game timer provides, among other features, a user-definable delay between the time the activation button is pressed and {{the time that the}} activated clock actually begins to count down. United States Patent 5,420,830 was issued on May 10, 1995, and subsequently assigned to the United States Chess Federation by the inventors. The benefit of the <b>delay</b> <b>clock</b> is to reduce the likelihood that a player with positional and/or material superiority will lose a match solely because of the expiration of time on that player's time clock. The [...] "delay" [...] mode is still a popular feature for both standard and sudden-death time controls in major tournaments throughout the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|Tournaments governed {{under the}} rules of the United States Chess Federation have a similar rule to FIDE's guidelines, called the [...] "insufficient losing chances" [...] rule. A player with less than two minutes {{remaining}} without time delay or increment can petition the tournament director for a draw {{on the grounds that the}} opponent has no reasonable chance of winning the position, had both players had ample time. In USCF's guidelines, this would mean an average tournament player (class C) having a less than a 10% probability of losing the position against a master, with both players having sufficient time. The tournament director may accept the claim (ending the game as drawn), reject the claim and penalize the claimant with one minute less time, or postpone the decision. If the tournament director postpones the decision, there is the option of substituting a non-delay clock with a <b>delay</b> <b>clock</b> with the claimant having his remaining time halved. Since the insufficient losing chances rules calls upon discretion from the tournament director, clocks with the time delay or increment feature are preferred over clocks without them.|$|E

Our measurement results show that M 2 E delay depends mostly on the receiving end-point, and when hardware IP phones act as receivers, they achieve low average M 2 E delay (45 - 90 ms) in a LAN environment. For software VoIP clients as receivers, their average M 2 E delays range from 65 ms to over 400 ms.
