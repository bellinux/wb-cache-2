5|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead {{poisoning}} became {{common in the}} work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. An important step {{in the understanding of}} childhood {{lead poisoning}} occurred when toxicity in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead <b>house</b> <b>paint</b> were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.|$|E

25|$|Although Pollock {{is closely}} {{associated}} with Action Painting because of his style, technique, and his painterly touch and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale Water Lilies of Claude Monet done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic Michael Fried, and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his drip paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and {{are related to the}} mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic drip painting period of 1947-1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and <b>house</b> <b>paint</b> into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City Pollock showed Number 12, 1952, a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by Nelson Rockefeller for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Love Ballad" [...] was co-directed by Tove Lo and Motellet Film. Lo also wrote the video's script; she said: [...] "Imagine {{sitting on a}} {{football}} field in the dark, freezing, after seven hours, covered only in black <b>house</b> <b>paint,</b> trying to put on fake eyelashes!". MTV Sweden premiered the video on 5 October 2012, and Lo released it on her YouTube channel on 8 October 2012. The video begins with Lo [...] covered in black paint and walking {{in the middle of}} a road. In the next scene, she covers four men, who go to play rugby on a football field, in paint. Later, Lo is shown walking upside-down and performing other acrobatics on the road and the football field. Then, she appears wearing a hibiscus dress while singing the song in a rubbish dump. In the next scenes, Lo is walking topless through a field of flowers. Near the end, she is standing on the football field while the four men run up to her and cover her in paint. The video is interspersed with scenes of Lo performing the song with images of cities and explosions projected onto her.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Rauschenberg (b. 1925, Port Arthur, Texas, USA; d. 2008) became known for white, then black, and {{eventually}} red monochrome canvases. In the [...] (1951) series, Rauschenberg applied everyday <b>house</b> <b>paint</b> with paint rollers to achieve smooth [...] "blank" [...] surfaces. White panels were exhibited {{alone or in}} modular groupings. The Black Paintings (1951–53) incorporated texture under the painted surface by way of collaged newspaper that sometimes indicates a grid-like structure. The Red Paintings (1953–54) incorporate still more materials such as wood and fabric under the heavily worked painted surface, and seem to foreshadow Rauschenberg's development of assemblage in his [...] "Combine Paintings" [...] {{as well as his}} stated intention to act in [...] "the gap" [...] between [...] "Art" [...] and [...] "Life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{photographer}} Dora Maar—who {{had worked}} with Picasso since mid-1936, photographing his studio and teaching him the technique of cameraless photography— documented the stages Guernica went through {{on its way to}} completion. Apart from their documentary and publicity value, Maar's photographs [...] "helped Picasso to eschew color and give the work the black-and-white immediacy of a photograph", according to John Richardson. The work was painted using a matte <b>house</b> <b>paint</b> specially formulated at Picasso's request to have the least possible gloss, and the American artist John Ferren assisted him in stretching the monumental canvas. [...] Previously, Picasso had rarely allowed strangers into his studio to watch him work, but he admitted influential visitors to his studio to observe the progress of the painting, believing that the publicity to be gained would help the antifascist cause.|$|E
2500|$|Crown Services {{from nearby}} Kiel, Wisconsin painted the house. It {{had to start}} {{painting}} in 2007 because winter temperatures came early in 2006. It finished the job by the July 2007 opening. The company nominated the paint job for a national paint award by Zinsser Company, and it was awarded $10,000 and its [...] "Top Job" [...] winner for 2007. The painters {{had to deal with}} lead paint, so worker had to have a lead abatement area to lessen lead poisoning. A minimal amount of damaged siding and trim was replaced to maintain the historic nature of the house. When paint was sprayed, it had to be back brushed to keep the hand-painted look. Two coats of chocolate-colored latex paint were applied. The Timm <b>house</b> <b>paint</b> job was featured on the cover of American Painting Contractors March 2008 issue.|$|E
2500|$|The Mission School {{is closely}} {{aligned with the}} larger lowbrow art movement, and can be {{considered}} to be a regional expression of that movement. Artists of the Mission School take their inspiration from the urban, bohemian, [...] "street" [...] culture of the Mission District and are strongly influenced by mural and graffiti art, comic and cartoon art, and folk art forms such as sign painting and hobo art. These artists are also noted for use of non-traditional artistic materials, such as <b>house</b> <b>paint,</b> spray paint, correction fluid, ballpoint pens, scrapboard, and found objects. Gallery work by these artists is often displayed using the [...] "cluster method", in which a number of individual works (sometimes by different artists) are clustered closely together on a gallery wall, rather than the traditional gallery display method of widely separating individual works.|$|E
50|$|Water-based acrylic paints were {{subsequently}} sold as latex <b>house</b> <b>paints,</b> as latex is the technical {{term for a}} suspension of polymer microparticles in water. Interior latex <b>house</b> <b>paints</b> {{tend to be a}} combination of binder (sometimes acrylic, vinyl, pva, and others), filler, pigment, and water. Exterior latex <b>house</b> <b>paints</b> may also be a co-polymer blend, but the best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic, due to elasticity and other factors. Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and PVA (polyvinyl acetate) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.|$|R
