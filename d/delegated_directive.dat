40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed commentary of arts. 21 through 30 {{of the new}} Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2014 / 65 /EU, MiFID II). Its primary target audience is legal practitioners who want to inform themselves about the operating conditions for investment firms in Europe, particularly the conduct of business rules. MiFID II will come into force on 3 rd January 2018. The aim of the commentary is to provide an understandable {{and at the same}} time thorough account of MiFID II’s requirements, the corresponding provisions in the MiFID II <b>Delegated</b> <b>Directive</b> (Directive (EU) 2017 / 593) and MiFID II Delegated Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017 / 565) as well as ESMA’s guidance. The commentary also directs readers to issues that are in doubt or completely uncertain in the new regime, and it adopts a clear stance on these issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{president}} is now regularly and {{heavily involved in}} the decisionmaking processes of administrative agencies. What began in the mid-twentieth century as macro-level oversight has evolved, since the Reagan Administration, into controlling case-level influence. Scholars have hotly debated the legality of this shift and have compellingly demonstrated the need to ensure that agencies remain accountable and that their decisions remain nonarbitrary {{in the face of}} presidential involvement. However, as this Note demonstrates, the existing scholarship has not provided an adequate solution to these twin problems. This Note provides a novel and effective solution to the accountability and arbitrariness problems of presidential involvement by re-examining the doctrine of arbitrary and capricious review. Contrary to contemporary practice, this Note argues that while arbitrary and capricious review is never directly applicable to the president 2 ̆ 7 s actions, it is always applicable to agency decisions that the president has influenced. It introduces a bifurcated framework for applying arbitrary and capricious review based on an initial determination of whether Congress has <b>delegated</b> <b>directive</b> authority to the president or the agency. It then demonstrates that arbitrary and capricious review is a better solution to the accountability and arbitrariness problems of presidential involvement than other suggestions in the existing literature...|$|E

40|$|According to an Audi Urban Future Initiative study, {{the average}} person spends 106 days over their {{life-time}} searching for parking spaces. Whether {{it is on the}} side of a busy city street or a shopping center car park, the issue of parking private vehicles poses a substantial logistical challenge that scales in complexity along with population density. As modern populations trend towards urbanization it becomes imperative to develop more efficient parking structures. With the inevitable shift towards driverless vehicles, there exists a need to establish a control system to mitigate these complications. One embodiment of such a solution is a distributed sensor network feeding real-time data to a central management system which <b>delegates</b> navigational <b>directives</b> to individual vehicles based on algorithms designed to maximize spatial and temporal efficiency. This method would rely on wireless radio communication between the host and client nodes with a static sensor providing state feedback information enabling a non-causal autonomous parking process. The project strives to streamline the process of finding a vacant parking space while ensuring client safety through the direction of localized traffic by means of an optimized control scheme determined by the central server leveraging data collected from the sensor network. Such a mechanism would not only improve safety and efficiency by reducing collisions and time spent searching for open spaces, but also obviate the need for driverless vehicles to have prior knowledge of the destination layout by having the information available locally and on demand.

50|$|Gerstein {{formerly}} {{served in}} the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2014. He claims {{there has not been}} a serious plan of action since 2004 during George W. Bush's presidency, in which he issued a Homeland Security <b>directive</b> <b>delegating</b> responsibilities among various federal agencies. He also stated that the blatant mishandling of the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014 attested to the government's lack of preparation. This past May, legislation that would create a national defense strategy was introduced in the Senate, coinciding with the timing of ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups get closer to weaponizing biological agents. Last August, Kenyan officials apprehended two members of an Islamic extremist group in motion to set off a biological bomb containing anthrax. Mohammed Abdi Ali, the believed leader of the group, who was a medical intern, was arrested along with his wife, a medical student. The two were caught just before carrying out their plan. The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, which comprises a group of experts on national security and government officials, in which Gerstein had previously testified to, submitted its National Blueprint for Biodefense to Congress in October 2015 listing their recommendations for devising an effective plan.|$|R
40|$|The {{draft for}} a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base Directive in the European Union {{includes}} the suggestion for an apportionment formula which allocates taxable group profits to group member corporations. These allocated profits shall then be taxed in the respective Member States. The draft <b>directive</b> <b>delegates</b> {{the right to}} define one factor of the apportionment formula, the term "Employee" to the Member States, who are therefore free to choose a narrow or a broad definition, the latter including also atypical employment schemes. Using a game-theoretic approach the paper shows that the individually rational strategy of any Member State to define "Employee" broadly so as to maximize {{the volume of the}} apportionment factor and thus maximize the allocated share of taxable income is only the best solution when tax rate differences and differences in the volume of atypical employment schemes are disregarded. If such differentials and the corporate groups' reactions to different Member States' definitions are included in modelling the game's pay-offs a narrow definition of "Employee" yields the highest individual pay-offs to the Member States involved. This change of dominant strategies is triggered by the corporate group's shifting of the employment factor from high-tax to low-tax Member States. Our paper differs from previous research on the economic effects of the CCCTB apportionment formula as it is the first paper identifying and analysing the employment factor and its distorting effects. The paper discusses possible tax minimizing strategies for corporate groups by shifting workforce and develops a model to quantify these potential relocations. Furthermore the paper presents advice to policy makers in their "Employee" definition decision and shows how Member States could use this definition to both minimize outward factor shifting and maximize inward factor shifting.
