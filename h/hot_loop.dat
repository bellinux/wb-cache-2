We investigate the absolute Doppler shift of lines formed at temperatures between 1 MK and 2 MK in a moss area within active region NOAA 11243 using a novel technique that allows determining the absolute Doppler shift of EUV lines by combining observations from the SUMER and EIS spectrometers. The inner (brighter and denser) part of the moss area shows roughly constant blue shift (upward motions) of 5 km/s in the temperature range of 1 MK to 1. 6 MK. For hotter lines the blue shift decreases and reaches 1 km/s for Fe xv 284 Å (2 MK).

At any given time, the altitude difference between the <b>hot</b> X-ray <b>loops</b> of 6 - 7 × 10 6 K and the cool Hα loops of 1. 5 × 10 4 K is related to the expansion rate of the loop systems and their cooling time.

We measured the altitude of <b>hot</b> and cool <b>loops</b> for 15 and 19 hours, respectively, and found that the cooling time increased as the density of the loops decreased. We found a reasonably good agreement between the observed cooling times and those obtained from model calculations, although the observed values were always somewhat longer than the theoretical ones. Taking into account evolutionary effects, we also found similar shapes and configurations of <b>hot</b> and cool <b>loops</b> during the entire observing period and confirmed that, at any time, <b>hot</b> <b>loops</b> are at higher altitude than cool loops, suggesting that cool loops indeed evolve from <b>hot</b> <b>loops.</b> These results were used to check the validity of the reconnection model...|$|R

Damped Doppler shift oscillations were detected in the Fe XIX line by SUMER, and interpreted as a fundamental standing slow mode. The evolution of soft X-ray emission from GOES/SXI and hard X-ray sources from RHESSI suggests that the oscillations of a large loop are triggered by a small flare, which may be produced by interaction (local reconnection) of this large loop with a small loop at its footpoint. This study provides clear evidence supporting our early conjecture that the slow-mode standing waves in hot coronal loops are excited by impulsive heating (small or microflares) at the loop's footpoint.

40|$|Motivated by the {{observations}} of high Faraday rotation measures measured in cooling flow clusters we propose a model relevant to plasmas with comparable thermal and magnetic pressures. Magnetic field reconnection may {{play a major role}} in changing the topology of the magnetic field in the central cooling flow regions. The effect of the topology change is that cool flux loops can reconnect to <b>hot</b> flux <b>loops</b> that are connected to the overall thermal reservoir of the cluster. There can be a rapid recycling of mass between hot and cold phases on a time scale of ∼ 3 × 108 − 109 yr which may reduce the inferred inflow and mass condensation rates by at least an order of magnitude. A central multiphase medium is a direct consequence of such a model. Throughout the cooling flow the filling factor of the <b>hot</b> <b>loops</b> (T> 2 × 107 K) is of order unity. The filling factor of the cool loops(< 2 × 107 K) is 0. 1 − 1 % with a corresponding mass fraction of cold phase of 1 − 10 %. A crucial parameter is the coherence length of the field relative to the cooling radius and the distribution of field energy with scale. When the cooling radius is greater than the field coherence length then cooling flows proceed as usual. When the coherence length is greater than the central cooling radius, however, the thermal energy of the reservoir can be tapped and the mass condensation rates may be very significantly reduced. Three additional conditions must be satisfied: I. Cold loops must be able to fall at least as far as the mean distance between <b>hot</b> <b>loops</b> in a cooling time; II. Loops must enter an evaporative phase on reconnecting; and III. A sufficient number of <b>hot</b> <b>loops</b> penetrate the cold phase region to power the radiative losses. – 3 – 1...|$|R

A center negative polarity was surrounded by several positive ones, and there appeared three FRs. The three FRs showed apparent slipping motions, and hook structures formed at their ends. Due to the moving footpoints of the erupting structures, one tight semi-circular hook disappeared after the slippage along its inner and outer edge, and coronal dimmings formed within the hook.

40|$|Abstract. The {{equations}} ruling {{the thermal}} equilibrium along coronal loops on rapidly rotating solar-type stars are solved.

Another type of solution consist of loops with a local temperature minimum at the summit which can be thought as representing a stellar slingshot prominence. A detailed study is presented and it is shown that these solutions are available in very general circumstances and without any special requirements such as those concerning the heating distribution along the loop or variations of the cross-sectional area.

The interpretation of the X-ray data in the context of models made previously by Brown and Jordan (1981) based on spectra obtained with the IUE satellite. The X-ray data lead to a higher electron pressure than does the UV spectrum. These results support the conclusion by Brown and Jordan that the UV data cannot be reconciled with a hot corona in a spherically symmetric uniform model. Two types of models are explored; one in which the X-ray emission originates from an isothermal corona but the UV emission is restricted to limited regions of the disk, analogous to solar supergranulation structure; the other in which <b>hot</b> <b>loop</b> structures are embedded in a cool (T(e) of about 300, 000 K) corona.

The periodic oscillations are observed in the Doppler shift of Fe XXI 1354. 09 A (logT~ 7. 05), and the dominant period is about 3. 1 minutes. However, such 3. 1 -min oscillations are {{not found in the}} line-integrated intensity of Fe XXI 1354. 09 A, AIA EUV fluxes, or microwave emissions. SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT imaging observations indicate that the Doppler shift oscillations locate at the hot loop-top region (> 11 MK). Moreover, the differential emission measure (DEM) results show that the temperature is increasing rapidly when the Doppler shift oscillates, but the number density does not exhibit the corresponding increases nor oscillations, implying that the flare loop is likely to oscillate in an incompressible mode. All these facts suggest that the Doppler shift oscillations at the shorter period are most likely the standing kink oscillations in a flare loop. Meanwhile, a longer period of about 10 minutes is identified in the time series of Doppler shift and line-integrated intensity, GOES SXR fluxes and AIA EUV light curves, indicating the periodic energy release in this flare, which may be caused by a slow mode wave.

40|$|We present {{observational}} {{analysis of}} two successive two-sided loop jets observed by the ground-based New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) and the space-borne Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The two successive two-sided loop jets manifested similar evolution process {{and both were}} associated with the interaction of two small-scale adjacent filamentary threads, magnetic emerging and cancellation processes at the jet's source region. High temporal and high spatial resolution observations reveal that the two adjacent ends of the two filamentary threads are rooted in opposite magnetic polarities within the source region. The two threads approached to each other, and then an obvious brightening patch is observed at the interaction position. Subsequently, a pair of hot plasma ejections are observed heading to opposite directions along the paths of the two filamentary threads, and with a typical speed of two-sided loop jets of the order 150 km/s. Close {{to the end of the}} second jet, we report the formation of a bright <b>hot</b> <b>loop</b> structure at the source region, which suggests the formation of new loops during the interaction. Based on the observational results, we propose that the observed two-sided loop jets are caused by the magnetic reconnection between the two adjacent filamentary threads, largely different from the previous scenario that a two-sided loop jet is generated by magnetic reconnection between an emerging bipole and the overlying horizontal magnetic fields.

However, the 171 Å and 193 Å channel images hint at an alternative scenario. These images reveal that large-scale waves with velocity greater than 1000 km/s propagated alongside and ahead of the erupting plasmoid. Just south of the plasmoid, the waves coincided with type-II radio emission, and to the north, where the waves propagated along plume-like structures, there was increased decimetric emission. Initially the cavity around the hot plasmoid expanded. Later, when the erupting plasmoid reached the height of an overlying arcade system, the plasmoid structure changed, and the lower parts of the cavity collapsed inwards. <b>Hot</b> <b>loops</b> appeared alongside and below the erupting plasmoid.

A Hardware Performance Monitor (HPM) in the processor is useful for locating the cache misses, but is rarely used in the real world for various reasons. It would be better to find a simple approach to locate the sources of cache misses and apply runtime optimizations without relying on an HPM. This paper shows that pointer dereferencing in <b>hot</b> <b>loops</b> is a major source of cache misses in Java programs. Based on this observation, we devised a new approach to identify the instructions and objects that cause frequent cache misses. Our heuristic technique effectively identifies the majority of the cache misses in typical Java programs by matching the <b>hot</b> <b>loops</b> to simple idiomatic code patterns. On average, our technique selected only 2. 8 % of the load and store instructions generated by the JIT compiler and these instructions accounted for 47 % of the L 1 D cache misses and 49 % of the L 2 cache misses caused by the JIT-compiled code. To prove the effectiveness of our technique in compiler optimizations, we prototyped object placement optimizations, which align objects in cache lines or collocate paired objects in the same cache line to reduce cache misses. For comparison, we also implemented the same optimizations based on the accurate information obtained from the HPM.

Recently, such longitudinal waves {{have been found}} by SDO/AIA in the 94 and 131 Å channels. Wang et al. (2015) reported the first AIA event revealing signatures in agreement with a fundamental standing slow-mode wave, and found quantitative evidence for thermal conduction suppression from the temperature and density perturbations in the <b>hot</b> <b>loop</b> plasma of ≳ 9 MK. The present study extends the work of Wang et al. (2015) by using an alternative approach. We determine the polytropic index directly based on the polytropic assumption instead of invoking the linear approximation. The same results are obtained as in the linear approximation, indicating that the nonlinearity effect is negligible.

Aschwanden (2001) found that a uniform heating led to an unreasonably large plasma column depth along the line of sight, and, using a two component loop model, that a footpoint-heated model loop (with a minor cool component) yields more acceptable physical solutions. We revisit the analysis of the same loop system, considering conventional hydrostatic single loop models with uniformly distributed heating, and with heating localized at the footpoints and at the apex, and an unstructured background contribution extrapolated from the region below the analyzed loop. The flux profiles synthesized from the loop models have been compared in detail with those observed in both filter passbands with and without background subtraction; we find that background-subtracted data are fitted with acceptable statistical significance by a model of relatively <b>hot</b> <b>loop</b> (~ 3. 7 MK) heated at the apex, with a column depth ~ 1 / 10 of the loop length.

We find the signature of periodic oscillations localized in the decay phase of the flare in its soft (0. 3 - 10. 0 keV) X-ray emissions. Using the standard wavelet tool, we find the multiple periodicities of 1261 s and 687 s. These bursty oscillations persist for durations of 90 minutes and 50 minutes, respectively, for more than 4 cycles. The intensity oscillations with the period of 1261 s may be the signature of the fundamental mode of slow magnetoacoustic waves with the phase-speed of 119 km s^- 1 in the loop of the length 7. 5 × 10 ^ 9 cm heated initially to obtain the flare peak temperature of 33 MK and later cooled down in the decay phase maintained at the average temperature of 7. 2 MK. The other period of 687 s {{may be associated with}} the first overtone of slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in the flaring loop. The fundamental mode oscillations show a dissipation with damping time of 47 min. The period ratio P_ 1 /P_ 2 is found to be 1. 83 indicating that such oscillations are most likely excited in longitudinal density stratified stellar loops.

These would have lengths of only 1 Mm barely protruding from the chromosphere and spanning across just one granule in the photosphere. Such short loops are well established at transition region temperatures (0. 1 MK), and we investigate if such miniature loops also exist at coronal temperatures (> 1 MK). We used extreme UV imaging (EUV) observations from the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0. 3 " to 0. 4 ". Together with EUV imaging and magnetogram data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) data from Hinode we investigated the spatial, temporal and thermal evolution of small loop-like structures in the solar corona above a plage region close to an active region and compared this to a moss area within the active region. We find that the size, motion and temporal evolution of the loop-like features are consistent with photospheric motions, suggesting a close connection to the photospheric magnetic field. Aligned magnetograms show that one of their endpoints is rooted at a magnetic concentration. Their thermal structure, as revealed together with the X-ray observations, shows significant differences to moss-like features. Considering different scenarios, these features are most probably miniature versions of <b>hot</b> <b>loops</b> rooted at magnetic concentrations at opposite sides of a granule in small emerging magnetic loops (or flux tubes).
