5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E

In <b>Delusions</b> <b>of</b> Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|In the 15 {{years since}} he had left Red River, his {{megalomania}} had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses {{were not the only}} symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was quite ready to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E

40|$|I {{studied the}} {{reliability}} <b>of</b> surveys concerning <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> possession and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> possession. The subjects were psychiatric patients {{who did not}} suffer from any organic mental disorders such as dementia, nor from any substance use disorders. The results were: (1) The reliability <b>of</b> surveys concerning <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> possession was examined in a test-retest fashion {{by a pair of}} psychiatrists and the reliability was very high such as Cohen K was 0. 83 or 0. 93. At the same time the scores of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale by the two raters were found to be highly correlated for most of the rating items. (2) As to the longitudinal change <b>of</b> <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> possession, 78. 9 % of all cases did not change. (3) The possession group was significantly more likely to have such delusions as references and love which were related to suggestibility than the non-possession group. (4) The possession group was significantly more likely to have such pathological experiences as auditory hallucinations, depersonalizations and passivity experiences than the non-possession group. (5) As to the development <b>of</b> <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> possession of schizophrenia, at first patients began to suffer from auditory hallucinations which commanded them, then from such ego disturbance as passivity experiences and depersonalizations {{and at the same time}} <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> references and grandeur, and at last suffered from <b>delusion</b> <b>of</b> possession.

5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

25|$|In {{more extreme}} cases {{features}} of psychosis, with <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> persecution or <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> reference, and pressure of speech may present themselves.

Paranoia and paranoid-hallucionary psychosis in hyperthyroidism usually have a manic disposition and it is therefore often not clear if the patient is experiencing a paranoid psychosis with depressive streaks, or a depression that has paranoid streaks.|$|E

25|$|Investigation of {{the sense}} of agency is {{important}} to explain positive symptoms of schizophrenia, like thought insertion and <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> control. The core of the problem met by these patients is a disturbance of their sense of agency: the first rank symptoms, which represent one of the major features of the disease, are nothing but a loss of the ability to attribute their own thoughts, internal speech, covert or overt actions to themselves. Nonattributed or misattributed thoughts and actions then become a material for delusional interpretation and delirium. One primary source reports that the feeling of alien control (i.e., <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> control) during a movement task in schizophrenic patients is associated with an increased metabolic activity in the right inferior parietal cortex.|$|E
25|$|As a {{military}} term, the word quijote refers to cuisses, {{part of a}} full suit of plate armour protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix -ote denotes the augmentative—for example, grande means large, but grandote means extra large. Following this example, Quixote would suggest 'The Great Quijano', a play on words that makes much sense {{in light of the}} character's <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> grandeur.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} agency {{refers to the}} {{subjective}} feeling of having chosen a particular action. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia, {{can lead to a}} loss of this sense, causing a person to feel like a machine or even leading to <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> being controlled from some outside source. The opposite extreme occurs too, with some people experiencing everything in their environment as if they had decided that it would happen.|$|E

25|$|Synonyms for ORS, many historical, include bromidrosiphobia, {{olfactory}} phobic syndrome, chronic olfactory paranoid syndrome, autodysomophobia, <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> bromosis, hallucinations {{of smell}} and olfactory delusional syndrome. By definition, the many terms {{which have been}} suggested in the dental literature to refer to subjective halitosis complaints (i.e. where a person complains of halitosis yet no odor is detectable clinically) {{can also be considered}} under the umbrella of ORS. Examples include halitophobia, non-genuine halitosis, delusional halitosis, pseudo-halitosis, imaginary halitosis, psychosomatic halitosis, and self halitosis.|$|E

These can be only regarded as tentative results; the study called for future research with a larger population.|$|E

25|$|Max Ernst studied {{philosophy}} and psychology in Bonn and {{was interested in}} the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings, such as Murdering Airplane (1920), may have been inspired by the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's study of the <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a castration complex. The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription {{on the back of the}} painting reads: The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.|$|E
25|$|In addition, one of {{the most}} {{important}} ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of schizophrenia is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force. People with schizophrenia will sometimes report that, although they are acting in the world, they do not recall initiating the particular actions they performed. This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as proprioception), leading to attendant hallucinations and <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> control.|$|E
25|$|ORS may be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. About 13% of schizophrenics have {{olfactory}} hallucinations. Generally, schizophrenic hallucinations {{are perceived}} as having an imposed, external origin, while in ORS they are recognized as originating from the individual. The suggested diagnostic criteria mean {{that the possibility of}} ORS is negated by a diagnosis of schizophrenia in which persistent <b>delusions</b> <b>of</b> an offensive body odor and olfactory hallucinations are contributing features for criterion A. However, some reported ORS cases were presented as co-morbid. Indeed, some have suggested that ORS may in time transform into schizophrenia, but others state there is little evidence for this. Persons with ORS have none of the other criteria to qualify for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.|$|E
