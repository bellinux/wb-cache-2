In a market economy, modernization of existing stone <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises,</b> the use of new technologies {{in the production of}} stone products is actually. Analysis of stone <b>processing</b> <b>enterprise</b> activity shows a large variation in quantitative and qualitative indicators, low competitiveness. However, the demand for stone products with traditional characteristics is stored. Waste stone <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises</b> often exported to landfills that are not suited to the storage of waste or unauthorized, and remain there, taking up more and more land area. During the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro independent Ukraine declared its intention to be actively involved in global environmental policy and development strategy of sustainable development, implementing guidelines defining international instruments at the national level. Consequently, there is an urgent need for real action on comprehensive recycling stone <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises</b> to obtain a secondary product. It {{should be noted that the}} use of modern methods of stone <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises</b> will waste the protection of nature and natural resources, improve the quality of life, restore lost harmony between man and nature.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{substantiate}} the directions of implementing the functions {{of control over the}} <b>processing</b> <b>enterprise</b> competitiveness with using engineering and outsourcing as a new approach to increasing the performance of enterprises operating under conditions of uncertainty and instability of the environment. The study determined that to increase the competitiveness of <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises,</b> their development should occur in two directions: engineering — inside the enterprise and outsourcing — outside it. This allows creating a unified corporate business culture. It is proposed to consider management of <b>processing</b> <b>enterprise</b> competitiveness as engineering problems of regulation of the competitive advantage level. Prospects for further research in this area are the integrated use of tasks of engineering and outsourcing as effective ways to improve the efficiency of <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises,</b> which will lead to the changing of the strategies direction: from costs reduction to creation of value in business operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{processing}} industry is playing {{an increasingly important}} role in Vietnam’s overall economy. A study on the restructure in this sector across the Coastal Central South has demonstrated the dominating part that middlemen are taking in connecting the supply, represented by fishers and farmers, to demand, represented by <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Still, middlemen have gone further in establishing their influences on both, via assisting small producers in inputs for production while intervening the price fixation traditionally practiced by <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises.</b> In deed, their leveraged position {{has come to the}} detriment of small-scale producers and <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises.</b> After examining specific constraints that have hampered potential development of the field, several recommendations are therefore proposed in favor of regulations and policy-marking processes at both business and industry levels. Once the tendency of extending this model is visible, it is hoped that suggested measures can encourage Vietnam, which has so far been witnessing the mainstream of transition from the centrally planned to market-oriented economy, to successfully introduce far-reaching reforms...|$|R
40|$|Value-added {{agriculture}} {{has grown}} {{in recent years and}} is often promoted as a rural development or business survival strategy. For dairy operations, value-added often has meant adding a <b>processing</b> <b>enterprise</b> to an existing dairy farm. This case study examined whether it was profitable to transition to a value-added operation, comparing and contrasting the business characteristics and financial performance of three businesses of similar size in Vermont, Wisconsin, and New York. The methods included the development of income statements, balance sheets, and economic costs and returns in order to evaluate the profitability of the farming and <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises</b> for each business. The financial data were collected from a previous study done by Nicholson and Stephenson (2006) for the fiscal year 2003. Tabular summaries of the key information from these statements were constructed to facilitate comparisons of the farming and <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises</b> separately for the three businesses. Results indicated that similar size operations in terms of cow numbers can have highly different production and financial outcomes. For two of the three businesses, the <b>processing</b> <b>enterprise</b> was profitable based on net income, but only one business had a positive (and small) rate of return on assets (accounting for equity capital and operator labor costs). None of the three processing businesses were profitable when the full economic costs of milk production and processing were accounted for. It is also important to note that none of the three operations had positive net incomes for both the dairy and <b>processing</b> <b>enterprises,</b> which appears to question a basic premise underlying value-added businesses. Although this study will be beneficial for the business owners and others interested in value-added operations, a more in-depth and up-to-date study would be beneficial to determine the specific factors involved in a successful value-added enterprise...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} rural women entrepreneurship in agro-food processing in Enugu State. Interview schedule {{was used to}} collect data from 160 respondents. The result revealed that majority (88. 1 %) of women agro-food processors in Enugu State had low level of involvement in agro-food processing activities. About 57 % of women agro-food processors were at low level of participation in establishment of agro-food <b>processing</b> <b>enterprise</b> in the State.
