40|$|This is an {{analysis}} of the connection between the <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. While it is made clear by historians such as Megan Elias and Kathy Cooke that there is ample connection between eugenics and euthenics, there has not been as comprehensive {{an analysis}} of the direct connections between <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. Close examination of literature from the <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> movement reveals the shared goals of <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. The <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> movement was also a necessary precursor to the euthenics movement, not simply a “re-envisioning” of home economics by Ellen Richards. When Richards died, her euthenic ideals would continue {{to be a part of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> in the early decades of the twentieth century. This analysis will contribute in part to the understanding of how, through rhetoric, nations can progress towards more unsightly policies of social engineering from seemingly benign beginnings. Eugenics may not have origins in <b>domestic</b> <b>science,</b> a field of homemaking, cookery, etiquette, and child-rearing, but eugenics certainly shares goals, purposes, and a vision with <b>domestic</b> <b>science...</b>|$|R
