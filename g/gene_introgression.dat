In this study, {{we set out to}} investigate the genetic status of the Vietnamese Black H’mong pig breed by evaluating (1) genetic diversity and (2) introgression from exotic breeds. Two exotic breeds, namely Lan-drace and Yorkshire used for crossbreeding, and the H’mong pig population from Ha Giang (HG) province were investigated using microsatellite markers. Within the province, three phenotypes were observed: a White, a Spotted and a Black phenotype. Genetic differentiation between phenotypes was low (0. 5 – 6. 1 %).

40|$|Soybean {{isoflavone}} synthase (IFS) and flavanone 3 -hydroxylase (F 3 H) are two key enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids and flavonoids, both {{of which}} play diverse roles in stress responses. However, {{little is known about}} the evolutionary pattern of these genes in cultivated soybean and its wild progenitors. Herein, we investigated the nucleotide polymorphisms in Isoflavone synthase (IFS 1, IFS 2) and Flavanone 3 -hydroxylase (F 3 H 2) genes from 33 soybean accessions, including 17 cultivars (Glycine max) and 16 their wild progenitors (Glycine soja). Our data showed that the target genes shared the levels of nucleotide polymorphism with three reference genes involved in plant-microbe interactions, but possessed a much higher nucleotide polymorphism than other reference genes. Moreover, no significant genetic differentiation was found between cultivated soybean and its wild relatives in three target genes, despite of considering bottleneck and founder effect during domestication. These results indicate that IFS and F 3 H genes could have experienced <b>gene</b> <b>introgressions</b> or diversifying selection events during domestication process.

40|$|Nowadays, {{hybridization}} {{is recognized}} as a powerful evolutionary force promoting speciation and shaping adaptation, {{but also as a}} serious threat to the conservation of biodiversity. This thesis is focused on two cases of hybridization between wild and domestic conspecifics, whose effects are mostly unexplored. In Sus scrofa, I sought to expand knowledge about hybridization between wild boar and domestic pig. I investigated the main sources of domestic <b>genes</b> <b>introgression,</b> and assessed hybridization at neutral markers and functional genes at both local and European scale. I also developed a set of new uniparental markers for studying male-specific gene flow, and studied the reproductive phenology of wild populations. In Canis lupus, I investigated patterns of hybridization between wolf and domestic dog in an Italian mountain area, focusing on the assessment of introgression and the food habits of hybrids. As regards wild boar, I detected introgression all over Europe, also highlighting the role of breeding stations in spreading domestic genes across wild populations. With respect to wolf, a new approach was used to provide complementary (genetic and phenotypic) data on specific individuals and to support hybrid identification. A trophic niche overlap between wolves and hybrids was also proved. These studies can have relevant management implications, offering new elements of knowledge on different aspects of the hybridization in two worrisome species of the Italian fauna. ...|$|R

Frost damage in barley has been prevalent in recent years prompting a GRDC funded project to identify spring {{radiation frost}} tolerance in barley. The project aims to characterise genetic variation for tolerance to spring radiation frost in barley through field-based screening. If genetic variation is found, the development of a mapping population to identify molecular markers linked to genes/QTLs conferring frost tolerance in barley will commence. The impact of frost damage on malting quality is also under investigation. Germplasm from areas throughout the world where spring frost occurs have been selected for screening, as well as commercial winter and spring varieties, selected landraces and mutant <b>gene</b> <b>introgressions.</b> Screening is being carried out at three locations in SA where spring radiation frost is frequent. The evaluation of frost damage includes traits such as electrolyte leakage; tiller, spike and floret mortality; pinched grain and grain weight.

Here, we report a possible trend of interspecific introgressive hybridization in the genus Liriodendron. We sampled five mixture plantations with L. chinense, L. tulipifera, and hybrid Liriodendron from southeastern China.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} number of studies showing that {{interspecific}} hybridization and <b>gene</b> <b>introgression</b> have a creative role in the evolution of animals. These studies emphasize that hybridization and a <b>gene</b> <b>introgression</b> represent an important source of a genetic variability. Within the process of adaptive introgression, adaptive traits may spread among species and help them to colonize new environments. Interspecific hybridization may also contribute to the emergence of new phenotypes and evolutionary novelties and thus contribute to adaptive radiations. Hybridization can be also a cause of parallel evolutions in many organisms. Another way how hybridization affects evolution is related to a speciation. Hybrid speciation could be one of ways how new species arise, and in this way increase the biodiversity. However in many cases the hybridization has an opposite impact on species richness and present a danger of species extinction by hybridization. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to explain and discuss the above described processes, introduces selected examples of animals related to these processes, and finally evaluate the role of interspecies hybridization in animal evolution.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{outbreak}} of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii began in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) in the late 1990 s. This outbreak consists of three clonal subpopulations: VGIIa/major, VGIIb/minor, and VGIIc/novel. Both VGIIa and VGIIc are unique to the PNW and exhibit increased virulence. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of isolates from these three groups, as well as global isolates, and analyzed a total of 53 isolates. We found that VGIIa/b/c populations show evidence of clonal expan-sion in the PNW. Whole-genome sequencing provided evidence that VGIIb originated in Australia, while VGIIa may have origi-nated in South America, and these were likely independently introduced. Additionally, the VGIIa outbreak lineage may have arisen from a less virulent clade that contained a mutation in theMSH 2 ortholog, but this appears to have reverted in the VGIIa outbreak strains, suggesting that a transient mutator phenotype {{may have contributed to}} adaptation and evolution of virulence in the PNW outbreak. PNW outbreak isolates share genomic islands, both between the clonal lineages and with global isolates, indicative of sexual recombination. This suggests that VGII C. gattii has undergone sexual reproduction, either bisexual or uni-sexual, in multiple locales contributing to the production of novel, virulent subtypes. We also found that the genomes of two basal VGII isolates fromHIV patients contain an introgression tract spanning three <b>genes.</b> <b>Introgression</b> substantially contrib-uted to intra-VGII polymorphism and likely occurred through sexual reproduction with VGI.

40|$|A {{defining}} {{feature of}} species {{is that their}} constituting populations are connected by gene flow. However, interspecific <b>gene</b> flow (<b>introgression)</b> can affect species integrity. If some genome components were less prone to introgression than others, they should be particularly suitable to delimitate species. Recent simulation studies have predicted a negative correlation between intra- and interspecific gene flow, suggesting that markers associated with the most dispersing sex should better delimitate species. A review of studies of introgression in species with sex-biased dispersal largely confirms this prediction. Hence, species delimitation should be more effective with markers experiencing high levels of gene flow, a simple but not widely appreciated prediction...|$|R

In this treatise, we develop a theory for marker-assisted selection for the proportion of the genome originating from the recurrent parent in a backcross program, carried out after preselection for the target gene(s). Our objectives were to (i) predict response to selection and (ii) give criteria for selecting the most promising backcross individuals for further backcrossing or selfing. Prediction of response to selection is based on the marker linkage map and the marker genotype of the parent(s) of the backcross population. In comparison to standard normal distribution selection theory, the main advantage of our approach is that it considers the reduction {{of the variance in the}} donor genome proportion due to selection. The developed selection criteria take into account the marker genotype of the candidates and consider whether these will be used for selfing or backcrossing. Prediction of response to selection is illustrated for model genomes of maize and sugar beet. Selection of promising individuals is illustrated with experimental data from sugar beet.

MK] is an {{important}} cereal crop economically and nutritionally in the Central Asia and Caucasian, West Asia, and North Africa (CWANA) regions. Durum landraces and improved lines are largely grown in this region. Its genetic diversity has been studied using different molecular markers. The increasing availability of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and related cereals provides a valuable resource of non-anonymous DNA markers to study durum diversity. In this study, a set of 517, 319 Triticum aestivum EST sequences was employed for the identification of wheat simple sequence repeats called microsatellites (W-eSSRs) {{with the help of}} a PERL 5 script called MISA. In comparison, barley microsatellites (B-eSSRs) have been used to exploit their transferability to durum wheat.

In this study, 300 primer pairs were designed from 265 wheat ESTs that contain microsatellites {{in order to develop}} new markers for wheat. Their level of transferability in eight related species [Triticum durum, T. monococcum, Aegilops speltoides, Ae. tauschii, rye (Secale cereale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), Agropyron elongatum and rice (Oryza sativa) ] was assessed. In total, 240 primer pairs (80 %) gave an amplification product on wheat, and 177 were assigned to wheat chromosomes using aneuploid lines. Transferability to closely related Triticeae species ranged from 76. 7 % for Ae. tauschii to 90. 4 % for T. durum and was lower for more distant relatives such as barley (50. 4 %) or rice (28. 3 %). No clear putative function could be assigned to the genes from which the simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were developed, even though most of them were located inside ORFs. BLAST analysis of the EST sequences against the 12 rice pseudo-molecules showed that the EST-SSRs are mainly located in the telomeric regions and that the wheat ESTs have the highest similarity to genes on rice chromosomes 2, 3 and 5. Interestingly, most of the SSRs giving an amplification product on barley or rice had a repeated motif similar to the one found in wheat, suggesting a common ancestral origin.

Two pine species, Pinus massoniana and P. hwangshanensis, are frequently observed growing adjacent to each other, where they overlap in a narrow hybrid zone. As a consequence, these species constitute an ideal system for studying genetic introgression and reproductive barriers between naturally hybridizing, adjacently distributed species. In this study, we sampled 270 pine trees along an elevation gradient in Anhui Province, China and analyzed these samples using EST-SSR markers. The molecular data revealed that direct gene flow between the two species was fairly low, and that the majority of <b>gene</b> <b>introgression</b> was intermediated by backcrossing. On the basis of empirical observation, the on-site distribution of pines was divided into a P. massoniana zone, a hybrid zone, and a P. hwangshanensis zone.

The genetic boundary of the hybrid zone, on the other hand, was indistinct owing to intensive backcrossing with parental species. Compared with P. massoniana, P. hwangshanensis was found to backcross with the hybrids more intensively, consistent with the observation that morphological and anatomical characteristics of trees in the contact zone were biased towards P. hwangshanensis.

40|$|Abstract Background If {{the insect}} {{innate immune system}} {{is to be used}} as a {{potential}} blocking step in transmission of malaria, then it will require targeting one or a few genes with highest relevance and ease of manipulation. The problem is to identify and manipulate those of most importance to malaria infection without the risk of decreasing the mosquito's ability to stave off infections by microbes in general. Molecular evolution methodologies and concepts can help identify such genes. Within the setting of a comparative molecular population genetic and phylogenetic framework, involving six species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, we investigated whether a set of four pre-selected immunity genes (gambicin, NOS, Rel 2 and FBN 9) might have evolved under selection pressure imposed by the malaria parasite. Results We document varying levels of polymorphism within and divergence between the species, in all four <b>genes.</b> <b>Introgression</b> and the sharing of ancestral polymorphisms, two processes that have been documented in the past, were verified in this study in all four studied genes. These processes appear to affect each gene in different ways and to different degrees. However, there is no evidence of positive selection acting on these genes. Conclusion Considering the results presented here in concert with previous studies, genes that interact directly with the Plasmodium parasite, and play little or no role in defense against other microbes, are probably the most likely candidates for a specific adaptive response against P. falciparum. Furthermore, since it is hard to establish direct evidence linking the adaptation of any candidate gene to P. falciparum infection, a comparative framework allowing at least an indirect link should be provided. Such a framework could be achieved, if a similar approach like the one involved here, was applied to all other anopheline complexes that transmit P. falciparum malaria. </p...|$|R

The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia, {{is one of the most}} damaging insect pests of wheat and barley throughout the World. Although it is not yet present, its incursion to Australia is expected cause substantial loses to the grains industry and therefore pre-breeding research against this insect is seen as a high priority in Australia. The objectives of the study are to: 1) Identify available RWA resistant wheat and barley germplasm from around the world and characterize against available RWA biotypes in various countries, 2) develop genomic tools for marker-assisted breeding, and 3) introgress new RWA resistance genes into more adapted wheat and barley backgrounds. We have evaluated a wide range of wheat and barley lines from various parts of the world against a number of RWA biotypes from USA, Argentina, Mexico, Hungary, South Africa, France, Chile, Iran, and Syria.

Within the setting of a comparative molecular population genetic and phylogenetic framework, involving six species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, we investigated whether a set of four preselected immunity genes (gambicin, NOS, Rel 2 and FBN 9) might have evolved under selection pressure imposed by the malaria parasite. Results: We document varying levels of polymorphism within and divergence between the species, in all four <b>genes.</b> <b>Introgression</b> and the sharing of ancestral polymorphisms, two processes that have been documented in the past, were verified in this study in all four studied genes. These processes appear to affect each gene in different ways and to different degrees. However, there is no evidence of positive selection acting on these genes. Conclusion: Considering the results presented here in concert with previous studies, genes that interact directly with the Plasmodium parasite, and play little or no role in defense against other microbes, are probably the most likely candidates for a specific adaptive response against P. falciparum. Furthermore, since it is hard to establish direct evidence linking the adaptation of any candidate gene to P. falciparum infection, a comparative framework allowing at least an indirect link should be provided. Such a framework could be achieved, if a similar approach like the one involved here, was applied to all other anopheline complexes that transmit P. falciparum malaria...|$|R

The Bph 20 gene was mapped to 193.4  kb region {{located on the}} short arm of chromosome 4, and the Bph 21 gene was mapped to a 194.0  kb region on the long arm of chromosome 12. However, allelism test is needed to confirm the independence of Bph 20 and Bph 21 genes.|$|R

By comparing morphological and ecological characteristics between these three phenotypes, I was able to separate C. longilabris and C. nebraskana using ventral and proepisternal color, presence or absence of a middle band on the elytra, elytral luster, labral width:length ratio, and hind tarsal length. Somewhat less useful characters were labral color and total length. The third phenotype was often not assignable to either species and probably represents hybrid populations, showing <b>gene</b> flow (<b>introgression</b> and recombination) between C. longilabris and C. nebraskana, as individuals were often found in overlapping prairie/boreal habitats at intermediate altitudes...|$|R
