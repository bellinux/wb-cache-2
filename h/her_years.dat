She died in 1953; despite <b>her</b> <b>years</b> of service to party and union, and her successes in breaking through gender boundaries, {{she has not been}} greatly honoured within the Labour movement. According to a later female cabinet minister, Barbara Castle, Bondfield's actions in office had brought her close to betrayal of the movement.|$|E

After the 2007 World Cup, she experienced a drop in confidence due to both her own negative thoughts about her performances as well as derogatory comments about her sexuality made by fellow national team players.

5|$|The American Library Association honored her for <b>her</b> <b>years</b> {{of support}} to America's {{libraries}} and librarians in April 2005. The Progressive Librarians Guild opposed her being honored, because of her support of the USA PATRIOT Act, her cancellation of a poetry forum due to concern {{that some of the}} poets would express opposition to the war in Iraq, and the Guild's opposition to policies and spending priorities of her husband's administration.|$|E

5|$|Alma Mahler survived {{her husband}} {{by more than}} 50years, dying in 1964. She married Walter Gropius in 1915, {{divorced}} him five years later, and married the writer Franz Werfel in 1929. In 1940 she published a memoir of <b>her</b> <b>years</b> with Mahler, entitled Gustav Mahler: Memories and Letters. This account was criticised by later biographers as incomplete, selective and self-serving, and for providing a distorted picture of Mahler's life. The composer's daughter Anna Mahler became a well-known sculptor; she died in 1988. The International Gustav Mahler Society was founded in 1955 in Vienna, with Bruno Walter as its first president and Alma Mahler as an honorary member. The Society aims to create a complete critical edition of Mahler's works, and to commemorate {{all aspects of the}} composer's life.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>her</b> <b>years</b> of service, she {{had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial status and the unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept her {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Sir Norman Brook {{attempted}} to have Gowing {{retained in the}} Cabinet Office as the permanent historian, but was stymied by the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission. In 1951, she was told {{that she had no}} chance of being appointed to the grade of Principal, which would have carried retirement benefits with it. She later said that <b>her</b> <b>years</b> at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life, but she began looking for another position. In 1955, she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford, and for a position as a reader at LSE, but was unsuccessful. Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes to allow her to be retained at the Cabinet Office, and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office Archivist, but he could not offer her a pension.|$|E

Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the Spectator newspaper and freelanced for The Oregonian, both in Portland, Oregon. During <b>her</b> <b>years</b> in Portland (1909–1915), she became active in the women's suffrage movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to Greenwich Village, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as The Masses, or at meetings of a women's group, Heterodoxy, or through work with the Provincetown Players. During a National Woman's Party suffrage rally in Washington, D.C., in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail.

The original work was compiled by Dickinson during <b>her</b> <b>years</b> at Amherst Academy, and consists of 424 pressed specimens of plants arranged on 66 pages of a bound album.

It opened to the public for tours, and also served as a faculty residence for many years. The Emily Dickinson Museum was created in 2003 when ownership of the Evergreens, which had been occupied by Dickinson family heirs until 1988, was transferred to the college.|$|E
