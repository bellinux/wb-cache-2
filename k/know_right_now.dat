And now I'm still a member of the counterculture, but I don't know what to call that.

5000|$|The {{organization}} has used their PM2.5 data {{as a means}} of bringing attention to the health concerns associated with Hong Kong’s air pollution. For instance, their preliminary air quality monitoring showed that PM2.5 levels exceeded the recommended guidelines from the WHO. CAN also intended for their self-monitored report to act as a catalyst in encouraging the government to publish city wide PM2.5 levels in real-time. CAN believes that real time PM2.5 data is necessary, as [...] "people need to <b>know,</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> the level of air pollution harming their health," [...] according to CAN campaign manager Erica Chan. Eventually, through politicizing and lobbying, CAN influenced the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) to monitor PM2.5 levels every hour and to release the data to the public. Data is now gathered from 14 different monitoring stations, although the organization still finds the government’s actions inadequate as a majority of monitors are placed above ground level and do not accurately measure the pollutants the average person would be exposed to. As well, six districts in Hong Kong still lack air quality monitoring stations, with the said districts being the Southern District, Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City, North, Sai Kung and Tuen Mun.|$|E
5000|$|Proponents {{argue the}} train {{should have been}} {{equipped}} with positive train control (PTC), which can automatically stop a train or slow it to a safe speed if the engineer fails {{to do so in}} time. Amtrak officials said PTC had been installed on the tracks ahead of a Congress-mandated December 2015 deadline, but had yet to be operational due to [...] "budgetary shortfalls, technical hurdles and bureaucratic rules". For four years, the railroad struggled with the FCC to purchase the rights to airwaves in the Northeast Corridor required for PTC, which might have limited the train's speed and thereby prevented the wreck. During a press conference, NTSB member Robert Sumwalt told reporters, [...] "Based on what we <b>know</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> we feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred." [...] The track in question was not equipped with ATC (Automatic Train Control), which had been operational for years on the southbound track of the curve at which the derailment occurred, and which also would have limited the train's speed entering the curve. Shortly after the derailment, Amtrak completed that ATC installation on the northbound track.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany {{people suffer}} from {{fibromyalgia}} (FM) without an effective treatment. They {{do not have}} a good quality of life and cannot maintain normal daily activity. Among the different hypotheses for its ethiopathophysiology, oxidative stress is one of the possibilities. Non-scientific information addressed to patients regarding the benefits of nutrition is widely available, and they are used to trying non-evidenced strategies. The aim {{of this paper is to}} find out what we <b>know</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> from scientific studies regarding fibromyalgia disease and nutritional status, diets and food supplements. A systematic search has been performed on Medline with a wide range of terms about these nutritional issues. The search has been made during 2009, for articles published between 1998 and 2008. Target population: people suffering from FM. Vegetarian diets could have some beneficial effects probably due to the increase in antioxidant intake. There is a high prevalence of obesity and overweight in patients, and weight control seems to be an effective tool to improve the symptoms. Some nutritional deficiencies have been described, it is not clear whether they are directly related to this disease or not. About the usefulness of some food supplements we found very little data, and it seems that more studies are needed to prove which ones could be of help. Dietary advice is necessary to these patients to improve their diets and maintain normal weight. It would be interesting to investigate more in the field of nutrition and FM to reveal any possible relationships...|$|E

We experienced a fantastic response this spring to the call for committee members and RSS representatives to RUSA Committees. In fact, I’m glad {{to have had the}} problem of having too many highly engaged RSS members to place. Many thanks to everyone who is continuing to serve on a committee and a big hearty WELCOME to all of our new committee members! It was fantastic getting the chance to meet so many of you at the RSS Open House and All-Committee meeting on the Saturday morning of ALA Annual in Washington, DC. 2. RSS Committees have each been asked to craft 1 or 2 achievable goals for the year (July ’ 10 – June ’ 11). Examples of goals could be: “The committee will complete the revision of the Guidelines for _. ” “The committee will plan and present the program, _ at the 2011 Annual Conference in New Orleans. ” “The committee will plan and present one webinar on the topic of _. ” 3. The RSS Section Review is complete. Now the important work of making changes and implementing the recommendations begins. Thanks to all Organization & Planning members and others who were involved in seeing this project through to conclusion. 4. Did you know? As of July 1 we no longer have standing RSS “Discussion Groups. ” However, we now have two new committees. These are the Discussion Forums Coordinating Committee (responsible for selecting discussions to take place during Midwinter and Annual) and the RSS Service Achievement Award Committee (to annually recognize a stand-out RSS member). 5.
