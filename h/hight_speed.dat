40|$|The {{maximum speed}} {{requirements}} for <b>hight</b> <b>speed</b> boats {{is very important}} and just one knot less than maximumspeed established can invalidate the design or even the manufactured boat. On the other hand, {{there is a great}} scientific gap when it comes to performance prediction models for planing hulls made of composite materials. The performance of this kind of boat is very influenced by the propeller efficiency. Since there are no recurring methods to analyse a propeller's geometry, this article aims to establish a procedure based in the photogrammetry technique to evaluate manufactured propellers [...] .

40|$|High {{variability}} of the ionosphere {{is connected to}} geomagnetic, solar, and neutral atmosphere wave activity. Results of scaling analysis of solar data (F 10. 7, SSN), geomagnetic indices (Dst, Kp, AE), and ionospheric critical frequencies (foF 2) show similar structure of Kp, AE and foF 2 at periods {{in the range from}} 4 to 32 days. Data structure depends on the location of ionospheric stations. Correlation coefficients between foF 2 and geomagnetic and solar indices depend on length of time scale. We show that vertical coupling exists between neutral atmosphere activity and sporadic E layer area. This connection is located predominantly on periods corresponding to internal modes of planetary waves. Interplanetary magnetic field discontinuities (Coronal mass ejections, Magnetic clouds, <b>Hight</b> <b>speed</b> solar streams) affect strongly the ionosphere. Analysed events lead to lowering of foF 2, increase in heights of the layer F 2 and oscillations of hmF 2 and foF 2 on periods in the order of hours. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|Geographic {{information}} {{plays an}} important part in peopleâ€™s life. Especially with the development of computer science and Internet. GIS also went into a new era, from paper works to digital formats. The digital geographic data files can be spread and shared fast and widely via Internet. However, establishing new geographic data is expensive, thus the data users are not always the data establisher. In the <b>hight</b> <b>speed</b> developing GI society, many private sectors have participated in geographic data production, and also many datasets are from unclear sources with unclear quality information. In addition, errors can be generated during the transform and transfer processes. Therefor proper geographic data quality control and management is in urgent demand. GML is an XML-formed document for geographic information. It is a young but fast developing geographic data format, with its natural advantages, it is now being considered as standard geographic data format world wide. This project is concerned with the data quality control for GML files. Data validation is one kind of data quality measurement method in the data quality control process. The thesis aims to build up a validation framework for GML files based on the Norwegian standard. In the report the geographic data modeling is first described, including the Norwegian road network production specification, simple feature specification, and the related GML knowledge. The data quality issues are introduced after the modeling, the data quality issues are elaborated from two levels: general inconsistency level and specific ISO data quality element level. Following is the introductions, discussions and comparisons to the existing relevant geographic data quality tools. And at the ene the final GML validation framework is determined...|$|E
