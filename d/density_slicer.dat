40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Photo-optical and electronic <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> {{were applied to}} ERTS- 1 E 1007 - 151651 - 4, 30 July 1972, an area in the Caribbean showing deep ocean water, and shallow areas on the Great Baham Bank ranging from 0. 5 meter or less to 18 meters. The <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> processes were adjusted to correlate water radiance to bathmetric contours shown on C and GS Chart 1112. A number of large areas corresponding to water depths of 2 meters or less, 5 to 10 meters, and 10 to about 20 meters were isolated by both processes. Where clear water and uniformly reflective bottom was found, clear of marine growths, the photo-optical and electronic image <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> processes proved effective in delineating areas where the depth was {{in the order of}} 5 meters, plus or minus 1 meter...|$|R
40|$|The {{keystone}} of the <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> {{process is}} an instrument called a densitometer, which can "see" many subtle gradations not {{visible to the}} human eye. This instrument was integrated into a computerized system which analyzed the tonal density of a moon photo, assigned a color code {{to each of the}} various shades, and created on a video monitor a new picture in which each color represented a particular measurement, such as height or depth. <b>Density</b> <b>slicing,</b> applied to telescopic photos and later to close-up views acquired by unmanned spacecraft, provided the foundation for NASA's extensive study and selection of safe Apollo landing sites...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{variants}} of false color such as pseudocolor, <b>density</b> <b>slicing,</b> and choropleths {{are used for}} information visualization of either data gathered by a single grayscale channel or data not depicting parts {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} (e.g. elevation in relief maps or tissue types in magnetic resonance imaging).|$|R
50|$|<b>Density</b> <b>slicing,</b> a {{variation}} of pseudo color, divides an image into a few colored bands and is (among others) used {{in the analysis of}} remote sensing images. For <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> the range of grayscale levels is divided into intervals, with each interval assigned to one of a few discrete colors - this is in contrast to pseudo color, which uses a continuous color scale. For example, in a grayscale thermal image the temperature values in the image can be split into bands of 2 Â°C, and each band represented by one color - as a result the temperature of one spot in the thermograph can be easier acquired by the user, because the discernible differences between the discrete colors are greater than those of images with continuous grayscale or continuous pseudo color.|$|R

The intial experiments conducted with this film were encouraging, and indicated that this {{technique of}} <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> using readily accessible darkroom facilities and simple darkroom procedures allows rapid, accurate, and facile interpretation of certain areal phenomena to be made from the imagery. The distribution of the tree yucca, Yucca brevifolia Jaegeriana, in the eastern Mojave Desert of Southern California and southern Nevada was used as an example to test the accuracy of the technique for mapping purposes.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{determine}} the accuracy of using simple digital image processing techniques to map riverine water bodies with Landsat 5 TM data. This paper quantifies the classification accuracy of single band <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> of Landsat 5 TM data to delineate water bodies on riverine floodplains. The results of these analyses are then compared to a 6 -band maximum likelihood classification over the same area.

Comparison of 9 x 9 MSS band images and color composites made from bands 4, 5, and 6 showing vegetated areas near Phoenix {{during the summer}} and fall seasons aided in definitely establishing that certain land areas were being used as agricultural land and not as rangeland. Agricultural land, which appeared to be fallow, idle, or not irrigated, often became more readily identifiable as agricultural land when comparing different images of identical land areas which have been affected by seasonal vegetation changes. Experimentation with color <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> portions of 9 x 9 MSS band 7 transparency showing the central urban core of phoenix enabled dense commercial and industrial areas to be separated from less dense urbanized land uses; however, loss of resolution produced results of limited usefulness.

40|$|Coastal {{erosion and}} land loss {{continue}} to threaten many {{areas in the}} United States. Landsat data {{has been used to}} monitor regional coastal change since the 1970 s. Many techniques can be used to produce coastal land water masks, including image classification and <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> of individual bands or of band ratios. Band ratios used in land water detection include several variations of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). This poster discusses a study that compares land water masks computed from unsupervised Landsat image classification with masks from density-sliced band ratios and from the Landsat TM band 5. The greater New Orleans area is employed in this study, due to its abundance of coastal habitats and its vulnerability to coastal land loss. Image classification produced the best results based on visual comparison to higher resolution satellite and aerial image displays. However, <b>density</b> <b>sliced</b> NDWI imagery from either near infrared (NIR) and blue bands or from NIR and green bands also produced more effective land water masks than imagery from the density-sliced Landsat TM band 5.

In situ measurements of LAI were made using the LiCor LAI- 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer on 109 plots under a variety of stand conditions (i. e., stand age, nutritional regime, and stem density) in North Carolina and Virginia, USA in late summer, 2008. Distributional metrics were calculated for each plot using small footprint lidar data (average pulse density 5 pulses per square meter; up to four returns per pulse) acquired in the month preceding the field measurements. Distributional metrics were calculated for each plot using all vegetation returns, as well as using ten 1 m deep crown <b>density</b> <b>slices</b> (a new technique introduced in this study), five above and five below the mode of the vegetation returns for each plot. These metrics were used as independent variables in best subsets regressions with LAI (measured in situ) as the dependent variable.
