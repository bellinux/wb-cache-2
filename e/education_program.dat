40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} on technology integration and teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> shows that teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> are not adequately preparing students to integrate technology. This study focused on three teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> {{across the country that}} have acquired a reputation among their peers for having successfully integrated technology into their programs. In order to gain a deeper understanding, three research questions guided the research: (1) What are the contemporary realities of technology and teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in the three programs? (2) What are the affordances and constraints around technology integration in the three programs? and (3) What working infrastructure has been established in teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> as potential affordances for technology integration? To answer these research questions, multiple case study techniques were incorporated. Qualitative data were collected through site visits at three teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> Data sources included observations, in-depth semi-structured interviews with faculty, staff, and students, and examinations of documents and artifacts related to technology. The three case studies played a vital part in understanding which technology integration model succeeded and did not succeed. By using qualitative research methodology, this study provided more lively and convincing stories and perspectives of technology and teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> 	This study described the contemporary realities of technology and teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs,</b> the affordances and constraints around technology integration, and the process of creating a working infrastructure in teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> as potential affordances for technology integration. The commitment to integrate technology in the programs was an evolving process. Teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> continuously sought better ways to implement technology integration. One consistent finding across all programs was the lack of technology integration throughout the programs. There were strong attempts to integrate technology across the programs through a required technology course or digital portfolio construction and laptop initiative. Cases of integration of technology existed; however, it stayed at the individual level. Several affordances and constraints, ranging from organizational to personal constraints, have contributed to the general failure to integrate technology throughout the teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> In particular, levels of technology integration, administrative support, funding, technical support, technology access, and faculty development have influenced or hindered technology integration in the teacher <b>education</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
