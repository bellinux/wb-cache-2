5|$|Peter {{states that}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> his lesson {{and will never}} do it again. Instead {{he is going to}} try for such things as a {{minority}} scholarship, a sexual harassment suit, and a disability claim.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a major theme {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E

60|$|As he {{drew near}} the Big River, {{he was very}} watchful and careful, was Blacky, for this was the season when hunters with terrible guns were abroad, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{discovered}} that they {{were likely to be}} hiding along the Big River, hoping to shoot Mr. or Mrs. Quack or some of their relatives. So he was very watchful as he drew near the Big River, for <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that it was dangerous to pass too near a hunter with a terrible gun. More than once <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been shot at. But <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> by these experiences. Oh, yes, Blacky <b>had</b> <b>learned.</b> For one thing, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> to know a gun when he saw it. For another thing, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> just how far away one of these dreadful guns could be and still hurt the one it was pointed at, and to always keep just a little farther away. Also <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that a man or boy without a terrible gun is quite harmless, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that hunters with terrible guns are tricky and sometimes hide from those they seek to kill, so that in the dreadful hunting season it is best to look sharply before approaching any place.|$|R
6000|$|Don Sebastian smiled. [...] "Because I did not know. I {{saw a man}} steal {{down the}} ladder and {{thought he might be}} a spy, but could not tell how much <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned.</b> If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> nothing, it would have been {{dangerous}} for the captain to change his plan again and keep to the sailing list." ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> {{all this}} <b>he</b> {{did not think}} it worth while staying there any longer, so he ran away home to his parents again. Soon after this there was a market in the next village, and the boy told his mother that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> how to change himself into the shape of any animal he chose.|$|R
5|$|Strange {{meanwhile}} {{finds himself}} on the moon where he meets the Watcher Uatu, who tells him that the strange events are due to an anomaly he calls the Forerunner. The Forerunner is from the future and its presence {{in the past has}} disrupted reality to the point of impending annihilation of not only Strange's world but all other universes as well. Explaining his theory that the emergence of various superhumans on Stephen's Earth {{is the result of the}} universe trying to save itself, the Watcher tells Strange that he will not be able to repeat what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> while he is alive.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered over what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned,</b> and Kain says his actions are justified {{due to his}} being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E
5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned,</b> and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not for}} {{fun that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> while <b>he</b> was with the wolves to imitate the {{challenge}} of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little wild pig. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate it almost perfectly, and before dark <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> the names of many things in the hut.|$|R

5|$|Ripken {{has made}} {{donations}} to many various charitable causes, including donations supporting research on Lou Gehrig's disease. After he broke Gehrig's record, the Orioles, along with private donors, created the Cal Ripken/Lou Gehrig Fund for Neuromuscular Research at Johns Hopkins University. Along {{with his brother}} Billy, he formed the Cal Ripken Sr., Foundation in 2001 to give underprivileged children the opportunity to attend baseball camps {{around the country and}} learn the game. The Foundation is a branch of Ripken Baseball. In addition to controlling these camps and Ripken's minor league teams, Ripken Baseball operates for-profit camps and designs ballfields for youth, college, and professional teams. He gives speeches about his time in baseball and some of the lessons <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned.</b> Between 2001 and 2004, inclusive, Ripken served as commissioner of the White House Tee Ball Initiative of President George W. Bush, in which capacity he worked to promote the value of teamwork amongst players and volunteership amongst the public and helped to teach tee ball fundamentals to teams of children at the White House.|$|E
5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E

60|$|Gradually a broad grin {{illuminated}} his features. His bruises {{were many}} and they hurt; {{but the good}} that had come from his adventure was worth all that it <b>had</b> cost. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned,</b> for instance, that the apes of Kerchak had heeded his teaching, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> good friends among the sullen beasts whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> thought without sentiment. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> discovered that Manu, the monkey--even little, cowardly Manu--had risked his life in his defense.|$|R
25|$|Sopori {{hails from}} Srinagar in Kashmir Valley and traces his lineage to ancient Santoor experts. He {{belongs to the}} Sufiana gharana of Indian {{classical}} music. His family has played santoor for over seven generations.

25|$|One autumn, {{a disciple}} reveals <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> a new {{technique}} to shrink noses from a friend, a Chinese doctor who has become a high-ranking priest at the Chōrakuji temple in Kyoto. At first, Naigu feigns disinterest, {{to appeal to the}} misconception that he is unconcerned with his nose, but eventually “gives in” to his disciple’s insisting. The disciple first boils the nose, then stomps on it, finally removing the beads of fat the treatment extracts from the nose. To Naigu’s satisfaction, the nose, once dangling past his chin, is now the size of a typical hooked nose.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Malluch {{has bought}} the old Hur house and renovated it. He invites Simonides and Balthasar, with their daughters, {{to live in}} the house with him. Judah Ben-Hur seldom visits, but the day before Jesus plans to enter Jerusalem and {{proclaim}} himself, Judah returns. He tells all who are in the house of what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> while following Jesus. Amrah realizes that Judah's mother and sister could be healed, and brings them from a cave where they are living. The next day, the three await Jesus by the side of a road and seek his healing. Amidst the celebration of his Triumphal Entry, Jesus heals the women. When they are cured, they reunite with Judah.|$|E

25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.|$|E
25|$|Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser): A young, ambitious account {{executive}} {{from an old}} New York family with connections and a privileged background. Often displaying recurring lapses in experience and judgement, Campbell's ruthless {{climb to the top}} causes him to attempt to blackmail Don Draper with the Dick Whitman information <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned,</b> but it does not work. He and Don are antagonistic some of the time, but later develop a grudging respect for each other, culminating in Don's approaching Pete over Ken Cosgrove when forming a new agency. Campbell and his wife, Trudy, were unable to conceive a child early in their marriage, and he only learned of his child with Olson at the Season 2 finale. He and Trudy do conceive a daughter, Tammy, late in Season 4. At the end of Season 3, dissatisfied with his treatment at Sterling Cooper regarding a promotion, he secretly plans to leave the firm. Unaware of this, Don Draper approaches Campbell with an offer to join his new firm as long as Pete brings accounts worth $8 million of cash flow. Campbell decides to join Draper, with the condition that he be made a partner, though his surname does not appear in the new firm's name (Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce). Campbell {{is one of the few}} characters in the show who does not smoke cigarettes, though he is seen smoking marijuana on one occasion. He looks up to Don in many ways. Campbell is often shown cheating on his wife, and is not above manipulating and blackmailing women to get them to sleep with him. While Pete and Trudy separate in Season 6 after another one of his affairs, the two reconcile at the end of the series as Pete takes a lucrative offer with Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.|$|E

25|$|When {{asked by}} Benicio del Toro what the most {{important}} thing <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> from Kenji Mizoguchi was, Shindo replied that {{the most important}} thing <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> from Mizoguchi was never to give up. According to Shindo, although Mizoguchi made more than eighty films, most of them were boring, with only about five or six good films, but without the failures there would never have been successes like Ugetsu Monogatari.|$|R

Munna {{receives}} another setback when he is tricked by Lucky into revealing his conversations with Gandhi before a public audience. At this conference, Munna finds that only after <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> something about [...] "Bapu"'s life can the Gandhi image talk about it, which serves as proof for a psychiatrist in the audience that Munna is delusional.|$|E
500|$|Later that night, Holo-Pearl {{continues}} to ask Steven {{to be challenged}} in combat, though he repeatedly refuses. Eventually, Steven becomes fed up and fights back against Holo-Pearl, accidentally activating her [...] "advanced" [...] mode.

500|$|Werbin {{notes that}} while {{discounting}} products by 40percent set his business {{apart from the}} local competition in the 1970s, outlets such as Guitar Center now also offer discounts. [...] In response to questions about his strategy for competing with larger retailers such as Guitar Center and American Musical Supply, which also operate mail order and Internet businesses, Werbin states that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> to operate on small margins to stay competitive: [...] "The mom-and-pop businesses that have survived have learned to operate on narrow margins." ...|$|E

60|$|But Nebuchadnezzar {{required}} another lesson. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> {{that the}} God of the Jews was wiser {{than all the}} planets and heavenly lords and gods whom the Babylonian magicians consulted; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not <b>learned</b> that that same God of the Jews was the Creator and Lord of heaven and earth. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that the God of heaven favoured him, and had helped him toward his power and glory; but he thought that {{for that very reason}} the power and glory were his own--that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a right over the souls and consciences of his subjects, and might make them worship what he liked, and how he liked.|$|R
