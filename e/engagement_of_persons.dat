40|$|The {{interest}} in robot-assisted therapies (RAT) for dementia care has grown steadily in recent years. However, RAT using humanoid robots {{is still a}} novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, {{little is known about}} how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|Although robots are {{becoming}} an ever-growing presence in society, {{we do not}} hold the same expectations for robots as we do for humans, nor do we treat them the same. As such, the ability to recognize cues to human animacy is fundamental for guiding social interactions. We review literature that demonstrates cortical networks associated with person perception, action observation and mentalizing are sensitive to human animacy information. In addition, we show that most prior research has explored stimulus properties of artificial agents (humanness of appearance or motion), with less investigation into knowledge cues (whether an agent {{is believed to have}} human or artificial origins). Therefore, currently {{little is known about the}} relationship between stimulus and knowledge cues to human animacy in terms of cognitive and brain mechanisms. Using fMRI, an elaborate belief manipulation, and human and robot avatars, we found that knowledge cues to human animacy modulate <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> perception and mentalizing networks, while stimulus cues to human animacy had less impact on social brain networks. These findings demonstrate that self-other similarities are not only grounded in physical features but are also shaped by prior knowledge. More broadly, as artificial agents fulfil increasingly social roles, a challenge for roboticists will be to manage the impact of pre-conceived beliefs while optimizing human-like design...|$|R

50|$|Horticultural therapy (also {{known as}} social and {{therapeutic}} horticulture or STH) {{is defined by}} the American Horticultural Therapy Association (AHTA) as the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> a <b>person</b> in gardening and plant-based activities, facilitated by a trained therapist, to achieve specific therapeutic treatment goals. The visual aesthetics of plants are known to elicit feelings of inner peace, which generates positive emotions toward a meaningful appreciation of life. Direct contact with plants guides the individual's focus away from stress enhancing their overall quality of life. The AHTA believes that horticultural therapy is an active process which occurs {{in the context of an}} established treatment plan. Horticultural therapists are specially educated and trained members of rehabilitation teams (with doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, occupational therapists and other) who involve the client in all phases of gardening, from propagation to selling products, as a means of bringing about improvement in their life.|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} study featuring in {{this paper}} is contextualised within the statistics provided by a national survey on older volunteerism. Older volunteers are nowadays viewed as a valuable resource, a reliable and experienced labour pool. In Malta, many persons aged 60 and above volunteer many hours each month in local environmental organisations in their goal to preserve the earth for future generations even though they will not personally see the benefits. Through the data emanating from a qualitative survey this paper highlights the possible positive returns accruing from green volunteering in later life which are of a physical, cognitive, and social nature. It thus argues {{that there is a}} potential for moreolder volunteers in green non-governmental organisations. It is on this basis that a number of policy options and action strategies to improve the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> older <b>persons</b> in green volunteering are recommended. These include expanding the participation by older persons who are ageing actively, presenting green volunteering as a course module in pre-retirement educational programmes, advertising green volunteering as a means of self-actualisation rather than as a form of unpaid work, and designing green volunteer roles that do not necessitate high levels of education...|$|R
40|$|Background. Homeless {{patients}} have complex health needs. They also often describe difficulty accessing and maintaining access to clinical services. Although engagement {{with health care}} has been explored from the patient perspective, {{little is known about}} how health care professionals conceptualize, assess and promote engagement with health care among homeless persons. Aim. To examine how health professionals working in services for homeless persons view their patients’ engagement with health care and explore how these views influence their practice. Methods. Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with health professionals who had experience working with homeless patients. Purposive sampling aimed to cover a range of location, practice type and duration of professional experience. Thematic analysis was undertaken on interview transcripts. Results. Thirteen interviews were conducted. Four themes were explored relating to <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> homeless <b>persons</b> with health care: (i) systematic barriers to engagement; (ii) difficulties engaging with professionals; (iii) system approaches to facilitate engagement and (iv) relationship approaches to facilitate engagement. In addition, a fifth theme emerged relating to the interaction between practices and networks <b>of</b> homeless <b>persons</b> in which practices were perceived as a key resource for a citizenship of the homeless. Conclusion. Primary care practices providing services for homeless people aim to promote engagement with health care by maximizing flexibility and fostering relationships between patients and the clinical team. In doing so they produce a paradox, whereby they function as a key hub within a citizenship <b>of</b> homeless <b>persons</b> while simultaneously aiming to help people move out of homelessness into a more settled state...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary • Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that creativity might be linked with older persons’ wellbeing, there are few published studies that systematically explore the experiences of people who have recently retired. The few available studies stress the value <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> older <b>persons</b> within the first 5 years after retirement (Withnall and Thompson 2003) and their preference for active participation in creative projects dealing with issues that affect their lives (Bennets et al 2005). Some positive outcomes from engaging with the arts include: expression of feelings and thoughts, sensory stimulation and improvement of self-esteem (McMurray 1989). • This collaborative study aimed to explore the experiences <b>of</b> older <b>persons</b> who had recently retired in relation to engagement in the creative arts and identifying any links between participation in the arts and wellbeing. In order to address this aim an action research methodology was adopted that involved a circular flexible design. A research team based at Queen Margaret University (QMU) and two co-researchers, older persons based in the community, led the study. Qualitative information was generated from 15 co-participants (older persons recently retired based in East Lothian and the wider community) through interviews, participant observations and discussions/reflections. Co-participants were also invited to participate in and reflect upon creative arts workshops that were particularly designed for this project. Collected information was analysed using thematic analysis. • Key findings from this study were that the feeling of belonging to a community was important. Most co-participants liked a wide choice of arts activities and were often introduced to new ideas by their friends. They sought sustained, in-depth art experiences where they felt challenged and stimulated, rather than short, superficial courses; some like to strive towards a finished product and were critical about their own achievements, while for others, taking part was more important. The stimulation of new forms of creativity was perceived to be beneficial to mental and physical wellbeing, but the activities had to be fun as well...|$|R

40|$|The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as “one of the defining moments for sustainable development,” (United Nations, 2012). Since that time, {{the focus of the}} sustainability movement has been to promote economic development and facilitate social engagement while protecting the environment (Stoddart, et al., 2011). While the more easily measurable economic and environmental constructs of sustainability are widely researched and developed, limited progress has been made toward developing, quantifying, or qualifying social sustainability (Bacon, Cochrane, 2 ̆ 6 Woodcraft, 2012). The concept of social sustainability does, however, offer a unique opportunity to the fields of occupational science and occupational therapy, as social sustainability’s definition closely relates to several of the basic tenets of occupational engagement: “Social sustainability is about people’s quality of life, now and in the future. It describes {{the extent to which a}} neighborhood supports individual and collective well-being…It is enhanced by development which provides the right infrastructure to support a strong social and cultural life, opportunities for people to get involved, and scope for the place and the community to evolve. ” (Bacon, et al., 2012) While considerations related to social sustainability are vital to community <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> all <b>persons,</b> a literature review by Wolbring and Rybchinski (2013) noted a marked lack of research into the experiences <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities in relation to social sustainability.

We aimed to characterize the changes in <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> HIV-positive <b>persons</b> in care in Russia during three years (2011 – 2013). Methods: We defined seven steps in the cascade of care framework: HIV infected (estimation data), HIV diagnosed, linked to HIV care, retained in HIV care, need ART, on ART and viral suppressed (VL < 1000 copies/mL during 12 month ART). Information was extracted from the Federal AIDS Centre database and from the national monitoring forms of Rospotrebnadzor from the beginning of 2011 to 31 December 2013. Results: Nearly 668, 032 HIV-diagnosed Russian residents were alive by the end of 2013, which consisted 49 % of the estimated 1, 363, 330 people living with HIV. Among the alive HIV-diagnosed patients, 516, 403 (77 %) were linked to care and 481, 783 (72 %) were retained. Of 163, 822 (25 % of HIV diagnosed) patients who were eligible for ART, 156, 858 (96 %) were on treatment while 127, 054 (81 %) had viral suppression. However, only 19 % of HIV-diagnosed patients achieved viral suppression which is necessary to prevent viral transmission. We noted substantial improvements over time in the proportion of individuals on ART. The proportion of patients who received ART increased from 24 % in 2011 to 34 % in 2013. The most significant leakages of patients during three years were on steps: “HIV infected → HIV diagnosed” (loss − 55 % in 2011, − 53 % in 2012, and − 51 % in 2013), “HIV diagnosed → Linked to care” (− 23 % yearly) and “Retained in care → Need ART” (− 76 %, − 70 %, and − 66 %, respectively). Conclusion: The stages of HIV diagnosis and estimation of ART eligibility were the most vulnerable to leakage. Encouraging HIV testing and earlier ART initiation are needed to maximize the effects of TasP interventions and to contain the spread of HIV in Russia...|$|R
40|$|For me, {{the ability}} to {{dialogue}} {{is one of the}} oldest and most cherished of human activities. The <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> one <b>person</b> with another in the mutuality of dialogue can be an enor-mously powerful force. Through a recent experience at the In-stitute of Human Becoming in Pittsburgh, I have come to realize that dialogue is at the heart of the process of teach-ing-learning. I am a doctoral student in nursing and am also engaged in a full-time nursing practice. Both of these roles demand ongoing learning. I recently found myself looking for the connections between the new knowledge I was learn-ing in my student role, engaged with faculty and peers and reading textbooks, and that which was familiar to me in my role as an experienced nurse. The new knowledge I was dis-covering existed only as words in text and not as living knowl-edge with personal meaning in my life. I began to realize that for me to effectively integrate my doctoral learning with my familiar practice roles, I needed scholarly conversation grounded in the human exchange of ideas. What I was miss-ing was a dialogue that connected me as a practicing nurse to the nursing theory I was learning in my student role. For me to have a living connection between nursing theory and nursing practice, I realized that I needed to be situated within a space and time for supportive learning while being immersed in studying a specific nursing theory. Through my lived experience of attending the Institute of Human Becom-ing in the summer of 1999, I was able to find an experience matched to my need for dialogue. This experience I have enti-tled “situated immersion. ” Situated immersion connected me to a specific nursing theory, the theory of human becoming, which has transformed my nursing practice. Situated Immersion Situated immersion is the intentional cocreating of a space and a time where dialogue can be specifically focused and nurtured. Based on the concept of situated freedom (Parse, 1998), situated immersion refers to an individual’s choice to be truly present in a given situation through preparation, at-tention, focus, and participation in exploring a phenomeno...|$|R
40|$|Emotion {{is key to}} the {{effectiveness}} of media, whether it be in influencing memory, likability or persuasion. Stories and narratives, even if fictional, have the ability to induce a genuine emotional response. However, the understanding of the role of emotions in media and advertising effectiveness has been limited due to the difficulty in measuring emotions in real-life contexts. Video advertising is a ubiquitous form of a short story, usually 30 - 60 seconds in length, designed to influence, persuade, entertain and engage, in which media with emotional content is frequently used. The lack of understanding of the effects of emotion in advertising results in large amounts of wasted time, money and other resources; in this thesis I present several studies measuring responses to advertising. Facial expressions, heart rate, respiration rate and heart rate variability can inform us about the emotional valence, arousal and <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> a <b>person.</b> In this thesis I demonstrate how automatically-detected naturalistic and spontaneous facial responses and physiological responses can be used to predict {{the effectiveness}} of stories. I present a framework for automatically measuring facial and physiological responses in addition to self-report and behavioral measures to content (e. g. video advertisements) over the Internet {{in order to understand the}} role of emotions in story effectiveness. Specifically, I will present analysis of the first large scale data of facial, physiological, behavioral and self report responses to video content collected "in-the-wild" using the cloud. I have developed models for evaluating the effectiveness of media content (e. g. likability, persuasion and short-term sales impact) based on the automatically extracted features.

40|$|Social {{interactions}} {{are important in}} everyone’s life since they may positively influence various developmental {{and quality of life}} outcomes. Up till now research about interactions <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) mainly focussed on interactions with direct support workers or parents. However, peers may also be important interaction partners in their social network. It can be assumed that the complex disabilities <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with PIMD and various environmental factors substantially affect the amount and nature of peer directed behaviours. The aims of this doctoral dissertation were (1) to give a state of the art of the research on peer interactions in persons with PIMD, (2) to describe the frequency and nature of peer directed behaviours <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with PIMD and to investigate influencing environmental factors, and (3) to develop and evaluate an intervention to promote social scaffolding behaviours of direct support workers and peer directed behaviours <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with PIMD. First, the research on peer interactions in persons with PIMD was systematically reviewed (manuscript 1). The concepts peers and social interactions were operationalised in different ways. The literature review delivered insight in the different categories of peers, the effects of peer interactions on <b>engagement</b> and well-being <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with PIMD, the effects of training and technological support systems on peer interactions, and the influence of the adult on peer interactions. Secondly, the frequency and nature of peer directed behaviours <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with PIMD and influencing environmental factors were investigated. In the first study group activities for children with PIMD organised by a direct support worker were observed (manuscript 2). Children with PIMD only rarely presented peer directed behaviours, mostly singular peer directed behaviours were observed. Direct support workers did not often present social scaffolding behaviours and the positioning of the children with PIMD was not facilitative for peer interactions. In the second study dyads of children with PIMD in presence and in absence of a direct support worker were observed (manuscript 3). More peer directed behaviours were observed in absence of a direct support worker. The direct support workers did not often use social scaffolding strategies. The relation with the peer directed behaviours of the children with PIMD was not clear. In the third study interactions of a child with PIMD with a peer with PIMD or with a sibling were compared (manuscript 4). Interactions with the sibling seemed to be the most motivating for persons with PIMD. The siblings presented various attention directing behaviours, but mostly used nonverbal behaviours. Combining verbal and nonverbal attention directing behaviours was most effective in eliciting peer directed behaviours in the children with PIMD. Thirdly, based on the gathered knowledge an intervention to promote social scaffolding behaviours of direct support workers and peer directed behaviours <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with PIMD was developed and evaluated (manuscript 5). The direct support workers participated in a training and feedback session and a peer interaction supportive activity was designed.

Trickle-Down Engagement: Maximizing Teacher and Student Engagement in First-Year Courses. 36 th Annual Conference on the First-Year Experience, Atlanta, GA. While much {{research}} {{has examined the}} <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> college students in the classroom, relatively little research has examined the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> their teachers. This session explores the possibility that enhancing the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> college teachers will “trickle down” to enhance the <b>engagement</b> (and learning) <b>of</b> their students. Presenters will explore {{the results of their}} research program investigating college teachers’ subjective experiences in teaching, the correlates of these experiences, and the outcomes these experiences have on students’ engagement and learning. The data supports the “trickle-down engagement” model, and suggests practical recommendations to improve the <b>engagement</b> <b>of</b> both college faculty and students in their shared courses...|$|R
