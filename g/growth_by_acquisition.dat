Despite an extensive „regulatory capture‟ literature little attention has been given to the crucial interactions between merging firms and competition authorities. This paper charts the merger history of Scottish & Newcastle and its landmark acquisition of Courage that created the UK‟s largest brewer. The Scottish & Newcastle story addresses directly the question of capture in the merger process; gaming the „public interest provision‟.

40|$|Today, {{companies}} need to constantly expand their business {{to stay ahead}} of the severe competition. As competition grows more intense, it makes sense to join forces or simply acquire the rival to provide the most diverse service and to reach even the last customer. But is it really only about the need for efficiency to merge and acquire competitors? Are managers and investors right about their hope, that every new acquisition or merger offers more control over the market? Or are they themselves pushed into these promising expec- tations? This research focuses on how social behavior influences value creation in mergers and acquisitions. Throughout history, waves have been observed that reflect the excessive hype for perennial need of <b>growth.</b> <b>Growth</b> <b>by</b> <b>acquisitions</b> and mergers is seen as key element to create value by investors and managers. However, reality looks different. This research focuses on a two step approach by first describing underlying social catalysts that amplify the trend towards value creation in mergers and acquisitions. Secondly, to verify the inves- tigation of social behavior, the results are matched to a financial approach to detect wheth- er the transaction price justifies the current value and possible synergies or whether value is destroyed. A case study was conducted of Boss Media AB, a software company situated in the online gaming industry, which experienced several mergers and acquisitions since their founda- tions and was eventually acquired itself. The company provided an interview and further information on their involvement with mergers and acquisitions. The research showed that mergers and acquisitions continue to increase in number and value, leading to the amplitude of each wave being higher than the previous one. This also means that more value is destroyed. It is illustrated that managers being determined to have bet on the right horse, are often more influenced by social behavior and trends than they think they are. Blinded by the overestimation of their own abilities, and prosperous short- term profits, managers overvalue their investment choices. Hence, the research implies that managers destroy shareholder value even though they initially intended to create it...|$|R

40|$|In the mid- 1990 s several {{building}} {{societies in}} the UK ceased to be mutual organisations and became public limited companies (plcs). This paper seeks to explain this change, which has ended the building societies' historic dominance of the mortgage market. The thesis that mutuality had become redundant as an ownership form is rejected. Structural changes in the industry have presented mortgage lenders with strategic choices, rather than dictated a single viable course. Structural change necessitated demutualisation only in the limited cases where a larger plc took over a small mutual. Case studies {{of each of the}} building societies that have converted indicated four other principal reasons for demutualisation: (1) an attempt to maintain full organisational independence; (2) an attempt to maintain operational independence; (3) a <b>growth</b> <b>by</b> <b>acquisition</b> strategy; and (4) a members' revolt. Along with the continued commitment to mutuality of some societies, these represent a variety of responses to structural change...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of uniformly sized blastospores {{by means of}} a linear density gradient and its use to induce synchronous growth in Candida albicans are described. Synchronous development in broth and serum and the absence of multiplication during the first 8 hours after blastospores are inoculated into serum are reported. Consideration is given to exponential multiplication by blastospore production in broth, the linear development of hyphae in serum, and hyphal <b>growth</b> <b>by</b> the <b>acquisition</b> of increments in an arithmetical progression. When small synchronously growing blastospores were inoculated into serum, all developed germ tubes, and following a lag phase in the rate of hyphal elongation, a hyphal growth rate of 39. 8 It per hour was observed. It is concluded that in human serum or plasma, although the growth of C. albicans i not inhibited, a transient cessation of multiplication occurs and possible reasons for this are discussed. In serum-free liquid medium Candida albicans multiples asexually by blastospore production, but in serum or plasma it grows predominantly in the hyphal form. This latter phenomenon is the basis of the filamentation test of Taschdjian, Burchall & Kozinn (1960) much used in the identification of yeasts from clinical specimens. The bactericidal and bacteristatic effects of human serum are well known. Reports that serum inhibits the multiplication ofC. albicans have been publishe...|$|R

30|$|The {{original}} Cooper medium (Cooper et al. 1981; Table  1 : medium A) presents glucose as carbon {{source and}} NH 4 NO 3 as nitrogen source. The buffer system {{is composed of}} KH 2 PO 4 and Na 2 HPO 4. Aside from that, the addition of MgSO 4 serves as source for sulfur and magnesium. Additionally, the trace elements Fe, Ca and Mn are added together with the chelating agent EDTA. Early experiments contributing to previous studies (Willenbacher et al. 2014) were conducted with a slightly {{modified version of the}} Cooper medium (Table  1 : medium B). The nitrogen source 50  mM NH 4 NO 3 was exchanged against 1  M NH 4 Cl mainly because Bacillus prefers NH 4 over NO 3 as nitrogen source. Furthermore, the employment of NH 4 Cl solely required the analysis of one nitrogen compound. Additionally, the original 70  mM buffer system was replaced by a 10  mM buffer system when B. subtilis was cultivated in a benchtop bioreactor allowing pH control. In this way, it was possible to monitor the bacterial <b>growth</b> <b>by</b> the online <b>acquisition</b> of NaOH addition.

40|$|Arbuscular mycorrhizas play a {{key role}} in plant <b>growth</b> <b>by</b> {{supporting}} the <b>acquisition</b> of mineral nutrients, especially phosphorus. Around 80 % of vascular plants exhibit this association. The major aim of research work was to isolate plant genes that are related to mycorrhizal association by using a mutant screening approach. Several plant genes involved in the arbuscular mycorrhizal association have been identified in the past decade. However these genes are also involved in the association of another type of symbiosis that is nodulation. In order to identify genes that are specifically involved in mycorrhiza formation, independent of nodulation, a transposon mutagenized population of Medicago truncatula was screened for reduced mycorrhizal colonization in the presence of normal nodulation. Two mutants showing reduced colonization were identified. In the presence of colonised host plants in the same growth compartment the number of intraradical hyphae and vesicles was normal, but arbuscules did not fully develop. This suggests that the block in colonization is not absolute. The genes affected in both mutant lines have been isolated. One mutant is affected in a GRAS transcription factor that is likely to act in the mycorrhiza-specific transduction of fungal signals. The other is affected in a mycorrhiza induced H+-ATPase that is likely to be involved in generating an electrochemical gradient at the periarbuscular membrane to facilitate nutrient uptake at the fungus/plant interphace.
