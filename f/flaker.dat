50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{requirement}} of end product, various processing techniques are used. The commercial production of guar gum normally uses roasting, differential attrition, sieving, and polishing. Food-grade guar gum is manufactured in stages. Guar split selection is important in this process. The split is screened to clean it and then soaked to prehydrate it in a double-cone mixer. The prehydrating stage is very important because it determines the rate of hydration of the final product. The soaked splits, which have reasonably high moisture content, are passed through a <b>flaker.</b> The flaked guar split is ground and then dried. The powder is screened through rotary screens to deliver the required particle size. Oversize particles are either recycled to main ultra fine or reground in a separate regrind plant, according to the viscosity requirement.|$|E

In 1973 when the Oak Ridge Boys were {{beginning}} to make their transition from gospel to country, The Singing Americans were signed by the prestigious Lou Wills Hildreth Agency in Nashville. In an article announcing the signing, The Singing News predicted that based on their sound and popularity, that The Singing Americans would take the Oak Ridge Boys spot as the number one quartet in gospel music. Unfortunately, their owner, Homer Wadford had a different sound in mind, and {{wanted to see the}} group move in a different direction stylistically. In 1980, the group was sold to Charles Burke, who later went on to own the Kingsmen Quartet name for a few years, and obtained all new personnel with Mark <b>Flaker</b> singing tenor, Charles Surratt singing baritone, Ed Crawford singing Lead, and Charles Burke's son, Dwayne, singing bass. Mark <b>Flaker</b> left later that year and was replaced by Danny Funderburk. Ed Crwaford left and was replaced by Michael English, who would leave for a couple years and be replaced by Ivan Parker, and then Clayton Inman. Also, in 1982, Surrat would leave and be replaced by Southern Gospel legend, Ed Hill. When Michael English left {{for the second time in}} 1985, he was replaced again by Clayton Inman, who would replace Hill in 1987 in the baritone spot, leaving the lead open for Scott Whitener. The 1990s started a decline in the popularity of the Singing Americans, but it did not mean they still weren't capable of producing popular singers. David Sutton and Taylor Barnes passed through the group during this time. Finally, in 1993, the Singing Americans produced their final album, [...] "Live from Chicago", before retiring in 1994. In August 1996, promoter/historian Charles Waller reunited English with Ed Hill, Rick Strickland, Dwayne Burke and Milton Smith as the Singing Americans, before an audience of over 4,000 gospel music fans at the Grand Ole Gospel Reunion. and in 2010 at the National Quartet Convention in Louisville, KY at a showcase commemorating the 100th anniversary of Southern Gospel music.|$|E
5000|$|In archaeology, a lithic flake is a [...] "portion of rock {{removed from}} an {{objective}} piece by percussion or pressure," [...] {{and may also}} {{be referred to as}} a chip or spall, or collectively as debitage. The objective piece, or the rock being reduced by the removal of flakes, is known as a core. Once the proper tool stone has been selected, a percussor or pressure <b>flaker</b> (e.g., an antler tine) is used to direct a sharp blow, or apply sufficient force, respectively, {{to the surface of the}} stone, often on the edge of the piece. The energy of this blow propagates through the material, often (but not always) producing a Hertzian cone of force which causes the rock to fracture in a controllable fashion. Since cores are often struck on an edge with a suitable angle (x<90°) for flake propagation, the result is that only a portion of the Hertzian cone is created. The process continues as the flintknapper detaches the desired number of flakes from the core, which is marked with the negative scars of these removals. The surface area of the core which received the blows necessary for detaching the flakes is referred to as the striking platform.|$|E

40|$|From 1989 to 1994, {{more than}} 200 m 2 were {{excavated}} at the Saqqaq site of Nipisat, situated {{on a small}} island 15 km south of Sisimiut. The excellent preservation conditions for organic material, {{and the fact that}} some of the stone artefacts were not previously known from the Saqqaq Culture, were the main reasons for the excavation. More than 70, 000 bone fragments, 20, 000 flakes and 1, 000 artefacts were recovered. A total of 33 dates, making this site one of the best dated in the entire Arctic, reveal that Nipisat was occupied continuously for nearly 1, 500 years. Although protruding bedrock disturbed the stratigraphy and several lenses of crushed shells interrupted the layers, three different chronological phases could be identified. Phase 1 is dated by eight 14 C dates ranging from 2020 to 1740 BC (cal). Phase 2 partly overlaps, but is mainly younger than phase 1 and dated by five 14 C dates to 1860 - 1325 BC (cal). Phase 3 is dated by 16 14 C dates to 1310 - 810 BC (cal). One date was very young (520 BC (cal)) and problematic because of extreme oscillations of the 14 C curve. From phase 1 there is a mid-passage structure with a box-hearth. A ring of flagstones surrounds the structure. From phase 2 there is a well-defined box-hearth. There was no clear outline of a tent ring surrounding the hearth, which could be due to later disturbances in phase 3. No dwelling structures were recognised from phase 3. Instead several sherds of soapstone were recorded, indicating the use of blubber for light or cooking. From phase 1 and 2 the tool types are well known from other Saqqaq sites in Greenland and Arctic Canada e. g. small harpoon endblades, projectile points, knife blades, scrapers, burins etc. and needles, flint <b>flakers,</b> harpoon heads, wedges etc. But from phase 3 previously unknown types were recorded. A new tool kit for sea mammal hunting is seen in the very sturdy harpoon or lance head made of antler. In addition there are many different kinds of barbed leisters or spears.

5000|$|Bradford House II (Site 5JF51) is a prehistoric rockshelter, 24 km {{southwest}} of Denver. It is situated on land {{owned by the}} Ken-Caryl Ranch Master Association. It was excavated {{in the summer and}} fall of 1973 by the Denver Chapter of the Colorado Archaeological Society. The excavations found several cultural features and recovered thousands of chipped stone artifacts, dozens of ground stone artifacts, a few ceramic sherds, bone tools, and faunal remains. The site was used by prehistoric groups during the Middle and Late Archaic periods, as well as the Early Woodland, and Middle Woodland periods. This is a span of 4,500 years.Bradford House II is located in the Ken-Caryl Valley. The Front Range foothills to the west and the Lyons and Dakota hogbacks to the east frame the valley. An abundance of archaeological sites, attests to the valley's attraction for the earliest inhabitants of the area. They frequented the area for its abundant resources, including shelter under the many bedrock monoliths scattered across the valley, lithic materials for chipped stone tools, and edible plants and animals.West of the valley, the arkosic sandstones of the Pennsylvanian Fountain formation lie uncomformably upon uplifted Precambrian metamorphic rocks of the Front Range (Rathbun 1997:21) [...] Although mostly covered by recent to pre-Wisconsin alluvium, the Fountain formation forms southwest facing escarpments, or monoliths, with undercut shelters or caves (Rathbun 1997:21), many of which were inhabited by prehistoric peoples. The elevation of the site is approximately 1878 m (6160 ft.) above mean sea level. Elevations surrounding the site range from about 1828 m (6000 ft.) in the Dutch Creek water gap to 1992 m (6536 ft.) on the highest point of the Dakota hogback ridge.The valley has a sunny, mild, and semiarid climate that has neither the extreme cold of the higher elevations to the west nor the hot summer afternoons of the eastern plains (Tate 1997:15). A south-facing rock shelter like Bradford House II absorbs a great deal of solar radiation, further mitigating the winter cold. Precipitation is moderate, averaging 15 to 18 inches, and winter snows melt quickly (Tate 1997:17) with frequent down slope (chinook) winds.The valley consists of various grasses and forbs. The surrounding hogbacks and foothills support a pine-Douglas fir vegetation community. The recovery of floral materials from Bradford House II and other archaeological sites in the valley (Johnson 1997:Table Gl) indicates that local plants such as sunflower, wild plum, acorn, and chokecherry were gathered and used by prehistoric peoples. Many animals, including elk, mule deer, and occasional Big Horn sheep, as well as a variety of carnivores, rabbits, rodents, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish are found in the hogbacks and foothills. Unworked animal, mostly mammal, bone was found in abundance in the Archaic and Early Ceramic levels (Johnson and Lyons 1997a:49, Table 6). Mule deer dominates the assemblage, followed by elk, bison, and rabbit, with little change in dietary preferences from the earlier to later time periods.

40|$|Simultanism, {{an attempt}} to conjure up {{in a piece of}} writing the {{existence}} of spatially distant phenomena or to bring into some close connections events that are in reality distant in point of time is a relatively new literary strategy and is connected with the modern (Modernist) understanding of text, space and time. Since previous students of simultanism (Žmegač, <b>Flaker)</b> have dated the beginnings of simultanist poetry differently, this paper draws a distinction between simultanist procedures (such as enumeration, asyndetic sequencing, juxtapositions) and simultanism as a principle of structure and composition. It is shown that Matoš’s Mora (1907) abounds in simultanist procedures and yet retains logical and causal sequences in expounding its content, while with the same phenomenon, the avantgarde texts of Krleža, Šimić, Cesarec, Micić, Ujević constitute various types of spatial and temporal simultanism.

The disintegrative energy of this period and its preference for the destruction of the canon came to full expression in the narrative process of Miodrag Bulatovic. Romanticism as a supra-historical and anthropological category is generally based on the maximal postulates that involve the destruction of the existing world, as well as an aggressive attitude towards reality, which is built into the writer’s universe and reaches its climax in his last novel, entitled Gullo Gullo and his eschatological mythemes. The irrational and fantastic images in the narrative process have been equated with real events co-existing as a narrative element completely equal to reality, and what is fantastic, unnatural and unusual reveals itself as very ordinary and realistic, erasing the boundaries between reality and fiction, belonging to one and the same, a diabolical universe, which substantially regulates romantic codes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explore the}} {{technological}} role of bone and antler artifacts from two contact period southern Northwest coast archaeological sites, the Cathlapotle site (45 CL 1) and the Meier site (35 CO 5). Technological measures of sedentism {{are based on}} lithics, and predict residential sedentism promotes technological expediency in hunter-gatherers (Parry and Kelley 1987). Cathlapotle and Meier lithic assemblages consist of expedient and opportunistic assemblages and raw material stockpiles, {{with the exception of}} highly curated projectile points and endscrapers (Hamilton 1994). The expectation that residential sedentism promotes technological expediency in hunter-gatherers was tested on the Cathlapotle and Meier bone and antler artifact assemblages in two ways. First, curation and expediency were recorded for each artifact by measuring level of energy investment in manufacture or degree of working. Second, a spatial analysis was used to explore methods of artifact storage and disposal. Results revealed both Cathlapotle and Meier osseous assemblages are highly curated, except for expedient awls and <b>flakers.</b> Specifically, artifact classes related to subsistence procurement, modification including woodworking, and ornamentation were highly curated. Both sites contain stockpiles of unmodified bone and antler. The spatial analysis showed level of curation did not affect artifact disposal method. Despite this, some patterns were evident. At Cathlapotle, curated procurement and modification artifacts, expedient awls as well as worked fragments were concentrated outside the houses, specifically in Sheet Midden. Broken modification artifacts, ornaments, and detritus were randomly distributed. At the Meier site, curated procurement and modification artifacts, as well as expedient awls were randomly distributed. Broken modification artifacts, detritus and worked fragments were concentrated outside the houses. Ornaments were concentrated in the northern segment (elite area) of the house. There were also significantly more curated complete tools recovered from the cellar facility, while significantly fewer curated complete tools were recovered from the midden facility at Meier. In this thesis, the effects of contact on osseous assemblages were examined. It is an assumption of North American archaeologists that European-introduced metals replace and/or change the character of traditional technologies such as lithic and osseous technologies. Few quantitative studies comparing pre and postcontact artifact assemblages exist (Bamforth 1993, Cobb 2003). In some parts of northeast North America, European contact is followed by a proliferation of osseous tool working, and over time osseous artifacts drop out of the archaeological record (Snow 1995, 1996). Cathlapotle and Meier were occupied from AD 1400 to AD 1830, spanning European contact. People at Cathlapotle were in direct contact with Europeans and Euro-Americans since 1792 (Boyd 2011). Previously, it was assumed Cathlapotle was more involved in the fur trade than Meier, because Cathlapotle was mentioned several times in ethnohistoric accounts, while Meier was never mentioned. Also Cathlapotle contains far more historic trade items than Meier (Ames 2011). The assumption that European-introduced metals replace and/or change the character of traditional technologies was tested on the Cathlapotle and Meier assemblages by comparing artifact frequency, density, and assemblage diversity of pre and postcontact assemblages. Results show contact is reflected in the osseous assemblages at both Cathlapotle and Meier. Contact is evident, but is reflected in different ways. At Cathlapotle, artifact frequencies, densities, and assemblage diversity decrease postcontact. In contrast at Meier, artifact frequencies and densities increase postcontact, with some artifact classes tripling or quadrupling in frequency. The introduction of metal could have enabled people to work osseous materials faster and easier, decreasing manufacture time, cost, and overall energy investment. The gain in efficiency promoted the proliferation of bone working and an abundance of osseous tools at the Meier site. These results encourage a reevaluation of Meier 2 ̆ 7 s role in the fur trade. At Cathlapotle, metal objects may have replaced osseous tools resulting in the decline of bone and antler working and/or activity patterns shifted away from activities requiring osseous tools. The results of this thesis deviate from typical Northwest Coast bone and antler assemblages, challenge technological models of sedentism that are based on lithics, and contradict assumptions of Lower Columbians involvement in the fur trade...|$|R
40|$|Aspen (Populus gradidentata) and {{loblolly pine}} (Pinus taeda) flakes were {{prepared}} with tangential-grain and radial- grain faces on a laboratory disk <b>flaker.</b> These were gently dried in a steam-heated rotary drum dryer. Approximately 1 week after drying, surface wettability was {{measured on a}} large sample of flakes using an aqueous dye solution. Three replicate boards of each combination of flake species and face grain were then fabricated. Each of the three replicate boards was made with a different adhesive resin. The three adhesives were urea-formaldehyde, phenolic, and neat isocyanate. The procedure (wettability measurements and board fabrication) was repeated at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after flake preparation. Surface wettabilities were reduced as the flake surfaces aged. Tension strengths of boards perpendicular to their faces (internal bond strengths) were also reduced as flake surfaces aged, and reductions in internal bond strengths and surface wettabilities appear to be related. Bending proper- ties were, in general, not influenced by flake age. The ob- served reductions in internal bond strengths suggest that laboratory storage of flakes for much longer than 6 months {{is not a good}} practice. However, no conclusive statements can be drawn from this work concerning the influence of flake aging on board properties...|$|E
40|$|S>Studies of the {{separation}} process known as zone melting were enclosed in 5 to 10 mm glass tubes and pulled through a stationary heater, which generated a liquid zone. The separation increased as the zone travel rate decreased, as {{the size of the}} tube increased, and as the difference in liquid density between the belk solid and the freezing interface increased. It was also found that, for vertical tubes, {{the separation}} was much greater when the fluid of lower density Between the buld zone and the freezing interface) was on the bottom the When it was on the top. Insertion of an axial thbe or rod of metal or glass into the zone also increased the separation. A correlation was developed which enables estimation {{of the separation}} for various - sithations in zone melting, Equations and principles were developed which enable estimation of the thermal requirements for zone melting and a theoretical study of pure diffusional mass transfer in some melting was also made. A general expression for concentration profiles was derived for materials with a constant distribution coefficient and a method for the rapid estimation of these concentration profiles was developed, Numerical results for eutectic-forming systems were obtained, and summarized in an analytical approximation. Economic calculations are included for a separation in the multistaged semicontinuous zone refiner known as a zone-void refiner. Exploratory experiments were made on a cooled-drum apparatus (modified drum- <b>flaker),</b> using NaC 1 -water as a system. These indicated that this equipment might be useful for large scalp industrial separations, although further research and development are needed. (auth...|$|E
