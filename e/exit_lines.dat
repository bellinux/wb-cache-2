60|$|George {{had never}} been in love before. Not really in love. True, from the age of fifteen, he had been in varying degrees of {{intensity}} attracted sentimentally by the opposite sex. Indeed, at that period of life of which Mr. Booth Tarkington has written so searchingly--the age of seventeen--he had been in love with practically every female he met and with dozens whom he had only seen in the distance; but ripening years had mellowed his taste and robbed him of that fine romantic catholicity. During the last five years women had found him more or less cold. It was the nature of his profession that had largely brought about this cooling of the emotions. To a man who, like George, has worked {{year in and year out}} at the composition of musical comedies, woman comes to lose many of those attractive qualities which ensnare the ordinary male. To George, of late years, it had begun to seem that the salient feature of woman as a sex was her disposition to kick. For five years he had been wandering in a world of women, many of them beautiful, all of them superficially attractive, who had left no other impress on his memory except the vigour and frequency with which they had kicked. Some had kicked about their musical numbers, some about their love-scenes; some had grumbled about their <b>exit</b> <b>lines,</b> others about the lines of their second-act frocks. They had kicked in a myriad differing ways--wrathfully, sweetly, noisily, softly, smilingly, tearfully, pathetically and patronizingly; but they had all kicked; with the result that woman had now become to George not so much a flaming inspiration or a tender goddess as something to be dodged--tactfully, if possible; but, if not possible, by open flight. For years he had dreaded to be left alone with a woman, and had developed a habit of gliding swiftly away when he saw one bearing down on him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Darcy’s Law might not be applicable for modelling miscible, density-dependent flow in porous media. To investigate this, three sets of careful laboratory column experiments were performed on coarse and medium sands, consisting of upward displace-ment of water by sodium chloride solutions with concentrations ranging from 5 to 200 g/l. Data on salt concentrations and water pressures were collected in horizontal transects along the flow direction. Salt concentration data were also collected in the influent and <b>exit</b> <b>lines.</b> The experimental data were analysed using a simplified approach based on Darcy’s Law alone, applied with the assumption of a sharp interface. Darcy’s Law was used to estimate porous medium permeability by fitting predictions to experimental data. Consistent estimates of permeability were obtained for each set of experiments. The results indicate that Darcy’s Law adequately describes high concentration displacements through saturated coarse- and medium-grained porous media...|$|E
40|$|Since {{its first}} wave {{in the late}} nineteenth century, {{feminism}} has reached a legitimation crisis the emergence from which is critical for its survival as a political movement. Several subjective figurations have been proposed by feminists and theorists in order to enable a leap beyond the impasses that feminism faces today. In this paper, the subjective figuration of the Nomad is explored as presented by Rosi Braidotti and inspired by poststructuralist theory, in particular the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze. It is suggested that if feminism has been disserved by the second wave’s adoption of rigid masculinist structures, then the fluid ways of nomadic subjectivity provide valuable tools for advancing it. The argument is formulated around the Deleuzian concept of ‘lines of flight ’ suggesting four ways in which nomadic theory offers <b>exit</b> <b>lines</b> from significant impasses confronting contemporary feminism. It is suggested that these exist lines carry potential to move the feminist movement beyond its current stasis; beyond postmodernist cynicism; beyond linear, hierarchical and exclusionary phallogocentrism; and most significantly beyond an outdated reactive and dogmatic feminism...|$|E
40|$|The {{components}} of the AGR- 1 irradiation capsules were analyzed to determine the retained inventory of fission products {{in order to determine}} the extent of in-pile fission product release from the fuel compacts. This includes analysis of (i) the metal capsule components, (ii) the graphite fuel holders, (iii) the graphite spacers, and (iv) the gas <b>exit</b> <b>lines.</b> The fission products most prevalent in the components were Ag- 110 m, Cs 134, Cs 137, Eu- 154, and Sr 90, and the most common location was the metal capsule components and the graphite fuel holders. Gamma scanning of the graphite fuel holders was also performed to determine spatial distribution of Ag- 110 m and radiocesium. Silver was released from the fuel components in significant fractions. The total Ag- 110 m inventory found in the capsules ranged from 1. 2 × 10 2 (Capsule 3) to 3. 8 × 10 1 (Capsule 6). Ag- 110 m was not distributed evenly in the graphite fuel holders, but tended to concentrate at the axial ends of the graphite holders in Capsules 1 and 6 (located at the top and bottom of the test train) and near the axial center in Capsules 2, 3, and 5 (in the center of the test train). The Ag- 110 m further tended to be concentrated around fuel stacks 1 and 3, the two stacks facing the ATR reactor core and location of higher burnup, neutron fluence, and temperatures compared with Stack 2. Detailed correlation of silver release with fuel type and irradiation temperatures is problematic at the capsule level due to the large range of temperatures experienced by individual fuel compacts in each capsule. A comprehensive Ag 110 m mass balance for the capsules was performed using measured inventories of individual compacts and the inventory on the capsule components. For most capsules, the mass balance was within 11 % of the predicted inventory. The Ag- 110 m release from individual compacts often exhibited a very large range within a particular capsule...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{in vitro}} {{the effects of}} increments of external pressure on the pressure required to conduct fluid through ureters of various lengths at different flow rates, as the flow of a fluid through a collapsible tube is influenced by various factors (e. g. external pressure, the pressure gradient between the ends, the length and diameter of the tube, and the viscosity of fluid). Materials and methods Two in vitro systems were designed, composed of three parts, i. e. a perfusion line, an exit line and a container of two different widths in which short or long ureteric segments, obtained from cattle, could be placed; the ureter {{was connected to the}} perfusion and <b>exit</b> <b>lines.</b> Physiological saline was added to the container until the desired external pressure was applied to the ureter. The flow pressure (height of the perfusion line) was recorded when producing flows through ureters of varying length at 1. 5 and 6 mL/min, and determined under various external pressures. The intra-ureteric pressure during flow was also monitored by a pressure transducer. The four combinations of long and short ureters with high and low flow rates were compared using analysis of variance, with the Pearson correlation coefficient used to evaluate the relationships between the various pressures. Results There were close relationships between flow pressure and external pressure (r = 3 D 0. 727), intra-ureteric and external pressure (r = 3 D 0. 766), and the flow pressure and intra-ureteric pressure (r = 3 D 0. 940, all P < 0. 001). Increments in external pressure resulted in greater flow and intra-ureteric pressure (P < 0. 05). Increases in flow pressure were more pronounced than increases in intra-ureteric pressure at the same external pressure (P < 0. 05) at high flow rates. A longer ureter and higher flow rates caused greater intra-ureteric pressure (P < 0. 05). Conclusion External pressure increases the pressure required to conduct fluid through a ureter and the effect is more pronounced at high flow rates. The length of the ureter also affects the flow pressure at high flow rates. Therefore, flow through the ureter follows the Poiseuille equation only at high flow rates. Thus, increases in intra-abdominal pressure may cause greater intrapelvic pressure and induce ureteric obstruction, contributing to the pathogenesis of hydronephrosis...|$|E
40|$|The invention, {{a static}} phase {{separator}} (SPS), uses airflow and capillary wetting characteristics to passively separate a two-phase (liquid and air) flow. The device accommodates highly variable liquid wetting characteristics. The resultant design {{allows for a}} range of wetting properties from about 0 to over 90 advancing contact angle, with frequent complete separation of liquid from gas observed when using appropriately scaled test conditions. Additionally, the design accommodates a range of air-to-liquid flow-rate ratios from only liquid flow to over 200 : 1 air-to-liquid flow rate. The SPS uses a helix input section with an ice-cream-cone-shaped constant area cross section (see figure). The wedge portion of the cross section is on {{the outer edge of the}} helix, and collects the liquid via centripetal acceleration. The helix then passes into an increasing cross-sectional area vane region. The liquid in the helix wedge is directed into the top of capillary wedges in the liquid containment section. The transition from diffuser to containment section includes a 90 change in capillary pumping direction, while maintaining inertial direction. This serves to impinge the liquid into the two off-center symmetrical vanes by the airflow. Rather than the airflow serving to shear liquid away from the capillary vanes, the design allows for further penetration of the liquid into the vanes by the air shear. This is also assisted by locating the air exit ports downstream of the liquid drain port. Additionally, any droplets not contained in the capillary vanes are re-entrained downstream by a third opposing capillary vane, which directs liquid back toward the liquid drain port. Finally, the dual air exit ports serve to slow the airflow down, and to reduce the likelihood of shear. The ports are stove-piped into the cavity to form an unfriendly capillary surface for a wetting fluid to carryover. The liquid drain port is located at the start of the containment region, allowing for draining the bulk fluid in a continuous circuit. The functional operation of the SPS involves introducing liquid flow (from a human body, a syringe, or other source) to the two-phase inlet while an air fan pulls on the air <b>exit</b> <b>lines.</b> The fan is operated until the liquid is fully introduced. The system is drained by negative pressure on the liquid drain lines when the SPS containment system is full...|$|E
40|$|Although in {{one sense}} this {{is a study in}} {{regional}} or local history, its findings have much wider implications which are of national significance. Britain gave to the world the Industrial Revolution and, as a corollary, the railway. Evidence which throws new light on the evolution of railways is therefore of high importance to historians and archaeologists of industry. Such evidence, it is suggested, is presented in this thesis. It relates mainly to the evolution of that most essential component of any railway, its track, and to the industrial archaeology of what was the leading iron-producing region of its day. From the 1790 s into the 1840 s South Wales and, in particular, the Heads of the Valleys was much the largest producer of iron in Britain. To feed the works with raw materials there was a major system of railroads and tramroads which, except perhaps for the North-eastern coalfield, was by far the most extensive in Britain and therefore in the world. Even the tramroads of Shropshire, though tight-packed, were much smaller in extent. As it turned out, the North-east had the greatest influence on the Railway Age, with South Wales not remaining in the vanguard of progress for long. However, it was in South Wales that the first all-iron edge rail was used, and South Wales developed the tramroad to its highest form. Here too, among the precursors of the Railway Age, elements of the public railway were forged. There are three components to the South Wales network. First, the feeders which ran from the limestone quarries of the northem outcrop to the furnaces can be followed for about 100 km in total. Although a fair proportion of this distance is now buried by tarmacced roads, within the quarries themselves lie around 20 km of traceable routes. Second, a quite different set of lines led to the furnaces from the coal and iron ore mines, which lay closer than the quarries to the ironworks; but if underground track were included their mileage would be huge. Third, the <b>exit</b> <b>lines</b> from the ironworks to the ports, canals and nearby markets (as far away as Kington and Hereford) add a further 190 km. Another guide to the enormous mileage built comes from the 10, 500 tons of rails cast at Ebbw Vale between 1808 and 1816. If these were 3 ft plates of a fairly standard 45 lb apiece, they would total nearly half a million, or enough to complete about 220 km of tramroad. This from only one ironworks over a mere nine years. So rich an area can only be studied in detail bit by bit. This thesis is therefore restricted to the limestone feeders of the northern outcrop, which archaeologically are the most fruitful. Most of the <b>exit</b> <b>lines</b> have been obscured by later railways; the coal and iron ore feeders are either underground and inaccessible or, where on the surface, have often been tipped over by later workings or destroyed by land reclamation. The limestone quarry feeders therefore provide the best opportunity to record early railways in South Wales. Many of the quarries which supplied the works remain as they were abandoned nearly a century ago. These vast monuments cover an area in excess of 4. 5 square kilometres. The importance of the archaeology of the quarrying industry has been established by English Heritage with the publication of a Step I report as part of the Monuments Protection Programme. But the future of the South Wales quarries is not assured. Many could be re-developed through the Interim Development Orders granted in 1947, {{at a time when they}} were regarded as eyesores with no particular relevance to our past. Owners of largely unproductive areas of moorland are constantly looking for ways of increasing income. Quarrying for roadstone offers a lucrative return, and provides some jobs in largely rural communities which, theoretically, stimulate local economies. In the relevant counties output, mostly for roadstone, grew from 1, 343, 000 tons in 1895 to 15, 515, 000 in 1974. 3 It is this threat which in part prompted this study. Although a great deal of attention has been devoted to the history of railways in South Wales (as in the rest of Britain) after 1830, relatively little has been given to their evolution. While previous studies have established the outline - notably Macdermot, Marshall, Lee, Barrie, Clinker, Baxter, Rattenbury and Hughes - these were mainly related to identifying the subject or concentrated on existing lines and documentary sources. Limestone railways have been largely ignored (with the partial exception of Rattenbury and Hughes), and little industrial archaeological survey has hitherto been done. My work, then, breaks new ground. It is intended as a contribution not to business or economic history, but rather to industrial archaeology and the history of technology. As such it combines extensive fieldwork with a detailed study of the history of limestone feeders from documentary sources, some printed but mostly in the National Library of Wales, Gwent Record Office and similar repositories. The result throws a completely new light on the artefacts of early railways, and especially on their permanent way. This has allowed for the first time a provisional typology to be made, and improved our understanding of the influences at work...|$|E
