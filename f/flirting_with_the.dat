It was digitally released on June 14, 2011 via iTunes Store and the same day was also uploaded on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube. Shot in an animated technique, the video starts with an animated version of lead singer Levine singing on a microphone while hands are behind his back touching his body. As the video progresses, a nude animated woman is shown dancing around him and <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{other members of the}} band. Several animation effects such as angel wings and devil elements are shown behind Levine as he is singing, while the woman is also dancing for the other members. The video finishes with a close shot of Levine's face.|$|E

In her autobiography Barbara Windsor wrote about Hawtrey's alcoholism and his outrageous <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> footballer George Best. While filming Carry On Spying (1964), in which they both played secret agents, Windsor thought that Hawtrey had fainted from fright at a dramatic scene on a conveyor belt.

25|$|On August 11, 2010, Paul Menard {{was signed}} {{to drive a}} fourth RCR Chevrolet after he {{decided to leave the}} {{struggling}} Richard Petty Motorsports. The car was re-numbered to 27, and MENARDS Home Improvement, owned by Paul's father John Menard, came on to sponsor the car in a multi-year agreement. Former TRG Motorsports partner Tom Pumpelly was listed as the owner of the No. 27 and the No. 35th place owner's points were given to Menard to guarantee a spot in the first five races. The 27 opened the season with a 9th-place finish at the Daytona 500. Menard would go on to win the Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on July 31, leading four times for a total of 21 laps and using a fuel mileage gamble to take the victory. It was the first career win for Menard, and his father's first win at the track as an owner or sponsor in both NASCAR and IndyCar competition. The victory also made Paul eligible for the $3 million Sprint Summer Showdown as well as a wild card Chase berth. Menard spent most of the season <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> top 12 in points, but ultimately missed the Chase despite his victory. Menard and the 27 team would end up finishing 17th in points.|$|E
25|$|In {{his essay}} Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation {{published}} by the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives at Dharamsala, S.L. Kuzmin, quoting the memoirs of Soviet diplomat A. M. Ledovsky, claims that on January 22, 1950, during his negotiations with Joseph Stalin in Moscow, Mao Zedong asked him to provide an aviation regiment because he was preparing to advance towards Tibet. Stalin approved these preparations and provided military support with Soviet pilots and airfield personnel dressed in Chinese clothes, because this aid was illegal. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China (PRC) entered Tibet and the US government made contact with the Dalai Lama's brother Gyalo Thondup, who was living in India, to offer US help, which was rejected. In May 1951, a delegation representing the Dalai Lama, 15 {{years old at the}} time, and led by Ngapoi Ngawang Jigmei, traveled to Beijing to be presented with the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, which established a PRC sovereignty over Tibet: assuming responsibility for Tibet's external affairs while leaving the domestic governance to the Lhasa government and assuring religious freedoms. The treaty was signed by the Lhasa delegation and the 10th Panchen Lama, who had already switched his loyalty to the PRC after <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kuomintang and conspiring against the central Tibetan government, which still refused to recognize him as the true Panchen Llama. Later there would be much controversy over the validity of the agreement stemming from claims it was signed under threat of arms and disagreements about whether the delegates had the authority to sign.|$|E

500|$|At Los Alamos, Slotin's duties {{consisted}} of dangerous criticality testing, first with uranium in Otto Robert Frisch's experiments, and later with plutonium cores.

Scientists referred to this <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as [...] "tickling the dragon's tail", based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to [...] "tickling {{the tail of a}} sleeping dragon". On 16 July 1945, Slotin assembled the core for Trinity, the first detonated atomic device, and became known as the [...] "chief armorer of the United States" [...] for his expertise in assembling nuclear weapons.

500|$|The Paris {{delegation}}, led by Bertrand Delanoë, {{argued that}} Tony Blair and the London delegation {{had broken the}} IOC rules. On 11 July 2005, Delanoë stated: [...] "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not {{say that they were}} <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line". A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a [...] "bidding war". Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street. It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: [...] "I made it very clear that, in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out". Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party of the Council of Paris, stated: [...] "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".|$|E
500|$|The slide {{continued}} into the 1980–81 season, with nine defeats in the first ten games, and Venables quit Selhurst Park for QPR. The club were suffering financial problems as well, and were virtually relegated {{by the start of}} February when another, even bigger change occurred. Ron Noades, formerly chairman of Wimbledon, took financial control of the club, purchasing it from Raymond Bloye's consortium. After a couple of seasons <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> drop and numerous managerial changes, Noades appointed 29-year-old former Manchester United and England midfielder Steve Coppell as manager for the 1984–85 season. Coppell's playing career had been cut short by a knee injury, and, assisted by former Palace player Ian Evans, he worked on rebuilding the club, eventually signing the then unknown Ian Wright from non-league Greenwich Borough and Mark Bright from Leicester City, and the pair formed the [...] "Wrighty & Brighty" [...] strike partnership. Coppell stabilised the club in his first season, and after two seasons of narrowly missing out on the play-offs, followed up by narrowly missing out on automatic promotion by a single point. The club instead entered the 1989 Football League Championship play-offs, beating Swindon in the semi-finals to set up a two legged final against Blackburn Rovers. The first leg at Ewood Park saw the Lancashire club defeat the Eagles 3–1, but a 30,000 full house at Selhurst Park saw the Eagles triumph 3–0 in extra time in the second leg to end their eight-year exile from the top flight. Ian Wright, who scored 24 league goals, and 33 in all competitions in the promotion campaign, was voted player {{of the year by the}} club's supporters.|$|E
500|$|On May 21, 1946, {{physicist}} Louis Slotin {{and seven}} other Los Alamos personnel {{were in a}} Los Alamos laboratory conducting another experiment to verify the exact point at which a subcritical mass (core) of fissile material could be made critical by the positioning of neutron reflectors. Slotin, who was leaving Los Alamos, was showing the technique to Alvin C. Graves, who would {{use it in a}} final test before the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests scheduled a month later at Bikini Atoll. It required the operator to place two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around the core to be tested and manually lower the top reflector over the core via a thumb hole on the top. As the reflectors were manually moved closer and farther away from each other, scintillation counters measured the relative activity from the core. Allowing them to close completely could result in the instantaneous formation of a critical mass and a lethal power excursion. Under Slotin's unapproved protocol, the only thing preventing this was the blade of a standard straight screwdriver, manipulated by the scientist's other hand. Slotin, who was given to bravado, became the local expert, performing the test on almost a dozen occasions, often in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots, in front of a roomful of observers. Enrico Fermi reportedly told Slotin and others they would be [...] "dead within a year" [...] if they continued performing it. [...] Scientists referred to this <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as [...] "tickling the dragon's tail", based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to [...] "tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon".|$|E

500|$|Millwall's {{first game}} {{back in the}} Championship was a 3–0 away win at Bristol City. The game had been much hyped due to City's signing of then-England goalkeeper David James. Only days after the defeat, Steve Coppell {{resigned}} as City manager. The Lions celebrated the 125th anniversary of the club on 2 October 2010, which was the closest home game date to the first fixture Millwall ever played against Fillebrook on 3 October 1885. Millwall drew 1–1 with Burnley and wore a special one-off kit for the game, made by manufacturers Macron, which bore the names of every footballer who had played for the club. Kenny Jackett celebrated five years {{in charge of the}} club in November 2012, with a 4–1 victory away at Nottingham Forest. After a strong start to the 2012–13 season, including a 13-game unbeaten run and <b>flirting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> play-offs, Millwall finished poorly, with only five wins in the last 23 games, narrowly avoiding relegation {{on the last day of}} the season. Their poor league form coincided with reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup for the fifth time in their history. They played Wigan Athletic at Wembley Stadium on 14 April 2013, losing 2–0 to the eventual cup winners. Kenny Jackett resigned on 7 May 2013. He was Millwall's fourth-longest serving manager. After a month of searching, Millwall appointed St Johnstone boss Steve Lomas as their new manager on 6 June 2013. His appointment provoked mixed emotions among some supporters, due to him being a former captain of West Ham United, their biggest rival. Club record goalscorer Neil Harris returned to Millwall as a coach on 23 June 2013 after retiring as a player through injury. Millwall sacked Lomas on 26 December 2013, after winning only five of his first 22 games in charge. Harris and youth team coach Scott Fitzgerald took over as joint caretaker-managers. On 4 January 2014 Millwall lost 4–1 at Southend United in the FA Cup, a team 31 places below them in the football pyramid. Harris described the performance as a [...] "shambles." ...|$|E
