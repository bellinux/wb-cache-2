25|$|In August, {{the band}} headed {{off on the}} Operation Starlift Tour, an all-Australian concert series, which featured: The Masters Apprentices, Johnny Farnham, Ronnie Burns, Russell Morris, Johnny Young, Zoot, and The Valentines. Although the tour was {{apparently}} a financial disaster, it was a promotional success for the band. The Brisbane Festival Hall concert was a highpoint of the tour and they drew a record crowd there, breaking The Beatles' 1964 attendance record. Wheatley was dragged offstage by the audience and had <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> coat literally torn to shreds, {{with the result that}} one of the police on hand threatened to arrest him for indecent exposure if they did not finish playing immediately.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Love Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Alfredo Flores with Bieber as co-director. It was released on August 3, 2010. Bieber said the video serves as a [...] "tribute to his worldwide fans, thanking them for their support". The dominant scenes are made of up of live performances. Other scenes of the video feature behind-the-scenes footage such as; rehearsal sessions, fan meet and greets, making radio appearances, jokingly walking around with toilet paper sticking out of <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> scenes with friends and family. Bieber's mentor, Usher, also makes an appearance in the video. The video also incorporates Bieber {{standing in front of}} a [...] "simple [...] backdrop" [...] dancing and [...] "draw hearts in the air, presumably directed at his loving fanbase" [...] relative to the songs theme, [...] "Love Me".|$|E
500|$|The police detain Brandon {{on charges}} that arose prior to his relocation; they place him in the women's section of the Falls City prison. Lana bails Brandon out and asks why he {{was placed in a}} women's prison. Brandon {{attempts}} to lie to her, saying he was born a hermaphrodite and will soon receive a sex change; but Lana stops him, declaring her love for Brandon regardless of his gender. However, while Brandon is in prison, Candace finds a number of documents listing Brandon's birth name, Teena Brandon, and she and her friends react upon these news with shock and disgust. Tom and John violently confront Brandon, forcing him to remove <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> reveal his genitals. They try to make Lana look, but she shields her eyes and turns away. After this confrontation, Tom and John drag Brandon into John's car and drive to an isolated location, where they brutally beat and gang rape him. Afterwards, they take Brandon to Tom's house. Though injured, Brandon escapes through a bathroom window. Although his assailants threaten Brandon and warn him not to report the attack to the police, Lana persuades him to do so. This, however, is of no help whatsoever, as the police chief focuses not on the crime but on Brandon's 'sexual identity crisis.' ...|$|E

500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee on <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this is my life now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E
2500|$|Viewed {{separately}} from his criminal history, the crime Gary Ewing committed {{in this case}} is relatively benign. [...] In 2000 he stole three golf clubs worth $399 each from the pro shop of the El Segundo Golf Course in El Segundo, California. [...] He slipped them down the leg of <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> a shop employee called the police when he noticed Ewing limping out of the pro shop.|$|E

Covington also alleged that Cosby grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hands down her pants at his home. Cosby was questioned and insisted [...] "it was not true". The police referred her complaint to the D.A., but they declined to prosecute.|$|E

2500|$|On one {{occasion}} the anime gives Tuxedo Mask a stylized transformation sequence, with his tuxedo and accessories forming {{around him as}} he flings a rose. He does not shout any special phrase, although his voice-actor jokingly ad-libbed the line [...] "Tuxedo Power! Make up!" [...] He also acquires a transformation in the live-action series, using the same phrase, which {{is a part of}} an outrageous story he tells Usagi about how he became Tuxedo Mask. This transformation is initiated with a special band-aid, and the sequence consists of Mamoru pulling on <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> coat with dramatic flair.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shooting}} {{occurred in}} theater 14 during the 7:10p.m. screening of Trainwreck, {{held at the}} Grand 16 movie theater in Lafayette. Houser, 59, went to the theater alone, bought a ticket ten minutes late into the movie, and sat for several minutes in the theater's second-to-last row. Including Houser, there were 25 people in the theater and 300 people in the building. Houser was armed with a Hi-Point Model JCP [...]40-caliber handgun and equipped with two 10-round magazines. Shortly before 7:30p.m., he stood up, pulled out the handgun from <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> started shooting indiscriminately while walking down the steps. Houser fired at least 13 rounds and reloaded once. He killed two people and injured nine others.|$|E
2500|$|St. Eligius {{is saved}} (and any {{damage from the}} {{above-mentioned}} [...] "Wrecker's Ball" [...] repaired), but it falls under the new ownership of Ecumena Corporation, a national managed health care concern. (The use of [...] "Ecumena" [...] garnered some real-life controversy, as Humana thought {{the use of that}} name sounded too much like its own; the protest prompted NBC to begin airing post-episode disclaimers stating that Ecumena was indeed fictional.) [...] Ecumena's choice to head St. Eligius, Dr. John Gideon, mixed like oil and water with the St. Eligius staff, especially Dr. Westphall, who, in the final scene of this episode (and Ed Flanders's last moment as a St. Elsewhere series regular), delivers his resignation [...] "in terms you can understand"—by dropping <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> exposing his bare buttocks to Gideon ("You can kiss my ass, pal"). This scene, which would normally be considered controversial, was preserved by NBC's censors as they did not consider Westphall's display to be erotic in nature.|$|E

2500|$|Eugene—who {{eventually}} became completely naked, discarding even {{his shoes and}} his Bible at the crime scene—encountered 65-year-old Ronald Poppo at approximately 1:55pm. Poppo had been lying underneath the elevated Metromover people-mover viaduct when Eugene began to pummel him, strip him of <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> bite his face. The attack unfolded at {{the west end of}} the MacArthur Causeway, near the headquarters of The Miami Herald in the Omni neighborhood of Downtown Miami. It was at first believed that neither Eugene nor Poppo knew the other before their encounter, until a July 2012 publication revealed that Eugene had met Poppo while working for the homeless community of Miami. A passing cyclist, Larry Vega, came upon the scene and alerted authorities via 9-1-1. A few minutes later, Miami Police Department officer Jose Ramirez arrived and, after doing a [...] at the spectacle, warned Eugene to desist from attacking Poppo. Eugene ignored the officer's warnings and, instead, reportedly growled at him, then resumed biting his victim. The attack ended at 2:13pm with Officer Ramirez shooting Eugene once at first and then another four times when that proved ineffective. The ordeal was captured by a security camera on The Miami Herald building. Surveillance video shows that the attack continued for 18 minutes before help arrived.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shooting}} of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded {{after receiving a}} police dispatch call of a black male that [...] "keeps pulling a gun out of <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> pointing it at people". A caller reported that a male was pointing [...] "a pistol" [...] at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At {{the beginning of the}} call and again in the middle he says of the pistol [...] "it's probably fake". [...] Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated [...] "he is probably a juvenile". However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled [...] "show me your hands" [...] through the open patrol car window. [...] Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw the replica: [...] "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} and final {{appearance}} on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of [...] "Hound Dog", [...] "Love Me Tender", and [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", followed by a full version of [...] "Don't Be Cruel". For a second set later in the show he did [...] "Too Much" [...] and [...] "When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again". For his last set he sang [...] "Peace in the Valley". According to Sullivan's co-producer Marlo Lewis, the rumor had it that [...] "Elvis has been hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!" [...] It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although {{much has been made of}} the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of [...] "Hound Dog", all of the songs on this show were ballads. [...] "Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows", Greil Marcus says, Elvis [...] "stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out. That he did so in front of the Jordanaires, who this night appeared as the four squarest-looking men on the planet, made the performance even more potent." ...|$|E

And they crowded around and gazed upon the Worm with horror, and they gazed upon Sir Launcelot in wonder that Heaven should have sent so wonderful a Champion to save {{them out of their}} distresses. And ever Sir Launcelot stood there leaning upon <b>his</b> sword <b>panting</b> <b>and</b> with the blood flowing down from his shoulder and his thigh so that all that side of his body was ensanguined with shining red.|$|R
