[...] Her routine, the first time Bollywood appeared on the Miss America stage, was developed in conjunction with Nakul Dev Mahajan as a fusion of Bollywood and Indian classical dance.

500|$|Cleveland {{reached the}} {{championship}} game in the following three seasons but lost each time, once to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions. Gillom led the NFL in punting in 1951, with a 45.5-yard average. He again led the league the following season, averaging 45.7 yards per punt, and was selected for the Pro Bowl, football's all-star game. Gillom was second in the NFL in punting average in 1953. During his years with the Browns, Gillom's long, high punts and his habit of standing further back from center than was usual set a precedent followed by many of his successors at the position. His kicks had a long hang time, which allowed teammates to get further downfield to defend the punt return. [...] "We didn't <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> 40 yards, we went back 50, 60 yards because he just kicked it so damn far and so high", Otto Schnellbacher, who played against the Browns with the Yankees and Giants, later said. Gillom's positioning behind the center gave him more space to kick but also put more distance {{between him and the}} opposing linemen, reducing the likelihood of a block.|$|E
500|$|After {{the high}} ratings for [...] "A Study in Pink", the BBC was {{reportedly}} eager {{to produce more}} episodes. On 10 August 2010, {{it was confirmed that}} Sherlock had been renewed for a second series. At the 2011 convention, Gatiss confirmed which stories would be adapted, and that the writers of the first series would each write an episode for series two. Acknowledging that [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia", [...] "The Hound of the Baskervilles" [...] and [...] "The Final Problem" [...] are amongst the best-known Holmes stories, Gatiss explained, [...] "We knew after having a successful first run that the natural order would be to do three of the most famous [...]" [...] "There's {{the question of how to}} go out on a cliffhanger and then the thematic things of the three stories, where we were trying to get to and what Sherlock and John's relationship is a little further on. You can't <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to: 'You have no emotions.' 'I don't care.' You've got to move on somewhere and make sure the other characters have something of a journey too." [...] Paul McGuigan directed the first two episodes, and Doctor Who director Toby Haynes handled the last one. The second series of three 90-minute episodes was initially planned to air in late 2011, but was delayed until early January 2012.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} of The Album Network, Jared Leto {{explained that the}} song is [...] "less about reinventing yourself and more about finding out who you really are, your true self. That's a pretty important thing. That feeling of if you could <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> knowing what you know now." [...] Leto said: [...] "In a general sense, it is about a desire for renewal. But I'd rather let people take their own understanding and meaning from the song. I think {{that is one of}} the exciting things about music, the interpretation, from individual to individual and how it can change so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk {{in front of people}} or to open yourself up to your closest friends. But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand. And when I was going through this thing this year, that is the example I would think to myself that gave me the courage to <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opeth {{was formed}} in 1990 in Stockholm, Sweden, by David Isberg. Isberg invited Mikael Åkerfeldt (of the {{recently}} disbanded band Eruption) to join Opeth. The {{other members of the}} band took exception to this, and quit Opeth, leaving only Isberg and Åkerfeldt. Anders Nordin, Nick Döring, and Andreas Dimeo were brought in as replacements. They rehearsed in an elementary school using old 60's equipment that they found there. Opeth played a show in February 1991, along with Therion, Excruciate and Authorise, in Stockholm. Only two songs were performed for their set. Åkerfeldt commented about the show: [...] "I reckon it was probably the worst appearance one can have witnessed. We were so fucking nervous that we all wanted to cancel the fucking gig and <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> home." ...|$|E

60|$|And I {{must say}} I rather admired the man’s ingenuity. With {{a box of}} tools and a few mighty simple contrivances he had made {{out to have a}} devil of a temple. Any poor Kanaka brought up here in the dark, with the harps whining all round him, and shown that smoking face {{in the bottom of a}} hole, would make no kind of doubt but he had seen and heard enough devils for a lifetime. It’s easy to find out what Kanakas think. <b>Just</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to {{yourself}} any way round from ten to fifteen years old, and there’s an average Kanaka. There are some pious, just as there are pious boys; and the most of them, like the boys again, are middling honest and yet think it rather larks to steal, and are easy scared and rather like to be so. I remember a boy I was at school with at home who played the Case business. He didn’t know anything, that boy; he couldn’t do anything; he had no luminous paint and no Tyrolean harps; he just boldly said he was a sorcerer, and frightened us out of our boots, and we loved it. And then it came in my mind how the master had once flogged that boy, and the surprise we were all in to see the sorcerer catch it and bum like anybody else. Thinks I to myself, “I must find some way of fixing it so for Master Case.” And the next moment I had my idea.|$|E

6000|$|The {{expression}} {{of his face}} as he said these words was not at all pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into the road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face, and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me. [...] "I have a son of my own," [...] said he, [...] "as like you as two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art. But the great thing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline.
