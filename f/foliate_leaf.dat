The building is laden with Spanish/Moorish features, including blue faience tiles; <b>foliated</b> (<b>leaf</b> shaped) and rope moulded ornament, painted in gold and a foyer featuring terrazzo and inlaid stone. A Heritage Victoria database entry for Majorca House, says: [...] "The Moorish influence in its terracotta façade places it firmly within the Melbourne tradition of exotic architecture in the late 1920s." ...|$|R

No visible labels, marks or signatures. Fan has alternately {{been identified as}} Irish lace or machine-made lace, and dated 1830 's or 1880 - 1899...|$|R
40|$|We study one-instantons, that is anti-selfdual {{connections}} with instanton number 1 on the quantum projective plane ^ 2 _q with orientation which is reversed {{with respect to}} the usual one. The orientation is fixed by a suitable choice of a basis element for the rank 1 free bimodule of top forms. The noncommutative family of solutions is <b>foliated,</b> each non-singular <b>leaf</b> being isomorphic to he quantum projective plane itself...|$|R
40|$|Adiabatic invariants foliate phase space, and impart a macro-scale {{hierarchy}} by separating microscopic variables. On a macroscopic leaf, long-scale ordered {{structures are}} created while maximizing entropy. A plasma confined in a magnetosphere is invoked for unveiling the organizing principle [...] -in {{the vicinity of}} a magnetic dipole, the plasma self-organizes to a state with a steep density gradient. The resulting nontrivial structure has maximum entropy in an appropriate, constrained phase space. One could view such a phase space as a <b>leaf</b> <b>foliated</b> in terms of Casimir invariants [...] -adiabatic invariants measuring the number of quasi-particles (macroscopic representation of periodic motions) are identified as the relevant Casimir invariants. The density clump is created {{in response to the}} inhomogeneity of the energy level (frequency) of quasi-particles...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the growth and mineral composition of the yellow passion fruit plant seedlings (Passiflora edulis Sims f. flavicarpa Degener) in fertilized substrates with boron and kalium, with and without coconut fiber (25 % e 0 %) and bovine manure (15 %). The treatments were distributed in a outlined random block with four blocks and four seedlings per portion being five kalium doses and five boron doses combined according to the main Composite Central of Box. Each 20 days were done evaluations. Were analyzed the dry and green matter of the root and the <b>leaf,</b> <b>foliated</b> area and nutriment contents of the leaf. The results were submitted to analysis of change and regression. There was no significant effect of the treatments on the seedling's height, diameter of the shaft, number of leaves and foliated area. The coconut fiber doesn’t affect their growth and mineral composition. The kalium increased in a lineal way the root growth and aerial part of the seedlings, either the foliar contents of kalium, but reduce magnesium proportions. The boron increased the foliar contents of boron and reduced the nitrogen’s...|$|R

Copying finished ("wa-kāna al-farāgh min hādhihi al-nuskhah al-sharīfah [...] . ") Sunday into Monday, 10 th of Ṣafar 1132 [ca. 23 December 1719]. Accompanying materials: a. Inventory cataloguing slip in hand of Winifred Smeaton Thomas. [...] b. Acquisitions slip from Yahuda. Former shelfmark: From inscription on inner front cover and label on foreedge flap "IL 174 " (likely supplied by Yahuda, see acquisitions slip). Binding: Pasteboard covered in dark brown leather, with light brown leather and red goatskin used for repairs; Type II binding (with flap); board linings and interior of envelope flap in pink laid paper; interior of fore edge flap in light brown leather; upper and lower covers carry large blind-tooled (with leather onlays) central mandorla (compare Déroche class. OAi 4); smaller, rounder blind-tooled panel appears on envelope flap (compare Déroche class. OAi 2 2); in fair condition. Support: European laid paper; very clear single chain lines, running vertically and evently spaced 24 mm. apart; laid lines running horizontally and spaced roughly 10 laid lines per cm; paper used in repair of fol. 1 bears embossed mark ('imitation watermark'); some ink burn. Decoration: Illuminated headpiece (ʻunwān) accompanies opening on fol. 1 b, nearly identical to that found in first volume (Isl. Ms. 532 v. 1) but more expertly drawn and painted; consists of rectangular panel containing an empty cartouche in gold flanked by angular vegetal accents in red, gold, and blue; rectangular panel is surmounted by well with semi-circular piece (effectively dome within dome) evoking the miḥrāb filled with vegetal design in gold, blue, and red, outlining in black; gold rule-border on incipit and facing page (misplaced and found after fol. 8 (p. 16), with red rule-borders throughout thereafter; occasional textual dividers {{in the form of}} red discs and three dots; keywords such as "قوله", notabilia, and section headings rubricated; overlining in red. Script: Naskh; clear, compact Egyptian hand; seriffed with small right-sloping serifs on free standing alif, lām, ṭāʼ, etc., curvilinear though somewhat flattened descenders, pointing mainly in distinct dots, kāf mashqūqah preferred (even final kāf); same hand appears in first volume.

Ms. 532 v. 1); location of lacunae in the exemplar (model) are marked "بياض بالاصل" or "بياض بالاصل هنا" or the interesting logograph "بض بص" in the margin (see fol. 79 a, 196 a, 200 a, 213 b, 216 b, etc.) though a gap in the text is not always left, a bāʼ hindīyah serves as a signes-de-renvoi to mark where the gap had appeared in the exemplar; quire numbering in red ink in the form of full words through quire 19, thereafter in the form of Hindu-Arabic numerals surmounted by the letter kāf (compare quire numbering of first volume); catchwords present; foliation in black ink, Hindu-Arabic numerals, begins with "۳۰۰", continuing the foliation of the first volume; pagination in pencil, Western numerals (referenced in cataloguing).
