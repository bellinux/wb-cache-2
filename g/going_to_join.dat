5|$|During {{his service}} in New Orleans, Beauregard became {{dissatisfied}} as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 {{that he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the filibuster with William Walker, who had seized control of Nicaragua; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard {{to stay in the}} United States. He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Third class {{passengers}} were {{a diverse group}} of nationalities and ethnic groups. In addition to large numbers of British, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants, there were passengers from Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East (primarily Lebanon and Syria) and Hong Kong. Some travelled alone or in small family groups. Several groups of mothers were travelling alone with their young children—most <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> their husbands who had already gone to America to find jobs, and, having saved up enough money, could now send for their families.|$|E
5|$|Admiral de Grasse had {{the option}} to attack British forces in either New York or Virginia; he opted for Virginia, {{arriving}} at the Chesapeake {{at the end of}} August. Admiral Graves learned that de Grasse had sailed from the West Indies for North America and that French Admiral de Barras had also sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, and he concluded that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> forces at the Chesapeake. He sailed south from New York with 19 ships of the line and arrived {{at the mouth of the}} Chesapeake early on 5 September to see de Grasse's fleet at anchor in the bay. De Grasse hastily prepared most of his fleet for battle—24 ships of the line—and sailed out to meet him, and the two-hour engagement took place after hours of maneuvering. The lines of the two fleets did not completely meet; only the forward and center sections fully engaged. The battle was consequently fairly evenly matched, although the British suffered more casualties and ship damage, and it broke off when the sun set. The British tactics have been a subject of debate ever since.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from Norway, training started for Operation Puma, {{the occupation of}} the Canary Islands. The operation was planned following intelligence that Spain was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the war {{on the side of}} the Axis forces. The intention was to prevent Germany using the islands as a U-Boat base. The force assembled included five commando units, an army brigade, two Royal Marine brigades and supporting arms. Training for Operation Puma culminated in landing exercises in the Hebrides from the Landing Ship, Infantry HMS Royal Scotsman. The operation was renamed Operation Pilgrim and after a number of delays was put on hold by the Chiefs-of-Staff. On 13 September a token force including a troop from No. 4 Commando was dispatched to West Africa. The troop was based in Sierra Leone and Nigeria until returning to Britain in February 1942, after the cancellation of the operation. While this was happening a new second in command (2IC) was appointed, Major Charles Vaughan, and a Captain Lord Lovat joined the unit as the training officer. Lovat had been attached to the Lofoten raid as an observer and had applied for a posting to the commandos.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, {{theatrical}} producer Martin Gabel {{was working}} on a stage adaptation of the James M. Cain novel Serenade, about an opera singer who comes to the realization he is homosexual, and he invited Laurents to write the book. Laurents accepted and suggested Bernstein and Robbins join the creative team. Robbins felt if the three were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> forces, they should return to East Side Story, and Bernstein agreed. Laurents, however, was committed to Gabel, who introduced him to the young composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim auditioned by playing the score for Saturday Night, his musical that was scheduled to open in the fall. Laurents liked the lyrics but was not impressed with the music. Sondheim did not care for Laurents' opinion. Serenade ultimately was shelved.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the last two years, Magellus had {{acquired}} large tracts of uncleared land from the Samnites which, although they were technically public land, he was treating as his own. Instead of immediately <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Gurges, who was besieging Cominium, he used some 2,000 of his soldiers to begin clearing the land, which he had them do for some considerable time, before moving to finally join Gurges. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a jealous Megellus prevented Gurges from taking the Samnite stronghold of Cominium. Approaching the town, Megellus wrote to Gurges, ordering him to withdraw from Samnium. Gurges declined, declaring his command had been given to him by the Senate, and wrote to Rome, asking the Senate to confirm his command. The Senate sent a delegation of senators to Megellus, stating that he was not to countermand the Senate’s decree. He responded to the deputation that, as long as he was the duly elected consul of Rome, it was up to him to command the Senate, not for the Senate to dictate to him how he was to go about his duties. He then marched on to Cominium, and forced Gurges to stand down from his command. Gurges had no choice but to obey, and Megellus, having taken command of both armies, immediately sent Gurges back to Rome. Cominium quickly fell, and he followed this up with a campaign against the Hirpini, followed by the capture of Venusia.|$|E
25|$|Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland) Camp Comic – Spike {{was born}} on 12 September (year unknown) and brought up in Edgbaston with his {{childhood}} sweetheart Brenda, {{the daughter of the}} local butcher. After leaving school he gained a good position in the Income Tax office, but resigned in 1959 and joined the entertainment staff at Maplins. It is not known how long he had known Ted, but they were already well-acquainted by the time they travelled on the train to the camp and it was suggested that it was Ted who got Spike the job. Spike shared a chalet with Ted, and there were many humorous scenes between the pair in their chalet, such as Spike being kept awake by Ted's snoring. Spike often tried to branch out into his own style of comedy, designing and making his own costumes and funny sequences. These received mixed reactions from the campers, but Ted criticised almost all of them. Spike was a very honest and law-abiding man, and was {{the only member of the}} entertainment staff who didn't run his own scheme to scam the campers for money. Although he was loyal to Ted and willing to turn a blind-eye to his schemes, he was often shocked at the lengths Ted would go to in order to make money. Spike had to make an impossible choice between his job and the woman he loved during the 1959 season, when his girlfriend, Brenda, said she would marry him only if he gave up his job and went to work for her father's business. He chose his job and ended their relationship. During the 1960 season he became involved with April, one of the new Yellowcoats. At the same time, Spike also fell in love with Gladys, but this never amounted to anything. He continued his relationship with April, and she wanted him to leave Maplins and go back to the tax office so they could get married and have a steady income. As with Brenda, he again decided against this in favour of show business. Spike's immediate intentions after the 1960 season were left unknown, though he revealed he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Ted over Christmas playing a Chinese policeman in a pantomime. It was also implied that he had resumed his affair with April.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, a {{diplomatic}} {{source close to}} the euro adoption preparation talks with the seven remaining new member states who had yet to adopt the euro (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania), claimed that the monetary union (eurozone) they had thought they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> upon their signing of the accession treaty may very well end up being a very different union entailing much closer fiscal, economic and political convergence. This changed legal status of the eurozone could potentially cause them to conclude that the conditions for their promise to join were no longer valid, which [...] "could force them to stage new referendums" [...] on euro adoption.|$|E

Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) and the CAA, were placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). Subsequently, he was summoned before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and when questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating: [...] "Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go to jail for the failure to answer that question, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> them, if necessary." ...|$|E
