5|$|New {{airspeed}} {{records were}} set after the 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy contests, both achieved using the R engine. In {{the two decades}} before World War II, the quest to break the land speed record was hotly contested, particularly so in the early 1930s. Aero engines were often used to power wheeled vehicles to ever-higher speeds, chosen because of their high power-to-weight ratios: the Liberty engine, Napier Lion and the Sunbeam Matabele were among the <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> used in the 1920s. The Rolls-Royce R was the latest development in high-powered aero engine design at the time, and was chosen by several makers of land speed record-contending cars; the engine was also chosen for powerboats attempting the water speed record. One car and two boats successfully used the combined power of two R engines.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time in {{commercial}} aviation, both <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> will have a standard interface with the aircraft, allowing any 787 to be fitted with either a GE or Rolls-Royce engine at any time as long as the pylon is also modified. Engine interchangeability makes the 787 a more flexible asset to airlines, allowing them to change from one manufacturer's engine to the other's in light of any future engine developments which conform more closely to their operating profile. The cost of such a change would require a significant operating cost difference between the two <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> to make it economical - a difference that does not exist with the engines today.|$|E

25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} these engines are very large rear driving wheels fitted with solid rubber tyres, three-speed gearing (most traction <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> {{have only two}} gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a winch drum on the back axle. This {{can be used by}} removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing the drive train to power the winch drum instead of the wheels.|$|E
25|$|The {{intended}} {{engine for}} the Type 148 was the Bristol Perseus, but the aircraft {{made its first}} flight on 15 October 1937 with a Mercury IX. It was re-engined with a Perseus XII after a landing accident during comparative trials with the Westland Lysander. Both aircraft met the specification, including the demanding low-speed requirements but the visibility offered by the Lysander's high wing and the security of its fixed undercarriage made it the competition winner. The second prototype, labelled the Type 148B flew in May 1938, powered by a Bristol Taurus II engine and the two machines were used to compare and evaluate the two <b>engine</b> <b>types.</b>|$|E
25|$|These terms {{refer to}} the {{orientation}} of the engine cylinder. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical inverted engine is defined as a vertical cylinder arrangement, with the crankshaft mounted directly below the cylinder(s). With an inclined or horizontal type, the cylinder and piston are positioned at an incline or horizontally. An inclined inverted cylinder is an inverted cylinder operating at an incline. These terms are all generally used in conjunction with the <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> above. Thus, one may have a horizontal direct-acting engine, or an inclined compound double acting engine, etc.|$|E

25|$|The Vimy was {{powered by}} a range of {{different}} engines. Owing to engine supply difficulties, the prototype Vimys were tested {{with a number of}} different <b>engine</b> <b>types,</b> including Sunbeam Maoris, Salmson 9Zm water-cooled radials, and Fiat A.12bis engines, before production orders were placed for aircraft powered by the 230hp (170kW) BHP Puma, 400hp (300kW) Fiat, 400hp (300kW) Liberty L-12 and the 360hp (270kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engines, with a total of 776 ordered {{before the end of the}} First World War. Of these, only aircraft powered by the Eagle engine, known as the Vimy IV, were delivered to the RAF. Due to the diverse number of engines used, there are multiple conflicting official reports on the production numbers of each sub-variant of the Vimy.|$|E

500|$|Airbus {{intended}} the A330 {{to compete in}} the Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards (ETOPS) market, specifically with the Boeing 767. (ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards.) Instead of the [...] "ETOPS out of the box" [...] or [...] "Early ETOPS" [...] approach taken by Boeing with its 777, Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330 using in-service experience. [...] Airbus suggested that the A340 and A330 were essentially identical except for their engine number, and that the A340's experience could be applied to the A330's ETOPS approval. [...] The plans were for all three <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> to enter service with 90-minute approval, before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330 fleet accumulated 25,000 flight hours, and then to 180 minutes after 50,000 flight hours, in 1995. Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in-service flight hours on over-ocean flights. In November 2009, the A330 became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS–240 approval, which has since been offered by Airbus as an option.|$|E
