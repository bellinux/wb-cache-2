40|$|A novel trust-based design {{method for}} FPGA {{circuits}} that uses error-correcting code (ECC) structures for detecting design tampers (changes, deletion of existing logic, and addition of extradesign logic-like Trojans) is proposed in this article. We determine ECC-based CLB (configuration logic block) “parity groups ” and embed the check CLBs for each parity {{group in the}} FPGA circuit. During a trust-checking phase, a Test-Pattern Generator (TPG) and an Output Response Analyzer (ORA), configured in the FPGA, are used to check that each parity group of CLB outputs produce the expected parities. We use two levels of randomization to thwart attempts by an adversary to discover the parity groups and inject tampers that mask each other, or to tamper with the TPG and ORA so that design tampers remain undetected: (a) randomization of the mapping of the ECC parity groups to the CLB array; (b) randomization within each parity group of odd and <b>even</b> <b>parities</b> for different input combinations (classically, all ECC <b>parity</b> groups have <b>even</b> <b>parities</b> across all inputs). These randomizations along with the error-detecting property of the underlying ECC lead to design tampers being uncovered with very high probabilities, as we show both analytically and empirically.

2500|$|Proof. The {{identity}} is an isometry; nothing changes, so distance cannot change. And if one isometry cannot change distance, neither can two (or three, or more) in succession; thus {{the composition of}} two isometries is again an isometry, and the set of isometries is closed under composition. The {{identity is}}ometry is also an identity for composition, and composition is associative; therefore isometries satisfy the axioms for a semigroup. For a group, we must also have an inverse for every element. To cancel a reflection, we merely compose it with itself. (Reflections are involutions.) And since every isometry can be expressed as a sequence of reflections, its inverse can be expressed as that sequence reversed. Notice that the cancellation {{of a pair of}} identical reflections reduces the number of reflections by an even number, preserving the parity of the sequence; also notice that the identity has <b>even</b> <b>parity.</b> Therefore all isometries form a group, and even isometries a subgroup. (Odd isometries do not include the identity, so are not a subgroup.) This subgroup is a normal subgroup, because sandwiching an even isometry between two odd ones yields an even isometry. ∎ ...|$|E
