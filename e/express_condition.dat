25|$|In 1852, {{the voters}} of Edinburgh offered to re-elect him to Parliament. He {{accepted}} on the <b>express</b> <b>condition</b> that he need not campaign and would not pledge himself to a position on any political issue. Remarkably, he was elected on those terms. He seldom attended the House due to ill health. His weakness after suffering a heart attack caused him to postpone for several months making his speech of thanks to the Edinburgh voters. He resigned his seat in January 1856. In 1857 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Macaulay, of Rothley in the County of Leicester, but seldom attended the House of Lords.|$|E
500|$|Attorney Manuel Genaro Villota, {{representative}} of the conservative Spanish, said that the city of Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} make unilateral decisions about the legitimacy of the Viceroy or the Council of Regency without the participation of other cities of the Viceroyalty. He argued that such an action would break the unity of the country and establish as many sovereignties as there were cities. His intention was to keep Cisneros in power by delaying any possible action. Juan José Paso accepted his first point, but argued that the situation in Europe and the possibility that Napoleon's forces could conquer the American colonies demanded an urgent resolution. He then expounded the [...] "argument of the elder sister", reasoning that Buenos Aires should take the initiative and make the changes deemed necessary and appropriate, on the <b>express</b> <b>condition</b> that the other cities would be invited to comment as soon as possible. The rhetorical device of the [...] "elder sister", comparable to negotiorum gestio, makes an analogy between the relationship of Buenos Aires and other cities of the viceroyalty with a sibling relationship.|$|E

An examination of Crown freehold grants from the beginnings of settlement in New South Wales and after the separation of the Colony of Queensland until the 1890 s shows that fee simple titles were granted subject to <b>express</b> <b>conditions</b> and reservations designed to reserve useful natural resources to the Crown and to promote public purposes.

60|$|Buthred was {{the king}} of Mercia. He could not resist Hubba and his Danes alone, {{and he could not}} now have Alfred's assistance. Alfred was censured very much at the time, and has been {{condemned}} often since, for having thus made a separate peace for himself and his own immediate dominions, and abandoned his natural allies and friends, the people of the other Saxon kingdoms. To make a peace with savage and relentless pagans, on the <b>express</b> <b>condition</b> of leaving his fellow-Christian neighbors at their mercy, has been considered ungenerous, at least, if it was not unjust. On the other hand, those who vindicate his conduct maintain that it was his duty to secure the peace and welfare of his own realm, leaving other sovereigns to take care of theirs; and that he would have done very wrong to sacrifice the property and lives of his own immediate subjects to a mere point of honor, when it was utterly out of his power to protect them and his neighbors too.|$|E

Colonel Baum set out from camp at break of day on the 13th of August. He was too slow a man to take a place by surprise. The people of Bennington heard of his approach and were on the alert.

Swift fed the flame by publishing songs and ballads well fitted for the street singers, and appealing to the understandings of those who he well knew would effectively carry his message to the very hearths of the poorest labourers. Courtier and student, tradesman and freeman, thief and prostitute, beggar and loafer, all were alike carried by an indignation which launched them on a maelstrom of enthusiasm. So general became the outcry that, in Coxe's words, [...] "the lords justices refused to issue the orders for the circulation of the coin....
