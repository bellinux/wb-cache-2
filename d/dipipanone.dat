50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{disadvantages}} of using <b>dipipanone</b> {{is that it is}} only produced in one dosage form that is mixed with the anti-emetic cyclizine at a ratio of 25% <b>dipipanone</b> to 75% cyclizine which limits the dose of <b>dipipanone</b> to an absolute maximum of 3 tablets per dose up to 4-6 times a day.|$|E
50|$|The drug Diconal is a {{combination}} of cyclizine and the opioid <b>dipipanone.</b> <b>Dipipanone</b> is a schedule I controlled substance in the US, due to its high abuse potential.|$|E
50|$|Keto: phenadoxone, methadone, <b>dipipanone,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipipanone</b> is a Schedule I {{controlled}} substance in the United States; {{it has been}} assigned the ACSCN of 9622 and in 2013 had an annual manufacturing quota of 5 g.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipipanone</b> {{was also}} {{available}} as an oral mixture 10 mg/5ml without the cyclizine during the 1970s-1980s in the United Kingdom. This form was rare and used normally only in drug trials and in specialist diconal addiction clinics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipipanone</b> (Pipadone) is {{a strong}} opioid {{analgesic}} drug, used for very severe pain in cases where other analgesics are unsuitable, for instance where morphine is indicated but cannot {{be used due to}} the patient being allergic to morphine.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of oxycodone, <b>dipipanone</b> is now the only alternative opioid left {{to use in the}} UK that is of equal strength to morphine that can be prescribed instead. All the other opioids are either weaker like codeine, dihydrocodeine and pethidine or stronger like hydromorphone, methadone, and fentanyl.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipipanone</b> is now {{unavailable}} in {{most countries}} of the world either by laws prohibiting its medicinal use as in the United States or by falling out of production as more modern analgesics took its market share. Great Britain, Northern Ireland and South Africa are known to continue to use the substance but it is infrequently prescribed.|$|E
50|$|Chemically, <b>dipipanone</b> {{belongs to}} the class of opioids called the 4,4-diphenylheptane-3-ones. It closely resembles methadone, the only {{structural}} difference being the N,N-dimethyl moiety of methadone being replaced with a piperidine ring. Other related compounds with equivalent activity where the piperidine ring {{has been replaced by}} other groups, include the morpholine derivative phenadoxone, as well as the corresponding pyrrolidine derivative.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{professional}} {{role for}} pharmacist as prescriber {{has been recognized}} in the UK since May 2006, called the [...] "Pharmacist Independent Prescriber". Once qualified, a pharmacist independent prescriber can prescribe any licensed medicine for any medical condition within their competence. This includes controlled drugs except schedule 1 and prescribing certain drugs {{for the treatment of}} addiction (cocaine, heroin and <b>dipipanone).</b>|$|E
50|$|Meclizine is a first-generation {{antihistamine}} (nonselective H1 antagonist) of the piperazine class. It is structurally and pharmacologically {{similar to}} buclizine, cyclizine, and hydroxyzine, {{but has a}} shorter half-life of six hours compared to cyclizine and hydroxyzine with about 20 hours (though half-life {{should not be confused}} with duration). It is used as an antivertigo/antiemetic agent, specifically in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. Meclizine is sometimes combined with opioids, especially ones of the open-chain class like methadone, dextropropoxyphene, and <b>dipipanone</b> (originally combined with meclizine's parent drug cyclizine, the brand name of this combination is Diconal).|$|E
5000|$|Prescription Only Medication (POM), {{which are}} legally {{available}} {{only with a}} valid prescription from a prescriber. A pharmacist {{has to be on}} the premises for POM medicines to be dispensed, required by law. The medicine has been specifically prescribed for the patient holding the prescription, so it is considered safe for only the recipient to take. Just a small example of these include most antibiotics and all antidepressants or antidiabetic medications. Drugs included as POM are high-strength painkillers such as oxycodone and tramadol, medications such as sildenafil (Viagra) and diazepam (Valium), and certain topical preparations such as corticosteroids. These medicines are often sold by drug dealers, especially those marked as [...] "CD POM," [...] which are controlled due to abuse risk such as <b>dipipanone,</b> temazepam, and methadone.|$|E
50|$|Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947. It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like phenazocine and bezitramide) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), <b>dipipanone</b> (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil).|$|E
5000|$|Prescription of <b>dipipanone</b> is {{discouraged}} {{apart from}} in exceptional circumstances, {{because of the}} perceived risk of abuse - the BNF marks the substance as [...] "less suitable for prescribing" [...] along with other older compounds such as pethidine and pentazocine with unusual abuse patterns. The combination with cyclizine leads to a very strong [...] "rush" [...] if the drug is injected, however the tablets contain insoluble binders which led to many limb amputations and some fatalities (as with temazepam). During the late 1970s to early 1980s in the UK, many deaths were blamed on misuse of this preparation. As supplies became unavailable, opiate users would mix crushed methadone tablets or Physeptone ampoules with crushed Valoid (a cyclizine containing antihistamine) tablets, {{in an attempt to}} replicate the effect of Diconal.|$|E
5000|$|Morphine is {{the gold}} {{standard}} to which all narcotics are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), nicomorphine (Vilan), hydromorphinol and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency. Fentanyl has the benefit of less histamine release and thus fewer side effects. It can also be administered via transdermal patch which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable Sublimaze, the FDA has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). Oxycodone is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain; its main slow-release formula is known as OxyContin, and short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and ampules are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or breakthrough pain. Diamorphine, methadone and buprenorphine are used less frequently. Pethidine, known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended [...] for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. Pentazocine, dextromoramide and <b>dipipanone</b> are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons. In some countries potent synthetics such as piritramide and ketobemidone are used for severe pain, and tapentadol is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.|$|E
40|$|A single oral dose of Diconal (<b>dipipanone</b> HCl 10 mg, {{cyclizine}} HCl 30 mg) {{was given}} to six volunteers. The mean peak plasma <b>dipipanone</b> concentration was 29 ng ml- 1, the time to peak plasma concentration was 1 - 2 h, the mean elimination half-life was 3. 5 h and the mean AUC was 156 ng ml- 1 min. Less than 1 % of the dose was excreted in urine unchanged over 24 h...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the pain relief produced by opiates in normal volunteers in the cold induced pain test has been investigated. In a double-blind placebo controlled study, hand skin temperature during a 3 min immersion in water at 1 degree C was not affected by either the opioid <b>dipipanone</b> 8 mg or the vasodilator nifedipine 10 and 20 mg. During this immersion, <b>dipipanone</b> produced significant pain relief. Nifedipine reduced pre-immersion blood pressures and raised heart rates, however, it did not significantly alter pain scores. It is concluded that vasodilatation and local warming do not {{play a role in}} the relief of pain by opiates in the cold immersion test...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dipipanone</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{raised the}} threshold to ischaemic pain in healthy human volunteers. The lowest dose producing a significant rise in pain threshold was 10. 0 mg. The peak effect for all doses was reached after about 2 hr. Side effects, {{the most common}} of which were drowsiness, nausea, and vertigo, are described and analysed. The drug was shown to be a histamine liberator and to cause pain and tenderness at injection sites...|$|E
40|$|In the rat, {{the ratio}} of the {{analgesic}} to the respiratory depressant potency was the same for morphine, codeine, diamorphine, methadone, <b>dipipanone,</b> piperidylisomethadone, phenadoxone, dextromoramide, and propoxyphene. The relative respiratory depressant activity of pethidine tended to be less, but the difference was not significant. The ratio of the analgesic dose to the dose preventing transport of a charcoal meal in the rat was about the same for morphine, codeine, pethidine, methadone, phenadoxone, dimethylthiambutene, and propoxyphene; the relative activities of these compounds in inhibiting the peristaltic reflex of the isolated guinea-pig ileum were also similar. However, because of differences in the slopes of regression lines in the charcoal meal test, some compounds (for example, morphine) had a greater effect on gastrointestinal propulsion than others (for example, pethidine) when given at moderate analgesic dose levels...|$|E
40|$|A {{search of}} the Home Office index of {{notified}} drug addicts identified 1499 deaths during 1967 - 81, of which 226 (15 %) were of therapeutic addicts [...] that is, patients who had become addicted during medical treatment with a notifiable drug [...] and 1273 (85 %) were of non-therapeutic addicts. The crude mortality fell from 23. 5 / 1000 /year for the period 1968 - 70 to 18. 4 / 1000 /year for 1978 - 80. Altogether 416 addicts aged under 50 at notification died after 1972, which was 16 {{times the number of}} deaths expected in a population with a similar age and sex composition. A more detailed examination of the cohorts of addicts notified each year showed little variation between them {{in the first two years}} of follow up. Nineteen addicts (1. 6 %) had died by 31 December of the year of their notification and 39 (3. 3 %) one year later. These figures may be an indication of the clinical course of addiction. Most deaths of non-therapeutic addicts in which a drug was implicated (939 cases (74 %] were due to medically prescribed drugs [...] barbiturates at first and later opiates such as <b>dipipanone</b> hydrochloride and dextromoramide. Heroin was implicated in only 65 (7 %) of these deaths. The Home Office index is a valuable source for identifying drugs of abuse and serious problems of addiction. The fact that prescribed drugs are causing the death of so many addicts demands a response from the medical profession...|$|E
