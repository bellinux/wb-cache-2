5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. <b>In</b> <b>fish</b> the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E
5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species {{richness}} and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> samples.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. <b>In</b> <b>fish</b> and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. <b>In</b> <b>fish,</b> the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{sufficient}} work done <b>in</b> <b>fishes</b> {{to warrant a}} review of feeding-entrained rhythmicity, if only for comparative reasons. Relative to the extensive work with laboratory mammals, however, information on this topic <b>in</b> <b>fishes</b> is meager. An attempt at a broad overview {{at this point is}} fated from the outset to be data poor and speculation rich; hopefully this paper will, nevertheless, serve a heuristic role. Specifically, the paper addresses five questions regarding feeding entrainment of circadian rhythms in fishes: Does feeding entrain rhythms <b>in</b> <b>fishes?</b> How? Why? So what? and What next?[URL]...|$|R
5|$|Fish do {{not possess}} {{parathyroid}} glands; several species {{have been found to}} express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds and mammals. It has been suggested that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>fish</b> {{and other}} wildlife, {{selenium}} {{is necessary for}} life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight. Much below that level, young salmon die from deficiency; much above, they die from toxic excess.|$|E
5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. <b>In</b> <b>fish,</b> {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E

5|$|Other {{heavy metals}} noted for their {{potentially}} hazardous nature, usually as toxic environmental pollutants, include manganese (central nervous system damage); cobalt and nickel (carcinogens); copper, zinc, selenium and silver (endocrine disruption, congenital disorders, or general toxic effects <b>in</b> <b>fish,</b> plants, birds, or other aquatic organisms); tin, as organotin (central nervous system damage); antimony (a suspected carcinogen); and thallium (central nervous system damage).|$|E
5|$|Several {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat S.iniae infection <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> Enrofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops× M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. Amoxicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone, and oxytetracycline have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi). Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have also}} found {{significant}} levels of toxins <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> and the waters they inhabit within the basin. Accumulation of toxins <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> threatens the survival of fish species, and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems. Water quality {{is also an important}} factor in the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin. The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts. A number of cleanup efforts are currently underway, including Superfund projects at Portland Harbor, Hanford, and Lake Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is found in}} all vertebrates. <b>In</b> <b>fish,</b> it is usually located below the gills and is not always divided into {{distinct}} lobes.

5|$|Top/bottom countershading {{is common}} <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> {{including}} sharks, marlin, and mackerel, and animals in other {{groups such as}} dolphins, turtles and penguins.

5|$|After {{her first}} year of {{graduate}} school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson {{was forced to leave}} Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> biology and {{in the work of the}} bureau—a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.|$|E
