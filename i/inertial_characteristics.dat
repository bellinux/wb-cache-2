40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{accepted}} for publication in Journal of Fluid Mechanics published by Cambridge University PressInternational audienceThe magnetostrophic regime, in which Lorentz and Coriolis forces are in balance, has been investigated in a rapidly rotating spherical Couette flow experiment. The spherical shell is filled with liquid sodium and permeated by a strong imposed dipolar magnetic field. Azimuthally travelling hydromagnetic waves {{have been put in}} evidence through a detailed analysis of electric potential differences measured on the outer sphere, and their properties have been determined. Several types of waves have been identified depending on the relative rotation rates of the inner and outer spheres: they differ by their dispersion relation and by their selection of azimuthal wavenumbers. In addition, these waves constitute the largest contribution to the observed fluctuations, and all of them travel in the retrograde direction in the frame of reference bound to the fluid.

40|$|For amputees {{to perform}} an {{everyday}} task, or to participate in physical exercise, {{it is crucial that}} they have an appropriately designed and functional prosthesis. Past studies of transfemoral amputee gait have identified several limitations in the performance of amputees and in their prosthesis when compared with able-bodied walking, such as asymmetrical gait, slower walking speed, and higher energy demands. In particular the different <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the prosthesis relative to the sound limb results in a longer swing time for the prosthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether this longer swing time could be addressed by modifying the alignment of the prosthesis. The following hypothesis was tested: Can the <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the prosthesis be improved by lowering the prosthetic knee joint, thereby producing a faster swing time? To test this hypothesis, a simple 2 -D mathematical model was developed to simulate the swing-phase motion of the prosthetic leg. The model applies forward dynamics to the measured hip moment of the amputee in conjunction with the <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> of prosthetic components to predict the swing-phase motion. To evaluate the model and measure any change in prosthetic function, we conducted a kinematic analysis on four Paralympic runners as they ran. When evaluated, there was no significant difference between predicted and measured swing time. Of particular interest was how swing time was affected by changes in the position of the prosthetic knee axis. The model suggested that lowering the axis of the prosthetic knee could reduce the longer swing time. This hypothesis was confirmed when tested on the amputee runners...|$|E

40|$|In general, a multibody system {{consists}} of flexible bodies, interconnected through members {{which are also}} flexible, often very flexible. The kinematic conditions of the system may exhibit an unstable behavior {{for some of the}} bodies, whereas for other bodies the behavior is stable. As a very simple example, one can think of two independent bars, the first one in orbit in horizontal (unstable) position, and the other one in vertical (stable) position. If the two bodies are connected through a hinge, a very complicated motion may arise, that can sometimes reach a chaotic character. If the connections between the members are sufficiently stiff, with a proper choice of the <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristic</b> (which dedicate dynamic stability in orbit), the bodies of the system as a whole can reach stable configuration even with unstable motion: as an example, one can think again of the two bars now rigidly connected, {{in such a way that}} the resulting inertia tensor allows dynamic stability. The situation is even improved if one has an adaptive control system, providing the required stiffening (or damping) where such a need arises. This can be done via an intelligent system (e. g. piezo or shape memory alloys) able to generate internal foreces capable of driving the system and/or the parts of the system to the overall configuration(s) leading to stability. The dynamic formulation of the problem includes the mathematical models of the different parts of the connections, which are also considered as flexible structures.

Whereas increased system inertia is intrin-sically linked to the addition of synchronous generation to power systems, due to differing electromechanical characteristics, this in-herent link is not present in wind turbine generators.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Inspection using {{machine vision}} offers the {{potential}} for improved food safety and quality. However, effectiveness of fruit inspection has been limited by the difficulty of appropriately orienting fruit for imaging. Commercial orientation systems have had limited impact due to mechanical complexity, cost, error, or some combination thereof. Preliminary tests demonstrated that apples could be oriented by rolling them down a track consisting of two parallel rails. After achieving sufficient angular velocity, the apples moved to an orientation where the stem/calyx axis was perpendicular to the direction of travel and parallel to {{the plane of the}} track. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether this orientation phenomenon could be explained in terms of the <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> of axially symmetric objects. Rotation of a free body around an axis of axial symmetry was found to be stable, while rotation around an axis perpendicular to this symmetric axis was not. Furthermore, comparisons of action values for two different mathematical models of apples indicate that <b>inertial</b> <b>characteristics</b> can be used to orient apples. The critical assumption for this analysis was that for the same object traveling the same path with different initial orientations, lower action values represent preferred motions. This study introduces the novel use of action integrals to examine stability, and the results provide testable predictions that round apples as compared to elongated or squat apples and larger elongated apples will need to travel farther before orientation is favored...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{details the}} inertial dynamics of a uniform magnetization in the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) context. Analytical predictions and numerical simulations {{of the complete}} equations within the Inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (ILLG) model are presented. In addition to the usual precession resonance, the inertial model gives a second resonance peak associated to the nutation dynamics provided that the damping is not too large. The analytical resolution of the equations of motion yields both the precession and nutation angular frequencies. They are function of the <b>inertial</b> dynamics <b>characteristic</b> time τ, the dimensionless damping α and the static magnetic field H. A scaling function with respect to ατγ H is found for the nutation angular frequency, also valid for the precession angular frequency when ατγ H≫ 1.

Many servo-hydraulic control applications require high bandwidth realtime force tracking. Some specimen dynamics greatly limit the force bandwidth obtainable with standard PID loops. In these cases, the force control bandwidth {{is much lower}} than its position control counterpart. When the specimen includes resonant modes in the frequency range of interest, these resonant poles result in complex zeros in the open loop transfer function, which adversely affect the loop shape. These low frequency complex zeros are {{a consequence of the}} “highly <b>inertial</b> specimen” <b>characteristics</b> where the frequency of the zeros is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass.
