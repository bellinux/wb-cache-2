5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand, {{commonly}} referred to as the All Blacks, are the most successful team in international rugby. They have a positive winning record against all Test nations, and have a win record of over 74% The first All Blacks Test match was played against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 15 August 1903. New Zealand won 22 - 3, with The Sydney Morning Herald saying, 'The present New Zealand team have shown form so far in advance of every fifteen opposed to them that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> impossible for Australia to put a side into the field with any hope of victory...'.|$|E

500|$|Cream {{recorded}} the song on November 28, 1966, for broadcast on the BBC Guitar Club radio program. [...] At {{less than two}} minutes in length, Clapton only sings the first and last sections, with his guitar solo replacing the middle [...] "Traveling Riverside Blues" [...] verse. [...] It appeared on bootleg albums before finally being released in 2003 on BBC Sessions. [...] On March 10, 1968, Cream recorded it again during a concert at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. [...] According to two music writers, the recording was edited from a much longer performance that was typical for the trio – in the notes for Clapton's Crossroads box set, Anthony DeCurtis credits the trimming to engineer Tom Dowd, while critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes the editing to producer Felix Pappalardi, who [...] "cut together the best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes", to allow the song's drive more continuity. However, Clapton biographer Schumacher does not mentioning editing and adds [...] "Given the passion of the solo performances on 'Crossroads,' <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> miraculous that Cream is able to return to the song itself." [...] "Crossroads" [...] became the opening number on the live half of Cream's Wheels of Fire double album, released in August 1968 by Polydor Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US. [...] After the group's breakup, Atco issued the song as a single in January 1969, which reached number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100 pop chart and 17 on Cashbox. Both the original album and single credit the songwriter as Robert Johnson or R. Johnson, although Clapton and Cream extensively reworked the song.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} three films in the Die Hard series were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, {{alternate}} profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying [...] "It was about three months into it , and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it {{was just trying to}} make the best Die Hard movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be." [...] Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, [...] "I really wanted this one {{to live up to the}} promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they’re trying to reach a broader audience. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film." [...] Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: [...] "It's unbelievable. I just saw it last week. I personally think, it's better than the first one." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{nevertheless}} {{highly unlikely that}} either of these two burials within KV55 was original. In the case of Tiye, evidence found in tomb WV22 suggests that Amenhotep III prepared her burial in his own tomb. However, the fact that Tiye outlived her husband by possibly as much as twelve years seems to have disrupted such plans. From inscriptional evidence on the KV55 shrine on the other hand, {{it seems likely that}} Tiye was buried at Amarna by her son Akhenaten. In the case of Akhenaten <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> certain that he was originally buried in the tomb he prepared for himself in the Amarna royal wadi. Although it is unclear whether or not the original blocking of the tomb was stamped with Tutankhamun's seal, the several small seal impressions carrying his prenomen are most likely related to the reburial(s) in KV55 since he was probably not involved in the original burial preparations of either Tiye (who died several years before Tutankhamun came to the throne) or Akhenaten (who presumably was buried by his co-regent and probable immediate successor Smenkhkare).
