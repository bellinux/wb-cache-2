In general, large amplitudes of the annual cycle occur near the coast, except in the vicinity of strong western boundary currents. The difference between coastal areas and the deep ocean is suggested to be the result of several physical factors including local and remote atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial processes, sharp gradients in wind and moisture along land/sea boundaries, and land motions with an annual oscillatory component from tidal or atmospheric loading.|$|E

In the QuikSCAT wind field, small struc-tures related to orographic effects, air-sea interactions, and coastlines are observed, {{but these are not}} repre-sented well in the reanalysis. The simulated oceanic fields driven by the satellite wind capture small scale responses of the ocean to the small scale structures in the wind field, which are not represented in the NCEP run. For example, small scale structures in the sea surface <b>height</b> <b>variabilities</b> are found in the equatorial oceans, the eastern tropical Pacific, and the western subtropical Pacific. In addition to these, some of the oceanic responses have large zonal extents with small meridional scales in the QSCAT run, for example, the Hawaiian Lee Countercurrent {{to the west of the}} Hawaiian Islands and two branches of south equatorial cur-rents in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Biological fields in near-shore regions, for example along the California coast, are also simulated well in the QSCAT run due to realistic representation of coastal upwelling influenced by the near-shore wind field.

In the suburban neighbourhood during leaf-on, the anemometric and morphometric methods have similar directional variability for both zd and z 0.

40|$|A wind-tunnel {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate ventilation of scalars from urban-like geometries at neighbourhood scale by exploring two different geometries a uniform height roughness and a non-uniform height roughness, both with an equal plan and frontal density of Î» p = Î» f = 25 %. In both configurations a sub-unit of the idealized urban surface was coated with a thin layer of naphthalene to represent area sources. The naphthalene sublimation method was used to measure directly total area-averaged transport of scalars out of the complex geometries. At the same time, naphthalene vapour concentrations controlled by the turbulent fluxes were detected using a fast Flame Ionisation Detection (FID) technique. This paper describes the novel use of a naphthalene coated surface as an area source in dispersion studies. Particular emphasis was also given to testing whether the concentration measurements were independent of Reynolds number. For low wind speeds, transfer from the naphthalene surface is determined by a combination of forced and natural convection. Compared with a propane point source release, a 25 % higher free stream velocity was needed for the naphthalene area source to yield Reynolds-number-independent concentration fields. Ventilation transfer coefficients w T /U derived from the naphthalene sublimation method showed that, whilst there was enhanced vertical momentum exchange due to obstacle <b>height</b> <b>variability,</b> advection was reduced and dispersion from the source area was not enhanced. Thus, the <b>height</b> <b>variability</b> of a canopy is an important parameter when generalising urban dispersion.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the seasonal sea surface <b>height</b> (SSH) <b>variability</b> on large spatial scales in the North Atlantic by using both a numerical simulation and in situ data. First, an ocean general circulation model is run with daily forcing from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis. We evaluate the different {{contributions to the}} seasonal SSH variability resulting from the surface heat fluxes, advection, salt content variability, deep ocean steric changes, and bottom pressure variability. These terms are compared with estimates from in situ data. North of 20 Â°N, there is an approximate balance between hQ, the air-sea heat flux induced changes in steric <b>height,</b> and SSH <b>variability.</b> The next important component is the advection (its contribution to the annual amplitude is {{of the order of}} 1 cm except near the western boundary); other contributions are found to be smaller. Between 10 Â°N and 10 Â°S the advection variability induced by the seasonal wind stress cycle is the primary source of SSH variability. We then compare the sea surface height annual harmonic from TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry with the steric effect from the heat flux and with model and/or in situ estimates of the other terms. In many areas north of 20 Â°N the balance between hQ and the altimetric SSH seasonal cycle is closed within the uncertainty limit of each of the terms of the SSH budget. However, hQ and the SSH do not balance each other in the eastern North Atlantic, and the results are sensitive to the choice of the heat flux product, suggesting that significant errors, typically 20 â€“ 40 W mâˆ’ 2 for the seasonal cycle amplitude, are present in the meteorological model heat fluxes...|$|R

Here, five methods to estimate the spatially- and temporally- averaged wind-speed profile are compared in London: the logarithmic wind law (LOG); the Deaves and Harris equilibrium (DHe) and non-equilibrium (DHv) models; an adaptation of the power law (PL) and the Gryning et al.

Using measurements at 2. 5 times the average building height, a source area model is used to determine aerodynamic roughness parameters using two morphometric methods, which assume homogeneous and variable roughness-element heights, respectively. Hourly-averaged wind speeds are extrapolated to 200 m above the canopy during strong wind conditions, and compared to wind speeds observed with Doppler lidar. Wind speeds are consistently underestimated if roughness-element <b>height</b> <b>variability</b> is not considered during aerodynamic parameter determination.

It is found that the SH variability is not really sensitive to increasing the reference level from 1000 to 1500 m.

The 1 / 4 Â° Ã— 1 / 4 Â° resolution daily SSH fields are formed using optimal interpolation of available altimeter data.

A joint examination of SSH and sea surface tem-perature (SST) indicates strong {{relationship between the two}} only in winter, with correlations as high as 0. 6 or more. This would reflect a steric change in sea surface height due to thermal expansion averaged over a relatively deep winter mixed layer. Newly developed SSH fields also demonstrate a switch to the positive mode of SSH starting from the end of 1996 lasting â‰ˆ 4 yr. Such a climatic shift is found to be strongly related to large-scale teleconnection patterns.

A footprint model is {{used with the}} morphometric methods in an iterative procedure. The results are insensitive to the initial zd and z 0 estimates. Across the three sites, zd varies between 5 â€“ 45 m depending upon the method used.
