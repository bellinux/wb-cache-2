40|$|Aim Size {{and shape}} of the {{mandible}} are investigated across the latitudinal range of the <b>European</b> <b>wood</b> mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), in order to address the relative importance of genetic structure, insularity, and geographical gradient in patterning morphological variation. Results are compared with those on two Asiatic species of wood mice, A. argenteus and A. speciosus. Location The <b>European</b> <b>wood</b> mouse is sampled by a set of trapping localities including both, islands and mainland populations, as well as the four genetic groups identified in previous studies. The localities cover a latitudinal gradient from 55 degreesN to 36 degreesN. Methods Different Fourier methods are applied to the outlines of mandibles and their results compared in the case of A. sylvaticus. All provide similar results and allow a quantification of the size and shape variations across the geographical range of the <b>European</b> <b>wood</b> mouse. Using the method allowing for the best reduction of the informative data set, a comparison of the <b>European</b> <b>wood</b> mouse with the two Asiatic species was performed. Results Within the <b>European</b> <b>wood</b> mouse A. sylvaticus, a strong latitudinal gradient in mandible shape overrides the influence of insularity and genetic structure. Yet, random morphological divergence in insular conditions can be identified as a secondary process of shape differentiation. Size displays no obvious pattern of variation, neither with insularity or latitude. A comparison with two other species of wood mice suggests that a similar latitudinal gradient in mandible shape exists in different species, mandibles being flatter in the north and wider in the south. Main conclusion The latitudinal gradient in mandible shape observed in the three species of wood mice is interpreted as an intraspecific adaptive response to gradual changes in feeding behaviour.

Mainly the Honduran rosewood shows the optimal properties (high density, high modulus of elasticity, speed of sound, hardness, low damping) considering the required acoustic quality of the xylophone. The Honduran rosewood is listed in CITES Appendix II, therefore it is necessary to look for possibilities of its replacement by other wood species. However, the density, hardness and strength properties of the <b>European</b> <b>wood</b> species are rated less than Honduran rosewood.

40|$|Frost crack {{represents}} one of the main defects which affect <b>European</b> beech <b>wood</b> quality. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to improve the knowledge regarding both the impact of frost crack on <b>European</b> beech <b>wood</b> quality and the frost crack characteristics which affect wood quality. In order to do this, nineteen European beech trunks with frost crack have been studied. Each trunk has been cross-cut every 1 meter and the characteristics of frost crack and frost crack star-shaped heart have been measured in each cross-cut section. The defects which accompany frost crack have also been identified in each cross-cut section. Moreover, the possibility of determining these defects using the IML RESIF 500 – S Resistograph has been tested. The research has emphasized the existence of statistical correlations between frost crack star-shaped heart expansion, frost crack rib prominence and frost crack length. These correlations are expressed by multiple linear regressions. The presence of defects which affect wood structure leading to a decrease in penetration resistance can be determined accurately with the resistograph. Decay (in frost cracks older than 8 years) and ring shake have been identified as the most frequent defects which accompany frost crack. The measurements made on the frost cracks studied have been gathered in a graph which shows frost crack impact on <b>European</b> beech <b>wood</b> quality. The results obtained lead to the improvement of the criteria of <b>European</b> beech <b>wood</b> quality assessment by expanding the already existent knowledge and by identifying new aspects which may complete standing wood quality determination and sorting methods...|$|R
