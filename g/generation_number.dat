25|$|Objects may {{be either}} direct (embedded in another object) or indirect. Indirect objects are {{numbered}} with an object number and a <b>generation</b> <b>number</b> and defined between the obj and endobj keywords. An index table, {{also called the}} cross-reference table and marked with the xref keyword, follows the main body and gives the byte offset of each indirect object {{from the start of}} the file. This design allows for efficient random access to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (incremental update). Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects may also be located in special streams known as object streams. This technique reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for Tagged PDF.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of global (non-perturbative) gauge anomalies {{for a class}} of gauge groups are investigated. Intimately connected to branching rules and topological aspect of gauge groups, the results are applied {{to the study of}} unification gauge groups such as SO(10), SU(5), E 6, E 8 etc. Especially, we discuss extensively about the selection rule for <b>generation</b> <b>numbers</b> Nf + Nmf = even ≥ 4 in SO(10) and supersymmetric SO(10) unification theories as originally proposed by the author 1, where Nf and Nmf denote the <b>generation</b> <b>numbers</b> for ordinary fermions and mirror fermions respectively. This is due to the global gauge anomalies from some subgroups of SO(10) in a fundamental spinor representation such that the ill-defined ’large’ gauge transformations in the subgroup cannot be unwrapped in SO(10) in the quantum theory as we noted 1. A similar result related to left-right symmetric models is also given. PACS: 02. 20. +b, 02. 40. +m, 11. 15. -q. ...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 61 - 65. Randomness is {{a crucial}} resource for cryptography, and random number generators are critical building blocks of almost all cryptographic systems. Therefore, random <b>number</b> <b>generation</b> {{is one of the}} key parts of secure communication. Random <b>number</b> <b>generation</b> does not guarantee security. Problematic random <b>number</b> <b>generation</b> process may result in breaking the encrypted communication channel, because encryption keys are obtained by using random numbers. For computers and smart devices, <b>generation</b> of random <b>numbers</b> is done by operating systems. Applications which need random numbers for their operation request them from the operating system they are working on. Due to the importance of random <b>number</b> <b>generation,</b> this process should be analyzed deeply and cryptographically for different operating systems. From this perspective, we studied Android random <b>number</b> <b>generation</b> process by looking at the source codes and found that security of random <b>number</b> <b>generation</b> done by Android relies on the security of random <b>number</b> <b>generation</b> of Linux. Then we analyzed Android random number generator by modifying the kernel source code and applying some tests on its entropy estimator.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} topology on the structural and dynamic properties of dendrimers with different <b>generation</b> <b>numbers</b> and molecular weights is studied in solvents of varying solvent quality, and {{compared with the}} behaviour of linear polymer chains of similar molecular weights. Brownian dynamics simula-tions are used, with a coarse-grained bead-spring chain model for the dendrimer, and both intra-molecular hydrodynamic and excluded volume interactions incor-porated. The successive fine graining technique is applied to obtain parameter free predictions of properties {{as a function of}} solvent quality. In particular, it is shown that with a suitable definition of the solvent quality parameter, the swelling of dendrimers with increasing solvent quality can be collapsed on to a single master curve for molecules with the same topology. The swelling of den-drimers is found to cause a decrease in the translational diffusivity, and a shift in the characteristic maximum in intrinsic viscosity with molecular mass to higher <b>generation</b> <b>numbers.</b> Ratios of the radius of gyration to the hydrodynamic and viscometric radii converge to constant universal values for dendrimers with a fixed degree of branching...|$|R
