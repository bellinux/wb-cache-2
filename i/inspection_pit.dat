25|$|The works {{contained}} a single ‘road’, {{a piece of}} track over an <b>inspection</b> <b>pit</b> allowing work underneath the locomotive. A £10,000 grant from Darlington borough council also allowed {{the purchase of a}} five-tonne crane and four hydraulic jacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} shed {{was capable of}} holding four locomotives and held an <b>inspection</b> <b>pit.</b> Steam and smoke was carried away {{from the inside of}} the shed by a system of wooden troughs hanging suspended from the roof over the centre of the tracks and leading, sloping upwards, to wooden chimneys. The fumes would otherwise erode the iron roof supports.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{completion}} of infrastructure work, such as {{the replacement of the}} water tower at Dereham and the provision of an <b>inspection</b> <b>pit,</b> steam passenger services returned to the Dereham to Wymondham Abbey section on Sunday 30 April 2006. These were operated by Great Western Railway pannier tank number 9466 from the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The ownership of the section of railway line between Dereham and North Elmham, part of that originally authorised by the Norfolk Railway Extensions, Dereham, Wells and Blakeney Branch Act 1846, was passed to the Mid-Norfolk Railway in October 2001.|$|E

25|$|In 1987 the railway's owner Alexander Schwab died, and his executors {{took the}} {{decision}} to sell {{the assets of the}} Saltwood Miniature Railway in lots, and to close the line. Certain earthworks and sheds remained {{at the site of the}} railway, as well as other tangible reminders of the line including a deep locomotive <b>inspection</b> <b>pit,</b> a turntable pit, the main engine shed and erecting shop, and a lengthy, and elegant, brick tunnel; another survivor was the substantial locomotive air-raid shelter, designed to protect the engines from a direct hit by a German bomb. However, the track was all lifted, stations demolished, signals and other equipment disposed of, and the rolling stock relocated to a variety of new locations. The assorted buildings and the general route of the line, remained visible for more than a decade following closure. Subsequently the entire site was acquired by property developers, and a new housing estate was constructed, rendering all final traces of the line lost.|$|E
25|$|Three {{months after}} the Wests' assault trial, the couple {{committed}} their first known murder. The victim was a 19-year-old named Lynda Gough, with whom Fred and Rose became acquainted through a male lodger in early 1973. Gough regularly visited Cromwell Street, and {{is known to have}} engaged in affairs with two male lodgers. On 19 April, she moved into Cromwell Street, although on or about 20 April, other tenants were informed that she had been told to leave the household after she had hit one of their children. This story was repeated to the girl's mother when she contacted the Wests to enquire as to her daughter's whereabouts (although Rose had been wearing Lynda's clothing when she repeated this claim). When Lynda's dismembered body was found, her jaw was completely wrapped in both adhesive and surgical tape to silence her screams, and two small tubes had likely been inserted into her nasal cavities to facilitate breathing. Long sections of string and sections of knotted fabric were also discovered with her remains. Lynda had likely been suspended from holes carved into the wooden beams supporting the ceiling of the cellar Fred would later admit he had devised for the purpose of suspending his victims' bodies, and likely died of strangulation or suffocation. Her dismembered body, missing five cervical vertebrae bones in addition to her patellae and numerous phalange bones, was buried in an <b>inspection</b> <b>pit</b> beneath the garage.|$|E
2500|$|... c. 20 April: Lynda Gough, (19). The first sexually {{motivated}} {{killing the}} Wests {{are known to}} have committed together. Gough was a lodger at 25 Cromwell Street, and is known to have shared sex partners with Rose. Following her disappearance, Gough's mother called at Cromwell Street to enquire as to her daughter's whereabouts, only to note Rose had been wearing her daughter's clothes and slippers. She was informed Lynda had moved to find work in Weston-super-Mare. Her remains were buried in an <b>inspection</b> <b>pit</b> beneath the garage, which was later converted into a bathroom.|$|E
50|$|Two tracks {{have been}} laid east of the rail vehicle shed which are {{currently}} being used for vehicle storage. Tracks are also being laid in the rail vehicle shed {{as part of the}} construction of the shed's floor and <b>inspection</b> <b>pits.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the {{locomotive}} depot was closed in 1992, the society {{moved into the}} buildings which were protected as historical monuments. As a result, the museum has two roundhouses with 20 m turntables. In addition there are coaling and sanding facilities, water cranes, a working jack for <b>inspection</b> <b>pits</b> {{and a range of}} other equipment found in an operational depot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{workshop}} and fitting bays were each 183 by 18 metres in size, with four tracks and three <b>inspection</b> <b>pits.</b> For {{the handling of}} bogies under overhaul there were 24 short traverse tracks and pits. Two 25 tonne cranes were installed in the lifting bay, and two 15 tonne electric cranes were provided in the workshop bay.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{workshops}} much remains virtually unchanged since closure, with many items {{on display in}} the way of artifacts, and a leaflet to help identify them (although some items of equipment are so rare that the Visitors Guide admits that it has not been possible to identify them all). It is possible that the cast iron, fish-bellied rails {{on either side of the}} <b>inspection</b> <b>pit</b> form the oldest length of railway line in the world still in its original position. [...] Other items of particular interest, as indicated in the Visitors Guide, include a drill, chain bays, an old photograph, line tools, the forge and bellows, beam engine parts, a joiner's bench, and an oil tank.|$|E
2500|$|The {{appearance}} of Zermatt railway station is characterised by 1980s era alterations. [...] To protect passengers and rolling stock from avalanches, a massive concrete canopy was erected by 1989, and the canopy spans {{a total of}} six tracks. [...] Track 1, which is located on the western side of the station, is equipped with an <b>inspection</b> <b>pit,</b> and is not open to the public. [...] Here, the main task is the maintenance of the shuttle trains to and from Täsch. [...] Track 2 has been set up for the shuttle traffic to Täsch, and is used according to the Spanish solution, with both sides equipped with platforms to allow a rapid exchange of passengers. [...] Tracks 3 to 5 serve the regular traffic to Brig, and each has its own platform. [...] Track 6 serves mainly cargo traffic, and ends at the baggage hall of the station building. [...] It is shorter than the other tracks, but is also provided with a common platform with track 6.|$|E
50|$|A {{turntable}} {{was provided}} at Newmarket for turning locomotives {{and in the}} early 1880s the GER provided a timber engine shed and <b>inspection</b> <b>pit</b> at this location. The LNER installed a 60-foot turntable in the 1920s primarily for visiting locomotives on race day traffic rather than Newmarket's allocated shunting locomotive. The dilapidated shed was demolished during the 1930s although the <b>inspection</b> <b>pit,</b> turntable and water tower remained until closure.|$|E
50|$|In August 2006 the Museum {{dedicated}} the new Conservation and Restoration Center (CRC), {{phase one}} of the Railway History Center. The CRC {{is a place to}} perform collection care on large rail artifacts including locomotives, coaches, and freight cars. It features 8200 sq ft, two full length <b>inspection</b> <b>pits,</b> and is used to perform many functions once conducted in railroad backshops.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{reduction}} in steam traction and {{the implementation of the}} Beeching axe, in March 1964 the decision was taken to move the remaining steam locomotive allocation to the 1950s designed Southall MPD, and reconstruct Old Oak Common as a diesel depot. Within a year the majority of the GWR 1906 depot was demolished, with only [...] "The Factory" [...] repair shop, furthest western turntable and parts of the stores remaining. The main service building had 3 tracks, each holding two locos, with <b>inspection</b> <b>pits,</b> fuel supply points and a washing plant on the approach road. Some of the <b>inspection</b> <b>pits</b> in The Factory were also lengthened and deepened and jacks provided to allow for bogie and spring changing. It was the last of six big diesel depots built for the Western Region, the others being Margam TMD 1960, Bristol Bath Road depot 1960, Laira Traction Maintenance Depot, Plymouth, 1962, Landore TMD, Swansea, 1963 and Cardiff Canton TMD 1964.|$|R
50|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{automated}} locomotive servicing depot at the marshalling yard, {{to replace}} an existing depot at Strawberry Hill (which was converted into an electric multiple unit servicing depot. The shed was 475 x 125 ft with six roads and could accommodate 42 locomotives. There were <b>inspection</b> <b>pits</b> throughout and a 50-ton engine-hoist. There was also an electrically driven 65 ft turntable and an electrically operated coaling plant.|$|R

50|$|Maxton Depot, at grid {{reference}} , had two tracks, each capable of holding three trams. The left hand track had an <b>inspection</b> <b>pit.</b> All {{maintenance and repairs}} were done at this depot.|$|E
5000|$|In 1860, the GWR added a [...] Old Oak Common pattern 55 ft {{turntable}} shed, with 28 access tracks {{all with}} their own <b>inspection</b> <b>pits.</b> Sheds nos. 2 and 3 were added in the same pattern by 1875, with all turntables across all three sheds increased to 65 ft. But due to site access restrictions, sheds nos. 2 and 3 were not directly accessible from Wolverhampton Low Level.|$|R
25|$|In the {{workshop}} itself are two through-running lines (numbered 8 and 9) and line 10, a stub end. All lines have <b>inspection</b> <b>pits</b> and line 8 possesses a Hegenscheidt wheel lathe. This machine allows wheel turning whilst {{both sets of}} doors are closed. The wheelsets are turned in situ. High level access is provided on lines 9 and 10 for servicing of equipment boxes and pantographs. An automated washing machine is located on line 7.|$|R
50|$|Halfway stop is {{also the}} {{location}} of the engineering depot, with access for trams from both upper and lower sections. Engineers have depot facilities for inspection and maintenance of the trams, including <b>inspection</b> <b>pits.</b> Although there is no public access to the depot, some parts of both the depot and the control room can be viewed by passengers through internal glazing in the viewing area, whilst interchanging between upper and lower sections.|$|R

50|$|The GWR {{immediately}} {{made the}} CR/LNWR engine shed its divisional {{base for the}} new Oswestry locomotive division, allocating it code: OSW. In 1929, the GWR improved the facilities, adding electric lighting to the entire complex, extra <b>inspection</b> <b>pits,</b> and a GWR standard-pattern single-ramp coaling stage. A further improvement programme occurred in 1939, when the wooden roof was replaced with steel trusses, allowing the introduction of improved clearances, increased ventilation and additional glass shuttering.|$|R
50|$|In March 1988 tenders {{were called}} for the design, manufacture, {{installation}} and commissioning of a drop table. This drop table was fitted to No.4 road in No.2 shed, {{as part of this}} work No.3 road was removed along with the original drop pits on roads 2 to 5 along with the original <b>inspection</b> <b>pits</b> on roads 1 to 5. The pit on road 5 was replaced by a raised rail with depressed floor type.|$|R

50|$|An <b>inspection</b> <b>pit</b> {{and coal}} stage were {{provided}} in the early 1920s - probably primarily used by the local shunting locomotive, generally a GER 0-6-0T engine such as a GER Class R24 (LNER Class J67) or similar undertook these duties.|$|E
50|$|When {{the railway}} was reopened, it was envisaged {{that as the}} {{terminus}} of the line, Oxenhope would be the ideal place to base the locomotive department. To this end, the goods shed was extended with a two-road building including an <b>inspection</b> <b>pit.</b>|$|E
50|$|VTNZ {{currently}} has its testing station {{located in the}} grounds of the old rail yard. All evidence of the railway yard has been erased with exception of a loading bank, the stockyard platform and the remains of the locomotive <b>inspection</b> <b>pit</b> {{on the site of the}} old loco depot.|$|E
25|$|Many {{locomotives}} and freight {{and passenger}} cars are on display. Some have open cabs and compartments that visitors can climb in and walk through, including a mail car, railroad executives' passenger car (with dining room and sleeping / lounge areas), a boxcar, two cabooses, and a recreated DL station with ticket window. A steam locomotive with cutaway sections helps visitors understand steam power. Part {{of one of the}} 1865 roundhouse <b>inspection</b> <b>pits</b> uncovered in archaeological excavations is also preserved in situ, under glass.|$|R
50|$|Buckland Depot, at grid {{reference}} , had four tracks, each capable of holding five trams. The two centre tracks had <b>inspection</b> <b>pits,</b> but the depot was {{not suitable for}} maintenance and repairs, this work having {{to be done at}} the Maxton Depot. Although consideration was given to providing maintenance facilities at Buckland in 1919, the council was unable to negotiate the purchase of the necessary land to expand the depot. Buckland depot still stands, and is used as a car sales showroom.|$|R
