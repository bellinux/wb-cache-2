Tom {{waited until the}} crowd had dispersed, and the bustle was over; and then {{referred}} to a posted list of trains, and took counsel with porters. That done, he strolled away idly, stopping {{in the street and}} looking up it and down it, and lifting his hat off and putting it on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and exhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in one who had still to wait until the next train should come in, an hour and forty minutes hence.|$|E
60|$|Outside on the {{platform}} a few people lounged, waiting {{the arrival of the}} <b>expected</b> <b>train.</b> Among them was one whose bulky frame and firm strongly-lined countenance spoke of much power to dare and do. He was considerably above the middle height and somewhere about middle age. His costume was of that quiet unobtrusive kind which seems to court retirement, and the sharp glance of his eyes seemed to possess something of the gimblet in their penetrating power. This was no less a personage than Mr Sharp, the inspector of police on the Grand National Trunk Railway. Mr Inspector Sharp had evidently an eye for the beautiful, for he stood at the farther extremity of {{the platform}} gazing in rapt attention at the sun, which just then was setting in a flood of golden light. But Mr Sharp had also a peculiar faculty for observing several things at once. Indeed, some of his friends, referring to this, were wont to remark that he was a perfect Argus, with eyes in his elbows and calves and back of his head. It would seem, indeed, that this, or something like it, must really have been the case, for he not only observed and enjoyed the sunset but also paid particular attention to the conversation of two men who stood not far from him, {{and at the same time}} was cognisant of the fact that behind him, a couple of hundred yards or more up the line, a goods engine was engaged in shunting trucks.|$|E

The 2012 plans removed the separate power car maintenance shed, removed some cleaning facilities, {{and reduced the}} siding layout to a capacity of 20 five car (half train) sets due to changes in <b>expected</b> <b>train</b> timetabling, reducing the site's overall area. The 2013 plans re-instated a bio-cleaning pit, extended the train wash, and added an additional mainline track connection south of the main maintenance shed.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} made {{available}} online with kind {{permission of the}} publisher. Ground vibration boom is a physical phenomenon associated with {{a dramatic increase in}} railway-generated ground vibrations that can occur when train speeds exceed the velocity of Rayleigh waves in the supporting ground. The present paper describes the results of the preliminary assessment of the proposed HS 2 routes {{from the point of view}} of possible occurrence of ground vibration boom. The analysis is based on the available geological information about the soil composition along the proposed HS 2 routes and on the <b>expected</b> <b>train</b> speeds, including areas of train acceleration and deceleration between railway terminals. Rayleigh wave velocities have been calculated for all sites along the routes using the geological data and compared with the <b>expected</b> <b>train</b> speeds at the relevant locations. Using this method, several sensitive locations have been identified where ground vibration boom is likely to occur. The expected levels of ground vibration boom for some sites have been estimated...|$|E

40|$|Three tracks within Amsterdam Central Station (CS) {{were not}} covered by roof structure. This was rather uncomfortable for passengers, and {{therefore}} it was decided, when the existing roof structures were restored, to build an intermediate roof over the three uncovered tracks. The Intermediate Roof of Amsterdam CS closes {{the gap between the}} existing roof structures to cover all existing tracks. Its design was highly influenced by the architectural requirements imposed by the historic surroundings and by the complex erection method in a railway station under operation. The Intermediate Roof is a modern, transparent structure with which Amsterdam CS is ready for the <b>expected</b> <b>train</b> traffic in the 21 st century...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} initially to present a basic modeling of the railway traction system. This model includes the basic technologies used today. The voltage dependencies of the maximal possible power consumption as well as the maximal velocity of the common Rc-locomotives are included. The latter is very crucial for the studies of time table sensitivity, which is of our immediate interest. Moreover, a method is presented that estimates the <b>expected</b> <b>train</b> delay time for a given feeding technology. The reference timetable assumes the same train and surrounding conditions, but no voltage drops. In the numerical example where the developed model is applied to a realistic test system, a set of possible amounts of railway traffic are treated as uncertainties. Mainly, the contributions of this paper are three: compiling and connecting already accepted models, the development of a method for numerical calculations using this model compilation, and an example to apply this model on.

However, training may not lead to improved work performance if training transfer does not occur. The lack of training transfer in practice has long been considered as a critical problem. Also, previous theoretical models of training transfer cannot fully explain this phenomenon. As an attempt to solve the training transfer problem, this paper provides a literature review on training transfer and proposes a conceptual model grounded on the Theory of Planned Behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Distance to a {{sound source}} can be {{accurately}} estimated solely from auditory information. With a sound source {{such as a}} train that is passing by at a relatively large distance, the most important auditory information for the listener for estimating its distance consists of {{the intensity of the}} sound, spectral changes in the sound caused by air absorption, and the motion-induced rate of change of intensity. However, these cues are relative because prior information/experience of the sound source-its source power, its spectrum and the typical speed at which it moves-is required for such distance estimates. This paper describes two listening experiments that allow investigation of further prior contextual information taken into account by listeners-viz., whether they are indoors or outdoors. Asked to estimate the distance to the track of a railway, it is shown that listeners assessing sounds heard inside the dwelling based their distance estimates on the <b>expected</b> <b>train</b> passby sound level outdoors rather than on the passby sound level actually experienced indoors. This form of perceptual constancy may have consequences for the assessment of annoyance caused by railway noise. Full Tex...|$|E

It also already had its asbestos lagging removed, which is very expensive to remove for environmental and safety reasons. Finally, 261's relatively short 10 year service life meant that the engine's boiler is more pristine, meaning it would take less work to rebuild the engine.|$|R

The authors investigate the determinants of both employer-arranged training and individually organized training. The data relate to training spells experienced by 2, 000 British workers in 1984 - 87, when the propensity to train was rising rapidly. Both recent <b>training</b> and future <b>expected</b> <b>training</b> are related {{to a wide range}} of personal and job characteristics, including attitudes and incomes. Low income is associated with the failure to undertake training, suggestive of market failure in selection.

40|$|Recently, neural {{models have}} been {{proposed}} for headline generation by learning to map documents to headlines with recurrent neural networks. Nevertheless, as traditional neural network utilizes maximum likelihood estimation for parameter optimization, it essentially constrains the <b>expected</b> <b>training</b> objective within word level rather than sentence level. Moreover, the performance of model prediction significantly relies on training data distribution. To overcome these drawbacks, we employ minimum risk training strategy in this paper, which directly optimizes model parameters in sentence level with respect to evaluation metrics and leads to significant improvements for headline generation. Experiment results show that our models outperforms state-of-the-art systems on both English and Chinese headline generation tasks...|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} {{is the first to}} look at the effect of {{repeated}} whole blood donation on endurance capacity and key hematological parameters for oxygen transport, among which is hemoglobin mass. We found that maximal, but not submaximal, endurance capacity was altered after blood donation in moderately trained people and that the <b>expected</b> <b>training</b> effects were lower when repeating blood donations. Those alterations are probably partially due to reductions in the iron status, red blood cells, and hemoglobin mass. Measures to counteract the alterations in hematological parameters should be developed to minimize alterations in endurance capacity and thereby to attract more athletes to become donors. Finally, athletes constitute a very healthy potential donor population and should consider becoming plasma donors as there also is an increased need for plasma worldwide and plasma donation does not affect their hemoglobin levels at all.|$|R
