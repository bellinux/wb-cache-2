5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
5|$|Public {{debate about}} {{constructing}} a railway from Lillesand {{up the valley}} following the river Tovdalselva started in the mid-1880s. At the time, lumber was being floated down the river, but low levels of water was causing irregular operations and the piling of lumber in Flaksvand. In 1889, the government for received an application for a concession. Costs were estimated at NOK462,000 and the line {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway on 22 June 1891. At the same time, the line received a state funding of NOK200,000. Half of this was share capital, the other half was a subsidy. Aust-Agder County Municipality also gave a grant of NOK20,000, and bought shares <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount.</b> Of the share capital of NOK417,350, NOK850 was from private investors and the rest from municipalities. The largest owner was Lillesand Municipality, who bought shares for NOK181,000. Concession was granted by royal resolution on 31 August 1892, and lasted 30 years from the date of the opening of the railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

5|$|The year's {{following}} the Carling O'Keefe era {{were marked by}} increasingly short ownership stints. Canadian businessman Harry Ornest bought the team off Carling O'Keefe for $5 million {{at the end of}} 1988 and then sold to the trio of McNall (60%), Candy (20%), and Gretzky (20%) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> in 1991. Of the three, Candy is best remembered for his emotional investment in the team and a team player award continues in his honour. Given McNall's indictment and Candy's early death, the era was tumultuous and the last in which the club regularly made front page headlines. The now money-losing team was sold to the Labatt Brewing Company through its TSN unit in 1994 for $4.5 million. At the time, Labatt also owned the Toronto Blue Jays. In 1995, Labatt was acquired by Interbrew; The Interbrew years saw two championships but also the worst Argo attendance of the modern era. Interbrew soon lost interest in sports ownership and the team was sold again at the end of 1999 to New York businessman Sherwood Schwarz.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five {{cents for}} {{no more than a few}} minutes of {{entertainment}} was hardly cheap diversion. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount,</b> one could purchase a ticket to a major vaudeville theater; when America's first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.|$|E

25|$|Powder {{is another}} {{significant}} cost of reloading, and one {{over which the}} handloader has significant control. In addition to the obvious step of using a minimum charge, rather than a full power one, significant cost savings may be obtained through careful powder choice. Given the same bullet and cartridge, a faster burning powder will generally use a smaller charge of powder than required with a slower powder. For example, a 44 Magnum firing a 240-grain lead semi-wadcutter could be loaded with either Accurate Arms #2, a very fast pistol powder, or #9, a very slow pistol powder. When using the minimum loads, 9.0 grains (0.58 g) of AA #2 yield a velocity of 1126ft/s (343m/s), and 19.5 grains (1.26 g) of #9 yield 1364ft/s (416m/s). <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of powder, AA #2 can produce approximately twice as many rounds, yet both powders cost the same per weight.|$|E
