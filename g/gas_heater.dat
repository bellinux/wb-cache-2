500|$|On February 14, 1950, Ruth, who was {{pregnant}} with their second child, came {{too close to the}} <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> in their Lower East Side apartment, and her nightgown caught on fire. Greenglass extinguished the blaze, but she suffered severe burns. She was taken to Gouverneur Hospital for skin grafts. He suffered second degree burns to his right hand. He was already aware that the UK and US intelligence agencies had discovered that a Los Alamos theoretical physicist, Klaus Fuchs, had spied for the USSR during the war. Through Fuchs' confession, they found that one of his American contacts had been a man named Harry Gold from Brooklyn, New York. [...] Gold had passed Fuchs' information on to a Soviet agent, performing the role of courier, and Anatoli Yakovlev would then pass the information on to his controllers in the USSR. Through Gold, the FBI's trail led to Greenglass and the Rosenbergs, who had allegedly also used Gold as a courier. When Fuchs was first captured, Julius allegedly gave the Greenglasses $5,000 to finance an escape to Mexico. Instead, they went to the Catskills and used the money to seek legal advice.|$|E
50|$|Although oil heaters {{are more}} {{expensive}} to run and provide far less spatial heating than <b>gas</b> <b>heaters,</b> they are still commonly used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because <b>gas</b> <b>heaters,</b> especially when unflued, are not suitable for bedroom use - <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced oxygen, and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered heaters, such as oil heaters and fan heaters, as the only alternative.|$|R
40|$|There are long-standing {{concerns}} about {{adverse effects of}} gas appliances on respiratory health. However, the potential adverse effect of low-NOx (nitrogen oxide) unflued <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> on children’s health has not been assessed. Our goal was to compare the respiratory health effects and air quality consequences of exposure to low-NOx unflued <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> with exposure to non–indoor-air-emitting flued <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> in school classrooms. We conducted a double-blind, cluster-randomized, crossover study in 400 primary school students attending 22 schools in New South Wales, Australia. Children measured their lung function and recorded symptoms and medication use twice daily. Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and formaldehyde concentrations were measured in classrooms using passive diffusion badges. NO₂ concentrations were, on average, 1. 8 times higher [95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 6 – 2. 1] and formaldehyde concentrations were, on average, 9. 4 ppb higher (95 % CI, 5. 7 – 13. 1) during exposure to unflued gas versus flued <b>gas</b> <b>heaters.</b> Exposure to the unflued <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> was associated with increased cough reported in the evening [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 16; 95 % CI, 1. 01 – 1. 34] and wheeze reported in the morning (OR = 1. 38; 95 % CI, 1. 04 – 1. 83). The association with wheeze was greater in atopic subjects. There {{was no evidence of}} an adverse effect on lung function. We conclude that classroom exposure to low-NOx unflued <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> causes increased respiratory symptoms, particularly in atopic children, but is not associated with significant decrements in lung function. It is important to seek alternative sources of heating that do not have adverse effects on health...|$|R

50|$|Indoor {{household}} <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> can be broadly categorized {{in one of}} two ways: flued or non-flued, or vented and unvented.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{dedicated}} low emission <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> do {{not require}} a flue system. Furthermore, {{with the introduction of}} oxygen depletion sensors and thermostatic controls, they do not place critical reliance on ventilation as had been the case. These heaters can be positioned more conveniently and centralised to affect optimum warm air distribution. By definition unflued low NOx <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> are 100% efficient as all heat energy released from the flame is converted to useful heat.|$|R
40|$|Natural gas is {{transferred}} in high pressure by piping system from refiners to city gate stations. For public consumption the gas pressure is reduced in gas pressure reducing stations. The pressure is reduced in regulators {{and leads to}} a sudden drop of temperature and consequently the formation of gas hydrates. Preventing hydrate formation, natural gas is heated by passing through water bath <b>gas</b> <b>heaters.</b> In this study, the thermodynamic efficiencies of water bath <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> were conducted. The effect of air-fuel ratio and the flow rate of the fuel on the efficiency of this instrument were studied. Also, the variations of efficiencies versus flame temperature have been considered and the optimum points in each state were obtained. From these comparisons, {{it can be concluded}} that, first law efficiency is suitable meanwhile second law efficiency is very low. The main reason of low second law efficiency is that high availability generation by fuel causes low enhancement in the availability of natural <b>gas,</b> passed through <b>heaters.</b> Also, one dimensional simulation has been employed to compute temperature distribution numerically in whole of a gas pressure reducing station with water bath <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> and with shell and tube heaters (inline heaters). Comparison between these two stations show that the gas pressure reducing station with inline heaters is more appropriate than the one with water bath <b>gas</b> <b>heaters.</b> Finally, water bath <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> and inline heaters have been studied economically by utilizing energy flow optimization model, EFOM. It is shown that the inline heaters have less cost of heat generation and they are more economical...|$|R

40|$|The {{swimming}} pool at NIT Rourkela, presently, has no heating system {{to heat the}} pool water during winters. Therefore, it is rendered unused during winters. The focus of this project is on designing an efficient and economically viable system to heat the {{swimming pool}}. Temperatures of pool water and air above the surface of pool water were recorded {{for the month of}} November (2010). Using this data, losses associated with the pool were calculated and were found to agree completely with the literature data. Three systems were proposed based on: heat pumps, natural <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> and solar based water heating system. A design has been proposed for solar based water heating system. Many models of heat pumps were considered and a detailed cost analysis was made. For natural <b>gas</b> <b>heaters,</b> different models were considered and cost analysis was carried out. Annual operating cost of heat pumps and natural <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> were compared and natural <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> were found to be about 1. 8 - 3 times costlier than heat pumps.
