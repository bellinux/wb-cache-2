50|$|<b>Focus</b> <b>on</b> form (FonF) is an {{approach}} to language education in which learners are {{made aware of the}} grammatical form of language features that they are already able to use communicatively.

For a teaching intervention to qualify as <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> form and not as <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> forms, the learner must be aware of the meaning and use of the language features before the form is brought to their attention. <b>Focus</b> <b>on</b> form was proposed by Michael Long in 1988.|$|R

30|$|Considering the Hair et al. (2010) classification, Pearson’s {{correlation}} between the four factors indicated coefficients that can be classified as moderate (between the <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the problem and <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> social support factors and between the <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> religious coping and the <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> emotion factors) and low (all other two factor combinations). This indicates the existence of different styles of coping with difficult situations in the academic environment and also a composition among these styles that indicates the pairing of <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> social support with <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the problem and <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> emotion with <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> religious coping.
