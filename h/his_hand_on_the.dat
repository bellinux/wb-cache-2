5|$|Georges Dumézil {{theorized that}} Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of {{his foot on the}} wolf's lower jaw and <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wolf's upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, {{in tandem}} with his work at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E

5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's {{daughter}} at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E
5|$|At that time, Antoine had {{a student}} named Martin Jeanfils, an {{employee}} at the Corbeau coal. A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The judgment was adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E

This was a wet summer and most of the bowling in the series was done by spinners, but Trueman still managed 5–31 in the first Test at Edgbaston.

While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb.

He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face staring out malevolently. He cuts <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face.|$|E
25|$|There {{are limits}} {{placed on the}} steps a player may take without dribbling, which {{commonly}} results in an infraction known as traveling. Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling. A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name double dribble. Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the ball; doing so is known as carrying the ball. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return {{the ball to the}} backcourt and be the first to touch it. A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.|$|E

In early 1994, he {{played the role of}} Mike Brady in a musical version of The Brady Bunch, directed by fellow Second City member Bruce Pirrie. In the production, Mochrie plays the character as caffeine-fuelled, jittery, and neurotic, an exaggeration of the Mike Brady television character, who often had a coffee in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. Shortly before his move to the US version of Whose Line in 1998, Mochrie starred in Supertown Challenge as the host of game shows, which the show spoofed.

25|$|Ford usually {{gave his}} actors little {{explicit}} direction, although on occasion he would casually {{walk through a}} scene himself, and actors were expected to note every subtle action or mannerism; if they did not, Ford would make them repeat the scene until they got it right, and he would often berate and belittle those who failed to achieve his desired performance. On The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Ford ran through a scene with Edmond O'Brien and ended by drooping his hand over a railing. O'Brien noticed this but deliberately ignored it, placing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railing instead; Ford would not explicitly correct him and he reportedly made O'Brien play the scene forty-two times before the actor relented and did it Ford's way.|$|E
