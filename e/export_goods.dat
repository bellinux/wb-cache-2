5|$|Before the Suez Canal {{was opened}} in 1869, the Indonesian {{archipelago}} was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa. From the Suez Canal, {{the route to}} Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait. Due to its natural harbour with relatively deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the Atjeh Associate. At first, the harbour {{was intended as a}} coal station for the Dutch navy, but later also served merchant vessels and for the transfer of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> from northern Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of <b>export</b> <b>goods.</b> This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to diversify the economy and make it less {{dependent}} on <b>export</b> <b>goods,</b> the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by {{the negative effects of}} the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own. Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed {{as one of the best}} places to retire to in the world, with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index. This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. In 2016, Malaysia ranked the fifth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire. Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> were tea, rice, and matches. At first, {{the export}} tea came from Kyoto, but tea produced in western Japan was gradually promoted, and structures for its export came into place. Rice was exported from Kobe {{in sufficient quantity}} to become the standard rice in London's grain market. Full-scale match manufacturing in Kobe {{began in the late}} 1870s, at which point those matches also started being exported. The value of match exports from the Port of Kobe increased rapidly beginning in the late 1880s, increasing until they comprised more than nine-tenths of Japan's total match exports. These exports were directed primarily at China at first, but over time expanded to reach Australia, Europe, and America.|$|E

25|$|MEFO was a dummy {{company that}} was formed with {{relatively}} small amounts of capital {{that was used to}} finance German rearmament off the books. It issued bills without backing by its own resources but which were guaranteed redeemable at 1:1 for Reichsmarks for five years by the government. The MEFO bills amounts were considered a state secret and were an important element in the impression that Hitlerian economics was a success. This company essentially created a large amount of Reichsmarks off the books, inflating the currency in secret. Payment was about to come due giving Hitler the option of shifting the German economy to <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> to pay the bills or going to war and paying the debts off from looting profits extracted from conquered states.|$|E
25|$|The port prospered {{with trade}} from {{immediately}} after its opening. The initial trade consisted of exports supplied by Japanese merchants to foreign ones, and imports sold from foreign merchants to Japanese ones. This was because foreigners {{were not allowed}} to buy <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> or sell their own imports outside the settlement, while Japanese merchants lacked the know-how to conduct business directly with businessmen overseas. Japanese merchants trying to sell goods to foreigners or buy goods from them carried out their negotiations through intermediaries, either Japanese clerks or Chinese baiben. As many of the foreign merchants were high-handed and forceful in their negotiations, and the Japanese were unaccustomed to trading with foreign countries and unfamiliar with the state of the world outside Japan, Japanese merchants were frequently manipulated into buying and selling goods at disadvantageous prices.|$|E
25|$|Among black-figure Attic vases, the Panathenaic prize amphoras play {{a special}} role. After 566 BC—when the Panathenaic {{celebrations}} were introduced or reorganized—they were {{the prize for}} the winners of sport competitions and were filled with olive oil, one of the city's main <b>export</b> <b>goods.</b> On the front they routinely bore {{the image of the}} goddess Athena standing between two pillars on which roosters perched; on the back there was a sports scene. The shape was always the same and was only modified slightly over the long period of its production. The belly amphora was, as its name suggests, originally especially bulbous, with a short neck and a long, narrow foot. Around 530 BC the necks become shorter and the body somewhat narrower. Around 400 BC the vase shoulders were considerably reduced in width and the curve of the vase body looked constricted. After 366 BC the vases were again more elegant and become even narrower.|$|E

25|$|Israel {{also took}} {{a series of steps}} to evade the embargo and clandestinely trade with the Arab world. Front {{companies}} in third countries were set up, which imported goods, then re-exported them to Arab countries with false labels and certificates of origin. In other cases, foreign companies would purchase Israeli technology and materials, use them to assemble completed products, and export them to Arab countries while concealing this fact from their customers. Arrangements with American companies were worked out where the American companies would buy goods from Israeli affiliates and export them as American-made goods. Israeli ships were re-flagged as ships of other nations and provided with faked bills of landing so they could directly <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> to the Arab and Muslim world. Greece and Cyprus were particularly popular hubs for smuggling Israeli goods into the Arab world due to their location, multilateral economic connections, large merchant fleets, and Cyprus' corporate and bank secrecy laws.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, transportation from the US east coast into the mainland was difficult. Ships were the fastest vehicles at the time, as trains and automobiles were still being developed. In order to facilitate shipping throughout the country's interior, numerous canals were constructed between internal bodies of water in the 1800s. One of the most significant canals of this era was the Erie Canal, built to link the Midwest to the Port of New York, a significant seaport during that time. The completion of the canal enhanced the development of the American West, allowing settlers to travel west, send goods to markets in frontier cities, and <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> via the Hudson River and New York City. The completion of the canal made New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation, surpassing the Port of Philadelphia and ports in Massachusetts. After the completion of the Erie Canal, smaller canals were built to connect it with the new system. The Champlain Canal was built to connect the Hudson River near Troy to the southern end of Lake Champlain. This canal allowed boaters to travel from the St. Lawrence Seaway, and then British cities such as Montreal to the Hudson River and New York City. Another major canal was the Oswego Canal, which connected the Erie Canal to Oswego and Lake Ontario, and could be used to bypass Niagara Falls. The Cayuga-Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake. Farther south, the Delaware and Hudson Canal was built between the Delaware River at Honesdale, Pennsylvania, and the Hudson River at Kingston, New York. This canal enabled the transportation of coal, and later other goods as well, between the Delaware and Hudson River watersheds. The combination of these canals made the Hudson River one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} also established the IAPI {{to control the}} foreign trade in export commodities. Perón erected a system of almost complete protection against imports, largely cutting off Argentina from the international market. In 1947, he announced his first Five-Year Plan based on growth of nationalized industries. Protectionism also created a domestically oriented industry with high production costs, incapable of competing in international markets. At the same time, output of beef and grain, the country's main <b>export</b> <b>goods,</b> stagnated.|$|E
