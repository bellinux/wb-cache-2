50|$|The driving {{impedance}} of {{the antenna}} {{is equal to}} the characteristic impedance of the wire with respect to ground, somewhere between 400 and 800 ohms, depending on the height of the wire. Typically a length of 50-ohm or 75-ohm coaxial cable would be used for connecting the receiver to the antenna endpoint. A matching transformer should be inserted between any such low-impedance transmission line and the higher 470-ohm impedance of the antenna. A transformer with a turns ratio of 3:1 would provide an <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation</b> of 9:1, which will match the antenna to a 50-ohm transmission line. A transformer with a turns ratio of 5:2 would provide an <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation</b> of 6.25:1, which will match the antenna to a 75-ohm transmission line. Alternatively, a parallel-wire transmission line (twin lead) of 600 ohms makes a fairly good match to the antenna.|$|E

In order to study the performances of such structures, we perform numerical simulations of the surface impedance of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d (YBCO) thin films grown over Silicon (Si) substrates. We find that it can significantly differ from the value given by bulk superconductors Zs=(im 0 w / s) 1 / 2, where s is the complex conductivity.

A center conductor of 1 cm diameter placed in the standard vacuum pipe forms a 125 Omega coaxial line. If a nonstandard vacuum tank is inserted one observes reflection and transmission coefficients. To save the laborious <b>impedance</b> <b>transformations</b> in the frequency domain the reflected and transmitted waveforms are photographed in the time domain.

50|$|The Hairpin tuner (top right) has {{the same}} circuit, but uses a hairpin (transmission line) inductor. Moving the taps along the hairpin allows {{continuous}} adjustment of the <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation,</b> which is difficult with a solenoid coil. It is useful for very short wavelengths from about 10 meters to 70 cm (frequencies about 30 MHz to 430 MHz) where the solenoid inductor would have too few turns to allow fine adjustment. These tuners typically operate over at most a 2:1 frequency range.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the narrow}} band tuners, the L-network {{has the lowest}} loss, partly because it has the fewest components, but mainly because it {{necessarily}} operates at the lowest [...] possible for a given <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation.</b> With the L-network, the loaded [...] is not adjustable, but is fixed midway between the source and load impedances. Since most of the loss in practical tuners {{will be in the}} coil, choosing either the low-pass or high-pass network may reduce the loss somewhat. The L-network using only capacitors will have the lowest loss, but this network only works where the load impedance is very inductive, as occurs with a small loop antenna or a straight-wire antenna that is between a quarter and a half wave long. Note, however, that problematic straight-wire antennas are typically too short, rather than too long.|$|E

The microwave measurements, performed with a resonant cavity technique at two distinct frequencies (24 and 48 GHz), show anomalies both in the temperature and in the frequency dependences. By properly taking into account a relevant complex substrate contribution, with an important role played by the finite thickness effect, the whole set of data finds a satisfactory explanation in terms of standard <b>impedance</b> <b>transformations.</b> Using independent measurements at a single temperature, it is possible to extract the temperature dependence of the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -delta bulk surface impedance, which shows the expected frequency and temperature behaviours...|$|R
40|$|This letter {{presents}} an improved Doherty power amplifier (DPA) for high-efficiency and wideband operations. To achieve the <b>impedance</b> <b>transformations</b> {{both in the}} low power region and at saturation, a design approach is proposed to determine the desired minimum phase delays of the carrier and peaking output matching networks, which can simplify the load modulation network of the DPA and extend the bandwidth. For verification, a 1. 6 - 2. 2 GHz asymmetric DPA was designed and measured. The designed DPA can deliver an efficiency of 51 %- 55 % at 10 dB back-off power over the whole band. For a 20 MHz LTE signal, an average efficiency of higher than 50 % can be achieved at 36 dBm average output power with the linearity of - 48 dBc after linearization across the band...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{interpretations of the}} Polarizable Vacuum (PV). One is the {{variable}} speed of light (VSL) approach, that {{has been shown to}} be isomorphic to General Relativity (GR) within experimental limits. However, another interpretation is representative of flat geometry, in which intervals of time and distance are measured in local inertial reference frames where the speed of light remains constant. The Flat PV approach leads to variable <b>impedance</b> <b>transformations,</b> governed by the spectral energy content of the Quantum Vacuum’s Electromagnetic (EM) Zero-Point Field (ZPF). The EM ZPF consists of photons. An unlimited number of photons may occupy the same quantum state at an arbitrary set of coordinates. Therefore, the spectral energy of the ZPF may be varied smoothly, represented by a superposition of EM waves with a large number of photons per cubic wavelength. Utilizing the Flat PV representation, a family of frequency dependent solutions of Poisson’s equation are derived, that may be applied as tools for engineering the PV space-time metric, within the GR representation...|$|R
50|$|Solid-state power {{amplifiers}} operating from 1 - 30 MHz typically use {{one or more}} wideband transformers wound on ferrite cores. MOSFETs and bipolar junction transistors are designed to operate into a low impedance, so the transformer primary typically has a single turn, while the 50 Ohm secondary will have 2 to 4 turns. This feedline system design {{has the advantage of}} reducing the retuning required when the operating frequency is changed. A similar design can match an antenna to a transmission line; For example, many TV antennas have a 300 Ohm impedance and feed the signal to the TV via a 75 Ohm coaxial line. A small ferrite core transformer makes the broad band <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation.</b> This transformer does not need, nor is it capable of adjustment. For receive-only use in a TV the small SWR variation with frequency is not a major problem.|$|E

5000|$|The {{number of}} {{equivalent}} circuits that a linear network {{can be transformed}} into is unbounded. Even in the most trivial cases {{this can be seen}} to be true, for instance, by asking how many different combinations of resistors in parallel are equivalent to a given combined resistor. The number of series and parallel combinations that can be formed grows exponentially with the number of resistors, n. For large n the size of the set has been found by numerical techniques to be approximately 2.53n and analytically strict bounds are given by a Farey sequence of Fibonacci numbers.

40|$|The {{following}} note {{describes how}} maximum {{power can be}} delivered from the Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) output to the FinRF input of a LMX 243 x frequency synthesizer by means of performing a single element match. Maximum power transfer is achieved by designing a matching network that transforms the FinRF input (load) impedance to an impedance that {{is equivalent to the}} VCO output (source) impedance. In most applications, the VCO has an output impedance equivalent to 50 Ω. Furthermore, the trace impedance of the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is typically designed to be 50 Ω. This means that the matching network should be designed to transform the FinRF input impedance to 50 Ω.

A novel on-chip <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation</b> and power-combining technique, the distributed active transformer (DAT) is introduced. It overcomes the fundamental difficulties presented by silicon {{technology in the}} design of integrated rf power amplifiers. This technique efficiently combines several low-voltage push-pull amplifiers and simultaneously performs an <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation</b> to produce a larger output power while maintaining a [ [...] . ] match. It also uses virtual ac grounds and magnetic couplings extensively to eliminate the need for any off-chip component, such as tuned bonding wires or external inductors. Furthermore, it desensitizes the operation of the amplifier to the inductance of bonding wires making the design more repeatable.

40|$|A highly {{selective}} <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation</b> filtering technique suitable for tunable selective RF receivers is proposed in this paper. To achieve blocker rejection comparable to SAW filters, {{we use a}} two stage architecture based on a low noise trans-conductance amplifier (LNTA). The filter rejection is captured by a linear periodically varying (LPV) model that includes band limitation by the LNTA output impedance and the related parasitic capacitances of the <b>impedance</b> <b>transformation</b> circuit.
