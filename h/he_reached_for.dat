5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E

25|$|On January 16, 1961, Mantle {{became the}} highest-paid player in {{baseball}} by signing a $75,000 ($ today) contract. DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg, and Ted Williams, {{who had just}} retired, had been paid over $100,000 in a season, and Ruth had a peak salary of $80,000. Mantle became the highest-paid active player of his time. Mantle's top salary was $100,000, which <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the 1963 season.

Playing against Middlesex at Lord's, he fell off a chair in the dressing-room as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his clothes and broke his wrist, missing the remainder of the summer of 1921. His benefit match in 1922 against Kent at Headingley, Leeds raised £1,891 and he hit the winning runs, after scoring 20 of the 24 required to win, to secure victory by ten wickets. He suffered from sciatica {{in the latter part of}} his career, and he played his last match for Yorkshire in 1927.|$|E
500|$|The name {{tantalum}} {{was derived}} from the name of the mythological Tantalus, the father of Niobe in Greek mythology.

(If he bent to drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp.)

According to a {{newspaper}} account, [...] "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up {{what looked like a}} Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low.

One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal.

2500|$|The Slater-Morrill Shoe Company factory {{was located}} on Pearl Street in Braintree, Massachusetts. On April 15, 1920, {{two men were}} robbed and killed while {{transporting}} the company's payroll in two large steel boxes to the main factory. One of them, Alessandro Berardelli—a security guard—was shot four times as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his hip-holstered [...]38-caliber, Harrington & Richardson revolver; his gun was not recovered from the scene. The other man, Frederick Parmenter—a paymaster who was unarmed—was shot twice: once {{in the chest and}} a second time, fatally, in the back as he attempted to flee. The robbers seized the payroll boxes and escaped in a stolen dark blue Buick that sped up and was carrying several other men.

2500|$|Tipu was {{commonly}} known as the Tiger of Mysore and adopted this animal as the symbol (bubri/ babri) of his rule. It is said that Tipu Sultan was hunting in the forest with a French friend. He {{came face to face with}} a tiger. His gun did not work, and his dagger fell on the ground as the tiger jumped on him. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the dagger, picked it up, and killed the tiger with it. That earned him the name [...] "the Tiger of Mysore". He even had French engineers build a mechanical tiger for his palace. The device, known as Tipu's Tiger, is on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Not only did Tipu place relics of tigers around his palace and domain, but also had the emblem of a tiger on his banners and some arms and weapons. Sometimes this tiger was very ornate and had inscriptions within the drawing, alluding to Tipu's faith. Historian Alexander Beatson reported that [...] "in his palace was found a great variety of curious swords, daggers, fusils, pistols, and blunderbusses; some were of exquisite workmanship, mounted with gold, or silver, and beautifully inlaid and ornamented with tigers' heads and stripes, or with Persian and Arabic verses".|$|E

2500|$|At 6 pm {{a boy in}} {{the watch}} tower at Fort Douglas saw the party of mounted Métis and gave the alarm. Semple soon arrived, {{observed}} them with his spy glass and quickly assembled a party of 20 colonists and Baymen, stating they should go and meet with the Métis and ascertain their intentions. Semple’s men are armed, but Semple gave orders {{that no one was}} to shoot unless attacked. However, other witnesses testified that the Baymen bragged they would “have the Métis’ provisions or their lives.” Several Métis entered Lot #3 of the colony to obtain information from the people there. Several colonists then fled towards Fort Douglas for protection. Semple departed Fort Douglas, heading along the road towards the colony and immediately observed the Métis party increase in number. These re-enforcements were either members of the advance party returning from Frog Plain or the party returning from scouting the colony. Seeing the Métis force swell, {{while at the same time}} seeing the fleeing colonists, Semple sent John Bourke back to Fort Douglas to bring up a piece of artillery and to dispatch reinforcements to protect the settlers. Semple halted and waited for Bourke and his cannon, but Bourke was delayed and Semple continued towards the Métis. Half a mile from Fort Douglas, Lieutenant Holte’s gun discharged accidentally. Semple was “very much displeased” and scolded him, telling him to be more careful and reiterated that no one should shoot unless fired on. The Canadians and Métis, now numbering around 60 rode towards Semple’s party, seeing this, Semple and his men took several steps backward and began to spread out. When the two parties were within gunshot range of each other, the Métis spread into a half-circle in front of Semple’s men. A French-Canadian clerk named François-Firmin Boucher approached Semple. At the same time Bourke departed Fort Douglas with a cannon and 8 or 9 men. Boucher and Semple exchanged some words and Semple reached for the reins of Boucher’s horse, or, according to some accounts, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> Boucher’s gun, apparently in an attempt to arrest him. Several shots were immediately fired and Lieutenant Holte and Governor Semple were the first to fall. The Métis dismounted and began firing from behind their horses. The remaining Baymen and settlers rushed towards Semple to give him aid, and being thus concentrated together, were cut down in short order. John Pritchard surrendered and was protected from the Métis by Boucher, who recognized him. Boucher received some blows and threats from the Métis but kept Pritchard safe. Michael Heden, Michael Kilkenny and Surgeon Mccoy fled towards the river. McCoy was shot and wounded. Heden and Kilkenny crossed the river in an old boat and returned to Fort Douglas later that night. According to John Pritchard's published account, Bourke, fearing his cannon would be captured, escorted it back to Fort Douglas and soon returned with a stronger party. As Bourke approached the battle site, he observed the Canadians and Métis still in command of the field. They then called out to Bourke to come fetch the body of Semple, apparently in a mocking tone. Fearing a trick, Bourke again retreated to Fort Douglas. As the party retreated, the Métis fired on it wounding Bourke and killing Duncan McNaughton. [...] The account given by Boucher in his own 1819 pamphlet differed strongly from Pritchard's.|$|E
