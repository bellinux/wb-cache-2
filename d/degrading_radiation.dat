40|$|Abstract: The {{wireless}} communication antenna {{plays an important}} role both at transmitter and receiver. For design considerations antenna parameters are designed depending upon range of propagation, input power to the transmitting antenna, and effective aperture of both transmitting and receiving. Antenna Array is formed by assembly of radiating elements in an electrical or geometrical configuration. In most cases the elements are identical. The antenna array {{is one of the most}} important components to improve the system capacity and spectral efficiency. The active antenna array is widely used in many applications like satellite communication, sonar, mobile communication etc. for signal acquisition purpose. Failure of one or more elements in an antenna array <b>degrades</b> the <b>radiation</b> patterns. If the failed elements are detected properly then no corrective measure can be adopted. Detection of the failed elements is often a difficult process, particularly in large arrays especially when the array is not physically accessible. In this paper, an efficient method for detecting faulty element(s) in an antenna array, based on Genetic Algorithm (GA), is proposed. This method uses a constrained optimal synthesis procedure to regenerate the <b>degraded</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns...|$|R

In this paper a correction procedure is introduced based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which maintains the nulling performance of the failed antenna array.

If the correlated Rayleigh component (NLOS) dominates the channel, the mutual coupling leads to lower capacity.

The application for the undulator is for a SASE source to produce 1 nm wavelength radiation using a low energy electron beam in the range 1 - 2 GeV.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} {{criteria}} for choosing a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) is its sensitivity to the radiations under investigation. Increasing the heating rate during readout appears often necessary to reduce the time between the measurements and the dose evaluation, especially in routine dosimetry. However, doing this <b>degrades</b> the <b>radiation</b> sensitivity of the common dosimeters, as illustrated in this work for the TLD 500 dosimeter. It is shown that the germanium-doped optical fiber is not only more sensitive to radiation than these COTS dosimeters but, unlike them, its sensitivity is enhanced when the heating rate increases. The physical origin of this rare effect of sensitivity enhancement is {{probably due to the}} temperature dependence of the recombination rate by which the detrapped electrons upon stimulation are transferred to the luminescent centers. The effect of light exposure on the dose information stored in both GDF and a commercial TLD is also reported...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{radiation pattern}} synthesis problems for small linear periodic phased arrays (with array elements less then 10). Due {{to the small}} array size conventional pattern synthesis techniques fail to produce the required results. In the case of practical small arrays, mutual coupling and element pattern asymmetric effect <b>degrade</b> the array <b>radiation</b> performance. The main performance metrics considered in this thesis include side lobe level (SLL), gain, halfpower beamwidth (HPBW) and mainbeam scan direction. The conventional pattern synthesis approaches result in sub optimal gain, SLL and HPBW due to {{the limited number of}} elements and the mutual coupling involved. In case of difference pattern synthesis these factors resulted in lower difference pattern slope, degraded SLL and difference peak asymmetry. The sum and difference patterns are used in monopulse arrays and a simplified feed that could produce both patterns with acceptable radiation properties is of interest and has been examined (chapter 5). A conventional technique is applied to small arrays to synthesise a sector beam and there is limited control over the radiation pattern. It is shown that the mutual coupling has significant effect on the array radiation pattern and mitigation is necessary for optimum performance (chapter 6). Furthermore, wideband phased arrays may have a natural limitation of the HPBW in low gain applications and minimisation of the variation becomes important. Also the SLL variations for wideband antenna arrays in the presence of mutual coupling considerably <b>degrade</b> the <b>radiation</b> pattern. The mutual coupling <b>degrades</b> significantly the <b>radiation</b> pattern performance in case of small scanning wideband arrays (chapter 7). It is the primary goal of this thesis to develop an optimisation scheme thatis applied in the above scenarios (chapters 3 & 4). The only degree of freedom assumed is the array excitation. Optimised amplitude and phase for each element in the array are determined by the proposed scheme, concurrently. The deterministic optimisation techniques reported in the literature for the pattern synthesis may involve complicated problem modelling. The heuristic opti-misation techniques generally are computationally expensive. The proposedIntelligent z-space Boundary Condition-Particle Swarm Optimiser (IzBC-PSO) is based on a heuristic algorithm. This scheme can be applied to a wider rangeof problems without significant modifications and requires fewer computationscompared to the competing techniques. In order to verify the performance of IzBC-PSO antenna array measure-ments were performed in the receiving mode only using the online and offlinedigital beamforming setups described in chapter 8. The measurement resultsshow that the proposed scheme may be successfully applied with both onlineand offline digital beamformers for a practical small array (chapter 8).

40|$|Low-cost, compact, {{circular}} planar dipole UWB antennas {{have been}} designed, {{based on the}} ‘two-penny dipole’. One of the dipole arms has been integrated with the ground plane of a microstrip transmission line, the strip being connected to the other dipole arm. The use of microstrip in stead of stripline technology hardly <b>degrades</b> the <b>radiation</b> characteristics, but simplifies the antenna architecture considerably. Up to 6 GHz the azimuthal gain variation does not exceed 3 dB. For frequencies in excess of 6 GHz the antenna becomes too long, resulting in the forming of elevational lobes and large azimuthal gain variations. Shortening the antenna, results in gain-uniformity in azimuth for high frequencies {{at the cost of}} a resonance shift beyond 3 GHz. As shown by the first full-wave simulations, this shortening may be realised without compromising the in-band return loss specifications. First measurements performed with antennas realised on FR 4 – although hindered by cable-current effects – indicate the correctness of this approach. By inserting a slot in the upper arm of the dipole or inserting a spurline filter in the microstrip part of the antenna, a stop band from 5 GHz to 6 GHz may be realised. ...|$|R
