500|$|Writing for School Library Journal, Benjamin Russell {{criticized the}} series for being [...] "slow and formulaic" [...] with [...] "similarly formulaic" [...] {{character}} designs that made [...] "it seem staid". He {{also stated that}} the [...] "animal world" [...] portrayed could be fun {{and that it was}} [...] "interesting to see humanoid characters so tiny next to artifacts of human culture", but it failed to hold the reader's interest. Casey Brienza of Anime News Network heavily criticized the story, grading it as an [...] "F" [...] and calling it [...] "a pastiche {{of a large number of}} manga and anime clichés, not because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was intended to be a pastiche, but because the manga artist [...] flatly is unable to sustain a coherent, unified storyline that is his own, original creation." [...] However, Brienza did praise the artwork, grading it as an [...] "A" [...] and calling it rich and [...] "beautifully drawn". In , Jason Thompson notes that the series' [...] "hook" [...] is that characters are all [...] "drawn as hot anthropomorphic cat-girls and cat-boys" [...] and praises it for having a [...] "unique twist".|$|E
500|$|Clinkscales often plays streetball {{with the}} Sean Bell All-Stars against local teams in New York City, {{acting as the}} {{starting}} point guard. The team was named after an unarmed New York native who was shot 50 times by three police officers on November 25, 2006. The Sean Bell All-Stars won the Trayvon Martin Invitational in August 2013, with a team that featured Clinkscales and Tobias Harris, in Harlem, New York. The event raised over $5,000 for the Trayvon Martin Foundation and was attended by NBA players Kyrie Irving, Tyreke Evans, and future NBA commissioner Adam Silver. At the invitational, Clinkscales spoke out against police brutality, saying, [...] "Kids everywhere are getting shot and murdered, whether it's in Jamaica, the Bronx, Chicago. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> never goes right {{when it comes to the}} law, but the message to the kids is that if you go hard on the court you have to go hard in the classroom." [...] In 2015, he competed for the All-Stars at The Basketball Tournament, in a team that featured Delroy James and Zamal Nixon and was managed by Raheem Wiggins. In a victory against Team No Excuses in 2015, Clinkscales scored 11 points. As well as playing streetball, he coaches youth basketball in South Jamaica, Queens.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The music video's {{representation}} of the song, and its exclusion of Rocky were also well received. Morgan Peterson of Harper's Bazaar said the visual saw Gomez [...] "syncing up to her sultry new sound", while MTV UK wrote that it [...] "keeps true to the intense theme of the song". Lockett said it reinstated the song's [...] "titillating striptease" [...] theme, and that Rocky's exclusion was the clip's biggest statement, [...] "so that all eyes and ears are on Selena. 'Make you never wanna leave, indeed.'" [...] Lockett's commendation of Rocky's exclusion was echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard and Marjua Esteves of Vibe, who both said his absence assisted the premise conceptually. In a less enthusiastic review, Yasmeen Gharnit of Nylon wrote, [...] "While there's no exact formula for how Disney stars transition into full-fledged adults, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> always involves a water and sexual innuendo-filled video". Gharnit said the visual [...] "seems in equal parts too try-hard and unimaginative", and that it distracted from its intended stripped-down {{representation of}} the song.|$|E

[...] On December 10, 2003: [...] "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss.

I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with." [...] On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading “Harvard Connection,” however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E

50|$|Every {{successful}} {{leader and}} organization knows {{that in order}} to maximize profits, it's absolutely imperative to hire and keep the best employees possible. If a business is always looking to maximize profit, it’ll be actively vested in trying to reduce expenses whenever possible—including (alas) employees’ wages. The truth is that most companies pay employees as little as they can get away with. Which is perfect if you want a workforce who will, in turn, provide as little effort as they can get away with. Many companies are still rocking this archaic, backward thinking about compensation. While <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> may be cost effective to apply this profit-first mentality of low-as-possible wages, it ultimately cripples employee performance, engagement, and damages your bottom line.|$|E

The two provers cannot communicate once the verifier has begun sending messages to them.
