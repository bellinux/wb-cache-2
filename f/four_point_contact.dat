40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the bearings used in pitch control system of a wind turbine which enables the blades {{to have an}} optimum angle of attack for efficient power generation and to prevent over-speeding of the blades. Large forces and moments act on the pitch control bearings causing significant wear and deformations of the bearings. In this study, the wear pattern in the pitch control bearings has been simulated using discrete element method and deformations in the bearings have been investigated using finite element software ABAQUS. ^ A six degree freedom dynamic bearing model (DBM) was developed for analysis of <b>four</b> <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> bearing which are commonly used in wind turbine pitch control. DBM for <b>four</b> <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> bearings was tested for accuracy under simple loading conditions. The model was also used to demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>four</b> <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> bearings to resist moment and axial loads. The model was validated by comparing velocities of bearing elements obtained from DBM for <b>four</b> <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> bearings with those from kinematic model which considers pure rolling conditions between ball and the races and neglects the effect of external forces. Parametric studies were performed to investigate the effect of changes in bearing geometry and operating conditions on the bearing performance. Further, the ball motion causing mechanical wear in pitch control bearing raceways was simulated using the DBM for <b>four</b> <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> bearings. ^ Finite element analysis was performed on a model of wind turbine hub with three pitch control bearings using ABAQUS. Initially, a model was developed to calculate the loads (forces and moments) acting on pitch control bearings {{as a function of}} wind speed, wind turbine blade properties (geometry, weight), angular velocity, pitch angle and angular position of the blade. These loads were applied on the inner race of the bearings modeled in ABAQUS and the deformations and stress in the bearing raceways were investigated. The bearings modeled in ABAQUS were <b>four</b> <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> and double row bearings. ABAQUS / Explicit finite element analysis which is well-suited for non-linear problems such as contacts observed in bearings was used. ^ Due to the large axial loads and moments acting on the pitch control bearings, the bearing races undergo large deformations. The pitch control bearings have large diameter (approximately 2 meters) and as the loads on the outer race vary over its surface, the outer race acquires a shape similar to that of a potato chip. These deformation characteristics of the pitch control bearings were simulated using ABAQUS. The finite element analysis also provides magnitude and locations of maximum stress and deformation in the bearing raceways. Further, the locations of maximum deformation were verified analytically to validate the finite element analysis results. A parametric study was also performed to investigate the effect of wind speed, pitch angle and blade rotation speed on the deformations of the bearings. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{decoupled}} {{slow speed}} friction torque {{model has been}} developed to predict the running torque of a double-arched angular contact bearing when operating as a four-point, {{as well as a}} two-point contact bearing. The load distribution model from Amasorrain et al. (2003) and the kinematics model developed by Leblanc and Nelias (2007) have been combined after ignoring centrifugal and gyroscopic effects, a valid assumption for slow speed operation. Results from the model are compared with previous literature data, as well as with tests done on a specially-developed friction torque rig. The comparison with the literature results was done for two specific cases: (i) when only one out of the two contact lines in the four-point contact bearing is active (effectively creating a two-point contact bearing); and (ii) where both contact lines in the four-point contact bearing are active. Further, the comparison was done with a custom-built friction torque rig with FAG QJ 309 bearings, again for two cases: (i) bearings mounted with a specific clearance (two-point contact); and (ii) bearings mounted with larger size balls to obtain interference (four-point contact). All tests were performed at low speeds. The sliding friction, which is an important input to the friction torque model, is carefully measured on ball-on-plate test using the same interface roughness, speed and contact pressure conditions as seen in the QJ 309 friction test. The model comparison with experimental results is covered. The comparison is found to be encouraging, with the RMS difference being less than 7 % between the model and experimental data for a <b>four</b> <b>point</b> <b>contact...</b>|$|E
40|$|As {{solar cells}} become ever cheaper to make, cos ts not {{directly}} related to the solar cell man ufacturing process comprise an ever increasin g share of the total cost of a solar cell. These c osts can be reducedon a per unit energy basis ¨by making more efficient solar cells. Theref ore, there is a strong incentive for research in t he field of high-efficiency solar cells. Spec ifically silicon solar cells are of great pra ctical interest as they presently have a dominant¨ market position. Contact recombination curren ts are one of the major power loss mechanisms in c ertain types of high efficiency silicon solar ¨cells, for example interdigitated back conta ct silicon solar cells featuring diffused junction s. Therefore, reducing contact recombination¨ currents can result in efficiency gains. However,¨ the characterization of contact recombination ¨losses is convoluted, and many present techn ologies forthe characterization of contact recombi nation currents are imperfect. This provided¨ the incentive for this work on a novel charac terization method for contact recombination curren ts. The characterization method developed in¨ this dissertation is based on photo conductancemeasurements on lattices of point contacts on o therwise passivated wafers. Chapt er one features a general introduction. This inclu des a discussion the context in which this di ssertation is performed is performed. Then, v arious sources of efficiency loss in solar cells a rediscussed. The focus is on silicon solar ce lls, and Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) silicon solar cells in particular. Finally, varioust ypes of passivated contacts are discussed. In chapter two, an introduction to carrie r recombination in silicon solar cells is pro vided. Chapter two also features an introduction t o radio-wave detected quasi steady state phot o conductance (QSSPC) measurements. QSSPC mea surements lie at the basis of the characterization ¨method for contact recombination measurement s which is developed in this dissertation. The result of chapter two is a mathematical framewor k for a number of basic concepts in the field ¨of silicon solar cells, and particularly in the f ield of silicon solar cell characterization. In chapter three, an overview of contem porary methods for contact recombination curr ent measurements is given, and it is argued why th e developmentof a novel method for contact re combination measurements is desirable. This m ethod is subsequently described in detail. This de tailed description covers the physics that li es at the basis of the method. It also covers ¨design rules, error analysis, parasitic effects,¨ and experimental results. The focus is on tes t structures based on lattices of point contacts,but at the end of chapter three, alternative¨ test structure embodiments are described. In chapter <b>four,</b> <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> based test¨ structures are applied to the optimization of ¨n+ diffusions which are used as back surface ¨fields (BSF) in interdigitated back contact (IBC) ¨silicon solar cells. In addition, various fr ont surface field oxidations are investigated. The ¨use of the test structure developed in chapt er three for a classical junction optimizationproblem allows for further experimental confirma tion of the characterization method. Certainl y, the consistency of the trends observed between¨ contact resistance, contact saturation curren t density and saturation current density of p assivated junctions is a strong experimental confi rmation of the novel characterization method¨ described in this dissertation. I n the final chapter, thin dielectric Al 2 O 3 la yers grown using thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) are investigated for the passivation of¨ the interface between aluminum contacts and n+ orp+ silicon. Specific attention is paid to the ¨effect of specific surface treatments prior¨ to the formation of Al 2 O 3 contact passivation ¨layers: ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layerson HF-last and HNO 3 -last silicon are investigated. ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layers arefound to effectively passivate aluminum contactson n+ silicon surfaces, but they are found to be¨ ineffective at passivating aluminum contacts¨ on p+ silicon surfaces. In addition, it is fo und that pin-holesassociated with HF-last ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layers can improve the¨ trade-off between contact resistance and cont act recombination associated with passivated conta cts. However, the reproducibility of pinhole¨ formation in ALD Al 2 O 3 contacts remains an op en question. Acknowledgements	v Abstract	viii Nederlandse samenvatting	x Table of contents	xii 1.

The properties of optical fibre sensors make them very promising for use on space structures. They are immune from electromagnetic interferences, resistant to chemical corrosion, compatible with the space environmental conditions. Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBG) are particularly interesting because they can be multiplexed along the same fibre. Those sensors are basically optical strain gages with many advantages over the conventional ones. In the paper it is proposed the use of those sensors for correlating experimental finite element analysis on the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> of the separation system with LARES satellite.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} concern about the sound emitted into the indoor environment due to the vibration of rooftop building services equipment. Force transmissibility or isolation efficiency is a performance indicator of vibration isolators for building services equipment. In the derivation of the force transmissibility, floor structure is usually assumed to be rigid and immovable. The floor structural dynamic characteristics are therefore neglected. It is used in situations for a single <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> or symmetrical arrangement of symmetrical <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> In the most common situation where a machine with <b>four</b> symmetrical <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> is placed asymmetrically on a floor, dynamic forces transmitted to the floor through each <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> are different. A force transmissibility vector, which comprises these different dynamic forces transmitted to the floor, is introduced. Measurements of the floor mobility have been conducted in several sites. The effect of floor mobility on force transmissibility vector particularly at disturbing frequencies near the resonant frequencies of the floor is also discussed.

5000|$|To obtain proper rolling {{action of}} the balls, as in a {{standard}} ball bearing, it is necessary that, when loaded in one direction, the ball makes <b>contact</b> at one <b>point</b> with the nut, and one point with the screw. In practice, most ball screws {{are designed to be}} lightly preloaded, so that there is at least a slight load on the ball at <b>four</b> <b>points,</b> two in <b>contact</b> with the nut and two in contact with the screw. This is accomplished by using a thread profile that has a slightly larger radius than the ball, the difference in radii being kept small (e.g. a simple V thread with flat faces is unsuitable) so that elastic deformation around the <b>point</b> of <b>contact</b> allows a small, but non-zero contact area to be obtained, like any other rolling element bearing. To this end, the threads are usually machined as a [...] "gothic arch" [...] profile. If a simple semicircular thread profile were used, contact would only be at two points, on the outer and inner edges, which would not resist axial loading.|$|R
40|$|We use the Cosserat rod {{theory to}} present a uni 5 ed picture of jump phenomena, {{associated}} with looping, snap-through, pop-out, etc., in twisted clamped rods undergoing large de 6 ections. Both contact-free rods and rods with isolated points of self-contact are considered. Taking proper account of the symmetries of the problem we 5 nd that an arbitrary contact-free solution is fully characterised by <b>four</b> parameters; each <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> adds another two. A shooting method is used for solving the boundary value problem. An intricate bifurcation picture emerges with a strong interplay between planar and spatial rod con 5 gurations. We 5 nd new jump phenomena by treating the ratio of torsional to bending sti 8 ness of the rod as a bifurcation parameter.

5000|$|In {{the case}} of ball bearings, the bearing has inner and outer races {{and a set of}} balls. Each race is a ring with a groove where the balls rest. The groove is usually shaped so the ball is a {{slightly}} loose fit in the groove. Thus, in principle, the ball contacts each race at a single point. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race, much as a tire flattens where it touches the road. The race also dents slightly where each ball presses on it. Thus, the contact between ball and race is of finite size and has finite pressure. Note also that the deformed ball and race do not roll entirely smoothly because different parts of the ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag. [...] "V" [...] groove raceways distribute the load evenly over the balls as they travel on <b>four</b> <b>points</b> of <b>contact,</b> creating a straight line rolling effect and decreasing the amount of friction created by a full contact round groove design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper studies {{modeling}} and biomimetic {{control of a}} 3 D 8 -dof whole arm cooperative manipulation system using sensitive skin. The control law is designed based on integration of voluntary movement and reflex considering the system’s redundancy. The voluntary task for holding the object is realized by impedance control at <b>four</b> <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> with the object using the contact force information from the sensitive skin. The reflection {{on the other hand}} is introduced as a regulation problem of the direction between the points of end-effectors and elbows. We then investigate the exact solutions for the combined motion and their solvable conditions. The validity of the proposed method is investigated by numerical simulations.
