5|$|Ornamentation {{assumes a}} preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines tonal and atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other composers and less amenable to analysis.

The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>third</b> movement are a tritone apart. However, some people have remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is commonly associated with very dissonant music.|$|E
