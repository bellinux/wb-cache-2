Theobald of Bec was also present, even though the king had {{forbidden}} him to attend. The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury stated that Stephen wanted to weaken Theobald's standing with the papacy, but Stephen also would have wished to assert his authority over the English Church by insisting {{on the right to}} limit papal contact with the English bishops, something that his predecessors <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
5|$|United States v. Washington, 384 F.Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), aff'd, 520 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1975), {{commonly}} known as the Boldt Decision (from the name of the trial court judge, George Hugo Boldt), was a 1974 case heard in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It reaffirmed the reserved right of American Indian tribes in the State of Washington to act alongside the state as co-managers of salmon and other fish, and to continue harvesting them in accordance with the various treaties that the United States had signed with the tribes. The tribes of Washington had ceded their land to the United States but had reserved the right to fish as they <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done,</b> including fishing at their traditional locations that were off the designated reservations.|$|E

25|$|On the {{accession}} of Queen Mary in 1553 Gresham {{fell out}} of favour at Court {{for a short time}} with Alderman William Dauntsey displacing him. But Dauntsey's financial operations proved unsuccessful and Gresham was soon re-instated; and as he professed his zealous desire to serve the Queen, and manifested great adroitness both in negotiating loans and in smuggling money, arms and foreign goods, not only were his services retained throughout her reign (1553–1558), but besides his salary of twenty shillings per diem he received grants of church lands to the yearly value of 200 pounds. Under Queen Elizabeth's reign (1558–1603), besides continuing in his post as financial agent of the Crown, Gresham acted as Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the Court of Duchess Margaret of Parma, Governor of the Netherlands, and was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1559 prior to his departure. The unsettled times preceding the Dutch revolt compelled him to leave Antwerp on 10 March 1567; but, though he spent the remainder of his life in London, he continued his business as merchant and government financial agent {{in much the same way}} as he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done.</b> His enterprises made him one of the richest men of his generation in England.|$|E

She paid very {{close attention to the}} details, something she <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> in her husband's life. Betsy Bloomingdale, one of Reagan's closest friends, stated, [...] "She looks a little frail. But she is very strong inside. She is. She has the strength. She is doing her last thing for Ronnie. And she is going to get it right." [...] The funeral marked her first major public appearance since she delivered a speech to the 1996 Republican National Convention on her husband's behalf.|$|E

500|$|Though Skelton <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> live engagements at Nevada {{hotels and}} {{appearances}} such as state fairs during his television show's hiatus, he focused {{his time and}} energy on live performances after {{he was no longer}} on the air, performing up to 125 dates a year. He often arrived days early for his engagement and would serve as his own promotion staff, making the rounds of the local shopping malls. [...] Before the show, his audiences received a ballot listing about 100 of his many routines and were asked to tick off their favorites. [...] The venue's ushers would collect the ballots and tally the votes. [...] Skelton's performance on that given day was based on the skits his audience selected. After he learned that his performances were popular with the hearing-impaired because of his heavy use of pantomimes, Skelton hired a sign language interpreter to translate the non-pantomime portions of his act for all his shows. He continued performing live until 1993, when he celebrated his 80th birthday.|$|E
500|$|Adams had {{his first}} {{audience}} with King George III on June 1, and recorded the event {{as he saw it}} in great detail in a letter to Foreign Minister John Jay on June 2. Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> what he thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." [...] Adams replied, [...] "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." [...] To this King George responded, [...] "An honest Man will never have any other." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} over Meckiff's action persisted as throwing {{was in the}} spotlight in England, where it {{was regarded as a}} growing problem. The issue prompted numerous international discussions and meetings on amending the throwing law and the interpretation thereof. An expected confrontation with English umpires in 1961 was averted when the bowler suffered multiple injuries in the preceding Australian summer and was omitted from the team to tour England, but Meckiff had two strong seasons in domestic cricket that forced the Australian selectors to recall him for the Tests against South Africa in 1963–64. The Victorian's recall had occurred despite his being no-balled for throwing in two separate Sheffield Shield matches in the previous season. In his first over of the Test, Meckiff was no-balled four times by umpire Egar. Australian captain Richie Benaud chose to not bowl his paceman again, and Meckiff retired from all cricket {{at the end of the}} match. The throwing controversy provoked heavy debate among cricket commentators, players and umpires, past and present; some praised Egar's no-ball call while others condemned the umpire and felt that the paceman had bowled in the same way as he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done.</b> Others felt that Meckiff had been set up so that he would be no-balled in an [...] "execution" [...] or [...] "sacrifice" [...] to prove Australia's resolve against throwing.|$|E

She specialized in gatherings at embassies and ministries, charming people as she <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done,</b> while gathering information.

2500|$|Its lands {{were granted}} first to a cleric called Richard Thornden or Thornton, but passed on shortly {{afterwards}} to Archbishop Thomas Cranmer when Thornton [...] received an important benefice.

2500|$|In cricket in {{the early}} 1760s, there was a {{transition}} from the sport's [...] "pioneering phase" [...] to its [...] "pre-modern phase" [...] when bowlers began to bowl pitched deliveries by pitching the ball towards the wicket instead of rolling or skimming it along the ground as they <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> formerly, since time immemorial. The essential bowling action was still underarm but {{the introduction of a}} ball travelling through the air coupled with a bounce was a key point of evolution in the sport's history, especially as it was the catalyst for the invention of the straight bat, which replaced the old [...] "hockey stick" [...] design. It was the first of three keypoint evolutions in bowling: the others were the introduction of the roundarm style in the 1820s and overarm in the 1860s.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976 Ginn {{formed the}} punk rock band Panic.

By late 1978 Bomp had still not formally agreed to release the music on record, so Ginn decided he had enough business experience with SST to release it himself.
