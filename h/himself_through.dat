5|$|Lingbao ritual {{shares a}} great deal with ritual in other Daoist traditions. Like other traditions, Lingbao rituals had a {{theatrical}} quality that involved accompanying music, dances, and chants. Lingbao Daoism also shared the multidimensional aspect of Daoist ritual, meaning that it was carried on at several different levels simultaneously. For example, while a ritual was being performed, the priest would repeat the ritual within <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> interior meditation.|$|E
5|$|While in New York, Gipsy {{performed}} at the Ramayana Restaurant, which was owned by the Indonesian gas company Pertamina. The band, housed in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, performed in New York for almost a year, providing Indonesian-themed music and covering songs by Procol Harum, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis and Blood, Sweat & Tears. Although Chrisye became upset {{that he could not}} fully express <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> covers, he continued to work.|$|E
50|$|Music {{learning}} {{is in many}} ways analogous to language learning; just as the child seems to teach <b>himself</b> language <b>through</b> interacting with a language environment, he teaches <b>himself</b> music <b>through</b> being in a music environment. When adults model active singing and movement behaviors, the child imitates and learns. The combination of classroom activities and at-home music-making inspired by a recording and songbook help children learn music skills naturally and effortlessly.|$|R

5|$|Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire {{received}} {{a number of}} threats and had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena.|$|E
5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was born}} in Connecticut and was a {{merchant}} operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> acts of intelligence and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 (allowing American forces time to prepare New York's defenses), the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut (after which {{he was promoted to}} major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that halted his combat career for several years.|$|E

5|$|Gossip {{was born}} in New York City on December 6, 1841, to George Hatfeild Gossip, an Englishman, and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip, of New York. When he was sixteen months old, his mother died; about two years later, {{he and his father}} moved to England. His aunt, Mrs. Reaston Rodes, raised him, {{apparently}} with little involvement by his father. Gossip grew up at Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire (the Rodes family seat) and at Hatfield, in Yorkshire. Both the Gossip and Rodes families are listed in Burke's Landed Gentry. He was educated at Windermere College, Westmorland, and won a scholarship to Oxford University, but was unable to attend as his father, uncle, and aunts lost a lawsuit that ruined them financially. As a result, Gossip had to support <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> his own labors.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, the King of Coorg, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, {{managed to}} escape from captivity at Seringapatnam, and, {{with the aid of}} the British armies under Lord Cornwallis, was able to regain Coorg for <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> the treaty of 1792 between the English, their allies and Tipu. Anxious to repopulate a kingdom {{depopulated}} by Tipu, Dodda welcomed the fugitive Konkani Christians. As an inducement to remain permanently in his territory, he granted them several privileges, obtained a priest from Goa, and built a chapel for them. After the relaxation of policies from 1792 onwards, the Christians began to resettle in Canara. Many Mangalorean Catholic students, who had studied for the priesthood in Goa returned to Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E

His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a {{copyright}} lawyer who had fought in WWII and put <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> college on the G.I. Bill; both his older sister and brother went on to become lawyers. His paternal grandfather was {{one of the founders of}} the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). Sorkin took an early interest in acting. Before he reached his teenage years, his parents were taking him to the theatre to see shows such as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and That Championship Season.|$|E
5|$|Tequila {{finds the}} last {{baby in the}} {{maternity}} unit, and carries it to safety while fighting off {{the last of the}} gangsters. Alan and Tequila meet up again and are confronted by Wong, who has set bombs to blow up the building. Alan pursues Wong as Tequila escapes the hospital with the last baby, the hospital exploding around him. Outside, Wong suddenly appears holding Alan at gunpoint. After watching Wong humiliate Tequila, Alan grabs Wong's pistol. In a struggle, Alan shoots <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> the stomach giving Tequila enough time to shoot Wong dead. Later at the police station, Pang and Tequila burn Alan's police file. Alan then sails away from Hong Kong in his boat.|$|E
5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of William's early years. He was the fourth son of the family, and up until three years before his father died, he still had two {{surviving}} older brothers. For this reason, his early biography is based largely on conjecture. It is known that he managed to establish an independent position for <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> a fortunate marriage. By 1361 {{he was married to}} Joan Montagu, the daughter of Alice of Norfolk, and – through Alice – a granddaughter of Thomas of Brotherton, a younger son of Edward I. The first recorded evidence for his military activity dates from 1367, but he was probably also present in earlier campaigns. His father campaigned in France in 1355–6 and 1359–60, and it is likely that William also took part in these expeditions, along with Thomas Beauchamp, the future Earl of Warwick. The two men would develop a close affinity, and their careers were strikingly similar: they were born around the same time, they were probably knighted together in July 1355, neither was born as heir to their earldoms but came to their titles through the death of older brothers, and both succeeded their fathers in 1369.|$|E
5|$|Obtaining {{funding for}} the battleships was a {{struggle}} for the Japanese government. The initial request was submitted in the budget of Prime Minister Matsukata Masayoshi in 1891, but was deleted by the Diet of Japan due to political infighting. Matsukata submitted the request again and, when again denied, was forced to dissolve his cabinet. His successor, Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi, attempted to pass the funding measure in 1892, but he also failed. This led to an extraordinary personal intervention by Emperor Meiji in a statement dated 10 February 1893, wherein the emperor offered to fund {{the construction of the}} two battleships <b>himself,</b> <b>through</b> an annual reduction in the expenses of the Imperial Household, and asked that all government officials likewise agree to a reduction in their salaries by ten percent. The funding measure for the Fuji-class battleships was passed by the Japanese Diet soon after. Completion of the ships was originally scheduled for 1899, but the start of the First Sino-Japanese War shortly before they were laid down in 1894 caused the government to accelerate the schedule by two years.|$|E
5|$|While Árbenz {{was living}} in Montevideo, his wife came to join him. He was also visited by Arévalo a year after his own arrival there. Although the {{relationship}} between Arévalo and the Árbenz family was initially friendly, it soon deteriorated due to {{differences between the two}} men. Arévalo himself was not under surveillance in Uruguay and was occasionally able to express <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> articles in the popular press. He left for Venezuela a year after his arrival to take up a position as a teacher. During his stay in Uruguay, Árbenz was initially required to report to the police on a daily basis; eventually, however, this requirement was relaxed a little. María Árbenz later stated that the couple was pleased by the hospitality they received in Uruguay, and would have stayed there indefinitely had they received permission to do so.|$|E

5|$|During the Chunin Exams, Orochimaru plans the {{invasion}} of Konoha with the ninja of Sunagakure to not only kill Hiruzen but also claim the body of Itachi's brother Sasuke Uchiha. To that end, Orochimaru infiltrated the Chunin Exam's Forest of Death round by killing a Grass ninja named Shiore and assuming his identity to personally test Sasuke before branding him with a Curse Mark once satisfied with the youth's abilities. For {{the duration of the}} Exams, Orochimaru laid in wait and secretly murdered the Fourth Kazekage to assume his identity and get close to his mentor as {{the invasion}} begins. However, Orochimaru is forced to retreat when Hiruzen sacrifices <b>himself</b> <b>through</b> the Reaper Death Seal to take away Orochimaru's ability to perform jutsu with his forces pulling back while Sunagakure later learns of Orochimaru's treachery. Wanting to regain the ability to use jutsu, Orochimaru attempts to get aid from Tsunade before seeking out another way to cure himself. When all his efforts prove unsuccessful, Orochimaru sends his Sound Four to fetch Sasuke, hoping that a body-transfer will allow him to use his arms again. Though he waits as long as he can, Sasuke takes too long to arrive and Orochimaru is forced to switch to the body of one of his prisoners instead. Once Sasuke arrives, Orochimaru decides to train him instead until the day that {{he will be able to}} take the body for himself.|$|E
