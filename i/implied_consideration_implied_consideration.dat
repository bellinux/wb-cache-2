40|$|The {{role of the}} {{business}} English teacher has substantially {{changed in the last}} decades, and in a variety of ways. These changes have been driven by different social, economic, political and cultural trends. Among these trends are the increasing internationalisation of economic activity, a strongly increased cross-cultural and cross-linguistic interaction, increased mobility of labour, and the increased public interest in all professions including teaching. The role of {{the business}} English teacher is more and more demanding in many ways. It requires some basic qualities in addition to those which were typical of the good modern language teacher of the past. Among those traditional professional qualities that will still be required are: proficiency in the target language; knowledge of, and a positive attitude towards, the target culture; knowledge about language as a system and as a social construct, with particular reference to the target language; knowledge of appropriate assessment techniques. In addition to these, the changing demands require new professional qualities. We might mention: much more sophisticated and effective pedagogical skills; much greater autonomy and self-direction in professional development; sensitivity to pluricultural and multicultural issues and a willingness to work in international programmes; the ability to exploit and build on school and teaching experience. These <b>considerations</b> <b>imply</b> serious <b>considerations,</b> among others, on the new role of the Business English teacher in the Faculties of Economics and Business. In this context, and in a continent where higher performing economies show advanced forms of curricular integration, the traditional profile of the teacher as a ‘lone rider’ doing his or her subject in isolation from others is no longer valid. In the light of the most recent CLIL guidelines and referring to the Italian context, we will try to highlight the specificity of the Business English teacher in the academic Italian landscape, with particular attention to his/her relationship with the public (who are the students for English for International Business language courses? Who are the EIB speakers? Are they native or non-native speakers of English?), with the contents and materials (which texts and tools for EIB teaching?), with the specific communication requirements of financial and accounting experts...|$|R

30|$|Addressing {{real-world}} applications implies that a video analysis approach {{must be able}} to properly handle the information extracted from noisy videos. This requirement has been considered by proposing a generic mechanism to measure in a consistent way the reliability of the information in the whole video analysis process. More concretely, reliability measures associated to the object attributes have been proposed in order to measure the quality and coherence of this information. The proposed tracking method presents similar ideas in the structure for creating, generating and eliminating mobile object hypotheses compared to the MHT methods. The main differences from these methods are induced by the object representation utilised for tracking and the fact that this representation differs from the point representation normally utilised in the MHT methods. The utilisation of a representation different from a point representation <b>implies</b> the <b>consideration</b> of the possibility that several visual evidences could be associated to a mobile object. This <b>consideration</b> <b>implies</b> the conception of new methods for creation and update of object hypotheses.|$|R
40|$|At {{the current}} level of stent {{application}} in urology each irreversible urostasis contraindicated for surgical therapy <b>implies</b> <b>consideration</b> of indications for metal stent insertion. Stent incrustation which leads directly into a new uroobstruction is a characteristic complication of this method. Available experience in different uroobstructive conditions has shown that very different clinical aspects of stent usage may directly determine the possibility of their incrustation. Stent incrustation may occur in the early postprocedural course or several months later. After that, prevention of stent incrustation starts with postprocedural evaluation, selection of the stent type, and it is subsequently continued by insertion technique and lasts practically permanently after the insertion (infection control, promotion of diuresis and maintenance of normal urodynamics). Authors present own experianse in clinical application of metal stents in uroradiology strictures for period of last 15 years...|$|R
40|$|Ethics are {{involved}} in a model's purposes (for example, the purpose might be to increase a heroin dealer's profits). These purposes <b>imply</b> <b>consideration</b> of the various stakeholders (modelers, users, public) and their values. Ethics also concern professional standards of conduct for the modelers. These standards require that the modelers validate the model assumptions. Hence, modelers should provide model documentation. Validation, however, is virtually impossible when the model represents unique events, such as nuclear accidents; credibility is then the maximum attainable. Anyhow, modelers should try to develop `robust' models; that is, models that are not very sensitive to their assumptions. This article pays special attention to the use of models in crime, war, and nuclear applications, which might be controversial applications indeed. It also discusses freedom of science.

40|$|The two core {{objectives}} of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) are cost-effective emission reduction and sustainable development. Despite the potential to contribute to both objectives, solar projects play a negligible role under the CDM.

In particular, we compare the use of absolute and relative mitigation costs to evaluate the attractiveness of these projects under the CDM. We encourage the use of relative mitigation costs, <b>implying</b> <b>consideration</b> of baseline costs that render the projects profitable. Results of the mitigation cost analysis are dependent on the baseline chosen. To overcome this drawback, we complement the analysis with a multi-objective optimization approach, which allows quantifying the trade-off between economic and environmental performances of the optimal technologies without requiring a baseline...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} solar, {{atmospheric}} and reactor neutrinos {{over the past}} several years provide almost certain indications that neutrinos oscillate, have masses and mix. These new properties of neutrinos, if confirmed by better statistics in the proceeding and forthcoming experiments, will require a significant departure from the Standard Model. It is well known [1] that massive neutrinos can have nonvanishing magnetic moment. For example, in the Standard Model supplied with SU(2) -singlet right-handed neutrino the one-loop radiative correction generates neutrino magnetic moment which is proportional to neutrino mass. There are plenty of models [2] which predict much large magnetic moment for neutrinos. In the light of new developments in neutrino physics, to get better understanding of the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos is an important task. In general, there are two aspects of this problem. The first one is connected with values of neutrino electromagnetic form factors. The second aspect of the problem <b>implies</b> <b>consideration</b> of influence of external electromagnetic fields...|$|R

Various authors agree that sociometric criteria are basic relevant activities of the group they refer to {{and that they should}} be meaningful, understandable to every group member and clearly and precisely formulated. The selection of the appropriate sociometric technique and instrument has to be adjusted with the goal of sociometric research, along with the consideration of the advantages and short­comings of different sociometric techniques and instruments. The existing research provides very divergent results on the adequacy of different classification methods in identifying stable sociometric groups. Still, the majority of studies have confirmed that the two-dimensional rating scale method yields more stable classifications than the classification methods based on peer nominations, as well as that it is methodologically more justifiable to use cluster analysis in identifying stable sociometric status groups than the traditional classification methods...|$|R

There were significant relationships from distributive justice to job satisfaction and commitment for both men and women. Informational justice significantly predicted job satisfaction.

How practitioners define and enact this principle however, depends in large part on the kind of service they are providing. This paper reports research with practitioners in a Queensland children’s contact service [CCS]. Workers were asked what the notion of the child’s best interests meant for them and how they identified and acted in children’s interests. The focus here is on three strategies or sets of practices they saw as essential: effectively engaging all service participants, facilitating positive parent-child interaction and encouraging children’s participation in decision making.
