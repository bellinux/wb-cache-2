5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just <b>interesting</b> <b>how</b> something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|It is both biochemically and {{medically}} <b>interesting</b> <b>how</b> tarantula hawk venom works. How can {{an essentially}} non-toxic venom that causes so much pain, described as blinding, debilitating, and shockingly electric by Schmidt, subside in only three minutes in humans? Only the bullet ant is ranked {{higher than the}} tarantula hawk’s sting on Schmidt’s Sting Pain Index. How does it permanently paralyze a tarantula, yet keep it alive? It is also evolutionarily interesting and significant how such a toxin evolved. Selection pressure by potential vertebrate predators would have favored individuals with painful venom components, but not vertebrate-lethal components. At the same time, selection pressure against venom lethality towards prey and subsequent loss of prey to spoilage would be very strong. The tarantula hawk’s venom is a specific, evolutionarily tailored cocktail of compounds best suited to the wasps’ needs. Studying tarantula hawk venom may help us gain insight into treating human problems like chronic pain from injury or disease.|$|E

500|$|... "You do {{appreciate}} {{the absurdity of}} a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven't heard the record, right? And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's <b>interesting</b> <b>how</b> their minds work, those naughty rabbis.

We said, [...] "We're just going to record you. We don't know what we're going to do with it." [...] He's flawless. One take, no bad notes. He doesn't even need a microphone. We took one of the songs he did and I said to Stuart, [...] "Let's sample these bits. We'll create a chorus and then I'll write lyrics around it." [...] That's how we constructed it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Boortz {{enrolled}} in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class {{in his spare}} time, while {{he and his wife}} Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing [...] "the money to keep me in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of <b>interesting</b> <b>how</b> your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by television critics. Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a {{nine out of}} ten rating, and opined that the episode was a [...] "home run episode" [...] for the series. Harrison continued: [...] "Its central conflict is intense, its action is solid, and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right. Light on the gore and heavy on the drama—just how I like my Sunday night zombie adventures." [...] Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, [...] "At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of [...] "Bloodletting" [...] provides more than enough action." [...] Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: [...] "It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on." [...] Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, and I found it <b>interesting</b> <b>how</b> the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood. The scenes between the two men were moving, and if you listened close you could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops. Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and let her know their son is in mortal danger, without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission, while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic." [...] In conclusion, Oesterle gave [...] "Bloodletting" [...] a 'B' grade. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, signaling a [...] "great" [...] response. Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode, and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger. Similarly, Paste Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8.3 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that [...] "Bloodletting" [...] was superior to the previous episode, opining that it was [...] "a character strengthening episode." [...] He continued: [...] "Even those throwaway threads are immensely important to what’s about to go down at the Green farm." ...|$|E

6000|$|As to George Augustus Clearemout, Esquire--that able {{managing}} director, {{despite his}} ducking at St. Just, continued {{to fill his}} chair and to fulfil his destiny in the airy little street in London, where, for many years, he represented Wheal Dooem, and [...] "did" [...] a too confiding public. In this work he was ably assisted by Secretary Jack Muddle, who became quite celebrated as a clear expounder and explainer of veins, lodes, ores, cross-cuts, shafts, levels, winzes, minerals, metals, and mines-- insomuch that he was regarded {{by many of the}} confiding public who frequented his office as a more thoroughly learned and scientific man than George Augustus himself. It is <b>interesting,</b> <b>how</b> ever, to have to record the curious fact that the too confiding public changed their opinion at last on this head, and came to regard Secretary Jack as a humbug, and the managing director as a scoundrel. Unfortunately this change of opinion did not take place until the whole of the too confiding public (the T.C.P., as Clearemout styled them) had lost large sums of money, and a few of them become bankrupt. When affairs had reached this crisis, one of the T.C.P.--an irascible old gentleman, whose fiery nature seemed to have singed all the hair off his head, leaving it completely bald--went down to Cornwall in a passion to sift the thing for himself. There he found the Great Wheal Dooem pump-engine going full swing, day and night, under the superintendence of one man, while the vast works underground (on which depended the [...] "enormous" [...] dividends promised to and expected by the T.C.P.) were carried on by another man and a boy. On making this discovery the fiery old gentleman with the denuded head left Cornwall--still in a passion--and exploded {{in the face of a}} meeting of the members of the T.C.P., who immediately exploded in each other's faces, and appointed an indignation committee to go and explode, with unexampled fury, in the faces of the managing director and Secretary Jack. But these knowing gentlemen, being aware that the explosion was coming, had wisely betaken themselves to the retirement and seclusion of the Continent.|$|E
60|$|He {{did not go}} to sleep, but {{lay awake}} half {{thinking}} and half dreaming. He certainly liked Mrs. Smith; but then, as he had begun to find out of himself he liked women's society generally. He was almost jealous of the doctor, because the doctor was allowed to talk to Miss Green and waltz with Miss Green, whereas he could not approach her. Then he thought of Maria Shand and that kiss in the little back parlour,--the kiss which had not meant much, but which had meant something; and then of Julia Babington, to whom he was not quite sure that he ought not to feel himself engaged. But the face that was clearest to him of all,--and which became the dearer the nearer that he approached to a state of dozing,--was that of Hester Bolton, whose voice he had hardly heard, who had barely spoken to him;--the tips of whose fingers he had only just touched. If there was any one thing fixed on his mind it was that, as soon as he had put together a large lump of gold, he would go back to Cambridge and win Hester Bolton to be his wife. But yet what a singular woman was this Mrs. Smith! As to marrying her, that of course had been a joke produced by the petulance of his snoring friend. He began to dislike Shand, because he did snore so loudly, and drank so much bottled ale, and smelt so strongly of cavendish tobacco. Mrs. Smith was at any rate much too good for Shand. Surely she must have been a lady, or her voice would not have been sweet and silvery? And though she did bristle roughly against the ill-usage of the world, and say strong things, she was never absolutely indelicate or even loud. And she was certainly very <b>interesting.</b> <b>How</b> did it come to pass that she was so completely alone, so poor, so unfriended and yet possessed of such gifts? There certainly was a mystery, and it would certainly be his fate, and not the fate of Dick Shand, to unravel it. The puzzle was much too delicate and too intricate for Dick Shand's rough hands. Then, giving his last waking thoughts for a moment to Hester Bolton, he went to sleep in spite of the snoring.|$|E
