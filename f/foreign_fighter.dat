25|$|The report had a {{significant}} impact on the U.S. legislative process related to counterterrorism objectives. Representative Martha McSally spoke out on the floor of the United States House of Representatives in favor the Tracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act, House Resolution 4239.

25|$|Combating Terrorist and <b>Foreign</b> <b>Fighter</b> Travel was a {{bipartisan}} task force {{made up of}} members from the United States House Committee on Homeland Security, begun in 2015.

Additional membership included United States Representatives Barry Loudermilk, Filemon Vela Jr., John Ratcliffe, Donald Payne Jr., Will Hurd, and Martha McSally.

40|$|This {{research}} {{resulted in}} a <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> analytical framework aiming to identify the reasons for an increase of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> travelling from the European Union to jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq. The theoretical framework is built on EU’s Counterterrorism strategy (ECTS) on prevention, protection, pursuing and responding towards terrorism. The theoretical framework has in this essay been applied on ECTS in order to search explanation to the phenomenon of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> in the EU. The analytical framework is built on the concepts operationalized in the theoretical framework {{in order to obtain}} further clarifications on <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> in relation to the EU. The results and analysis of this essay show that ECTS somewhat approaches the phenomenon of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters.</b> However, further analysis shows that the strategy does not completely explain the phenomenon of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> nor entirely contemplate preventing, protecting, pursuing or responding towards <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters.</b> The contributions that could be drawn from the essay are mainly interpretive that should be kept in mind when discussing the ECTS in relation to <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Methodological {{questions}} {{around the}} determination {{how many of}} the <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> going to Syria are likely to engage in terrorism upon their return are discussed. Two approaches are used in this Research Note to assess the threat posed by Western <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> in the past. These serve to answer two questions: {{how many of the}} former <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> became involved in terrorist activity (approach 1) and how many of jihadist-inspired terrorists were former <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> (approach 2) ? The research is based on three studies (Afghanistan, Bosnia and Somalia) and the data are presented in an Appendix. A typology of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> is presented in the text itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> is high on international agendas {{as one of}} the most pressing transnational security issues of our time. European governments have tried to respond to this development by designing various policies, focusing not only on stopping potential <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> but also on limiting the possible threat posed by returning fighters. In this Policy Brief, ICCT Fellows Dr. Alastair Reed, Ms. Jeanine de Roy van Zuijdewijn and Prof. Dr. Edwin Bakker look at the (un) intended consequences of these policies on the pathways <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> could take once they have arrived in Syria or Iraq. In the first part, the authors identify different possible pathways. In the second part, they provide an overview of the main trends in policies pursued by European governments to deal with these <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters.</b> They specifically focus on four policies: reintegration programmes, prosecution of returning <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters,</b> revoking nationality of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> and finally, military interventions against <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters.</b> In the final part, the authors use the earlier identified pathways as a conceptual tool to look at the (un) intended consequences of these four policies...|$|R
25|$|Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and <b>Foreign</b> <b>Fighter</b> Travel is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism and foreign fighters in the Syrian and Iraqi Civil Wars by a {{bipartisan}} {{task force of}} the United States House Committee on Homeland Security, with a foreword by cryptology analyst and author Malcolm Nance. The work was released in paperback format in 2016 by Skyhorse Publishing. The report discusses United States citizens leaving their country to gain fighting experience in Iraq and Syria on the battlefield. It notes some linked up with the Syrian Civil War in order to attempt to remove Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad from power, later joining ISIS. According to the work, approximately 4,500 from the Western world left their countries to join ISIS, including over 250 American citizens. The report gives thirty-two recommendations to address the problem, including tactics to stop travels of battlefield soldiers to and from their countries of origin, ways to change executive branch policies, and methods to determine which individuals are planning terrorist activities.|$|E

[...] The report became a resource cited by the Brookings Institution which noted terrorist entities use tools online in order to promote violent extremism via the Web to their followers and for recruitment purposes.|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that a number between 27, 000 and 31, 000 <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> have been flocking to Iraq and Syria since the breakout {{of the war in}} 2011.

40|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> {{have become}} {{inextricably}} linked to perceptions {{of human rights abuses}} in the Syria and Iraq wars, particularly since the Islamic State group founded its caliphate. This paper explores the human rights impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> in the conflicts, noting that while <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> have been involved in grave human rights abuses, such behavior has not been uniform and must be differentiated by group and role. In this regard, it is argued that while <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> have overwhelmingly had a negative impact on most human rights indicators, fighters in some groups have positively impacted the Right to Self-Determination. Further, the paper notes that while <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> have been large-scale perpetrators of human rights abuses, one must also consider the propaganda value of such acts because foreign fighter-led violence is more newsworthy globally than local-led violence...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} German <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> who have left for Syria and Iraq since early 2012 and make up the second largest contingent among Western <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters.</b> It draws on statistical information about German <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters,</b> but also uses case studies {{in an attempt to}} shed more detailed light on their motivations and why they became radicalized. Drawing on recently released government data, trial documents, and media reports, the article seeks to contribute to new research on the prevailing mechanisms of Jihadi radicalization. To facilitate this kind of comprehensive analysis, McCauley and Moskalenko’s Friction framework is applied to fourteen prominent German fighters, including Denis Cuspert (who served as medium-level ISIL propaganda official), Philip Bergner and Robert Baum (responsible for ISIL suicide attacks in Iraq and Syria), Kreshnik B. and Harun Pashtoon (among the first returning fighters convicted of ISIL membership and other terrorist activities). The article concludes with a discussion of countermeasures used to prevent <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> from leaving Germany, deradicalize those who have started to embrace violent ideas and/or actions, and deal with returning <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters...</b>|$|R

Nance concludes his foreword writing, [...] "This Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and <b>Foreign</b> <b>Fighter</b> Travel is a keystone study of ISIS's ability to recruit terrorists from or in their home nations to abandon all they have ever known and launch themselves as a virtually programmed corps of human guided weapons globally."
