The Duke of Devonshire, anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, offered Chatsworth House {{for the use of the}} school. The contents of the house were packed away in eleven days and 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.|$|E

Grimm detests method; according to him, it is the pedantry of letters. Those who can only arrange, would do as well to remain idle; those who can only get instruction from what has been arranged, would do as well to remain ignorant. What necessity is there <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> knowing anything else besides their trade?

60|$|We {{despatched}} private messengers to Swansea and Pembroke, {{and other}} places; {{but they all}} discouraged us from the attempt that way, and advised us to go higher towards North Wales, where the king's interest had more friends, and the Parliament no forces. Upon this we met, and resolved, and having sent several messengers that way, one of my men provided us two small vessels in a little creek near Harlech Castle, in Merionethshire. We marched away with what expedition we could, and embarked in the two vessels accordingly. It was the worst voyage sure that ever man went; for first we had no manner of accommodation <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> hay for our horses we got none, or very little, but good store of oats, which served us for our own bread as well as provender for the horses.|$|E

50|$|Livestock raising, pursued {{throughout}} Sudan {{except in}} the extremely dry areas of {{the north and the}} tsetse-fly-infested area in the far south, was almost entirely in the traditional sector.
