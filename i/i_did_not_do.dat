25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do,</b> for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act." [...] However, Sherman himself stated that [...] "f I had made up my mind to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> it ..." [...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina." [...] Historian James M. McPherson has concluded that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{said that}} Thompson, [...] "fearing that I would not obey his order, decided to {{threaten}} other state officials and {{force them to}} remove the monument if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so. A threat of heavy fines {{was his way of}} coercing obedience to that order," [...] an action that Moore sees as a violation of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> {{the good}} <b>I</b> want to <b>do,</b> but the evil <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to do—this <b>I</b> keep on <b>not</b> <b>doing.</b> Let me explain this slowly, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> the good <b>I</b> want to <b>do</b> (creating {{the good of}} a raceless society in its {{historically}} constituted terms, so, practically speaking, doing Dutch society’s reality of race differently), but the evil <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to <b>do</b> (which is thinking and doing in terms of race)—this <b>I</b> keep on <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> (so <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> race at all).|$|R

2500|$|Lavelle assumed full {{responsibility}} for reporting the strikes as protective reaction, but testified he {{was not aware of}} the four falsified after-action intelligence reports until they were brought to his attention by the Inspector General on March 9, 1972. He stated, [...] "I accepted responsibility for it even though <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> it and did not have any knowledge of the detail. It was my command and I should have known.".|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Cliff Saunders broadcast by the SABC, she said [...] "The facts of the matter are [...] <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> {{any of the things}} of which I was accused by paid witnesses." [...] She was soon interviewed by Lin Sampson for Playboy and reinforced her disagreement with the defence witnesses. In the favourable article, Sampson described the rage against Allan as [...] "the first public showing of what would become the new South African psychosis". Sunday Times defence witnesses were said to be irate that their shared publisher, Times Media, published the article. The newspaper proceeded to publish an extract of the interview to promote its sister magazine sales.|$|E
2500|$|E: Yes, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> it consciously. I {{saw all the}} sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I {{no longer had the}} strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E

2500|$|During the trial, Corby {{wrote to}} the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, saying [...] "as a father and as a leader, I plead for your help. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> this. I beg for justice. I don't know how much longer I can do this. Please bring me home." [...] Of Corby, Howard said: [...] "I feel for her. I {{understand}} why there's a lot of public sympathy for her; I would simply say that I hope justice is done and it's a fair and true verdict ... I would ask the rhetorical question: My fellow Australians, if a foreigner were to come to Australia and a foreign government were to start telling us how we should handle , we would react very angrily to that." [...] The Australian Labor Party generally supported the government's approach to the case in not wanting to interfere in Indonesia's judicial system, while Australian Greens leader Bob Brown criticised the verdict.|$|E

The only difference I did make in our mode of life was that I no longer gave him bed and board at the hostelry where I lodged in Passy, but placed the chair-bedstead in the anteroom of the office permanently at his disposal, and allowed him five sous a day for his breakfast.|$|E
