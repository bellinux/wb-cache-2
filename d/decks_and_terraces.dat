50|$|At {{about this}} time, {{the market for}} {{thermally}} modified wood expanded dramatically from its traditional application in sauna materials, to include exterior products, such as <b>decking</b> (<b>terrace)</b> <b>and</b> cladding (siding). While Ha-Serv continued to focus primarily on the Finnish sauna market, Brenstol established the Thermory brand and begin to export across Europe and to Japan and Thermory {{has become the most}} widely-recognized brand of thermally modified wood in these regions. The market for thermally modified exterior products increased very rapidly as European consumers increasingly looked for alternatives to tropical woods from Asia, Africa and South America. A Turkish producer, Nova Wood, also started producing of thermally modified wood and became a minor player in European markets. In 2012, Brenstol established an affiliate in the U.S., Thermory USA and began to expand aggressively in markets around the world. The Thermory brand has become well-established in the U.S. and Canada, and has been shipped to over 55 countries around the world.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{architecture}} {{revolves around the}} notion of closure. It is concerned with shelter, protection and differentiation. A history of openness in architecture {{has yet to be}} written. It does not see origins in the forest or the primitive hut but instead in the ocean and the boat. Open architecture is not concerned with closed rooms courtyards or squares. It is instead about platforms, <b>decks,</b> <b>terraces,</b> <b>and</b> beaches Hodges, the artist on Cook’s first voyage, was confounded by the aesthetic appeal of Pacific and Asian architecture which couldn’t be explained by reference to the architectural canon of ancient Greece. Oceanic societies lived in a way that contradicted traditional European architecture. This architecture of the new world introduced the notion of the open and provoked the introduction of the modern. The skyscraper, the suburb, the freeway are New World examples of open architecture. The negatives of openness are well known; the boredom of suburbs the waste of the freeway and the banality of the skyscraper city. Nevertheless the outcomes are sometimes sublime. The architecture of openness endlessly strives for porosity, connection, or view, rather than enclosure, shelter, or containment. The positive story to be written is about the achievement of openness as a way of examining the architecture of the Pacific Islands...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Large fans <b>and</b> <b>terraces</b> are {{frequent}} in the Khumbu Himal within the high Himalayan valleys south of Mt. Everest. These features {{are composed of}} massive matrix- and clast-supported diamicts that were formed from both hyperconcentrated flows and coarse-grained debris flows. Cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) exposure ages for boulders on fans <b>and</b> <b>terraces</b> indicate that periods of fan <b>and</b> <b>terrace</b> formation occurred at c. 16, c. 12, c. 8, c. 4 and c. 1. 5 ka, and are broadly coincident with the timing of glaciation in the region. The dating precision is insufficient to resolve whether the surfaces formed before, during or after the correlated glacial advance. However, the sedimentology, and morphostratigraphic and geomorphological relationships suggest that fan <b>and</b> <b>terrace</b> sedimentation {{in this part of}} the Himalaya primarily occurs during glacier retreat and is thus paraglacial in origin. Furthermore, modern glacial-lake outburst floods and their associated deposits are common in the Khumbu Himal as the result of glacial retreat during historical times. We therefore suggest that Late Quaternary and Holocene fan <b>and</b> <b>terrace</b> formation <b>and</b> sediment transfer are probably linked to temporal changes in discharge and sediment load caused by glacier oscillations responding to climate change. The timing of major sedimentation events in this region can be correlated with fans <b>and</b> <b>terraces</b> in other parts of the Himalaya, suggesting that major sedimentation throughout the Himalaya is synchronous and tied to regional climatic oscillations. Bedrock incision rates calculated from strath terrace ages average c...|$|R
