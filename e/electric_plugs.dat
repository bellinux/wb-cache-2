With the elevators freed from the need to carry construction materials and workmen, the tower was finally opened to the public.

Some interior work was also needed. For example, holes had been drilled in the marble floor of the memorial hall so that <b>electric</b> <b>plugs</b> could be installed for lighting fixtures. The unassigned seventh floor finally found a sponsor as well. [...] That year, the Grand Central Council of Cryptic Masonry agreed to sponsor the floor, and by year's end had raised half the funds necessary to complete and furnish the floor.|$|E

50|$|Hard rubber {{was used}} in early 20th century bowling balls; however, it was phased {{out in favor of}} other {{materials}} (the Ebonite name remains as a trade name for one of the major manufacturers of polymer balls). It has been used in <b>electric</b> <b>plugs,</b> smoking pipe mouthpieces (in competition with lucite), fountain pen bodies and nib feeds, and saxophone and clarinet mouthpieces as well as complete humidity-stable clarinets http://www.wwbw.com/Buyer-Guides-Clarinets-g25060t0.wwbw#2. Hard rubber is often seen as the wheel material in casters. It is also commonly used in physics classrooms to demonstrate static electricity because it is at or near the negative end of the triboelectric series.|$|E

Many travelling musicians {{prefer not to}} transport their own backline gear across borders and continents for fear of damage or customs hassles, which makes renting backline equipment while on tour an attractive option. Many music festivals and performance venues provide backline equipment. In some countries, all electronic and electric gear needs documentation and certification by an electrical expert {{before it can be}} brought into the country. Another issue is that some bands may travel to a country or continent which uses a different type of AC mains power and differently-shaped <b>electric</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|E

50|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power <b>plug,</b> <b>electric</b> <b>plug,</b> and plug top.

The general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket,wall socket, and wall plug.Modern British sockets for domestic use are normally manufactured as single or double units with an integral face plate and are designed to fit standard mounting boxes.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{investigate}} a realistic and low-cost deployment of large scale direct control of inelastic home appliances whose energy demand cannot be shaped, but simply deferred. The {{idea is to}} exploit 1) some simple actuators {{to be placed on}} the <b>electric</b> <b>plugs</b> for connecting or disconnecting appliances with heterogeneous control interfaces, including non-smart appliances, and 2) the Internet connections of customers for transporting the activation requests from the actuators to a centralized controller. Our solution requires no interaction with home users: in particular, it does not require them to express their energy demand in advance. A queuing theory model is derived to quantify how many users should adopt this solution in order to control a significant aggregated power load without significantly impairing their quality of service...|$|E
