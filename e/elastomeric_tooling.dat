40|$|The thesis {{contains}} {{a review of}} methods using elastomer tool, including the distribution of tools and suitability to the operations. Forming using elastomers is among the unconventional forming methods using flexible tool which is especially suitable for sheet metal forming. The material is used rubber and polyurethane. There are described properties, forming forces and other attractions of elastomers. The principle consists in replacing the fixed part of the tool flexible medium. Forming methods are divided to open tool forming and close tool forming, according {{to the construction of}} forming tool. Open tool forming includes bending and roll bending. Among the close tool forming methods is Guerin, Marform, Maslenikov, radial expanding and extrusion. The following are examples of tools and differences compared to conventional methods and liquids. The advantage of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>tool</b> is a low cost, simplicity and frugality to surface modified products. The disadvantage is a low life, low productivity and the use of large forming forces. Forming using elastomers has application in the prototypes and small series production...|$|R
40|$|The use of monochloramines in the {{potable water}} supply {{industry}} has been selected as the disinfectant method of choice due to a longer term of effectiveness and less toxic by-products than the previous choice of chlorine. In spite of the benefits exhibited {{by the use of}} monochloramines much greater rates of elastomer degradation have been noted in the water industry. The modes of attack by monochloramines on the rubber parts are still poorly understood. A common ingredient in nearly all elastomer formulations is carbon black. In addition to its role as a filler material, carbon black is also known to add strength and durability to the elastomer. Degradation of average particle size showing that carbon black particles dissolve into the invasive liquid medium can be observed using phase images produced by atomic force microscopy. The nanoscale size of the carbon black particles makes the use of the AFM an ideal investigative <b>tool.</b> <b>Elastomeric</b> properties of the rubber coupons exhibit similar trends to the degradation of the carbon black material in the polymer matrix. Diffusion coefficients approximated by use of a simplified form of Fick 2 ̆ 7 s second law also shows a similar trend. Use of monochloramines as a disinfectant by the water supply industry produce fewer toxic by-products and maintain a longer useful potable water life than chlorine; however, rapid degradation of rubber parts will continue unless more suitable formulations can be found...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for nanostructured polymeric surfaces for many scientific and commercial applications including the fields of cell and tissue engineering, where {{the study of the}} ways that cells interact with their environment holds great potential for the future of regenerative medicine. Current replication based fabrication techniques, such as hot embossing, which are used to produce nanostructured surfaces for this type of research are not fast enough {{to keep up with the}} growing demand for them. Injection moulding offers a high throughput alternative to these processes and can upscale the production of nanopatterned samples by several orders of magnitude. However, the nickel moulds traditionally used to injection mould micro- and nanostructures are limited to producing recessed features due to the rate at which the injected polymer cools upon contact with it. In order to replicate raised features (e. g. pillars) the polymer needs enough time to fill the nanoscale cavities of the mould before freezing. A solution to this limitation of nickel tooling is devised and implemented, using a thermally insulating tooling material that facilitates the formation of nanopillars by injection moulding. This tooling material can be patterned by a range of fabrication techniques including photolithography and nanoimprint lithography. The tooling can be used to replicate nanopatterns over underlying micron and millimetre scale topographies. This flexible solution enables the large volume production of samples containing raised poly(carbonate) nanopillars without significantly compromising cycle time. Following this, the technique is adapted in an attempt to replicate high aspect ratio nanostructures. In this section a range of non-adhesive surface coatings are tested for their abilities to enhance the replication process through the systematic analysis of their durability and the replication fidelity that they enable. Nanopillars with aspect ratios of greater than 10 : 1 are successfully produced and are used to fabricate surfaces for cell engineering research. This success is also demonstrative of the technique’s potential to mass produce nanostructures for other applications such as non-reflective and dry adhesive surfaces. Finally, a study is undertaken to replicate microstructures with an <b>elastomeric</b> polymer. The <b>tooling</b> solution is used to assess the minimum feature size that can be replicated with this polymer and how processing parameters and non-adhesive coatings can improve this. This thesis documents the development of a range of enabling techniques which add to the existing toolbox of nanofabrication technologies. They address a growing demand for nanostructured polymeric surfaces in cell and tissue engineering research, whilst remaining open and adaptable to any application that requires the high throughput production of nanopatterned polymeric samples...|$|R
