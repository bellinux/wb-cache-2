40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{dynamics}} {{of a system}} composed by two heavy quarks is well {{understood in terms of}} a potential interaction (static plus relativistic corrections) obtained from the semirelativistic reduction of the QCD dynamics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. If {{at least one of the}} quarks is light the system behaves relativistically (the light quark can no more be considered static) and a pure relativistic treatment becomes necessary (via Dirac or Bethe [...] Salpeter equations). A lot of phenomenologically justified relativistic equations can be found in the literature but up to now we miss a relativistic treatment which follows directly from QCD. Our work <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction.</b> In order to simplify the problem we focus on the heavylight mesons in the non-recoil limit (i. e. infinitely heavy antiquark).

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} for the robotics community is to deploy robots which can reliably operate in real world scenarios together with humans. A crucial requirement for legged robots is the capability to properly balance on their feet, rejecting external disturbances. iCub is a state-of-the-art humanoid robot which has only recently started to balance on its feet. While the current balancing controller has proved successful in various scenarios, it still misses the capability to properly react to strong pushes by taking steps. This paper <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction.</b> It proposes and implements a control strategy based on the Capture Point concept [1]. Instead of relying on position control, like most of Capture Point related approaches, the proposed strategy generates references for the momentum-based torque controller already implemented on the iCub, thus extending its capabilities to react to external disturbances, while retaining the advantages of torque control when interacting with the environment. Experiments in the Gazebo simulator and on the iCub humanoid robot validate the proposed strategy...|$|E

According to these studies, a highly promising solution consists in looking to achieve the supporting of learners’ motivation and engagement via adaptation of pedagogical scenarios. This paper <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> by examining and trying to analyze the literature around the dropout issue in MOOCs.

40|$|Minimalism, in {{grammatical}} theorizing (Chomsky 1995) led to simpler linguistic {{devices and}} a better focalization of the core properties of the structure-building engine: a lexicon and a free (recursive) phrase formation operation, dubbed Merge, are the basic components that serve in building syntactic structures. Here I suggest that looking at the elementary restrictions that apply to free Merge (i. e. selection and licensing of functional features), we could conclude that a re-orientation of the syntactic derivation (from bottom-up/right-left to top-down/left-right) is necessary to make the theory simpler, especially for long-distance (filler-gap) dependencies, and empirically more adequate: if our structure building operations would roughly assemble lexical items in the order they were pronounced (Phillips 1996, Chesi 2004 - 2012 a. o.), on-line performance data could better fit the grammatical model, without resorting to external “performance factors”.

Potential policy instruments for Norway include feed-in tariffs, green certificates under quota obligations, and subsidies for research and development, and are discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses.
