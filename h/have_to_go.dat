5|$|Alabama′s rush defense {{considerably}} {{improved in}} 2008. After giving up 128.4 rushing {{yards a game}} in 2007, the Crimson Tide only allowed 78.8 yards per game in 2008. “As far as one guy who has changed our team more than any, you’d <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with Terrence,” offensive lineman Mike Johnson said. Cody was subsequently given the team’s Defensive Achievement Award for a newcomer who has {{played a critical role}} in the effectiveness of his unit.|$|E
5|$|At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has {{introduced}} the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, counters 6A, allowing passengers {{to check in}} and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to an airline representative at the counters.|$|E

5|$|Ever 17 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the game's story. At certain points, they get to make a choice, which affects the {{direction}} of the story, leading to eleven possible different endings. The whole plot is not revealed in just one ending; instead, the player has to play through the game multiple times, with each playthrough revealing new information. After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, so that they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{back to the beginning of}} the game for each playthrough.|$|E
5|$|In the American Azteca registry, horses with American Paint Horse (APHA) {{breeding}} {{are also}} allowed. However, horses {{with more than}} 25 percent Thoroughbred blood in their pedigrees (common in many Paints and Quarter Horses) within four generations cannot be registered. American Aztecas have four categories of registration based on the relative degree of blood from each foundation breed, seeking an ideal blend of 3/8 Quarter Horse and 5/8 Andalusian. Unlike their Mexican counterparts, they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through physical inspections before being registered.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the faith}} are {{defensive}} {{of the fact that}} some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality in leadership impossible. They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to separate women's temples. As with practices of niddah in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the menstrual cycle lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time. Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women.|$|E

5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{indicated}} that Holloway {{did not appear}} on any nighttime surveillance camera footage of her hotel's lobby; however, Twitty has made varying statements {{as to whether the}} cameras were operational that night. According to an April 19, 2006, statement made by Twitty, the video cameras at the Holiday Inn were not functioning the night Holloway vanished. Twitty has made other statements indicating that they were working, and has stated so in her book. Police Commissioner Jan van der Straaten —the initial head of the investigation until his 2005 retirement— said that Holloway did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the lobby to return to her room.|$|E

5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up, then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E
5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control {{goes down to}} West Road by the intersection of Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station on this side do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E

5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge his crime, and then would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, {{he would have to}} write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E

5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} {{apparent lack of}} playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{leads the}} kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Hell. He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E
5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E
