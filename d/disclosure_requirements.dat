40|$|The {{requirement}} that recipients of patents disclose {{information about their}} inventions is a fundamental attribute of patent systems. Yet, despite being a core element of patent law, the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> is rarely thought of in those terms; rather, it is conventionally approached by first dissecting it in two ways: {{in terms of its}} doctrinal mechanisms (primarily enablement and written description) and in terms of its theoretical basis. While this dissection can be useful in understanding issues within the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement,</b> the resulting compartmentalization also imposes limits on this approach. This Essay approaches patent law’s <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> from a more holistic perspective, treating it as a foundational component of patent law that can be studied and analyzed as a collective whole. In doing so, this Essay brings together different perspectives on the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement,</b> explaining how its seemingly independent purposes are actually closely intertwined and exploring the consequences for the patent law that flow from that relationship...|$|R
40|$|Dye (1991) {{suggests}} that when audit fees are disclosed, auditor independence will be improved {{because there are}} no quasi-rents to influence audit opinion and the public could assess the independence of the auditors. According to DeAngelo (1981 a), however, disclosure of audit fees is irrelevant to the issuance of audit opinion because transaction costs, which give rise to quasi-rents, could not be affected by disclosure of audit fees. This paper examines this controversy by investigating the issuance of a going concern modified audit opinion before and after the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> of the Securities and Exchange Commission (2000). The results show that financial statements issued after the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> {{are more likely to be}} associated with a going concern opinion than those issued before the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement.</b> These results are robust to various sensitivity tests, including the control for the effect of economic factors, auditor reporting conservatism, and auditor reporting accuracy. In addition, it is found that firms before (after) the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> are more (less) likely to receive a going concern opinion if audit fees were (were not) disclosed. Hence, this paper provides evidence to suggest that disclosure of audit fees is associated with enhanced auditor independence, and thus supports Dye's (1991) theory.

40|$|Empirical {{findings}} {{state that}} the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> might be a reason for firms to rely on secrecy rather than patents to protect their inventions. We choose a dynamic framework {{in which we can}} explicitly analyze the patenting decision reflecting the tradeoff between a positive protective effect and a negative effect due to the required disclosure of the protected invention. In spite of a patent, the inventor's rival may still enter the market with a non-infringing product. Measuring the technological lead of the inventor by a time advantage he has compared with his rival, we show that if his headstart exceeds a critical threshold, he will not patent and rather rely on secrecy. patenting decision, secrecy, <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement,</b> patent height, vertical product differentiation,...|$|R

25|$|Because Medicare offers statutorily {{determined}} benefits, {{its coverage}} policies and payment rates are publicly known, and all enrollees {{are entitled to}} the same coverage. In the private insurance market, plans can be tailored to offer different benefits to different customers, enabling individuals to reduce coverage costs while assuming risks for care that is not covered. Insurers, however, have far fewer <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> than Medicare, and studies show that customers {{in the private sector}} can find it difficult to know what their policy covers. and at what cost. Moreover, since Medicare collects data about utilization and costs for its enrollees—data that private insurers treat as trade secrets—it gives researchers key information about health care system performance.|$|E
25|$|Hedge {{funds are}} {{structured}} to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated) {{and are not}} required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements.</b> This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.|$|E
25|$|Since {{hedge funds}} are private {{entities}} and have few public <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements,</b> this is sometimes {{perceived as a}} lack of transparency. Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud. New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 require hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements. The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions and leverage exposure.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, in {{response}} to lobbying scandals involving, among others, Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham, Congress passed a lobbying and ethics reform package to which Vitter proposed a package of five amendments. The Senate approved three that limited which legislators' spouses could lobby the Senate, created criminal penalties for legislators and executive branch officials who falsify financial reports, and doubled the penalties for lobbyists who failed to comply with <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements.</b> The Senate rejected prohibiting legislators from paying their families with campaign funds with some saying it was unrelated to the current legislation and others that the payments were not a problem. Additionally, they tabled his proposal to define Indian tribes as corporations and its members as stockholders {{so that they are}} required to contribute to candidates through political action committees instead of their tribal treasury. Senators objected saying that they are already subjected to campaign laws for unincorporated entities and individuals and that the proposal was singling them out unfairly.

40|$|In KSR International Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., the Supreme Court {{rejected}} the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s rigid {{application of the}} teaching, suggestion, or motivation test (TSM test), {{and replaced it with}} an expansive and flexible approach, in determining the question of obviousness. Nevertheless, an expansive and flexible approach to obviousness may not be consistent with the international norms of practice if it is applied literally. The U. S. Patent and Trademark Office 2 ̆ 7 s literal application of the decision has essentially created another set of inflexible rules, which is contrary to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s intent. The Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in In re Kubin cautiously revived obvious to try in its obviousness jurisprudence. However, In re Kubin may not represent a clear precedent for determining obviousness in the biotechnological context. Certain key technological factual issues were unclear when the court was making its judgment. Commentators have suggested that a fairly high obviousness threshold coupled with a fairly low <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> will produce a few very powerful patents in uncertain industries. Nevertheless, lowering the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> in the biotechnological context would provide inventors incentives to retain more know-how and thus frustrate the purposes of the existing statutory exemptions, namely the medical practice exemption under 35 U. S. C. § 287 (c) and the so called FDA exemption under 35 U. S. C. § 271 (e) (1). Therefore, this Article suggests that the high <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> for biotechnological patent applications should not be sacrificed as a tradeoff for a heightened obviousness standard...|$|R
