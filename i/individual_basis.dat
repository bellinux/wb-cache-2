5|$|Early Lingbao ritual {{was mostly}} done on an <b>individual</b> <b>basis,</b> {{either in a}} {{meditation}} chamber, or the courtyard of a house. Early practitioners were not professional priests, but rather 'students of the Dao'. Later on, as the Lingbao movement developed religious institutions and an established clergy, ritual practice became more of a communal rite.|$|E
5|$|Some {{confusion}} {{still exists}} {{as to what}} treatments a patient may receive in hospice care. Hospices may provide treatments that have been traditionally regarded as curative, including radiation therapy or antibiotics, if these are administered to improve quality of life. Determination of appropriate treatment is made by medical personnel on an <b>individual</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|E

Although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an <b>individual</b> <b>basis,</b> ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.|$|E

This theory states that an <b>individual’s</b> <b>basis</b> of judgment of a stimulus {{is based on}} their prior experiences {{as well as their}} recollections of how they perceived similar stimuli in the past. It is a theory used to interpret psychological findings, and it is still used today.|$|R

5|$|NATO {{provides}} feedback {{as well as}} {{technical advice}} to each country and evaluates its progress on an <b>individual</b> <b>basis.</b> Once a country is agreed to meet the requirements, NATO can issue that country an invitation to begin accession talks. Currently, two countries have a Membership Action Plan: Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia.. Former MAP participants were Albania and Croatia between May 2002 and April 2009, and Montenegro between December 2009 and June 2017, when they joined NATO. The final accession process, once invited, involves five steps {{leading up to the}} signing of the accession protocols and the acceptance and ratification of those protocols by the governments of the current NATO members.|$|E

5000|$|Illusionism is {{a metaphysical}} theory first propounded by {{professor}} Saul Smilansky of the University of Haifa. It holds {{that people have}} illusory beliefs about free will. Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society. Giving up a belief in hard incompatibilism, argues Smilansky, removes an <b>individual's</b> <b>basis</b> {{for a sense of}} self-worth {{in his or her own}} achievements. It is [...] "extremely damaging to our view of ourselves, to our sense of achievement, worth, and self-respect".|$|R

5|$|While genetic {{influences}} {{are important}} to understanding obesity, they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally. Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an <b>individual</b> <b>basis,</b> {{the cause of the}} shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.|$|E
5|$|Mares can be {{of several}} origins and be listed as facteur de selle français. Thoroughbred, AQPS, pure or {{crossbred}} Anglo-Arabians and French Trotting horses may also qualify under this designation, as do mares that {{are the product of}} two facteur de selle français horses. Mares belonging to other saddle horse breeds recognized by the European Union (EU) are also listed in this category. Pure and crossbred Arabians, saddle breeds not recognized by the EU and some other mares may be listed on an <b>individual</b> <b>basis</b> by performing at a high level in show jumping, three-day eventing or dressage competition. If mares come from countries or territories that {{do not have access to}} high-level competitions, they may be granted special listing status.|$|E

Furthermore, the cast including Pine, Quinto and Zoe Saldana were also recognised on an <b>individual</b> <b>basis.</b> The most success received by the film was at the Scream Awards where it took home six awards in a single ceremony out of seventeen nominations. Amongst the nominations received by the film, there were three at the British Academy Film Awards, five at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards, four at the People's Choice Awards, and single nominations at both the Grammy Awards, and the Writers Guild of America Awards. The film was also the first in the Star Trek franchise to win an Academy Award, with Barney Burman, Mindy Hall and Joel Harlow winning for Best Makeup and Hairstyling.|$|E

5|$|If {{infinite}} matrices {{are used}} to describe linear maps, then only those matrices can be used all of whose columns have but {{a finite number of}} nonzero entries, for the following reason. For a matrix A to describe a linear map f: V→W, bases for both spaces must have been chosen; recall that by definition this means that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a (finite) linear combination of basis vectors, so that written as a (column) vectorv of coefficients, only finitely many entries v'i are nonzero. Now the columns of A describe the images by f of <b>individual</b> <b>basis</b> vectors of V in the basis of W, which is only meaningful if these columns have only finitely many nonzero entries. There is no restriction on the rows of A however: in the product A·v there are only finitely many nonzero coefficients of v involved, so every one of its entries, even if it is given as an infinite sum of products, involves only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore well defined. Moreover, this amounts to forming a linear combination of the columns of A that effectively involves only finitely many of them, whence the result has only finitely many nonzero entries, because each of those columns do. One also sees that products of two matrices of the given type is well defined (provided as usual that the column-index and row-index sets match), is again of the same type, and corresponds to the composition of linear maps.|$|E
