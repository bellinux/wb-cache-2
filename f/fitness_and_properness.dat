40|$|On 29 th - 30 th March 2007, SUERF and the Central Bank of Cyprus jointly {{organized}} a Seminar: Corporate Governance in Financial Institutions. The {{papers in the}} present publication {{are based on a}} sample of the presentations at the Seminar. Together, the papers illuminate a number of key issues in corporate governance in a variety of financial firms. In the first paper based on a keynote address, Spyros G. Stavrinakis, Central Bank of Cyprus gives an overview of the legal framework for corporate governance in financial institutions in Cyprus. According to a Central BankDirective issued in 2006, implementation of corporate governance principles is mandatory for all banks incorporated in Cyprus and their overseas branches and for some Cyprus branches of foreign banks domiciled outside the European Economic Area. Banks are obliged to have a robust internal governance framework, consistent lines of reporting and effective risk identification, management, monitoring and reporting procedures for all the risks to which credit institutions are actually or potentially exposed. The board of directors should take the lead in establishing and approving ethical standards and corporate values for itself and for the bank's senior executive management. Potential conflicts of interest should be identified, prevented or appropriately managed. Each bank should maintain a compliance function that monitors compliance with rules, regulations and policies. Clear lines of responsibility and accountability should be set and enforced. New members {{of the board of directors}} as well as the senior executive managers of banks have to be vetted and approved by the Central Bank of Cyprus for their " <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> <b>properness.</b> " In order to ensure transparency concerning the implementation of the principles, each bank's corporate governance framework should be disclosed in the bank's annual report and on its public website. In the second paper by Christian Harm, University of Muenster, "The Governance of the Banking Firm" the author builds on the literatures on corporate governance and financial regulation. In relation to governance of financial institutions, agency theory has both merits and shortcomings. It provides good explanations in many delegation situations but it has severe difficulties in dealing with institutions with several stakeholders and complex objective functions for the management. Firms guided by shareholder value may work more effectively than firms guided by stakeholder cacophony. Depositors are important stakeholders in banks. Since they are typically incapable of managing the supervision of their claims on the bank, they rely on regulators to do it for them. Remuneration systems for bank managers should provide proper incentives. According to the author, incentives should be structured such as to reward particular strategic achievements. Banks can apply executive stock option plans, but should confine options to a secondary place behind other long-term incentives based on success criteria that further shareholder interests without compromising the regulatory mission. Such an incentive framework tends, however, to be very complex so that the general ambiguities associated with the concept of governance could imply that in the banking firm, selecting managers with a proper intrinsic motivation may be superior to defining complex remuneration programs. In the third paper "Corporate Governance Issues in Non-Shareholder Value Financial Institutions: ACase Study of Mutual Building Societies in the UK", David T. Llewellyn, Loughborough University, focuses on corporate governance in non-incorporated financial firms. The author describes the relevant stakeholders and the nature of agency problems in different types of financial firms. He compares monitoring mechanisms, incentives, abilities and feasibilities of managers and members of mutuals. Mutuality raises specific corporate governance issues: Corporate governance is less clearly defined because the firm's objectives are less clearly defined. Conflicts of interest between managers and owners are less easily identified and it is more difficult to create management incentives. The almost exclusive source of capital is retained profits and each member has a non-exclusive and non-marketable claim to residual net worth. Voting rights are typically not proportional to the size of the ownership stake. There is no market in ownership claims and therefore no effective market in corporate control. Consequently, there is ample scope for mutuals to be inefficient. There is, however, no evidence that the efficiency and performance of mutuals are poorer that that of incorporated financial firms. In the fourth paper "Corporate Governance in Emerging Market Banks", Bridget Gandy, Fitch Ratings Ltd., and her co-authors from the rating agency look at the framework for corporate governance of banks in a sample of emerging market countries. Since the crisis in the late 1990 s in Latin America and Asia, there has been a marked improvement in corporate governance of financial institutions in the regions under observation. Many countries have taken legal steps to develop functioning market economies with a view to the need to satisfy the demands of international capital markets. Several banks have listed their shares on stock exchanges in developed markets and foreign bank ownership and involvement in local banking systems have increased. In Central and Eastern Europe, countries' desire for EU-accession has impacted on the development of their corporate governance systems. At the individual bank level, Fitch Ratings looks at bank board independence and quality, oversight and the importance of related party transactions, the integrity of the audit process, acceptability of executive and director remuneration, ownership structures and transparency. In evaluating the quality of governance at the country level, the authors apply a three-pillar approach in line with Montesquieu: Powers and responsibilities need to be separated between a representative legislature, a competent and accountable executive branch and a fair and independent judiciary. The paper contains an interesting table in which a number of key regulatory initiatives in a sample of emerging market countries are compared. The authors point out that large scale privatizations have reduced the importance of state-owned banks in many countries. There are, however, still several examples with complex holding structures involving banks with potential negative implications for corporate governance quality and problems with related party transactions. Acquisitions by foreign banks with developed corporate governance standards have generally had a positive impact and also listing of bank shares on foreign stock exchanges with tough disclosure and transparency requirements have contributed positively to the quality of corporate governance in emerging market banks. Read together, the four papers give a good overview of the development of corporate governance practices and remaining problems in financial institutions of different types and with domicile in different countries...|$|E

Data on 544 children were collected and analysed (130 SDC, 414 non-SDC, mean age = 8. 0 +/- 0. 7). Physical fitness was measured with tests for cardiovascular <b>and</b> muscular <b>fitness.</b> Academic performance was evaluated using scores on mathematics, spelling and reading. SDC did not differ on physical fitness, compared with non-SDC, but scored significantly lower on academic performance. In the total group, multilevel analysis showed positive associations between cardiovascular <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> mathematics (beta = 0. 23), <b>and</b> between cardiovascular <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> spelling (beta = 0. 16), but not with reading.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{present study}} aimed: (1) {{to test the}} {{associations}} of overall physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> subjective well-being with fibromyalgia severity and (2) {{to determine whether the}} combination of overall physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> subjective well-being is associated with fibromyalgia severity among adult women patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 424 participants from Andalusia, southern Spain. Overall physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> the components of subjective well-being (positive affect, negative affect and cognitive well-being), and fibromyalgia severity were assessed using the Functional Senior Physical Fitness Test Battery, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: Overall physical fitness (β = -. 23), positive affect (β = -. 18), negative affect (β =. 26), and cognitive well-being (β = -. 18) were all associated with fibromyalgia severity. The patients with the highest overall physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> increased subjective well-being reported ~ 15 % lower fibromyalgia severity than those with the lowest <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> poorest subjective well-being (Cohen's d > 1. 0). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that higher levels of overall physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> subjective well-being are independently associated with lower fibromyalgia severity. Moreover, patients with higher overall physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> increased subjective well-being (high positive affect, low negative affect, or high cognitive well-being) reported lower fibromyalgia severity than those with low levels of overall physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> subjective well-being...|$|R
40|$|Research has {{illustrated}} the interrelatedness of childhood physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> psychological wellbeing, psychological wellbeing and academic achievement, {{as well as}} physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement.

This paper develops a new refinement criterion, called the local best response (LBR) criterion, that more accurately and concisely captures {{the concept of}} a plausible Nash equilibrium. This criterion is also conceptually simpler than the standard refinement criteria, since it does not depend on out-of-equilibrium, counterfactual, or limit arguments, and it does not require the addition of a belief system to the usual assumptions of noncooperative game theory. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{relationship}} between physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement in children has received much attention, however, whether executive functioning plays a mediating {{role in this}} relationship is unclear. The {{aim of this study}} therefore was to investigate the relationships between physical <b>fitness,</b> executive functioning, <b>and</b> academic achievement, more specifically to test whether the {{relationship between}} physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement is direct or indirect, via executive functioning. Design: Cross-sectional. Method: This study examined 263 children (145 boys, 118 girls), aged 7 - 12 years, who performed tests on physical <b>fitness,</b> executive functioning, <b>and</b> academic achievement. Results: In a structural equation model linking physical fitness to executive functioning and academic achievement there was a significant relationship between physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> executive functioning (r =. 43, R- 2 =. 19) and academic achievement (r =. 33, R- 2 =. 11). Adding a relationship from executive functioning to academic achievement resulted in a non-significant direct link between physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement (r = -. 08, R- 2 =. 006). However, a significant indirect relation through executive functioning persisted. The indirect relation between <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement (r =. 41), was stronger than both the direct and total relation (r =. 33). Conclusion: Executive functioning thus served as a mediator in the relation between physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement. This highlights the importance of including executive functioning when studying the relationship between physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement in children. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Background Not only {{in adults}} {{but also in}} {{children}} and adolescents, obesity increases the risk for several health disorders. In turn, many factors including genetic variations and environmental influences (e. g. physical activity) {{increase the risk of}} obesity. For instance, 25 to 40 percent of people inherit a predisposition for a high body mass index (BMI). The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize current cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on physical activity, <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> overweight in adolescents and to identify mediator and moderator effects by evaluating the interaction between these three parameters. Methods The electronic academic databases PubMed, SportDiscus, WEB OF KNOWLEDGE and Ovid were searched for studies on physical activity, <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> overweight in adolescents aged 11 to 19 years (cross-sectional studies) and in adolescents up to 23 years old (longitudinal studies) published in English in or after 2000. Results Twelve cross-sectional and two longitudinal studies were included. Only four studies analyzed the interaction among physical activity, <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> overweight in adolescents and reported inconsistent results. All other studies analyzed the relationship between either physical activity and overweight, or between <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> overweight. Overweight—here including obesity—was inversely related to physical activity. Similarly, all studies reported inverse relations between physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> overweight. Mediator and moderator effects were detected in the interrelationship of BMI, <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> physical activity. Overall, a distinction of excessive body weight as cause or effect of low levels of physical activity <b>and</b> <b>fitness</b> is lacking. Conclusions The small number of studies on the interrelationship of BMI, <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> physical activity emphasizes the need for longitudinal studies that would reveal 1) the causality between physical activity <b>and</b> overweight / <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> overweight and 2) the causal interrelationships among overweight, physical activity <b>and</b> <b>fitness.</b> These results must be carefully interpreted given the lack of distinction between self-reported and objective physical activity and that studies analyzing the metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular disease were not considered. The importance of physical activity or fitness in predicting overweight remains unknown. </p...|$|R
