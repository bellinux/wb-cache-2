50|$|This {{method of}} using large stone blocks proved expensive, with one 1890 {{estimate}} being that a Bermuda house cost {{three times more}} than it should. The main cause of this expense was high labour costs, though the rarity of building-quality limestone also contributed. Interestingly enough, this did not prove expensive enough to price the poor - particularly blacks - out of the market, thus restricting the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>shanty</b> <b>towns.</b>|$|E
50|$|During the Spanish Civil War, gitanos {{were not}} persecuted for their {{ethnicity}} by either side. Under Franco, Gitanos were often harassed or simply ignored, although {{their children were}} educated, sometimes forcibly, much as all Spaniards are nowadays. On the other hand, Andalusian and gitano culture was instrumentalized in the country's tourist promotion strategy which focused on the south to exalt the uniqueness of Spanish culture. However, the country's industrialization negatively affected gitanos as the migration of rural Spaniards to major cities led to the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> around urban areas with a consequent explosion in birth rates and a drastic fall {{in the quality of}} living and an abandonment of traditional professions. Traditional Gitano neighbourhoods such as Triana in Seville became gentrified and gitanos were slowly pushed out to the periphery and these new shanty towns.|$|E

The background under which <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> take shape is comprehensively analyzed and the connotation of renovation project <b>of</b> <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> is clearly defined. Based on an extensive range of practical investigations, several questions existing in renovation project management <b>of</b> Chinese <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> are concluded. Furthermore, several countermeasures and suggestions aiming at improving renovation project management <b>of</b> <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> are put forward, with an aim to play an active driving role in the completion of renovation project <b>of</b> <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> with high efficiency, quality and benefit as scheduled...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, global {{population}} growth has largely been focused in Third World countries (which often have higher birth rates than developed countries).

5|$|The {{population}} of Lima played an ambivalent {{role in the}} 1821–1824 Peruvian War of Independence; the city suffered exactions from Royalist and Patriot armies alike.

After the war, the city went through a period of demographic expansion and urban renewal. Population growth accelerated in the 1940s spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru.

By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 {{within a few years}} of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in the town, at first administrators within a sovereign sultanate, in 1906.

40|$|The rapid {{population}} growth has brought some obvious problems which include the illegal settlement on land, a lack {{of housing and urban}} services, and unemployment. Local governments have not provided solutions to these problems and this has resulted in central cities becoming <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> with very high population densities. Therefore, shantytown redevelopment is the imperative task of urban construction and development. It is a potential way to promote economic and urban growth, consequently to improve livelihood and the inevitably to achieve the goal of creating a sustainable city, a harmonious society and liveable environment. It is also a significant approach to undertake the problem of low-income households with less affordability of housing. Thesis bases on case study <b>of</b> <b>shanty</b> <b>town</b> redevelopment project in Jinan. It will explain shanty redevelopment project policy and implementation process thereby highlighting redevelopment impact on livelihood of urban poor. Finally, recommendation and alternative strategies will be given to address issues caused by the redevelopment project...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{and accounts}} for patterns of income maintenance among elderly <b>shanty</b> <b>town</b> residents in Greater Buenos Aires (GBA), Argentina. It uses a framework which includes both macro-level institutional responses to ageing (such as national pension and assistance programmes) and responses at the micro-level (individual and household strategies). First, the thesis {{accounts for the}} high proportion of elderly in Argentina and explains the origin <b>of</b> <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> in GBA. This is followed by {{an analysis of the}} evolution of official social security programmes at the national and local levels {{and the extent to which}} gaps in them have been filled by non-state institutions. Particular attention is paid to the up-grading of limited, pluralistic initiatives in the early twentieth century, the imposition of a public sector welfare monopoly in the 1940 s and the gradual reintroduction of the voluntary and private sectors since the 1970 s. Despite the development of a complex bureaucratic apparatus, the mismanagement of insurance funds and an inconsistent commitment to assistance financing prevented universal state protection for the elderly. Case studies <b>of</b> three <b>shanty</b> <b>towns</b> draw attention to the significance of community initiatives for elderly welfare. Whilst these perform a number of functions, they serve primarily as conduits for resources from supra-local state and non-state agencies. A questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews demonstrate the economic dynamics of individual households containing elderly members. It is shown that most elderly combine income from a number of sources, including pensions, continued employment and family support and that the relative importance of these different sources is strongly influenced by their gender and labour histories. The significance of bureaucratic obstacles and disinformation in preventing access to support from state programmes is also highlighted...|$|R
