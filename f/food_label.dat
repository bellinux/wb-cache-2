40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} ethical <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> from a consumer perspective and makes recommendations to the food industry and regulators regarding ethical <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> {{in order to satisfy}} consumers’ food-labelling needs. Various studies have found that many consumers have negative perceptions regarding <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> However, research on consumers’ perspectives regarding ethical <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> has been accorded little attention. This article addresses this topic through a review of the relevant literature of mostly quantitative research, but also includes qualitative and mixed method studies. The article examines such aspects as the trustworthiness of claims on <b>food</b> <b>labels,</b> intelligibility of label information, listing of <b>food</b> additives on <b>labels,</b> and labelling of genetically modified foods. As negative perspectives on <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> are likely to affect consumers’ decision making regarding the purchasing of food products, the food industry must realise their responsibility to provide ethical <b>food</b> <b>labels.</b> The <b>food</b> industry and regulators should aim to provide risk communication and intelligible information through ethical <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> and consumer education programmes on <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> Consumers {{need to be aware of}} their right to know what they are purchasing through ethical <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> and take a stand in this regard...|$|R

40|$|Liberalization of trade, {{globalization}} {{and development in}} food science and technology has resulted {{in an increase in}} trade and consumption of pre-packaged <b>foods.</b> Reading <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> information is important to assist in making informed choices of food. This study determined level of awareness on pre-packaged <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> information among consumers in Ilala Municipality, their perception on the importance of such information and difficulties encountered in reading and using pre- packaged <b>food</b> <b>labels.</b> A descriptive cross- sectional study was conducted in Ilala Municipality from July to August, 2012. A questionnaire with both close and open ended questions was used to collect information from 208 consumers who were found purchasing prepackaged foods in selected supermarkets (Uchumi, Shoprite, Imalaseko, Mek One and TSN). The obtained data were computed to determine relationships and associations between various factors and the use of <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> information among consumers in the area of study. Awareness and use of pre-packaged <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> information was found to be low among consumers in Ilala municipality. Findings showed that only a quarter of the study respondents had high awareness on <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> Health concerns, religious beliefs and the need to know characteristics of food, motivate consumers to read prepackaged <b>food</b> <b>labels.</b> Difficulties encountered in reading <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> included small font sizes, use of scientific and technical language as well as the use of unfamiliar language. Circumstances in which consumers purchase pre-packaged food without consulting the respective labels include time constraint and purchase of routine food products. Awareness and use of pre-packaged <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> information was significantly associated with age, occupation and education level of respondents. People who read <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> concentrated on ingredients and expiry. It is therefore recommended that deliberate efforts should be taken to improve <b>food</b> <b>labelling,</b> provide education to consumers to raise their awareness and use of <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> information as well as develop a consumer guide on <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|On 11 July 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{issued a}} {{regulation}} requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements. The new labeling rule became mandatory across the board, even {{for companies that}} petitioned for extensions, on 1 January 2008. However, unlike in many other countries, trans fat levels of less than 0.5grams per serving can be listed as 0grams trans fat on the <b>food</b> <b>label.</b> According to {{a study published in}} the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, without an interpretive footnote or further information on recommended daily value, many consumers do not know how to interpret the meaning of trans fat content on the Nutrition Facts panel. In fact, without specific prior knowledge about trans fat and its negative health effects, consumers, including those at risk for heart disease, may misinterpret nutrient information provided on the panel. The FDA did not approve nutrient content claims such as [...] "trans fat free" [...] or [...] "low trans fat", as they could not determine a [...] "recommended daily value". Nevertheless, the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods. However, there is no requirement to list trans fats on institutional food packaging; thus bulk purchasers such as schools, hospitals, jails and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items.|$|E

40|$|Executive summary While Hong Kong {{consumers}} are increasingly concerned with {{food safety and}} a healthy diet, their usage of <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> during purchase remains significantly low. In order to prospect for effective moves in the future, one concordant step for both the government and pre-packaged food manufacturers is to understand the consumers’ perceptions and usage of <b>food</b> <b>labels.</b> This research explores what factors lead to such phenomenon and subsequently its implications in Hong Kong. The research also examines the behavioral variations of consumers in processing <b>food</b> <b>labels.</b> The study begins with a literature review to construct research hypotheses, covering aspects of the current practices and regulations in the market, and the reported studies of <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> from overseas. The primary research focuses on the perceptions, information sensitivity, potential biasing filters and processing involvement of the <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> among Hong Kong consumers. The study finds that the various internal biasing filters interact with respondents’ perceived benefits and sensitivity to <b>food</b> <b>labels,</b> which further affect the processing involvement. These findings may help to explain the current low and incomplete usage of <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> among Hong Kong consumers.

40|$|In the United States, {{there has}} been fierce debate over state, federal and {{international}} efforts to engage in genetically modified <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> (GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling).</b> A grassroots coalition of consumers, environmentalists, organic farmers, and the food movement has pushed for law reform in respect of GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> The Just Label It campaign has encouraged United States consumers to send comments to the United States Food and Drug Administration to <b>label</b> genetically modified <b>foods.</b> This Chapter explores the various justifications made in respect of genetically modified <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> There has been a considerable effort to portray the issue of GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> as one of consumer rights as part of ‘the right to know’. There {{has been a significant}} battle amongst farmers over GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> – with organic farmers and biotechnology companies, fighting for precedence. There has also been a significant discussion about the use of GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> as a form of environmental legislation. The prescriptions in GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> regulations may serve to promote eco-labelling, and deter greenwashing. There has been a significant debate over whether GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> may serve to regulate corporations – particularly from the food, agriculture, and biotechnology industries. There are significant issues about the interaction between intellectual property laws – particularly in respect of trade mark law and consumer protection – and regulatory proposals focused upon biotechnology. There has been a lack of international harmonization in respect of GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> As such, {{there has been}} a major use of comparative arguments about regulator models in respect of <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> There has also been a discussion about international law, particularly with the emergence of sweeping regional trade proposals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. This Chapter considers the United States debates over genetically modified <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> – at state, federal, and international levels. The battles often involved the use of citizen-initiated referenda. The policy conflicts have been policy-centric disputes – pitting organic farmers, consumers, and environmentalists against the food industry and biotechnology industry. Such battles have raised questions about consumer rights, public health, freedom of speech, and corporate rights. The disputes highlighted larger issues about lobbying, fund-raising, and political influence. The role of money in United States has been a prominent concern of Lawrence Lessig in his recent academic and policy work with the group, Rootstrikers.

40|$|Legal {{regulation}} {{shapes the}} form and content of <b>food</b> <b>labels.</b> Whether in developed or developing countries, national laws outline obligations for labelling that reflect a combination of safety, commercial, and proprietary objectives based on a country's unique circumstances. This dissertation mines one particular dimension of the interplay between national and international law. While focusing on the narrow issue of <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> legislation, it canvasses the national and international obligations affecting <b>food</b> <b>labels</b> that arise from intellectual property law, trade regulation and consumer protection. National <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> regimes share some similar legislative provisions. French, Canadian, and Ghanaian law all recognize three categories of <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> elements for pre-packaged foods: (1) mandatory labelling elements; (2) prohibited elements; and (3) reserved elements. As well, failure to comply with <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> laws can result in criminal or civil liability, although implementation varies from country to country, with "food-centred" cultures more apt to vigorously enforce <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> laws. Yet, it not simply national law that dictates the final form of <b>food</b> <b>labels.</b> International legal obligations increasingly play a pivotal role. While early international agreements were driven by States' desires to harmonize certain commercial and intellectual property laws, a shift occurred with the GATT 1947. This Agreement did not look to harmonize private law regimes amongst trading partners, but rather it set out general obligations that prohibited certain national measures which inhibited trade. The pendulum has swung even further {{with the establishment of}} the WTO. National governments, in light of their WTO obligations, must now (a) undertake positive law reform; (b) make national measures WTO-compatible; and (c) submit to compulsory trade dispute resolution, all of which can affect national <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> laws. Clear international obligations established to address commercial or health concerns permit States to maintain national measures while still pursuing trade liberalization. However, international obligations applied to discipline national measures like the marking of food quality and the provision of new consumer information tread on national cultural sensitivities. Until further consensus evolves concerning how international obligations should be applied to such national <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> measures, significant conflicts between national and international obligations will continue...|$|R
