Thus, the cardiovascular and respiratory alterations associated with neck flexion, subarachnoid puncture, and cerebrospinal fluid drainage during subarachnoid {{infusion of}} <b>ioversol</b> (320 mgI/mL) in dogs under general anesthesia using isoflurane were evaluated. The dogs received subarachnoid infusion of autologous cerebrospinal fluid kept at 38 °C - control group (GC); <b>ioversol</b> 0. 3 mL/kg at 25 °C (GI 25) and <b>ioversol</b> 0. 3 mL/kg heated to 38 °C (GI 38). Each dog had its heart rate (HR), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), respiratory rate (RR), oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO 2) and electrocardiography readings (PR and QT intervals) recorded. Group comparisons showed no statistical difference regarding neck positioning, subarachnoid puncture, and subarachnoid infusion of contrast medium on HR, RR and SaO 2, cardiac rhythm or conduction. However, isoflurane significantly increased PR and QT intervals. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the steps involved in cervical myelography {{and the use of}} <b>ioversol</b> 320 mgI/mL at 0. 3 mL/kg (25 ºC and 38 ºC) during cervical myelography did not result in relevant cardiovascular and respiratory alterations, except for an elevation in arterial pressure after injection of <b>ioversol...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of {{iatrogenic}} acute kidney injury (AKI); however, therapeutic strategies for AKI remain limited. This study aims to explore the effect of relaxin (RLX) on contrast-induced HK- 2 apoptosis and its underlying mechanisms. Methods. Renal tubular epithelial cells (HK- 2) were incubated either with or without <b>ioversol,</b> human H 2 relaxin, and LY 294002 (the inhibitor of the PI 3 K/Akt signal pathway). Cell viability was evaluated with a CCK- 8 assay. Apoptotic morphologic alterations were observed using the Hoechst 33342 staining method. Apoptosis was detected with Annexin V staining. Western blot analysis was employed to measure the expression of pAkt (S 473), Akt, cleaved caspase- 3, Bcl- 2, Bax, and actin proteins. Results. <b>Ioversol</b> reduced the viability of HK- 2 cells. Western blotting results revealed decreased expression of phosphorylated Akt in cells treated with <b>ioversol.</b> The activities of caspase- 3 and Bax protein increased, while the expression of Bcl- 2 protein decreased. As a result, the Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio increased after treatment with <b>ioversol.</b> These effects were reversed when HK- 2 cells were cotreated with RLX. However, with preadministration of PI 3 K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY 294002, the effect of RLX was blocked. Conclusion. Our study demonstrates that relaxin attenuates <b>ioversol</b> induced cell apoptosis via activation of the PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting that RLX might play a protective role in the treatment of CI-AKI...|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} previously that radiocontrast medium induces caspase-dependent apoptosis {{and that}} cAMP analogs inhibit cell injury in cultured renal tubular cells. In the present study, cellular me-chanisms underlying the protective effects of cAMP were determined. <b>Ioversol,</b> a radiocontrast medium, caused cell injury accompanied by decreases in Bcl- 2, increases in Bax, and caspase activation in LLC-PK 1 cells. Both cell injury and cellular events induced by <b>ioversol</b> were inhibited by dibutyryl cAMP and the prostacyclin analog beraprost. Dibutyryl cAMP increased phosphorylation of Akt and CREB, {{both of which}} were reversed by H 89, wortmannin and the Akt inhibitor SH- 6. The protective effect of dibutyryl cAMP was also reversed by these kinase inhibitors. In dominant-negative CREB-transfected cells, dibutyryl cAMP no longer prevented cell injury or inhibited changes in mRNA expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax. In mice with unilateral renal occlusion, <b>ioversol</b> increased urinary ex-cretion of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase with con-comitant decreases in Bcl- 2 mRNA, increases in Bax mRNA, activation of caspase- 3, and induction of apoptosis in tubular and interstitial cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant effects of sulforaphane (SFN) in a rat model of CIN and a cell model of oxidative stress in HK 2 cells. Methods. Rats were randomized into four groups (n= 6 per group) : control group, <b>Ioversol</b> group (Ioversol-induced CIN), <b>Ioversol</b> + SFN group (CIN rats pretreated with SFN), and SFN group (rats treated with SFN). Renal function tests, malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. Western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, and immunohistochemical analysis were performed for nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 -like 2 (Nrf 2) and heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) detection. Results. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and renal tissue MDA were increased after contrast exposure. Serum BUN, creatinine, and renal tissue MDA were decreased in the <b>Ioversol</b> + SFN group as compared with those in the <b>Ioversol</b> group. SFN increased the expression of Nrf 2 and HO- 1 in CIN rats and in Ioversol-induced injury HK 2 cells. SFN increased cell viability and attenuated ROS level in vitro. Conclusions.

BackgroundRadiographic {{contrast material}} {{is one of}} agents that are prone to cause nephropathy, although {{little is known about}} cellular mechanisms underlying contrast media–induced renal failure. The present study was designed to determine the role of caspase in contrast media–induced renal injury. The modulation by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) of cell injury was subsequently examined. MethodsLLC-PK 1 cells (a proximal renal tubular cell line of porcine origin) were exposed to diverse contrast media for 30 minutes followed by incubation for 24 hours in normal medium. Cell viability was assessed by mitochondrial enzyme activity and propidium iodide stain. Apoptosis was determined by DNA electrophoresis and annexin V stain. Caspase activity was measured fluorometrically. The mRNA for bax and bcl- 2 was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ResultsIodinated and magnetic resonance contrast media reduced cell viability due to apoptosis. The cell damage induced by a non-ionic contrast medium <b>ioversol</b> was inhibited by specific inhibitors for caspase- 3 and - 9 but not caspase- 8. <b>Ioversol</b> enhanced the activities of caspase- 3 and - 9, but to a lesser extent, caspase- 8. The bax mRNA was enhanced, while bcl- 2 mRNA was reduced, after exposure to <b>ioversol.</b> All of these actions of <b>ioversol</b> were reversed by dibutyl cAMP in the manner sensitive to a protein kinase A inhibitor H 89 and a phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3) kinase inhibitor wortmannin.

40|$|Background: Sulodexide is a {{powerful}} antithrombin agent with reno-protective property. However, whether it has beneficial effects on Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN) remained elusive. In the current study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of Sulodexide on CIN and investigated the potential mechanisms. Methods: CIN model was induced by intravenous injection of indomethacin, followed by <b>Ioversol</b> and L-NAME. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, CIN group, CIN+vehicle group (CIN rats pretreated with vehicle) and CIN+ Sulodexide (CIN rats pretreated with Sulodexide). Sulodexide or an equivalent volume of vehicle was intravenously delivered 30 min before the induction of CIN. All the animals were sacrificed at 24 h after CIN and tissues were harvested to evaluate renal injury, kidney oxidative stress and apoptosis levels. Plasma antithrombin III (ATIII) activities were also measured. Results: Compared to the untreated CIN group, improved renal function, reduced tubular injury, decreased levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis were observed in CIN rats receiving Sulodexide injection. In addition, {{we also found that}} ATIII activity was significantly higher in Sulodexide-administered group than that in vehicle-injected CIN rats. For in vitro studies, HK 2 cells were exposed to <b>Ioversol</b> and the cyto-protective effects of Sulodexide were also determined.

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{quantify}} {{in vitro}} {{the influence of}} gadopentetate dimeglumine and <b>ioversol</b> on the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signal observed {{with a variety of}} musculoskeletal pulse sequences to predict optimum gadolinium concentrations for direct MR arthrography at 1. 5 and 3. 0 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an in vitro study, T 1 and T 2 relaxation times of three dilution series of gadopentetate dimeglumine (concentration, 0 - 20. 0 mmol gadolinium per liter) at <b>ioversol</b> concentrations with iodine concentration of 0, 236. 4, and 1182 mmol iodine per liter (corresponding to 0, 30, and 150 mg of iodine per milliliter) were measured at 1. 5 and 3. 0 T. The relaxation rate dependence on concentrations of gadolinium and iodine was analytically modeled, and continuous profiles of signal versus gadolinium concentration were calculated for 10 pulse sequences used in current musculoskeletal imaging. After fitting to experimental discrete profiles, maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), gadolinium concentration with maximum SNR, and range of gadolinium concentration with 90 % of maximum SNR were derived. The overall influence of field strength and iodine concentration on these parameters was assessed by using t tests. The deviation of simulated from experimental signal-response profiles was assessed with the autocorrelation of the residuals. RESULTS: The model reproduced relaxation rates of 0. 37 - 38. 24 sec(- 1), with a mean error of 4. 5 %. Calculated SNR profiles matched the discrete experimental profiles, with autocorrelation of the residuals divided by the mean of less than 5. 0. Admixture of <b>ioversol</b> consistently reduced T 1 and T 2, narrowed optimum gadolinium concentration ranges (P =. 004 -. 006), and reduced maximum SNR (P <. 001 to not significant). Optimum gadolinium concentration was 0. 7 - 3. 4 mmol/L at both field strengths. At 3. 0 T, maximum SNR was up to 75 % higher than at 1. 5 T. CONCLUSION: Admixture of <b>ioversol</b> to gadopentetate dimeglumine solutions results in a consistent additional relaxation enhancement, which can be analytically modeled to allow a near-quantitative a priori optimized match of contrast media concentrations and imaging protocol for a broad variety of pulse sequences...|$|E

40|$|The {{coronary}} arteries of the isolated rabbit heart were perfused with different contrast media (CM). The effects on cardiac contractile force (CF) from enriching iohexol solutions with sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium and oxygen were investigated. The effects were studied during normal and reduced perfusion pressure; {{the latter was}} intended to simulate flow conditions distal to proximal stenotic processes of the {{coronary arteries}}. By adding the above mentioned cations to iohexol (175 mg I/ml) the smallest influence on CF was found when the CM contained 30 mM NaCl, 0. 3 mM CaCl 2, 0. 9 mM KCl and 0. 3 mM MgCl 2 and this influence on CF was significantly less than caused by iohexol with 30 mM NaCl (p < or = 0. 01). The influence on CF was further reduced when this iohexol solution was oxygenated with 100 % oxygen (p < or = 0. 001). This modified iohexol solution caused a significantly smaller influence on CF than the low-osmotic media iohexol, iopamiro, <b>ioversol</b> and ioxaglate (p < or = 0. 001).

40|$|We {{reported}} previously {{that various}} radiocontrast media cause apoptosis in porcine proximal tubular (LLC-PK 1) cells, in which reduction in B-cell lymphoma (Bcl) - 2 expression and caspase- 3 activation are implicated. In the present study, we investigated {{a role for}} ceramide in radiocontrast media-induced apoptosis in renal tubular cells. LLC-PK 1 cells were exposed to radiocontrast media for 30 [*]min, followed by incubation for 24 [*]h in normal medium. Cell viability was assessed by 2 -(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitrophenyl) - 3 -(4 -nitrophenyl) - 5 -(2, 4 -disulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium monosodium salt assay, while apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling stain. Immunofluorescent stains were performed using antibodies against phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (pCREB), and ceramide. The mRNA expression and protein content of Bcl- 2 were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. In vivo model of contrast-induced renal injury was induced in mice with unilateral renal occlusion. The cell injury induced by the nonionic radiocontrast medium <b>ioversol</b> was reversed by inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis with fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) and L-cycloserine, but not by suppressing sphingomyelin breakdown with D 609. FB 1 reversed ioversol-induced decrease in the immunoreactivities of pAkt and pCREB, reduction in Bcl- 2 expression and caspase- 3 activation. Like <b>ioversol,</b> C 2 ceramide and the Akt inhibitor Src homology- 6 induced apoptosis by reducing pAkt and pCREB-like immunoreactivities, lowering Bcl- 2 expression and enhancing caspase- 3 activity. Indeed, various radiocontrast media, excluding iodixanol which showed the least nephrotoxicity, enhanced ceramide-like immunoreactivity. The role for de novo ceramide synthesis was also shown in the in vivo model of radiocontrast nephropathy.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of hearing {{problems}} can potentially be treated with local drug delivery systems capable of delivering drugs directly to the cochlea over extended periods of time. Developing and testing such systems requires accurate quantification of drug concentration over time. A variety of techniques have been proposed for both direct and indirect measurement of drug pharmacokinetics; direct techniques are invasive, whereas many indirect techniques are imprecise because they rely on assumptions {{about the relationship between}} physiological response and drug concentrations. One indirect technique, however, is capable of quantifying drug pharmacokinetics very precisely: Micro-Computed tomography (micro-CT) can provide a non-invasive way to measure the concentration of a contrast agent in the cochlea over time. In this thesis, we propose a systematic approach for analyzing micro-CT images to measure concentrations of the contrast agent <b>ioversol</b> in mouse cochlea. This approach requires segmenting and classifying the intra-cochlea structures from micro-CT images, which is done via 3 D atlas-subject registration to a published atlas of the mouse cochlea. Labels of each intra-cochlear structure in the atlas are propagated through the registration transformation to the corresponding structures in the micro-CT images. Pixel intensities are extracted from three key intra-cochlea structures: scala tympani (ST), scala vestibuli (SV), scala media (SM) in the micro-CT images, and these intensities are mapped into concentrations using a linear model between solution concentration and image intensity that is determined in a previous calibration step. To localize this analysis, the ST, SV, SM are divided into several discrete components, and the concentrations are estimated in each component using a weighted average with weights determined by solving a nonhomogeneous Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the component boundaries. We illustrate this entire system on a series of micro-CT images of an anesthetized mouse that include a baseline scan (with no contrast agent) and a series of scans after injection of <b>ioversol</b> into the cochlea...|$|E
40|$|Background/objectives: Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) may be {{a severe}} complication to the administration of iodine-based contrast media for diagnostic or interventional procedure using radiation exposure. Whether {{there is a difference}} in nephrotoxic potential between the various agents is uncertain. We aimed to perform a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials on iodine-based contrast agents. Methods: Randomized trials of low-osmolar or iso-osmolar contrast media were searched in CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Scopus. Risk of CIN was appraised within a hierarchical Bayesian model computing absolute rates (AR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95 % credibility intervals, and probability of being best (Pbest) for each agent. Results: A total of 42 trials (10048 patients) were included focusing on 7 different iodine-based contrast media. Risk of CIN was similarly low with iodixanol (AR = 5. 7 % [2. 2 %- 13. 9 %], Pbest = 18. 8 %), iomeprol (AR = 6. 0 % [2. 2 %- 15. 4 %], Pbest = 24. 8 %), iopamidol (AR = 6. 1 % [2. 2 %- 15. 5 %], Pbest = 21. 5 %), and <b>ioversol</b> (AR = 6. 0 % [2. 1 %- 16. 4 %], Pbest = 31. 3 %). Conversely, CIN was twice as common with iohexol (AR = 11. 2 % [4. 1 %- 29. 5 %], Pbest = 0. 1 %) and ioxaglate (AR = 11. 0 % [4. 0 %- 26. 9 %], Pbest < 0. 1 %), with both proving less safe than iodixanol (respectively OR = 2. 18 [1. 22 - 3. 92] and 2. 05 [1. 26 - 3. 29]), iomeprol (OR = 2. 08 [1. 04 - 4. 17] and 1. 96 [1. 06 - 3. 48]) and iopamidol (OR = 2. 04 [1. 15 - 3. 85] and 1. 92 [1. 06 - 3. 45]). Data on iopromide were less conclusive (AR = 6. 9 % [2. 6 %- 17. 1 %], Pbest = 3. 6 %). Conclusions: Iodixanol, iomeprol, iopamidol and <b>ioversol</b> are iodine-based contrast media with a similar renal safety profile. Iohexol and ioxaglate have a poorer renal safety profile, whereas further data may be required on iopromide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Strategies {{to prevent}} contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) are suboptimal. Erythropoietin was recently {{found to be}} cytoprotective {{in a variety of}} nonhematopoietic cells, so it was hypothesized that the nonhematopoietic erythropoietin derivative asialoerythropoietin would prevent CIN. Nephropathy was induced in rats by injection of the radiocontrast medium <b>Ioversol</b> in addition to inhibition of prostaglandin and nitric oxide synthesis. Administration of a single dose of asialoerythropoietin before the induction of nephropathy significantly attenuated the resulting renal dysfunction and histologic renal tubular injury. Contrast-induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells was inhibited by asialoerythropoietin both in vivo and in vitro, and this effect was blocked by a Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) inhibitor in vitro. Furthermore, phospho-JAK 2 /signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT 5) and heat-shock protein 70 increased after injection of asialoerythropoietin, suggesting that the effects of asialoerythropoietin may be mediated by the activation of the JAK 2 /STAT 5 pathway. Overall, these findings suggest that asialoerythropoietin may have potential as a new therapeutic approach to prevent CIN given its ability to preserve renal function and directly protect renal tissue...|$|E

There were 314 ADR cases among 118, 208 patients receiving enhanced CT or MRI examinations. The frequency of moderate/severe ADRs defined by Chinese Society of Radiology (ie, severe vomiting, systematic urticaria, facial swelling, dyspnea, vasovagal reaction, laryngeal edema, seizure, trembling, convulsions, unconsciousness, shock, death, and other unexpected adverse reactions) was rare (0. 0431 %), whereas the mild ADRs were uncommon (0. 2225 %) and accounted for 83. 76 % of ADRs. Frequency of ADRs induced by iodinated contrast agents was related with examination site, sex, and type of patient settings (P< 0. 01) and was higher compared with gadolinium contrast agents (0. 3676 % vs 0. 0504 %, P< 0. 01). From 2014 to 2015, frequencies of total and moderate/severe ADRs induced by iodinated contrast agents decreased significantly (0. 4410 % vs 0. 2947 %, P< 0. 01; 0. 0960 % vs 0. 0282 %, P< 0. 01, respectively). Frequency of ADRs differed among different iodinated contrast and gadolinium contrast (P< 0. 05) agents. Iopromide’s ADR frequency in 2014 was significantly higher compared with iopamidol, <b>ioversol,</b> or iohexol (P< 0. 01). Frequency of moderate/severe ADRs induced by iodixanol was 4. 1 – 5. 4 times that of iohexol, iopromide, or iopamidol. Rash was the predominant ADR subtype (84. 39 %) and occurred more frequently with iodixanol compared with iohexol, iopamidol, or <b>ioversol</b> (P< 0. 01). Overall, 21. 97 % of ADR cases had allergy history or atopy traits, and these cases experienced ADRs earlier than the negative ones (17. 19 min vs 85. 34 min, P< 0. 01). The mean time to onset of ADRs was increased in patients receiving iodixanol compared with other iodinated contrast agents (323. 77 min vs 42. 36 min, P< 0. 01). Overall, 37. 26 % of ADRs occurred within 5 min and 84. 08 % of ADRs occurred within 30 min. Efficient quality improvement in decreasing ADRs induced by radiocontrast agents has been achieved by multidisciplinary collaboration.

40|$|In a male {{patient with}} {{cervical}} spinal cord injury, the urinary bladder may go into spasm when a urethral catheter is removed {{and a new}} Foley catheter is inserted. Before the balloon is inflated, the spastic bladder may push the Foley catheter out or the catheter may slip out of a small-capacity bladder. An inexperienced health professional may inflate the balloon of a Foley catheter in the urethra without realizing that the balloon segment of the catheter is lying in the urethra instead of the urinary bladder. When a Foley balloon is inflated in the urethra, a tetraplegic patient is likely to develop autonomic dysreflexia. This is a medical emergency and requires urgent treatment. Before the incorrectly placed Foley catheter is removed, {{it is important to}} document whether the balloon has been inflated in the urinary bladder or not. The clinician should first use the always available tools of observation and palpation at the bedside without delays of transportation. A misplaced balloon will often be evident by a long catheter sign, indicating excessive catheter remaining outside the patient. Radiological diagnosis is not frequently required and, when needed, should employ the technique most readily available, which might be a body and pelvic CT without intravenous contrast. An alternative radiological technique to demonstrate the position of the balloon of the Foley catheter is described. Three milliliters of nonionic X-ray contrast medium, <b>Ioversol</b> (OPTIRAY 300), is injected through the side channel of the Foley catheter, which is used for inflating the balloon. Then, with a catheter-tip syringe, 30 ml of sterile <b>Ioversol</b> is injected through the main lumen of the Foley catheter. Immediately thereafter, an X-ray of the pelvis (including perineum) is taken. By this technique, both the urinary bladder and balloon of the Foley catheter are visualized by the X-ray contrast medium. When a Foley catheter has been inserted correctly, the balloon of the Foley catheter should be located within the urinary bladder, but when the Foley catheter is misplaced with the balloon inflated in the urethra, a round opaque shadow of the Foley balloon is seen separately below the urinary bladder. This radiological study takes only a few minutes to perform, can be carried out bedside with a mobile X-ray machine, and does not require special expertise or preparations, unlike transrectal ultrasonography. When a Foley balloon is inflated in the urethra, abdominal ultrasonography will show an absence of the Foley balloon within the bladder. The technique described above aids in positive demonstration of a Foley balloon lying outside the urinary bladder. Such documentation proves valuable in planning future treatment, education of health professionals, and settlement of malpractice claims...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if with a multiphasic injection technique the admin- istered amount of contrast medium for abdominal computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) can be decreased, whilst improving CT image quality. Materials and methods: In 30 patients a multiphasic injection method was compared to the standard uniphasic contrast medium injection protocol. Fifteen patients underwent abdominal CTA with a standard uniphasic injection protocol (protocol I) receiving 100 mL of a non-ionic radiopaque contrast agent (Iover- sol). The second group of 15 patients underwent CTA with a multiphasic injection protocol (protocol II) receiving a total of 89 mL <b>Ioversol.</b> Vascular contrast enhancement and difference in enhancement uni- formity were assessed quantitatively and image quality was assessed by three independent radiologists. Results: Quantitative assessment of the vascular contrast enhancement showed that there was no signif- icant difference in enhancement uniformity for patients between the protocols. The image quality was rated as being good to excellent in 81. 8 % and 88. 0 % of the scans, for protocol I and protocol II, respectively. However these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: By using a multiphasic injection technique with CTA of the abdominal aorta a reduction of 11 percent of contrast medium can be realized. Enhancement patterns are quantitatively as well as qualitatively comparable to the standard contrast medium injection protocol...|$|E
40|$|Purpose : The {{steadily}} elevating {{cost of the}} contrast-enhanced CT {{has been}} a problem in last decade. One approach to curtail the cost is {{to reduce the amount of}} contrast media (CM). The purpose of this study was to examine the possibility of reducing the volume of CM in single-detector CT (SDCT) without compromising diagnostic ability. Materials and Methods : One hundred ml of Iohexol 300 and 75 ml of <b>Ioversol</b> 320 were compared in a prospective CT study about their imaging quality. One hundred patients were randomly divided into two parallel groups (A and B). The former agent was used for group A and the latter for B. CT attenuations of the aorta, central vein, spleen and kidney were measured and each imaging quality was reviewed by three radiologists. Results : CT attenuations and the imaging quality were significantly superior (p < 0. 05) in A group, however, comparing in the condition under 50 kg patients, they showed no significant differences and the quality was tolerable for diagnosis in both group. Conclusion : This demonstrates the difficulty to perform the high-quality CT with a reduced CM in SDCT. However, this does not negate the diagnostic ability of low dose of CM, but reflects the importance of determining the acceptable lowest doze of CM for diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{dysfunction}} {{may follow}} administration of iodinated radiographic contrast agents. This complication {{may be less}} common when low osmolarity nonionic agents are used. Although potential benefits {{from the use of}} low osmolarity nonionic contrast may be minimal in individuals with normal physiology, a greater benefit has been postulated in the presence of chronic cyanosis. To test this hypothesis, six adult mongrel dogs underwent anastomosis of the inferior vena cava to the left atrium. This produced chronic cyanosis with a mean pO 2 of 48 ± 4 mm Hg and polycythemia with a mean hematocrit of 56 ± 2 gm%. Three to 5 months after preparation, these cyanotic dogs and five control dogs each received diatrizoate (a high osmolarity ionic agent) or <b>ioversol</b> (a low osmolarity nonionic agent), 465 mg iodine/kg body weight, by intravenous bolus injection. One month later, each animal received the other agent. The order of administration was randomized. Renal function studies, including serum creatinine and creatinine clearance, were performed precontrast, after 60 min, and 24 hr postcontrast. Neither agent adversely affected renal function in either the cyanotic or the normal group. We conclude that at the doses that are commonly used in clinical practice, high osmolarity ionic contrast agents do not create a greater risk of renal injuiry than do low osmolarity nonionic agents in this model of cyanosis...|$|E
40|$|A {{prostacyclin}} analog beraprost sodium attenuates radiocontrast media-induced LLC-PK 1 cells injury. BackgroundWe {{previously reported}} that the apoptotic injury in a porcine renal tubular cell line LLC-PK 1 cells induced by radiographic contrast media is attenuated by dibutyl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in a manner dependent on protein kinase A (PKA). The present {{study was designed to}} determine whether the elevation of endogenous cAMP with beraprost sodium, a prostacyclin analog, reduces the contrast material-induced renal tubular injury. MethodsThe cell injury was induced by the exposure to <b>ioversol</b> for 30 minutes followed by further incubation for 24 hours {{in the absence of the}} contrast medium, and assessed by propidium iodide uptake and WST- 8 assay. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V stain and DNA electrophoresis. Caspase activity was assessed by the enzymatic degradation of specific substrate peptides. Bax and bcl- 2 mRNA expression were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) was measured by an immunofluorescent method. ResultsBeraprost sodium (10 to 1000 nmol/L) attenuated concentration dependently the ioversol-induced decrease in cell viability, in which the protective effect of beraprost sodium was dependent on the elevation of cellular cAMP content. The phosphorylation of CREB was enhanced by beraprost sodium in PKA-dependent manner. In addition, beraprost sodium reversed the ioversol-induced increase in bax mRNA with a concomitant decrease in bcl- 2 mRNA and subsequent activation of caspase- 3 and - 9, thereby resulting in the inhibition of the nuclear damage. ConclusionBeraprost sodium reversed the contrast media-induced renal tubular cells in culture by activating cAMP/protein kinase A–dependent phosphorylation of CREB and subsequent enhancement of bcl- 2 expression...|$|E
40|$|Radiographic {{contrast}} media–induced tubular injury: Evaluation of oxidant {{stress and}} plasma membrane integrity. BackgroundExperimental and clinical investigations suggest that oxidant stress {{is a critical}} determinant of radiocontrast nephropathy (RCN), and that N acetyl cysteine (NAC) can prevent this damage. This study addresses these issues directly at the tubular cell level. Potential alternative mechanisms for RCN have also been sought. MethodsIsolated mouse proximal tubule segments (PTS), or cultured proximal tubule (HK- 2) cells, were subjected to radiocontrast media (RCM) (<b>Ioversol,</b> Optiray 320) exposure, followed by assessments of cellular viability [% lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, tetrazolium dye (MTT), uptake] and lipid peroxidation. These experiments were conducted in the absence or presence {{of a variety of}} antioxidants [NAC, glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase, catalase] or pro-oxidant (GSH depletion, heme oxygenase inhibition) strategies. RCM effects on mitochondrial and plasma membrane integrity were also assessed. ResultsRCM exposure did not induce PTS lipid peroxidation. Neither antioxidant nor pro-oxidant interventions mitigated or exacerbated RCM-induced tubular cell injury, respectively. RCM impaired mitochondrial integrity, as assessed by ouabain-resistant ATP reductions, and by cytochrome c release (before cell death). RCM also induced plasma membrane damage, as indicated by loss of key resident proteins (NaK-ATPase, caveolin) and by increased susceptibility to phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) attack (increase of ≥ 2 times in free fatty acid and NaK-ATPase release). Hyperosmolality could not account for RCM's toxic effects. ConclusionRCM toxicity can be dissociated from tubular cell oxidant stress. Alternative mechanisms may include mitochondrial injury/cytochrome c release and plasma membrane damage. The latter results in critical protein loss, as well as a marked increase in plasma membrane susceptibility to exogenous/endogenous PLA 2 attack...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Solutions {{of iodine}} {{contrast}} media (CM) used for selective coronary arteriography (CA) should have minimal propensity to cause ventricular fibrillation (VF). Commonly used CM for CA are nonionic monomers or dimers. PURPOSE: To compare VF propensity of ready-to-use solutions of one nonionic dimer, iodixanol, and five nonionic monomers, iobitridol, iopamidol, iomeprol, iopromide, and <b>ioversol.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty milliliters of each CM was {{injected into the}} left coronary artery (LCA) through an inflated balloon catheter (0. 5 ml/s) in 14 pigs; the longest period of injection was 40 s. If VF occurred before 40 s, the injection was stopped and the heart was defibrillated. After VF, there was a delay of 40 min before the next injection. Hemodynamic parameters and vector electrocardiography (VECG) were monitored. A CM with a lower frequency of VF and a longer period between start of injection and start of VF was considered to have a lower VF propensity. RESULTS: Following 14 injections, {{each of the five}} nonionic monomers caused 14 VF, whereas iodixanol caused three VF (P< 0. 01). When VF occurred after iodixanol, it occurred later than after the other CM (P< 0. 001). Iodixanol caused less prolongation in QRS time (P< 0. 01) and QTc time (P< 0. 05) than the other CM. Prolongations in QRS and QTc times caused by CM parallel the VF propensities of the CM. CONCLUSION: Ready-to-use solutions of the dimer iodixanol have lower VF propensity than solutions of the five monomeric CM. This is related {{to the fact that the}} solutions of the dimer iodixanol have lower osmolality, higher viscosity, and higher concentrations of NaCl and CaCl 2 than solutions of the five monomers...|$|E
