60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> the Violet, {{because the}} {{arrangement}} of the group to which it belongs--Cytherides--is more arbitrary than that of the rest, and calls for some immediate explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] <b>I</b> <b>began,</b> <b>with</b> {{the freedom}} of long acquaintance, [...] "the rule should work both ways. If you had offered to divide the reward {{you would not have}} lost--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Trust you, my friends!' said James, deeply touched; 'I {{trust you}} {{with all my}} heart; but how could you trust me if <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> a breach of faith to the King of England?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Part <b>I</b> <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> {{a notice}} [...] "To the Reader", to {{establish}} the narrative frame: [...] "I here present you, courteous reader, with the record of a remarkable period in my life...." [...] It {{is followed by the}} substance of Part I, ...|$|R

6000|$|But before <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> any of them, I {{must speak}} {{a word or}} two {{concerning}} John's qualification, whereby he was enabled to behold and take a view of this city; which qualification he relateth in these words following: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How did <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> him? Let me see. Oh! I {{just told}} him who I was; {{and then he turned}} away and looked down under the fire like, and I {{thought he was going to}} make a faint of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devotion of Decius? Capital. Let me see!" [...] said Norman, {{taking up}} a paper {{scribbled}} in pencil, with Latin verses. [...] "Oh, {{you have taken}} up quite a different line from mine. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> Mount Vesuvius spouting lava like anything." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{stranger}} replied: [...] "I have merely {{attempted a}} philosophical history founded upon the facts known respecting rocks and strata and the remains they contain. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> {{what may be}} considered a creation, a fluid globe supplied with an immense atmosphere, and the series of phenomena which I imagine consequent to the creation, I supposed produced by powers impressed upon matter by Omnipotence." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> {{this great}} woman of letters {{for both the}} two reasons already mentioned. She {{represents}} the rationalism of the old Victorian Age at its highest. She and Mill are like two great mountains {{at the end of}} that long, hard chain which is the watershed of the Early Victorian time. They alone rise high enough to be confused among the clouds--or perhaps confused among the stars. They certainly were seeking truth, as Newman and Carlyle were; the slow slope of the later Victorian vulgarity does not lower their precipice and pinnacle. But <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> this name also because it emphasises the idea of modern fiction as a fresh and largely a female thing. The novel of the nineteenth century was female; as fully as the novel of the eighteenth century was male. It is quite certain that no woman could have written Roderick Random. It is not quite so certain that no woman could have written Esmond. The strength and subtlety of woman had certainly sunk deep into English letters when George Eliot began to write.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> the last; namely, the {{consumption}} abroad. This is too wide a field to enter upon in particular here, I refer {{it to be}} treated at large by itself; {{but as far as}} it serves to prove what I have affirmed above, namely, that {{the consumption}} of our manufactures may be improved abroad, so far it is needful to speak of it here; I shall confine it to the English colonies and factories abroad.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now may Heaven grant my prayer," [...] <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> awful solemnity, [...] "and {{send the}} great Ranunculus to loose the binding chain of concupiscence, heaving the multitudinous aquacity upon {{the heads of}} this wicked and sententious generation, whelming these {{diametrical}} scoffers in a supercilious Constantinople!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, mamma. Everybody did it. Mrs. Cornbury {{said she}} always waltzed {{when she was}} a girl; and as the things turned out I could not help myself. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> her cousin. <b>I</b> didn't mean to do it, but I got so ashamed of myself that I couldn't refuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my dear, I was {{thinking}} of a good many things. In the first place, <b>I</b> think, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> wondering what <b>I</b> should make of the boys; and that led to such a train of thoughts about ourselves and our circumstances, that I hardly knew where I was when you spoke to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... § 2. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> the Aiguilles. In Fig. 24, p. 170, at a, it {{was assumed}} that the mass was raised highest merely where the {{elevating}} force was greatest, being of one substance with the bank or cliff below. But it hardly ever is of the same substance. Almost always it is of compact crystallines, and the bank of slaty crystallines; or if it be of slaty crystallines the bank is of slaty coherents. The bank is almost always the softer of the two.[57] ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{much in the}} way {{of general}} preface to the pages for which I am about to ask the reader's attention. Let me now advance to particulars, and {{describe}} how I came to hear the first story in the present collection. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> it because it is the story that I have oftenest [...] "rehearsed," [...] to borrow a phrase from the stage. Wherever I go, I am sooner or later sure to tell it. Only last night, I was persuaded into repeating it once more by the inhabitants of the farmhouse in which I am now staying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but I {{would give}} {{so much to}} realise the ancient world!" [...] cried Mrs. Thornbury. [...] "Now that we old people are alone,--we're on our second honeymoon,--I am really going to put myself to school again. After all we are founded on the past, aren't we, Mr. Hewet? My soldier son says {{that there is still}} a great deal to be learnt from Hannibal. One ought to know so much more than one does. Somehow when I read the paper, <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> the debates first, and, before I've done, the door always opens--we're a very large party at home--and so one never does think enough about the ancients and all they've done for us. But you begin at the beginning, Miss Allan." ...|$|E

50|$|Danger <b>Is</b> <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> a dissonant guitar riff {{that ends}} {{abruptly}} {{with the introduction}} of the vocals. In terms of content, the song is about a looming unknown danger. After each verse line, Krawinkel plays a short riff on the electric guitar. After two verses the riff from the intro reappears with even more dissonance, in addition to a blaring siren.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh dear, yes!' said Traddles. 'I got fifty pounds. I {{had never}} been brought up to any profession, and at first I {{was at a loss}} what to do for myself. However, <b>I</b> <b>began,</b> <b>with</b> the {{assistance}} of the son of a professional man, who had been to Salem House--Yawler, with his nose on one side. Do you recollect him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace," [...] went on Owen, [...] "and listen. Be sure of this, Councillors, that if I die, your king will die; whereas if I live, your king may live. You ask me of this matter. Where shall I begin? Shall <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> {{the tale}} of two men seated {{together}} some nights ago in a hut so dark that no eyes could see in it, save perchance {{the eyes of a}} wizard? What did they talk of in that hut, and who were those men? They talked, I think, of the death of a king and of the crowning of a king. They talked of a price to be paid for a certain medicine; and one of them had a royal air, and one----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> you whose {{religion}} lieth only in your tongues; I {{mean you}} who are little or nothing known {{from the rest of}} the rabble of the world, only you can talk better than they. Hear me a word or two. If [...] "I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity," [...] that is, love to God, and Christ, and saints, and holiness, [...] "I am nothing"; no child of God, and so have nothing to do with heaven. (1 Cor 13:1,2) A prating tongue will not unlock the gates of haven, nor blind the eyes of the Judge. Look to it. [...] "The wise in heart will receive commandments; but a prating fool shall fall."

6000|$|... "Wait a little," [...] said Mrs. Rook. [...] "Everything in {{its right}} place, is my motto. I mustn't {{begin with the}} pocketbook. Why did <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> it? Do you think this veil on my face confuses me? Suppose I take it off. But you must promise first--solemnly promise you won't look at my face. How can I {{tell you about the}} murder (the murder is part of my confession, you know), with this lace {{tickling}} my skin? Go away--and stand there with your back to me. Thank you. Now I'll take it off. Ha! the air feels refreshing; I know what I am about. Good heavens, I have forgotten something! I have forgotten him. And after such a fright as he gave me! Did you see him on the landing?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> 44 votes, Shields 41, and Trumbull 5,--yet Trumbull was elected. In fact 47 {{different}} members {{voted for}} me,--getting three new {{ones on the}} second ballot, and losing four old ones. How came my 47 to yield to Trumbull's 5? It was Governor Matteson's work. He has been secretly a candidate ever since (before, even) the fall election.|$|R
