50|$|Many laser {{projectors}} and galvanometer sets include Digital Multiplexing (<b>DMX)</b> <b>input.</b> DMX {{was originally}} designed to control theatrical lighting, but has spread to laser projectors over the years.|$|E
50|$|When {{controlled}} by a Series 200 data signal, the VLSR stored the cue information (in {{much the same way}} that Series 200 luminaires did) and transmitted the raw positional and colour information to the luminaires, as Series 300 data. In this case, the Series 200 input connector was used to supply both power and data.When {{controlled by}} a DMX512 data signal, all cue information is stored in and transmitted from the lighting console; with the VLSR simply acting as a translating device, which converts the DMX signal to Series 300 data in real time. In this case, the Series 200 input connector is used only to supply mains power to the VLSR, with <b>DMX</b> data being <b>input</b> via a separate, standard, 5-pin XLR connector.|$|R
