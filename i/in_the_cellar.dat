5|$|Madness {{were not}} only running their own label at the time, but also had their own {{recording}} studio, Liquidator Studios. The studio is still located on Caledonian Road in North London, in {{what was once the}} premises of their fan club office. They built a 24-track professional studio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b> The ground floor has always been an office and chill out area, while a room upstairs is used for song mixing. The band have recorded a number of demos and b-sides at Liquidator, as well as The Madness album in 1988. Other acts to use the studio include Feargal Sharkey, The Farm, Apollo 440, The Potato 5, The Nutty Boys, The Deltones and The Butterfield 8.

5|$|The Casbah Coffee Club was a {{rock and}} roll music venue in West Derby, Liverpool, England started by Mona Best in 1959 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> of the family home. The Casbah, as it became widely known, was planned as a members-only club for Best's sons Pete, his younger brother, Rory, and their friends. Mona {{came up with the}} idea of the club after {{watching}} a TV report about The 2i's Coffee Bar in London's Soho where several singers had been discovered. She decided to open the club, which was located in her cellar, on 29 August 1959, for her sons, their friends and young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day.|$|E
5|$|The main {{influence}} in fourteen-year-old Will Burrow's life is his father, Dr. Burrows, {{and together they}} share an interest in archaeology and a fascination for the buried past. When Dr. Burrows begins to notice strange 'pallid men' where they live in Highfield, and then promptly goes missing, Will and his friend Chester go search for him. They discover a blocked passageway behind bookshelves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> of the Burrows home and re-excavate it, finding the passage leads to a door set into the rock, and beyond the door is an old lift that takes them down to another set of doors. A cobblestone street lies beyond, lit by a row of orb-like street lamps; houses {{that appear to be}} carved out of the walls themselves flank the street.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b> Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> in a {{state of}} shock. Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having felt sorry for him, brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, with the others assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant, the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E

Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby.

25|$|Many new {{restaurants}} and cafes appeared <b>in</b> and around <b>the</b> Palais-Royal {{and the new}} boulevards, usually close to the twenty-three theaters. A new café, Tortoni, specializing in ice creams, opened <b>in</b> 1795 at <b>the</b> corner of rue Taibout and the grand boulevards. <b>The</b> {{new restaurants}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Palais-Royal were often run by the former chefs of archbishops or nobles who had gone into exile. The restaurant Méot offered a menu with over a hundred dishes. Beside Méot and Beauvilliers, the Palais-Royal had the restaurants Naudet, Robert, Very, Foy and Huré, and the Cafés Berceau, Lyrique, Liberté Conquise, de Chartres, and du Sauvage (the last owned by the former coachman of Robespierre). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellars</b> of <b>the</b> Palais-Royal there were more popular cafés, usually with music, smaller menus and more reasonable prices. One restaurant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellars,</b> Postal, offered a menu for just 36 sous. Many of <b>the</b> cafes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellars</b> had orchestras; <b>the</b> most famous was the Café des Aveugles, which had an orchestra of blind musicians.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the 1960–61 NBA season, Robertson {{made himself}} {{eligible}} for the 1960 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus, {{a far cry from}} his childhood days when he was too poor to afford a basketball. In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists (leading the league), almost averaging a triple-double for the entire season. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year, was elected into the All-NBA First Team – which would happen in each of Robertson's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive All-Star Game appearances. In addition, he was named the 1961 NBA All-Star Game MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory. However, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> of the Western Division.|$|E
5|$|The Alsos Mission {{set out on}} 20 April and rendezvoused {{with the}} 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion at Freudenstadt. The intact bridge over the Neckar River at Horb was crossed and Haigerloch was {{occupied}} without opposition on 22 April. The main body of Task Force A arrived on 23 April. In a laboratory in a cellar they found a German experimental nuclear reactor shaped like a cylinder and made of graphite blocks, but the uranium and heavy water were missing. The scientists immediately began dismantling it. Pash left Hambro in charge, while he led troops of Task Force A to Bisingen, {{and then on to}} Hechingen, where 25 scientists were captured, including von Weizsäcker, von Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge. At Tailfingen they took Otto Hahn and nine members of his staff into custody. At Haigerloch, a sealed drum of documents was retrieved from a cesspool, and three drums of heavy water and 1.5 tons of uranium ingots were found buried in a field. The uranium and heavy water were loaded onto trucks. The apertures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> were blown up with minor explosions to prevent their capture by the French.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to contact}} Kell, Hannay flicks through the notebook, finding it {{contains}} pages of code using Roman numerals. He finds a map {{in the back}} and takes a train to Scotland to prove Scudder right, attempting to decipher the code en route. Finding out Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated, Hannay reaches Scotland and leaves the train to escape the police. He stays in a barn overnight, where he deciphers the code in the notebook (except a section in double code), which reveals the Germans want to destroy the Royal Navy so that they could invade the country, starting a war. Chased by the police, the Germans and machine-gun-fire from a biplane, he encounters brother and sister Harry and Victoria Sinclair, a prospective Member of Parliament and a suffragette respectively (Patrick Kennedy and Lydia Leonard), who believe him to be a Liberal spokesman. At a political rally in a nearby town (Culross) where Hannay meets Sir George Sinclair, Harry and Victoria's uncle (David Haig), Victoria aids Hannay's attempt to escape, before they are captured by the Germans. With the notebook missing from Hannay's pocket, they are taken to Longkeep Castle (Dumbarton Castle), the headquarters of the German espionage ring, where they are imprisoned by Professor Fisher (Patrick Malahide). Sir George arrives as they are captured and inquires about them while they are held in another room. After he leaves they are bound and gagged and placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b> They escape and return to where they were captured to look for the notebook, which Victoria reveals she had picked from Hannay's pocket and hidden. They stay overnight in an inn, where Hannay details the contents of the notebook to Victoria.|$|E

25|$|From their later investigations, {{police and}} {{forensic}} experts concluded all the victims found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> at 25 Cromwell Street {{had been murdered}} in this location, and that, like Gough, each had been dismembered in this location. Five victims were murdered and buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> at Cromwell Street between November 1973 and April 1975. The first of these victims, 15-year-old Carol Ann Cooper, was abducted on 10 November 1973. Cooper lived in the Pines Children's Home in Worcester, and was abducted after spending the evening at a cinema with her boyfriend. She {{had been waiting for}} a bus in Warndon when she vanished, and was likely dragged into Fred's car, where her face was bound with surgical tape and her arms bound with braiding cloth before she was driven to Cromwell Street. At the Wests' address, Cooper was suspended from the wooden beams of the cellar ceiling before her abuse and murder. As had been the case with Lynda, Cooper either {{died as a result of}} strangulation or asphyxiation before her dismembered body was buried in a shallow, cubical grave <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b>|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the cold}} winter {{temperatures}} prematurely halted fermentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellars,</b> leaving dormant yeast cells that would awaken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warmth of spring and start fermenting again. One of the byproducts of fermentation is {{the release of}} carbon dioxide gas, which, if the wine is bottled, is trapped inside the wine, causing intense pressure. The pressure inside the weak, early French wine bottles often caused the bottles to explode, creating havoc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cellars.</b> If <b>the</b> bottle survived, the wine was found to contain bubbles, something that the early Champenois were horrified to see, considering it a fault. As late as the 17th century, Champenois wine makers, most notably the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon (1638–1715), were still trying to rid their wines of the bubbles.|$|R
