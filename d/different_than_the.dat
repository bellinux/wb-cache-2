5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Integration with Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure {{were added}} in 2014. That October the Account Map tool was introduced, which uses an {{algorithm}} {{to visualize the}} flow of work across groups of employees. In August 2014, version 2.0 of the Smartsheet iOS app was introduced. It made a spreadsheet-like user interface {{the focus of the}} app's user interface, whereas previously the mobile interface was <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> spreadsheet-oriented desktop version.|$|E

5|$|Like the game, {{the comic}} {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie as the focus of the comic due to the uniqueness of her birth and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity.|$|E
5|$|The track lengths for {{a number}} of tracks on all three discs are <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Original Sound Version release. On the first disc, tracks 24-27 are new {{arranged}} version tracks that were included as the music from those tracks corresponded to the video animated sequences that were added originally on the PlayStation version. The same applied to tracks 25-27 on the second disc and tracks 18-24 on the third disc.|$|E
5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} one of Ippo's senpai, Masaru Aoki, who has been boxing {{for a number of}} years before Ippo. He enters the Class A Tournament, but loses. Afterward, he begins his {{comeback}} and rises through the Lightweight division to win the Lightweight Championship against Katsutaka Imae. Aoki's story differs from the manga in that Aoki lost several of the fights, and achieved a draw in the Title bout. After Aoki's story arc, the game shifts again to another of Ippo's senpai, Tatsuya Kimura, who began boxing with Aoki. His story is very similar to Aoki's in that he also enters the Class A Tournament and loses. Afterward, he begins his comeback that eventually leads to winning the Junior Lightweight Championship fight against Ryo Mashiba. Kimura's story is also <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> manga in that he lost several of the fights and did not become the Junior Lightweight Champion.|$|E

5|$|Secret of Mana was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} a launch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing PlayStation console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES game cartridge, which is much smaller {{than that of a}} CD-ROM. The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game. In 2006, Level magazine claimed that Secret of Manas rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the Final Fantasy series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was again}} activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven {{of the ten}} original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was {{necessary in order to}} fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 90-day term. To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term. Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at Camp Henry Wilson in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship Plymouth Rock. Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.|$|E

25|$|Undercuts from etching are {{somewhat}} <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> undercuts explained above, {{because it is}} a side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the etchant was applied too long. The second is due to an isotropic etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an anisotropic etchant is used.|$|E

However, Core's idea for the film was significantly <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> script. His concept was much more of a big tentpole movie, with scenes that defy the laws of physics.|$|E

25|$|The game of Poohsticks was {{originally}} played by Christopher Milne on a footbridge across {{a tributary of}} the River Medway in Posingford Wood, close to Cotchford Farm. The wooden bridge is now a tourist attraction, and it has become traditional to play the game there using sticks gathered in nearby woodland. When the footbridge recently had to be replaced, the engineer designed a new structure based closely on the drawings of the bridge by Shepard in the books, which were somewhat <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original structure.|$|E
