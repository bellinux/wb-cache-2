25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{approach}} to study the alteration of D/H ratios of <b>kerogen</b> during catagenesis: 1)laboratory incubation of organic matter that enables mechanistic study with controlled experiments. 2)natural sample measurement that provides information of combined effects over geological timescales. The complex composition and chemistry of <b>kerogen</b> complicates the results. Nevertheless, most research on hydrogen isotopes of <b>kerogen</b> show D enrichment with increasing maturity. Type II kerogen(marine derived) from New Albany Shale is reported to have δD rise from -120‰ to -70‰ as vitrinite reflectance increase from 0.3% to 1.5%. Two main mechanisms have been proposed for enrichment. One of them is kinetic fractionation during hydrocarbon generation while the other is isotopic exchange with surrounding water. Anhydrous incubation experiments have shown that the products are generally more depleted in D than their precursors, causing enrichment in residual <b>kerogen.</b> Schimmelmann et al. studied the relationship between terrestrially-derived oil and their source rock kerogens from four Australian Basins. They found that on average the oil is depleted to corresponding <b>kerogen</b> by 23‰. Hydrous incubation experiments suggest that 36-79% of bulk organic hydrogen may come from water at moderate maturity. While still under debate, it appears likely that incorporation of water hydrogen isotopes is the more dominant process for <b>kerogen</b> D- enrichment during catagenesis.|$|E

Thermochemolysis with {{tetramethylammonium}} hydroxide (TMAH) and solid-state 15 N NMR were utilized for {{the characterization of}} refractory organic nitrogen in Tertiary Spanish <b>kerogens.</b> The samples included sulfur-rich oil shales from the Ribesalbes (Serravallian), Libros (Tortonian) and Cerdanya (Tortonian) basins. Analysis using solid state 15 N NMR showed {{that part of the}} refractory nitrogen in the <b>kerogens</b> corresponds to amide groups. Moreover, the release of amino acid derivatives after pyrolysis in the presence of TMAH indicated that this amide-N arose from peptide moieties. The amino acids released from the <b>kerogens</b> were dominated by high amounts of glycine and alanine. Minor amounts of aspartic acid, serine, α-aminobutyric acid and other unidentified amino acids were also detected. Because proteinaceous structures, including small peptides, are generally considered as being highly sensitive to diagenetic degradation, encapsulation of labile peptide material into aliphatic structures in S-rich <b>kerogens</b> (probably via lipid sulfurization) has been proposed to explain the survival of these moieties. Substantial amounts of fatty acids (as methyl esters) were also released from all the <b>kerogens</b> after pyrolysis/TMAH, indicating their highly aliphatic character.

25|$|The {{oil sands}} of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) were {{formed as a}} result of the {{formation}} of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting over the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now compose most of British Columbia. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and raised the Rockies over the plains, forming the Canadian Rockies. This mountain building process buried the sedimentary rock layers which underlie most of Alberta very deep, creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a giant pressure cooker that converted the <b>kerogen</b> in the deeply buried organic-rich shales to light oil and natural gas. These source rocks were similar to the American so-called oil shales, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the <b>kerogen</b> in them into liquid oil.|$|E

30|$|Trace {{elements}} in <b>kerogens</b> isolated from shale samples obtained from oil wells {{in the central}} Niger Delta were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry, with the aim to determine the depositional environment and source of the organic matter.

In both wells, Fe was the most abundant element, while cobalt had the least concentration. Nickel had an enhanced concentration over vanadium in Well X, while the reversed was the case in Well Y. The distribution patterns of the trace elements indicate that most of the <b>kerogens</b> from the two wells have similar origin. The geochemical ratios calculated from the concentrations of the trace elements revealed <b>kerogens</b> from Well X have terrestrial organic matter input, while <b>kerogens</b> from Well Y have both mixed marine/terrestrial organic matter and terrestrial inputs.

As a result of this study, five indices of aromatization (total aromatic acids/kerogen; apparent aromaticity; benzenetetracarboxylic acids/total aromatic acids; benzene- 1, 2 -dicarboxylic acid/benzenedicarboxylic acids; benzene- 1, 2, 3 -tricarboxylic acid/benzenetricarboxylic acids) and two indices of aliphatic character (Total aliphatic acids/kerogen; Aliphaticity) are proposed to characterize the degree of thermal alteration of <b>kerogens.</b> Furthermore, a good correlation is observed between apparent aromaticity estimated by the present KMnO 4 oxidation method and that from the 13 C NMR method (Dennis et al., 1982; doi: 10. 1016 / 0016 - 7037 (82) 90046 - 1) ...|$|R
25|$|Heavy crude oil, {{which is}} much more viscous than {{conventional}} crude oil, and tar sands, where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing <b>kerogen,</b> a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield synthetic crude oil when heated (pyrolyzed).

However a more plausible explanation is that biomarkers are traces of biological molecules from bacteria (archaea) that feed on primordial hydrocarbons and die in that environment.

25|$|Petroleum {{and natural}} gas are formed by the {{anaerobic}} decomposition of remains of organisms including phytoplankton and zooplankton that settled to the sea (or lake) bottom in large quantities under anoxic conditions, millions of years ago. Over geological time, this organic matter, mixed with mud, got buried under heavy layers of sediment. The resulting high levels of heat and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter, first into a waxy material known as <b>kerogen</b> which is found in oil shales, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in {{a process known as}} catagenesis. Despite these heat driven transformations (which may increase the energy density compared to typical organic matter), the embedded energy is still photosynthetic in origin.|$|E

25|$|Coals {{are from}} type III <b>kerogen</b> mostly derived from {{terrestrial}} plants, {{which should have}} a primary D/H signal sensitive to local meteoric water. Reddings et al. analyzed coals from various origins and found them randomly scatter across the range of -90‰ to -170‰.

Smith et al. studied H isotopes of coal samples from Antarctica and Australia. They found a strong negative correlation between δD and inferred paleolatitude. For coal samples originating from near equatorial regions, δD is around -50‰, while for those originating from polar regions, δD is around -150‰. This δD trend along latitude is consistent meteoric water trend and thus is an evidence that coals can preserve much of the original signals.|$|E

For comparison purposes, samples from Sites 474 and 479 were selected as representative of unaltered material. The GC and GC-MS data show that lipids of the thermally unaltered samples were derived from microbial and terrestrial higher-plant detritus. Samples from sill proximities were found to contain thermally-derived distillates and those adjacent to sills contained essentially no lipids. Curie point pyrolysis combined with GC and GC-MS was used to show that <b>kerogens</b> from the unaltered samples reflected their predominantly autochthonous microbial origin. Pyrograms of the altered <b>kerogens</b> were much less complex than the unaltered samples, reflecting the thermal effects. The <b>kerogens</b> adjacent to the sills produce little or no pyrolysis products since these intrusions into unconsolidated, wet sediments resulted in in situ pyrolysis of the organic matter.
