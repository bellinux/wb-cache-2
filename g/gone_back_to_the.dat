Afraid that they will take her kits, she lies and says they died from the cold. Afterwards, she lets her kits play outside, but when they go back in, she tells them about Ken.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may have <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} rivalry {{heading into the}} pay-per-view was between then-WWF Champion Diesel and his storyline rival Sid. At the previous pay-per-view, WrestleMania XI, Diesel defeated Shawn Michaels to retain the WWF Championship, partly due to an interference by Michaels' bodyguard Sid backfiring. The following night, Michaels stated that for a potential rematch, he would give Sid the night off, causing the bodyguard to turn on Michaels by powerbombing him three times. Diesel eventually came out to help Michaels. Michaels was legitimately injured, and this sidelined him for six weeks, effectively shelving plans for a rematch between Diesel and Michaels. Diesel was then scheduled to defend his title against Bam Bam Bigelow, {{a member of the}} Million Dollar Corporation stable, after a staged confrontation between the two on the April 16, 1995 episode of Action Zone, a secondary television program for the WWF. On the same day, on Wrestling Challenge, another secondary television program, in a segment featuring the Corporation, Bigelow was noticeably snubbed, signaling a turn. Over the weekend of April 16, a match between Sid and Diesel was scheduled for In Your House, in which Sid could potentially face Diesel for the WWF Championship, depending on whether he retained or lost his title against Bigelow. On the April 24 episode of Raw, Sid stated he was unhappy about this stipulation, as it meant that if Bigelow won, Sid would not get a shot at the title. Diesel retained the title when the Corporation turned on Bigelow, with Tatanka tripping Bigelow as he ran off the ropes. Diesel hit Bigelow with a big boot and executed a powerbomb for the win. After the contest, Bigelow was insulted by Ted DiBiase and attacked by the Corporation. Diesel, who had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> locker room, came to Bigelow's aid. In Sid's match with Razor Ramon on the May 1 episode of Raw, Diesel approached the ring ready to fight Sid, who, along with the Corporation's manager DiBiase, left the arena abruptly. The following week on Raw, DiBiase revealed that he and Sid had been working together for a while, admitting that it was him who told Shawn Michaels to get a bodyguard.|$|E

25|$|The 80th {{floor of}} the {{original}} design was planned to be an observation deck, {{the first one in}} Miami. The complex was later redesigned as two 70-floor towers, with the main tower being all office space, hence taller. The shorter tower was to be all hotel space. The current design goes back to a single mixed-use tower with 80 floors on a large podium with the top floors being office space and the bottom being hotel or residential space. The observation deck {{can be seen in the}} schematic diagram. Two FECR published sources have <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor count of 80 with the 1,010-foot design, and renderings of this design from 2009 show an observation deck, as well as the Metromover connection, in the blueprints.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 2012, John McAreavey {{said he was}} handcuffed {{by police}} {{officers}} and they examined his body for marks.

McAreavey said that he had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel room looking for his wife when she failed to return to the restaurant after leaving him to get some biscuits from their room to eat with their cups of tea. He found her unconscious in the bath, with the tap running and laid her on the floor and then tried to revive her. The DNA test made by a forensic expert from England revealed that no DNA traces of the two men accused and the other two original suspects were found on Michaela McAreavey body and at the crime scene except the DNA of John McAreavey.|$|E

When Bran asks his father about the ranger's talk of White Walkers, Ned dismisses it as a madman's ravings, insisting that the Walkers have been considered extinct for thousands of years.|$|E
500|$|His 1985 film Revolution about a fur trapper {{during the}} American Revolutionary War, was a {{commercial}} and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production, {{resulting in a}} four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of Crystal Clear, National Anthems and other plays; he appeared in Julius Caesar in 1988 in producer Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: [...] "I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui on stage and reading that the reason I'd <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of ethos, {{the way in which}} theater's perceived, unfortunately." [...] Pacino returned to film in 1989's Sea of Love, when he portrayed a detective hunting a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews.|$|E

500|$|Contrary to the lukewarm {{response}} to the pilot, [...] "Diversity Day" [...] earned positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode positive reviews, stating that: [...] "Think of the toss-off racism of the original, plopped into a PC-gone-wrong showcase that might be entitled The Accidental Bigot. As when the African-American diversity trainer introduces himself as Mr. Brown, and Scott assures him, 'I will not call you that.'" [...] Ricky Gervais, who was {{the lead in the}} British series, stated that, in comparison to the British version, [...] "It is as good. I love the fact that, apart from the first one, the scripts are all original. You've <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blueprint of what the characters are and you've started from there, as opposed to copying anything." [...] Rolling Stone magazine named the scene wherein Michael shows the office his diversity video the third greatest Moment from The Office.

2500|$|The NOVA/Horizon episode The Case of the Bermuda Triangle, {{aired on}} June 27, 1976, was highly critical, stating that [...] "When we've <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} sources {{or the people}} involved, the mystery evaporates.

He later claimed that these doubts had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Boer War but there {{appears to have been}} an element of later embellishment about this; Haig (who had criticised Kitchener, Roberts and others) had in fact praised French during the Boer War and had welcomed his appointment as CIGS in 1911.|$|E

2500|$|Dexter filed {{a similar}} countersuit against Martin and Bernice on August 18, 2008, {{claiming}} they breached their duties to the King Center and their father's estate, misused assets {{belonging to the}} center and kept money that should have <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> center and estate. Among the claims in the suit were that Martin improperly kept a $55,000 Lincoln Navigator SUV donated to the King Center for his own personal use, and that he [...] "commandeered a reception" [...] being held at the King Center and [...] "turned it into his own wedding reception." [...] Dexter claimed he made numerous attempts to get his siblings to stop such misuses of power but was unsuccessful. King III's lawyer, Jock Smith, denied the allegations as petty and misguided, and said the suit demonstrates Dexter King's misuse of power and his history of making poor decisions involving the Center without seeking proper input from his siblings.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the works}} of Bliss's maturity, Burn {{comments}} {{that many of them}} were inspired by external stimuli. Some by the performers for whom they were written, such as the concertos for piano (1938), violin (1955) and cello (1970); some by literary and theatrical partners, such as the film music, ballets, cantatas and The Olympians; some by painters, such as the Serenade and the Metamorphic Variations; some by classical literature, such as Hymn to Apollo (1926), The Enchantress, and Pastoral. Of Bliss's works after the Second [...] World War, his opera, The Olympians is generally considered a failure. The idiom was judged to be old-fashioned. A contemporary critic, in a broadly favourable review, wrote, [...] "Bliss has wisely cleared his idiom of modern harmonic astringency. He uses quite a lot of common chords and progressions; in fact, he has <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harmony of the musical gods. The result, inevitably, is a certain air of reminiscence." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 2007, Joe {{unexpectedly}} {{returns to}} the Fowlers' house, much to the horror of Pauline's friend Dot Branning (June Brown), who is inside {{the house at the}} time. Joe reveals to Dot that he had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house on Christmas Day to try to patch things up with Pauline, but that she harshly told him that he [...] was leaving, not her, and continued to insult him and his ways. He told Pauline he felt like lashing out at times, and she dared him to [...] "be a man" [...] and hit her. Joe then describes how, In an anger, he picked up a frying pan and hit Pauline hard on the head with it. He left the house after the incident, at which point Pauline was fine, {{and that was the last}} time he saw his wife, who later died due to a brain haemorrhage caused by the blow to the head Joe had given her. Dot then proceeds to try to convince Joe to tell the truth but he refuses. She then attempts to ring the police but Joe snatches the phone out of her hand and throws it away. Dot's husband, Jim (John Bardon) meanwhile, arrives at the Fowlers' house to find Dot. Seeing that Joe is holding Dot captive, Jim rushes over to save her and a struggle that follows results in Joe falling back and crashing out of a window and falling through a market stall. Jim looks out of the window as Joe lies on the street, dead.|$|E
