This approach included three methods.

The third method consists of spectrogram segmentation into three patches, and after that for each spectrogram patch we applied the second method. The classification results prove that the second method is the most efficient in our environmental sound classification system. These methods were tested on a large database containing 10 environmental sound classes. The best performance was obtained by using the multiclass support vector machines (SVMs), producing an average classification accuracy of 89. 62 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} subset selection {{problems in}} ranking and selection with tight computational budgets. We {{develop a new}} procedure that selects the best m out of k stochastic systems. Previous approaches have focused on individually separating out the top m from all the systems being considered. We reformulate the problem by casting all m-sized subsets of the k systems as the alternatives of the selection problem. This reformulation enables our derivation to follow along traditional ranking and selection frameworks. In particular, we extend the value of <b>information</b> <b>procedure</b> to subset selection. Furthermore, unlike previous subset selection efforts, we use an expected opportunity cost (EOC) loss function as evidence for correct selection. In minimizing the EOC, we consider both deriving an asymptotic allocation rule as well as approximately solving the underlying optimization problem. Experiments show the advantage of our approach for tests with small computational budgets. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in quantum information {{is to explore}} what kind of quantum correlations is responsible for successful completion of a quantum <b>information</b> <b>procedure.</b> Here we study the roles of entanglement, discord, and dissonance needed for optimal quantum state discrimination when the latter is assisted with an auxiliary system. In such process, we present a more general joint unitary transformation than the existing results. The quantum entanglement between a principal qubit and an ancilla {{is found to be}} completely unnecessary, as it can be set to zero in the arbitrary case by adjusting the parameters in the general unitary without affecting the success probability. This result also shows that it is quantum dissonance that plays as a key role in assisted optimal state discrimination and not quantum entanglement. A necessary criterion for the necessity of quantum dissonance based on the linear entropy is also presented. Comment: 5 figures, 6 pages. Accepted by Scientific Report...|$|E

The analysis is based on revealed and stated preference data. A maximum <b>information</b> <b>procedure</b> is developed to identify the shift potential due to the provision of better access conditions. A model is developed using joint estimation approach for the prediction of mode shares under policy effects. The environmental transit accessibility index, defined in this study, considers the effect of socioeconomic characteristics of the commuter, the economic and environmental implications and the behaviour of commuter under the hypothetical scenarios. The index is defined both for base year and for scenario year. A scale for evaluating environment transit accessibility is proposed. The approach is found defining transit accessibility satisfactorily for the study area. © Elsevie...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{research}} {{provides no}} systematic, limited <b>information</b> <b>procedure</b> for handling non-invertibility, despite the well-known inference problem it causes {{as well as}} its presence in many types of dynamic systems. Non-invertibility means that structural shocks cannot be recovered from a history of observed variables. It arises from a form of delayed responses due to, among other things, time-to-plan, sticky information or news shocks. Structural VARs rule out non-invertibility by assumption. Inference about structural responses can, in turn, be incorrect. We develop a four-step procedure to partially, and sometimes fully, identify structural responses whether or not non-invertibility is present. Our method combines structural VAR restrictions, e. g. recursive identification, with ”agnostic ” identification, e. g. sign restrictions and bounds on forecast error contributions. In two model-generated examples, our procedure recovers the structural responses where structural VARs cannot. Also, we apply our procedure to real world data. We show that non-invertibility is unlikely in Fisher’s (2006) study of technology shocks in the U. S. J. E. L. Classification: E 3.
