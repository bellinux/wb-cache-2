40|$|In today’s world {{automotive}} {{industries are}} still putting efforts towards more autonomous vehicles (AVs). The main concern of introducing the autonomous technology is safety of driver. According {{to a survey}} 90 % of accidents happen due to mistake of driver. The adaptive cruise control system (ACC) is a system which combines cruise control with a collision avoidance system. The ACC system is based on laser and radar technologies. This system is capable of controlling the velocity of vehicle automatically to match the velocity of car, bus or truck in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b> If the lead vehicle gets slow down or accelerate, than ACC system automatically matches that velocity. The proposed paper is focusing on more accurate methods of detecting the preceding vehicle by using a radar and lidar sensors by considering the vehicle side slip and by controlling the distance between two vehicles. By using this approach i. e. logic for calculation of former vehicle distance and controlling the throttle valve of ACC equipped vehicle, an improvement in driving stability was achieved. The own contribution results with fuel efficient driving and with more safer and reliable driving system, but still some improvements are going on {{to make it more}} safe and reliable...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Car- Pedestrian {{accidents}} cause a loss {{of thousands}} of lives annually in addition to injuries. Therefore, pedestrian protection is one of the important issue in the design of friendly cars. This study shows the performance of finite element head model (FEM) to study and foretelling the extent of injury that occurs at pedestrian accidents and tests the design of the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> according to European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC WG 17) regulations of bonnet test. The FE models are powerful tools and effective method to understand how to reduce the sever ity of the fatalities of injuries in road pedestrian collision incidents. In this study, the finite element head model impactor has been built by using Soldworks program and simulated the impact process in LS-DYNA program to examine the four engine-hoods have been designed. All of the hood plates and inner hood panel were considered. Head Injury Criterion (HIC), internal energy time history generated in the head and hood, displacement occurred in the hood inner panel and weights of the complete hood are investigated. The results of the study concluded that modification of headform design of the car hood contributes in achieving low HIC and lead to a pedestrian friendly car. The results show that the structural design of the inner hood panel {{is one of the key}} factors affecting the design and specifications of car hood...|$|E

The 6 th International Workshop Applications of Computer Image Analysis and Spectroscopy in Agriculture, Aarhus, DNK, 25 -/ 06 / 2016 - 30 / 06 / 2016 International audiencePrecision {{agriculture}} vehicles need autonomous navigation in cultures {{to carry}} out their tasks. The detection of obstacles in crop row is crucial for safe navigation. Lidar devices or Time Of Flight cameras (TOF), allow to obtaingeometric data in natural environment. Fusion of those geometric information with a color camera data, improves the identification and discrimination of objects in agricultural cultures. Autonomous agricultural vehicles can use thesegeometric and colorimetric data in real time, to follow crop rows and detect obstacles while executing various precision agriculture operations, such as monitoring tasks, maintenance or harvesting, for preserving safety, for both vehicle and environment. In our application, a lidar and a TOF camera which detected objects respectively on a plane and in 3 D space, were associated with a color camera. Sensors were embedded on a mobile robot. Fusion method consisted to put the lidar and TOF data inside the color image, and make colorimetric and geometric measures on the detected objects (grass, leaf, tree branches), in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> for identifying these ones. Traversability operations, tested with a mobile robot in vineyard environment, during crop raw tracking operations, consisted to take a decision, according to the size and nature of the detected objects, working under different lighting conditions, and various vegetation levels: the vehicle crossed the object at reduced speed, or it avoided it, or it stopped. Experimentations showed the effectiveness of the approach to detect and identify objects, such as grass or solid obstacles, at various heights from the ground...|$|E
