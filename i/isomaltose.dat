This variety in sources could benefit consumers who have allergies or hypersensitivity to certain cereal crops. The manufacturing process controls the degree of polymerization (dp) and the α(1,6)-linkages to ensure a consistent quality of IMO from different starch sources. The starch is first converted, by means of simple enzymatic hydrolysis, into high maltose syrup with di-, tri and oligosaccharides (2, 3 or more glucose units) having α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages which are readily digestible in the human intestine. These α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages are further converted into digestion-resistant α(1,6)-glycosidic linkages, creating [...] "iso" [...] linkages between glucose moieties and forming Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO). [...] The majority of oligosaccharides found in IMO consist of three to six monosaccharide (glucose) units linked together. However, disaccharides, as well as longer polysaccharides (up to nine glucose units), are also present. The disaccharide fraction of IMO consists mainly of α(1,6)-linked <b>isomaltose,</b> while maltotriose, panose, and isomaltotriose make up the trisaccharide fraction.

SI catalyzes the hydrolysis of the {{glycosidic bond}} with retention of the anomeric configuration via a mechanism that involves a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate. It possesses a 325 RLDRD 329 motif, which is highly conserved and {{plays an important}} role in fructose binding. The predicted three-dimensional active-site structure of SI was superimposed on and compared with those of other α-glucosidases in family 13. We identified two Arg residues that may play important roles in SI-substrate binding with weak ionic strength. Mutations at Arg 325 and Arg 328 in the fructose-binding site reduced isomaltulose production and slightly increased trehalulose production. In addition, the perturbed interactions between the mutated residues and fructose at the fructose-binding site seemed to have altered the binding affinity of the site, where glucose could now bind and be utilized as a second substrate for <b>isomaltose</b> production. From eight mutant enzymes designed based on structural analysis, the R 325 Q mutant enzyme exhibiting high relative activity for <b>isomaltose</b> production was selected. We recorded 40. 0 % relative activity at 15 % (wt/vol) additive glucose with no temperature shift; the maximum <b>isomaltose</b> concentration and production yield were 57. 9 g liter− 1 and 0. 55 g of isomaltose/g of sucrose, respectively. Furthermore, <b>isomaltose</b> production increased with temperature but decreased at a temperature of > 35 °C.

We identified gene clusters associated with the production and intracellular catabolism of CNN in the K. flavida genome. One cluster encodes 6 -alpha-glucosyl-transferase and 3 -alpha-isomaltosyltransferase, which are known to coproduce CNN from starch. The other cluster contains four genes annotated as a transcriptional regulator, sugar transporter, glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 31 protein (Kfla 1895), and GH 15 protein (Kfla 1896). Kfla 1895 hydrolyzed the alpha-(1 -> 3) -glucosidic linkages of CNN and produced <b>isomaltose</b> via a possible linear tetrasaccharide. The initial rate of hydrolysis of CNN (11. 6 s(- 1)) was much {{higher than that of}} panose (0. 242 s(- 1)), and hydrolysis of isomaltotriose and nigerose was extremely low. Because Kfla 1895 has a strong preference for the alpha-(1 -> 3) -isomaltosyl moiety and effectively hydrolyzes the alpha-(1 -> 3) -glucosidic linkage, it should be termed 1, 3 -alpha-isomaltosidase. Kfla 1896 effectively hydrolyzed <b>isomaltose</b> with liberation of beta-glucose, but displayed low or no activity toward CNN and the general GH 15 enzyme substrates such as maltose, soluble starch, or dextran. The k(cat) /K-m for <b>isomaltose</b> (4. 81 +/- 0. 18 s(- 1) mM(- 1)) was 6. 9 - and 19 -fold higher than those for panose and isomaltotriose, respectively. These results indicate that Kfla 1896 is a new GH 15 enzyme with high substrate specificity for <b>isomaltose,</b> suggesting the enzyme should be designated an <b>isomaltose</b> glucohydrolase.

They share high nucleotide sequence identities between themselves (66 – 100 %) and with the MALx 2 genes (63 – 74 %). Comparison of their amino acid sequences underlined a substitution of threonine by valine in region II, one of the four highly conserved regions of the α-glucosidase family.

Here, we explore their functional diversity, with exhaustive in-vitro characterization of their enzymological and biochemical properties. The four isoenzymes exhibited {{a preference for}} the α-(1, 6) disaccharides <b>isomaltose</b> and palatinose, with Michaëlis–Menten kinetics and inhibition at high substrates concentration. They were also able to hydrolyze trisaccharides bearing an α-(1, 6) linkage, but also α-(1, 2), α-(1, 3) and α-(1, 5) disaccharides including sucrose, highlighting their substrate ambiguity. While Ima 1 p and Ima 2 p presented almost identical characteristics, our results nevertheless showed many singularities within this protein family. In particular, Ima 3 p presented lower activities and thermostability than Ima 2 p despite only three different amino acids between the sequences of these two isoforms. The Ima 3 p_R 279 Q variant recovered activity levels of Ima 2 p, while the Leu-to-Pro substitution at position 240 significantly increased the stability of Ima 3 p and supported the role of prolines in thermostability. The most distant protein, Ima 5 p, presented the lowest optimal temperature and was also extremely sensitive to temperature. <b>Isomaltose</b> hydrolysis by Ima 5 p challenged previous conclusions about the requirement of specific amino acids for determining the specificity for α-(1, 6) substrates. We finally found a mixed inhibition by maltose for Ima 5 p while, contrary to a previous work, Ima 1 p inhibition by maltose was competitive at very low <b>isomaltose</b> concentrations and uncompetitive as the substrate concentration increased. Altogether, this work illustrates that a gene family encoding proteins with strong sequence similarities can lead to enzyme with notable differences in biochemical and enzymological properties...|$|E
30|$|Glucose {{was found}} to be {{polymerized}} during treatment with [C 2 mim][Cl] at around 100  °C. Various disaccharides such as maltose, nigerose, kojibiose, laminaribiose, <b>isomaltose,</b> and gentiobiose were identified. The disaccharide yield tends to increase as the initial concentration of glucose in [C 2 mim][Cl] increases. Consequently, [C 2 mim][Cl] polymerizes glucose to oligosaccharides. We thus report a new and simple method for the production of various valuable oligosaccharides from various monosaccharides using an ionic liquid.|$|E

Bothproducts were obtained in one-pot reaction using as a donor the a-cyclodextrin and as an acceptor the disaccharide <b>isomaltose.</b> The regioselectivity of the reaction was 85...|$|E
