5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} promote {{is often the}} {{critical}} factor in endgames and thus is an important consideration in opening and middlegame strategy. Almost all promotions occur in the endgame, but promotion in the middlegame <b>does</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E

25|$|Polyandry {{occurs when}} one female gets {{exclusive}} mating rights with multiple males. This is not common, but it <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> among fish like clownfish that change their sex. It can also happen when males do the brooding but can cannot handle all the eggs the female produce, such as with some pipefish.|$|E
25|$|If it <b>does</b> <b>happen,</b> then {{material}} {{reaching the}} bottom of the convective thrust region can no longer be adequately supported by convection and will fall under gravity, forming a pyroclastic flow or surge which can travel down the flanks of a volcano at speeds of over 100km/h. Column collapse {{is one of the most}} common and dangerous volcanic hazards in a plinian eruption.|$|E
25|$|Again, {{suppose it}} were like this: people-seeds drift {{about in the}} air like pollen, and if you 	open your windows, one may drift in and take root in your carpets or upholstery. You don’t want children, so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy. As can happen, however, and on very, very rare {{occasions}} <b>does</b> <b>happen,</b> one of the screens is defective; and a seed drifts in and takes root.|$|E

25|$|By 31 July 2006 the Long Term Council Community Plans 2006 - 2016 {{will be in}} the Parliamentary Library for 86 Territorial Authorities. The Community Outcomes will {{be printed}} in this {{document}} for each area. It was optional until 2006 and now Community Outcomes are a must. Eleven LTA did not comply with pre-Audit requirements and whether they will make the deadline is not yet known. Three others will not have sign off by full Council by 30 June 2006 and this will have spending implications for the councils until sign off <b>does</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{literature}} {{available on the}} organs. In 2005, Lin Yangchen published an article titled Singapore's Answer to Notre Dame de Paris in The Organ describing both instruments in detail (The Organ 334:8–10). He describes the unique situation presented by having separate organs in the same building, which makes possible a dialogue between the Gallery and Choir Organs. In fact, this <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> during solemn occasions and when two organists are present. The choir and congregation are then accompanied separately, although {{this is no longer}} possible now {{that there is only one}} organ in the Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|According to Ahmadiyya thought, {{it is not}} {{essential}} for a caliph {{to be the head}} of a state, rather the spiritual and religious significance of the Caliphate is emphasised. It is above all a spiritual office, with the purpose to uphold, strengthen, spread the teachings of Islam and maintain the high spiritual and moral standards within the global community established by Muhammad. If a caliph <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> to bear governmental authority as a head of state, it is incidental and subsidiary in relation to his overall function as a caliph. The caliph is also referred to by Ahmadi Muslims as Amir al-Mu'minin (Leader of the Faithful). The current and fifth caliph is Mirza Masroor Ahmad.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the Premier selects MLAs {{from their}} party to be {{appointed}} ministers of the Crown by the Lieutenant Governor. Cabinet appointees are designated ministers in charge of government ministries; {{they are responsible for}} the day-to-day activities of individual government ministries such as the Ministry of Forests, and for proposing new laws or changing existing ones. The Premier may also choose an individual who is not an MLA to be a cabinet minister, although on the rare occasion that this <b>does</b> <b>happen,</b> the practice is that the minister proceeds to obtain a seat in the House. The appointment of an MLA to Cabinet is based on their ability and expertise and is also influenced by political considerations such as geography, gender and ethnicity.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanical {{heart valves}} have been {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} more durable in comparison to their bioprosthetic counterparts. [...] The struts and occluders are made out of either pyrolytic carbon or titanium coated with pyrolytic carbon, and the sewing ring cuff is Teflon (PTFE), polyester or dacron. [...] The major load arises from transvalvular pressure generated at and after valve closure, and in cases where structural failure <b>does</b> <b>happen,</b> it is usually {{as a result of}} occluder impact on the components.|$|E

2500|$|Kademlia uses a [...] "distance" [...] {{calculation}} {{between two}} nodes. This distance is computed as the exclusive or (XOR) {{of the two}} node IDs, taking the result as an integer number. Keys and Node IDs have the same format and length, so distance can be calculated among them {{in exactly the same}} way. The node ID is typically a large random number that is chosen with the goal of being unique for a particular node (see UUID). It can and <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> that geographically widely separated nodes—from Germany and Australia, for instance—can be [...] "neighbors" [...] if they have chosen similar random node IDs.|$|E
2500|$|In general, blood damage affects valves in {{both the}} mitral and aortic positions. [...] High {{stresses}} during leakage flow in aortal valves result from higher transvalvular pressures, and high stresses occur during forward flow for mitral valves. [...] Valvular thrombosis is most common in mitral prosthetics. [...] The caged-ball model {{is better than the}} other two models in terms of controlling this problem, because it is at a lower risk for thrombosis and it is gradual when it <b>does</b> <b>happen.</b> [...] The bileaflet is more adaptable to this problem than the tilting-disc model because if one leaflet stops working, the other can still function. [...] However, if the hinge is blocked, both leaflets will stop functioning.|$|E

[...] Also another of the four co-writers, Irish international criminal investigations expert Desmond Travers, noted: 'the tenor of the report in its entirety, in my opinion, stands'. Also Goldstone maintained that, although the one correction should be made, he had [...] "no reason to believe any part of the report needs to be reconsidered at this time" [...] and that he didn't plan to pursue nullifying the report.|$|E
