5|$|Both {{the commons}} and King Richard II were {{enthusiastic}} about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful {{of the consequences of}} imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French.|$|E
5|$|From 1878 to 1890, the Anti-Socialist Laws forbade all socialist trade unions. Only small local organizations, which communicated via {{intermediaries}} such as stewards, {{who worked}} illegally or semi-legally, survived. This form of organization {{was easier to}} protect against state repression. After the laws were sunset in 1890, the General Commission of the Trade Unions of Germany was founded on November 17 {{at a conference in}} Berlin to centralize the socialist labor movement. In 1892, the Trade Union Congress of Halberstadt was held to organize the many local unions under the committee. The localists, 31,000 of whom were represented at the congress, wanted to retain many of the changes that had been adopted during the repressive period. For example, they opposed separate organizations <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> matters, such as the party and the trade union. They especially wanted to keep their grassroots democratic structures. They also advocated local trade unions being networked by delegates rather than ruled centrally, and were wary of bureaucratic structures. The localists' proposals were rejected at the Halberstadt congress, so they refused to join the centralized trade unions, which became known as the Free Trade Unions. They did not renounce social democracy, but rather considered themselves to be an avant-garde within the social democratic movement in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} the {{policies}} of temple closure and monk defrocking of the Okayama, Aizu, and Mito Domains, also adopted <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic,</b> rather than religious, reasons during the early modern period. These domainal policies were in general based on Confucian anti-Buddhist thought. The Meiji period form of haibutsu kishaku, based on kokugaku and Shinto-centrism, was instead dictated {{by a desire to}} distinguish between foreign Buddhism and a purely Japanese Shinto.|$|E

25|$|As the Democrats were {{grappling}} {{with their own}} troubles, leaders in the Republican party fought to keep elected members focused {{on the issue of}} slavery in the West, which allowed them to mobilize popular support. Chase wrote Sumner that if the conservatives succeeded, it might be necessary to recreate the Free Soil Party. He was also particularly disturbed by the tendency of many Republicans to eschew moral attacks on slavery <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> arguments.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 a large {{section of}} second-rung leaders and members {{surrendered}} to government authorities. These former members {{were allowed to}} retain their weapons to defend against their former colleagues; they were offered bank loans without any liabilities to help them re-integrate into society. This loose group, now called SULFA, has become {{an important element in}} the armed politics and business of Assam.

25|$|Generals, {{during the}} recent Republican civil wars, had formed their own legions and {{numbered}} them as they wished. During this time, there was {{a high incidence of}} Gemina (twin) legions, where two legions were consolidated into a single organization (and was later made official and put under a legatus and six duces). At {{the end of the civil}} war against Mark Antony, Augustus was left with around fifty legions, with several double counts (multiple Legio Xs for instance). <b>For</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> reasons, Augustus reduced the number of legions to 28 (which diminished to 25 after the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, in which 3 legions were completely destroyed by the Germanics).|$|E

25|$|Togo had {{originally}} been a protectorate of the German colonial empire but {{was taken by the}} British and French during World War I. The French and British divided the area administratively with the French taking control in 1922 of the area of present-day Togo. The eastern portion joined the British Gold Coast colony, dividing the Ewe population between British and French colonies. During World War II, the French Vichy government considered the powerful Olympio family of Togo to be pro-British and so many members of that family were arrested, including Sylvanus Olympio who was held for a significant time in a prison in the remote city of Djougou (in present-day Benin). His imprisonment became a key point impacting his future relationships with the French and a metaphor for the need <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> independence for Togo which he would use repeatedly in speeches.|$|E
25|$|As the {{influence}} of the Hanseatic League waned, Riga became the object of foreign military, political, religious and economic aspirations. Riga accepted the Reformation in 1522, ending the power of the archbishops. In 1524, iconoclasts targeted a statue of the Virgin Mary in the Cathedral to make a statement against religious icons. It was accused of being a witch, and given a trial by water in the Daugava River. The statue floated, so it was denounced as a witch and burnt at Kubsberg. With the demise of the Livonian Order during the Livonian War, Riga for twenty years had the status of a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire before it came under {{the influence}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Treaty of Drohiczyn, which ended the war for Riga in 1581. In 1621, during the Polish–Swedish War (1621–1625), Riga and the outlying fortress of Daugavgriva came under the rule of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, who intervened in the Thirty Years' War not only <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> gain but also in favour of German Lutheran Protestantism. During the Russo-Swedish War (1656–1658), Riga withstood a siege by Russian forces.|$|E

2500|$|However, democratization had its problems. During {{the early}} stages of the process, {{political}} parties were still banned, but independent candidates, some including those who had splintered off from the Kuomintang, were allowed to run for offices, provided that they would not receive any campaign funding from the party. As a result, many of these candidates resorted to borrowing money from businessmen, local elite, or even gangsters, in exchange <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> favors.

2500|$|The {{outline of}} Russia's foreign policy was {{presented}} by Vladimir Putin in his Address to Russia's Federal Assembly in April 2002: [...] "We are building constructive, normal relations {{with all the}} world's nations—I want to emphasise, with all the world's nations.

And in this fight, Russia needs {{to be strong and}} competitive." [...] "I want to stress that Russian foreign policy will in the future be organized in a strictly pragmatic way, based on our capabilities and national interests: military and strategic, economic and political.

2500|$|After World War II, {{communism}} {{became a}} global phenomenon and anti-communism became {{an integral part}} of the domestic and foreign policies of the United States and its NATO allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religion and nationalism. Throughout the Cold War, colonial governments in Asia, Africa and Latin America turned to the United States <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> support. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying Wall Street as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term [...] "McCarthyism". While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called right-wing and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists, leftist.|$|E
2500|$|The harsh postwar {{crackdown}} on remnants of capitalism in the South {{led to the}} collapse of the economy during the 1980s. With the economy in shambles, the communist government altered its course and adopted consensus policies that bridged the divergent views of pragmatists and communist traditionalists. Throughout the 1980s, Vietnam received nearly $3 billion a year in economic and military aid from the Soviet Union and conducted most of its trade with the USSR and other Comecon countries. In 1986, Nguyễn Văn Linh, who was elevated to CPV general secretary the following year, launched a campaign <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> renewal (Đổi Mới). His policies were characterized by political and economic experimentation that was similar to simultaneous reform agenda undertaken in the Soviet Union. Reflecting the spirit of political compromise, Vietnam phased out its reeducation effort. The communist government stopped promoting agricultural and industrial cooperatives. Farmers were permitted to till private plots alongside state-owned land, and in 1990 the communist government passed a law encouraging the establishment of private businesses.|$|E
