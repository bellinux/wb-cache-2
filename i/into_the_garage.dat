5|$|Lisa remains skeptical {{and asks}} Stephen Jay Gould {{to test a}} sample. When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house {{the next day to}} tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive, Lisa goes on {{television}} to compare the belief in angels to the belief in unicorns and leprechauns. In response, Springfield's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions. Appalled with the violence, Lisa goes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> to destroy the skeleton, but finds that it has disappeared. The mob soon converges on the Simpson household and Lisa is arrested and put on trial for destroying the skeleton.|$|E
5|$|As Q3 started, Lewis Hamilton {{stopped in}} the pit lane {{with a loss of}} power and was pushed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> He was {{eventually}} able to go on track and qualified third, after starting several quick laps only to abandon them to leave his final run to the last moment. He was however beaten to pole position by Ricciardo, who was almost three-tenths of a second faster than second placed Rosberg, with Vettel following in fourth almost a second slower. Nico Hülkenberg managed fifth ahead of Kimi Räikkönen, who was to serve a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, leaving him eleventh on the grid. Carlos Sainz Jr., Sergio Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Fernando Alonso rounded up the top ten. Ricciardo's pole position was the first for a Renault-powered turbocharged car since Ayrton Senna's front-of-the-grid start at the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix for Lotus.|$|E
5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up {{from his}} chair and starts leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage,</b> they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E

50|$|Until 1920 Leith was a {{separate}} burgh, {{with its own}} municipal tram system. The Leith system was electrified, whereas the Edinburgh system used cable haulage (as still used by the San Francisco cable car system and the Great Orme Tramway in Wales). The cable was housed in a shallow trough between the tram rails; breakages could reduce the entire system to a standstill. The main depot was moved to Shrubhill on Leith Walk. An underground chamber at <b>the</b> main turn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garages</b> here was permanently manned during operating hours to try to reduce cable-snagging.|$|R
5|$|Mulder's own {{problems}} arise when {{his cell phone}} rings and Krycek disappears from his car. Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through the car window with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's cell phone. Krycek aims his gun at Mulder and tells him to get out. Krycek is about {{to pull the trigger}} when a bullet administered by Skinner pierces his arm. Krycek tries to pick his gun up again, but Skinner shoots his hand, rendering it useless. Krycek pushes his gun over and tells Skinner to shoot Mulder, telling him Mulder's life will grant him a thousand lives. Instead, Skinner raises his gun and shoots Krycek in the head. Doggett attempts to apprehend Rohrer and Crane but ends up being chased by the two. The pursuit ends up in the FBI garage and ends violently with Crane being run over and Rohrer crashing his car <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> wall, going up in flames. Both men are presumed dead.|$|E

25|$|Scene Three {{takes place}} on a Saturday. A hoedown-themed wedding {{reception}} has been organized at Dino's Diner. People are dressed in their party best, dancing and taking photographs. But {{in the midst of}} the jollity there is an ominous mood. Both Lana and Angelo try to get close to Luca, not realizing that the two of them have each slept with him, while Dino develops an odd sense that something untoward is happening, with Luca at its center. Rita continues to pine after Angelo, but he ignores her. Smarting from Dino's attempts to assert dominance over the proceedings and especially his wife, Lana and Luca sneak off from the party for a dalliance in the garage. They are caught by Dino, who gets into a fight with Luca. Lana tries to intervene but is punched in the stomach by Dino. Luca lunges at Dino but Dino pushes him to the ground. Then Lana picks up a heavy spanner and hits Dino on the head with it. He is stunned by the blow. Lana prevails upon Luca to finish Dino off, and Luca, despite some momentary reluctance, clubs Dino one last time. Dino falls to the ground, apparently dead. Luca and Lana hear someone coming, so they drag Dino's body into his office. Unknown to them, Rita has witnessed the last part of the fight, and she hurries off to call the police. Then Angelo appears, seeking Luca. To Luca and Lana's horror, Dino is not dead – he crawls out of the office and grabs Angelo, seeking help. He then collapses on Angelo, smearing him with his blood. The commotion by Angelo and Dino causes the partygoers to run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> Luca flees before the local cop, Chuck, arrives on the scene. Lana claims that Angelo murdered Dino, and pretends to cry over his dead body. Angelo, realizing his predicament too late and protesting his innocence, is arrested and taken away.|$|E

Further back, Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa touched, resulting in flat tyres for both drivers, with Sergio Pérez also having to go into the pit lane with a puncture. Hamilton led Vettel by 1.6 seconds after the first lap, increasing his advantage {{over the next couple of}} laps. Alonso, who had moved up the order at the start, lost ninth position to Sainz on lap four. Meanwhile, Rosberg tried to pass Bottas for third, but was told to hold off as his engine was overheating.

2500|$|GSA's design {{specifications}} required that extensive underground parking {{be incorporated into}} the building. Breuer designed a lightweight, six-acre (2.4 hectares) plaza to fit as a sort of roof over the underground parking garage. The plaza surface would be covered in masonry [...] "stones", with a curving driveway (mimicking the building facade) to lead vehicular traffic <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> entrance and exit (which were situated {{in the center of the}} plaza). An offshoot of the driveway (set off by bollards) came up to the front doors to allow the limousines of high-ranking visitors to pull up directly to the building's front doors. Because the weight of the plaza/roof had to be kept light, no plantings (lawns, trees, shrubs, etc.) were envisioned for the plaza. Although the plaza was devoid of plants, its shape and vast expanse were designed to relate aesthetically to the nearby National Mall.|$|E
2500|$|Racing resumed {{seven minutes}} later with Lieb {{maintaining}} the No. 2 Porsche's advantage over teammate Hartley.

Sam Bird, in the No. 71 AF Corse car, went off the track and into the turn five gravel trap but recovered to remain in third place in LMGTE Pro. Pizzonia in Manor's No. 44 vehicle passed Leventis's No. 42 Strakka Racing car for third place in LMP2, and the latter fell to fifth after he was overtaken by Derani. A fourth full course yellow was triggered when Lieb attempted to lap Kahled Al-Qubaisi in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing car but hit him, sending it into the turn six gravel trap. Most of the LMP1 and LMP2 runners made pit stops during the full course yellow. Lieb's front-left dive plane was damaged and required repairs, Audi's No. 7 car had its front bodywork changed and the track was cleaned by marshals.|$|E
