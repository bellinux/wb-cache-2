500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> creative first. It's an art, you've got to look at it like an art, treat it like an art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E
500|$|Another of Romney's {{initiatives}} was [...] "Operation Breakthrough," [...] {{which was}} intended {{to increase the amount}} of housing available to the poor and which initially had Nixon's support. [...] Based on his automotive industry experience, Romney thought that the cost of housing could be significantly reduced if in-factory modular construction techniques were used. [...] HUD officials believed that introduction of this technique could help bring about desegregation; Romney said, [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an end to the idea of moving to suburban areas and living only among people of the same economic and social class". [...] This aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well. [...] Over half of HUD's research funds during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough, and it was modestly successful in its building goals. [...] It did not revolutionize home construction, and was phased out once Romney left HUD. But it resulted indirectly in more modern and consistent building codes and introduction of technological advances such as the smoke alarm.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Waters {{called for}} the {{implementation}} of a federal [...] "jobs program of a trillion dollars or more". [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Americans to work," [...] she said. [...] "That's the only way to revitalize this economy. When people work they earn money, they spend that money, and that's what gets the economy up and going." ...|$|E

[...] "One of the things we've sat down and said is {{if you want to}} be the spinning allrounder you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a huge amount of time into your bowling, because Maxy would always try to bowl the miracle ball and then he'd bowl a leggie, then try a doosra, he just didn't settle on anything. All we've got him in the nets is bowling offspin, offspin, offspin. It's repetition all the time and he's getting better and better at it. He's a very fast learner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Indiana players wear {{warm-up pants}} that are striped red and white, like the stripes of a candy cane. They were first {{worn by the}} team in the 1970s under head coach Bob Knight. At {{the time they were}} in keeping with the fashion trends of the 1970s, but despite {{changing}} styles they have since become an iconic part of playing for Indiana. IU star guard Steve Alford said, [...] "As you watch television and you watch the IU games, that's the first thing you saw, was the team run out in the candy stripes. So when you finally <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> those on, those are pretty special." [...] Rusty Stillions, Director of Indiana's Equipment Operations, said the pants were originally available only for team members. However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events. Beginning in 2014, during Hoosier Hysteria, former IU basketball players have presented to the new players their first pair of candy striped pants. This practice symbolizes a [...] "passing-of-the-torch" [...] and carrying on the rich tradition and responsibilities of playing for Indiana University.|$|E
2500|$|In early December 2015, FEMM {{confirmed}} {{in a press}} release through Avex Group Inc. that they would release their debut physical album, which was revealed to be entitled Pow!/L.C.S.. FEMM confirmed the EP would include two new tracks; the studio version of [...] "Pow!", and [...] "L.C.S.", alongside old remixes of their previous singles; they commented that they would add new re-edited versions of different tracks that didn't appear on their debut studio. In late January 2016, FEMM announced through a press release with Avex Group Inc. that they would release a double album in late February 2016 that included a physical copy of Femm-Isation. Regarding the material, FEMM agent Honey-B stated [...] "The original order of the songs was already carefully mapped out, but this time round we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in segues in between songs which made a big difference. The songs flow so smoothly, it will seem like it all happens {{in a split second}} and like you have travelled in time." [...] On February 3, Pow!/L.C.S. was released digitally through iTunes Stores and served a physical released on February 23. The music videos to [...] "Pow!" [...] and [...] "L.C.S." [...] premiered on FEMM's YouTube channel in January and February 2016. On April 27, 2016, they re-release YouTube videos of [...] "White Noise" [...] and [...] "Whiplash" [...] with minor changes to lyrics and new camera angles.|$|E

They asked me to play, and as I couldn't work just then, I consented, and then they <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up some money,--just to make it interestin', they said.

2500|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétien's use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might [...] But you're {{not going to get the}} chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident that he was going to win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{split with}} Fleetwood Mac in 1987, Buckingham {{spent much of}} the next five years in the studio, working on his third solo album, Out of the Cradle, which was {{released}} in 1992. [...] Many of the songs deal with his relationship with Nicks and his decision to leave the band. [...] "There were things lingering for years having to do with relationships and the band, hurtful things, that were impossible to deal with until I left. If you were in a relationship and split up, then had to see that person every day for the next 15 years, it might keep you from dealing with some of those things. While we made Rumours (in 1977) there were two couples breaking up in the band (Buckingham and Nicks, and John and Christine McVie), and we had to say, [...] "This is an important thing we're doing, so we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> this set of feelings {{on this side of the}} room and get on with it.'" [...] And when you do that long enough you forget that those feelings are even there. On this album, I'm putting all these feelings in the healthiest possible perspective and that, looking at it broadly, is a lot of what the album is dealing with. It's a catharsis, absolutely." [...] "Wrong" [...] was a gentle rebuke of former bandmate Mick Fleetwood's tell-all biography. Out of the Cradle received some favorable reviews but did not achieve the sales levels associated with Fleetwood Mac. However, Buckingham toured throughout 1992–93 for the first time as a solo artist; his band included an army of seven other guitarists (Buckingham himself calls them [...] "the crazy band" [...] on his Soundstage DVD), each of whom he individually taught the entire two-and-a-half hours of music from the concert (Lindsey Buckingham: Behind the Music documentary for VH-1, 2001).|$|E
2500|$|The band entered Jackson Browne's private {{recording}} studio named Groovemasters in January 2006, after Panunzio had suggested {{it would be}} a suitable recording location. New Found Glory strove to achieve a [...] "clean kind of classic guitar sound" [...] when recording, using a Vox AC30 amp on almost the entire record. The amp, known for its [...] "jangly" [...] high-end sound, was used with several classic guitars in the studio including a Fender Tele, Les Paul, Gibson 335-S and a Rickenbacker. Gilbert enthused that, [...] "It sounds huge. When you put our old records on and our new record, there's actually less guitars on our new album, but it sounds bigger." [...] Jordan Pundik likewise accounted; [...] "he [...] brought this classic vibe to it, especially with the tones he got. We learned we don't have to double-up 15 Mesa cabinets and make it all distorted to make it sound big." [...] Pundik also spoke of the band's desire to challenge themselves musically; [...] "Usually with every record we think, 'We’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the fast punk song on it or people won't like it', but this wasn't anything like that." [...] He did admit that around thirty songs were written, including some fast-paced songs, but were excluded as, [...] "(they) didn't really fit." [...] Steve Klein, the band's principal lyricist and rhythm guitarist, also praised Panunzio for helping the band bring new elements to their sound. Describing the sessions as [...] "best recording experience ever", he added, [...] "It's this empty mansion where we were able to set up all our equipment, we just woke up and wrote songs. We were really relaxed and able to set our own pace. Everything about the record is way more classic rock sounding because Thom has done a bunch of classic rock records like Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen and Ozzy, and {{the list goes on and}} on. He kind of brought this different element to our band. This disc is less guitar driven and more melody driven, more than any other of our records." ...|$|E
