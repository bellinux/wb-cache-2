50|$|The {{prototype}} V-12s outperformed {{their design}} specifications, setting numerous world records which still stand today, and brought its designers numerous awards {{such as the}} prestigious Sikorsky Prize awarded by the American Helicopter Society for outstanding achievements in helicopter technology. The V-12 design was patented in the USA, Great Britain and other countries.Despite all of these achievements the Soviet Air Force {{refused to accept the}} helicopter for state acceptance trials for many reasons, the main one being that the V-12's most important intended mission no longer existed, i.e. the rapid deployment of <b>heavy</b> strategic <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> This also led to a reduction in Antonov An-22 production.|$|R
50|$|ICBMs are {{differentiated}} {{by having}} greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles: intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (IRBMs), medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (MRBMs), short-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (SRBMs) and tactical <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (TBMs). Short and medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are known collectively as theatre <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R

50|$|An intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (IRBM) is a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> with a {{range of}} 3,000-5,500 km (1,864-3,418 miles), between a medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (MRBM) and an {{intercontinental}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ICBM). Classifying <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> by range is done mostly for convenience, in principle there is very little difference between a low-performance ICBM and a high-performance IRBM, because decreasing payload mass can increase range over ICBM threshold. The range definition used here is used within the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. Some other sources include an additional category, the long-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (LRBM), to describe missiles {{with a range}} between IRBMs and true ICBMs. The more modern term theater <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> encompasses MRBMs and SRBMs, including any <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> with a range under 3500 km.|$|R

5000|$|A theatre <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (TBM) is any <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> with a {{range between}} 300 km and 3500 km, used against targets [...] "in-theatre". Its range is thus between that of {{tactical}} and intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> The term {{is a relatively new}} one, encompassing the former categories of short-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> and medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile.</b> Two examples of this type of in-theatre missile are the Soviet RT-15 and American PGM-17 Thor missile, both from the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> {{are largely}} used for land attack missions. Although {{normally}} associated with nuclear weapons, some conventionally armed <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are in service, such as MGM-140 ATACMS. The V2 had demonstrated that a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> could deliver a warhead to a target city with {{no possibility of}} interception, {{and the introduction of}} nuclear weapons meant it could efficiently do damage when it arrived. The accuracy of these systems was fairly poor, but post-war development by most military forces improved the basic Inertial navigation system concept {{to the point where it}} could be used as the guidance system on Intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> flying thousands of kilometers. Today, the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> represents the only strategic deterrent in most military forces; however, some <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are being adapted for conventional roles, such as the Russian Iskander or the Chinese DF-21D anti-ship <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile.</b> <b>Ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are primarily surface-launched from mobile launchers, silos, ships or submarines, with air launch being theoretically possible with a weapon such as the cancelled Skybolt missile.|$|R

50|$|A submarine-{{launched}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (SLBM) is a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> {{capable of}} being launched from submarines. Modern variants usually deliver multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) each of which carries a nuclear warhead and allows a single launched missile to strike several targets.

50|$|A <b>{{ballistic}}</b> <b>missile</b> is {{a missile}} that follows a ballistic trajectory {{with the objective}} of delivering one or more warheads to a predetermined target. A <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> is only guided during relatively brief periods of flight (there are unguided <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> as well, such as 9K52 Luna-M, although these may well be considered rockets), and most of its trajectory is unpowered and governed by gravity and air resistance if in the atmosphere. This contrasts to a cruise missile, which is aerodynamically guided in powered flight. Long range intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBM) are launched on a sub-orbital flight trajectory and spend most of their flight out of the atmosphere. Shorter range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> stay within the Earth's atmosphere.|$|R

Tactical <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are usually mobile to ensure survivability and quick deployment, as well as carrying a variety of warheads to target enemy facilities, assembly areas, artillery, and other targets behind the front lines. Warheads can include conventional high explosive, chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. Typically tactical nuclear weapons are limited in their total yield compared to strategic rockets.|$|R

It reviews the history of the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> submarine force, its current status, and the implementation of plans currently in progress and as well as {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} maintaining a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> submarine force. This thesis also assesses the other two legs of the nuclear triad - the intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs) and long range bomber aircraft. The status of these two forces and their operational advantages and disadvantages are compared with those of the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> submarine force. Also examined are the financial and political factors that may affect the prospects of the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> submarine force. This includes arms control treaties that may affect the force structure. Current and prospective energy prices suggest that the economy of the Russian Federation will be able to provide long term financing for the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> submarine force and Moscow's other strategic nuclear forces. This thesis concludes that the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> submarine force is a vital part of the Russian Federation's nuclear triad and will probably be maintained over the next 15 years and beyond.
