50|$|In Broward County, {{the highway}} passes {{protected}} wetlands and <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>power</b> {{lines on the}} west and the outer reaches of the suburban communities of Pembroke Pines and Weston on the east where it curves to the northwest. US 27 then reaches an interchange with I-75 and Alligator Alley which is an elaborate partial cloverleaf with flyovers from US 27, loop ramps from I-75 and no re-entry to either road. From here, the road is surrounded by Everglades-related wilderness and recreational areas before curving to the north toward South Bay, where it intersects State Road 80 and overlaps the road before curving west along the shores of Lake Okeechobee. The highway skirts the southwestern shore of Lake Okeechobee and then heads west through Lake Harbor and then Clewiston, before making a sharp turn to the north towards Moore Haven, where it crosses the Mamie Langdale Memorial Bridge over the Caloosahatchee Canal and makes another sharp turn to the west. The road then intersects with State Road 78, which it overlaps until reaching Citrus Center, then proceeds in a northerly direction toward the central Florida communities such as Lake Placid, where it intersects State Road 70.|$|E

The characteristics of Americans who permanently use wheelchairs and scooters are currently unknown. As the result of developing a Registry of individuals who use wheeled mobility devices for systematic recruitment for research studies, this study provides a description of a nationwide sample of over 1000 individuals who used wheelchairs or scooters for their daily mobility. The Registry is predominantly Caucasian (83 %), 63 % male, {{with a mean age of}} 50 years. Some 54 % used manual wheelchairs for an average of 16 years. When quality of wheelchairs was compared, results indicated those in more customizable manual wheelchairs were significantly more likely to be younger. Males were significantly more likely to receive more customizable, <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>power</b> wheelchairs than females.

The ITA (Integrated Test Area) Standardized Experiment Module (ISEM) structure was modified to accommodate the experiments for payload 559.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new modular experimental facility that was purpose-built to investigate flow {{interactions between the}} combustor and first stage nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>power</b> generation gas turbines with multiple can combustors. The first stage turbine NGV is subjected to the highest thermal loads of all turbine components and therefore consumes a proportionally large amount of cooling air that contributes detrimentally to the stage and cycle efficiency. It has become necessary to devise novel cooling concepts that can substantially reduce the coolant air requirement but still allow the turbine to maintain its aerothermal performance. The present work aims to aid this objective by the design and commissioning of a high-speed linear cascade, which consists of two can combustor transition ducts and four first stage NGVs. This is a modular nonreactive air test platform with engine realistic geometries (gas path and near gas path), cooling system, and boundary conditions (inlet swirl, turbulence level, and boundary layer).

40|$|Although many {{methods are}} {{available}} for production of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), the conventional carbon arc process remains the most popular due to its simplicity and large production rate. However, high temperatures inside the carbon arc generate strong buoyancy driven convection, and it is hypothesized that the non-uniform environment created by this flow will have large effects on the growth and morphology of SWNTs produced by the arc process. Indeed, using normal gravity experiments, Marin et al. have demonstrated that changes in the buoyant convection plume produced by altering the arc electrode orientation {{can be used to}} change the diameter distribution of the SWNTs produced; an effect they attribute to changes in the temperature of the local nanotube growth environment. While these experiments present convincing evidence that buoyant convection has a strong effect on nanotube growth, normal gravity experiments are severely limited in scope. The ideal way to study the effect of buoyancy on SWNT production is to remove it completely. Toward this goal, a microgravity carbon arc reactor has been designed for use in the NASA Glenn 2. 2 and 5 second drop towers. Although simple in principle, conventional carbon arc machines, which generally employ large reaction chambers and require <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> welding <b>power</b> supplies capable of supplying kilowatts of power, are not suitable for microgravity experiments. Here we describe a miniature carbon arc machine for SWNT production that fits into a conventional drop rig for use on the NASA Glenn 2. 2 and 5 second drop towers, but that has a performance (production rate) that is better than most large ground-based machines...|$|R

In the framework of the current project, an advanced newly designed CNG prototype engine developed as part of the 7 th Framework Programme research project “CO 2 Reduction for long distance transport” (CO 2 RE), is benchmarked against its parent Euro V compliant CNG engine (reference) in order to quantify the improvement in terms of real-world emissions. Results indicated a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions with the prototype CNG engine both at low and high loads, which varied between 5. 0 - 8. 4 %. The highest CO 2 reduction was observed during on-road testing, with the corresponding reduction at low loads being more pronounced compared to high loads. Furthermore, reductions of NOx and CO emissions were observed under all testing conditions.

Taking the D 2 car as an example of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and selecting the traditional track of railway, the finite element calculation model of track was established.

Then, the D 32, D 38 type of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and several common locomotives were selected and the forces and deformations with these loads were calculated and compared. The results show that the static extrema of forces and deformations of track structure have different laws under different parameters and conditions. The <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars loaded overweight goods generally make the track structure engender greater forces and deformations than those common locomotives do, and the D 2 car is of all the most adverse to the track.
