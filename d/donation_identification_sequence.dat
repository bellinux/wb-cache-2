Our method requires the original chip manufacturer to frequently publish <b>identification</b> <b>sequences</b> for each IC. These sequences are excerpts from the output of a stream cipher that {{is embedded in the}} protected chip and parameterized by a secret unique key. The key initialization is done by a trusted party after manufacturing. For IC verification, the end user measures the side channel leakage of the chip under test. The chip is assessed to be genuine if the end user finds a significant correlation between the observed side channel leakage and several previously published <b>identification</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{complexity}} of agent localization increases significantly when unique {{identification of the}} agents is not possible. Corresponding application cases include multiple-source localization, in which the agents do not have <b>identification</b> <b>sequences</b> at all, and scenarios {{in which it is}} infeasible to send sufficiently long <b>identification</b> <b>sequences,</b> e.g., for highly resource-limited agents. The complexity increase is due to the need to solve an additional optimization problem to resolve the indifferentiability of the agents and thus to enable their localization. In this work, we present a thorough analysis of this problem and propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP)-optimal algorithm based on graph decompositions and expression trees. The proposed algorithm efficiently exploits the fixed-parameter tractability of the underlying graph-theoretical problem and employs dynamic programming and backtracking. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce the run time by up to 88.3 % compared with a corresponding MAP-optimal integer linear programming formulation.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{two types of}} {{biometric}} identification systems with protected templates that also support authentication. In the first system two terminals observe biometric enrollment and <b>identification</b> <b>sequences</b> {{of a number of}} individuals. It is the goal of these terminals to form a common secret for the sequences belonging to the same individual by interchanging public (helper) messages of all individuals such that the information leakage about the secrets from these helper messages is negligible. These secret keys are used for authentication purposes. Moreover, the second terminal should be able to establish the identity of an individual based on the presented biometric <b>identification</b> <b>sequence</b> and helper messages. It is important to realize that biometric data are unique for individuals and cannot be replaced if compromised. Therefore the helper messages should contain as little as possible information about the biometric data. In the second setting we consider the first terminal does not generate secret keys from biometric sequences of individuals but chooses them uniformly at random. These keys are conveyed to the second terminal by communicating the corresponding helper messages. In this paper we determine the fundamental trade-offs between secretkey, identification and privacy-leakage rates for both biometric settings...|$|R

50|$|Research may {{indicate}} that the identifiable victim effect only affects identified individuals, not identified groups (Kogut & Ritov, 2005). A 2005 study by Kogut and Ritov asked participants how much {{they would be willing}} to donate to either a critically ill child or a group of eight critically ill children. Although identification of the individual child increased <b>donations,</b> <b>identification</b> of the group of children as a whole did not. Researchers also found that, although both the individual and group evoked similar amounts of empathy, individual victims evoked more emotional distress than groups of victims. Continuing from this, researchers hypothesized that emotional distress, not empathy, appears to be positively correlated with desire to help, or “willingness to contribute.” This supports the idea that altruistic acts may serve as coping mechanisms to alleviate negative emotions, such as guilt (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). This also supports later research that suggests distress and sympathy are the driving emotional factors behind the identifiable victim effect (Erlandsson, Björklund, & Bäckström, 2015).|$|R

40|$|In {{the system}} that we {{investigate}} here, two terminals observe the enrollment and <b>identification</b> biometric <b>sequences</b> of different individuals. The first terminal binds a secret key to each enrolled individual and stores the corresponding helper data in a public database. These helper data, on one hand, facilitate reliable determination of the individual's identity for the second terminal, and, on the other hand, reliable reconstruction of the secret key of this individual, based on the presented biometric <b>identification</b> <b>sequence.</b> All helper data in the database {{are assumed to be}} public. Since the secret keys are used by the individuals e. g. to encrypt data, the helper data should provide no information on these secret keys.
