5|$|The wood used {{to build}} the track is now classed as bog-wood, the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes {{hundreds}} of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from decaying by the acidic and anaerobic bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by tannins dissolved in the acidic water, and represents an early stage of fossilisation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|British {{journalist}} David Rose {{writes that}} by 1976 the Farm was already {{seen as a}} sink estate, and by 1980 a <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> report had suggested demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements. Sir Kenneth Newman, Metropolitan Police commissioner from 1982 to 1987, regarded the estate as one of London's symbolic locations, or potential no-go areas, along with Railton Road in Brixton, All Saints Road in Notting Hill, the Notting Hill Carnival, and the Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden. The 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting criticised the police for having adopted this attitude.|$|E

5|$|Old Gisborough Hall was {{demolished}} around 1825 and the Chaloners built {{a mansion}} house, Gisborough Hall, {{about half a}} mile to the east in 1857. In 1932, Thomas Chaloner, 2nd Baron Gisborough transferred control of the priory to the Office of Works. which became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works, then the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> and from 1984, English Heritage. It remains the property of Lord Gisborough; English Heritage is responsible for maintaining the ruins, while day-to-day running is managed by Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the medieval {{structure}} of the property had become quite limiting for the owners. The buildings {{on either side of}} the tower were then pulled down to allow for the construction of Hall Farm, including a more modern farm house; only the tower survived to become an ancillary farm building. In 1973 the Lonsdale Estate, who owned Hall Farm, placed the tower into the guardianship of the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment,</b> who decided to open it to the public. An archaeological excavation of the site took place between 1977 and 1979, making it one of only a handful of such sites in Cumbria to have been investigated in this way. In the 21st century the tower is in the care of English Heritage as a tourist attraction, and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> {{assisted}} the Powis estate by lending government staff {{to repair the}} castle. Visitor numbers were falling, however, in part due the dilapidated condition of the property, and the estate became increasingly unable to afford to maintain the castle. After 1984, when {{the function of the}} department was taken over by English Heritage, a more systematic approach was put into place. This based around a partnership in which the Powis Estate would retain ownership of the castle and develop visitor access, in exchange for a £500,000 contribution from English Heritage for a jointly-funded programme of repairs and maintenance, delivered through specialist contractors. This included repairs to the parts of the curtain wall, which collapsed in 1990, and the redevelopment of the visitor's centre. Limited archaeological excavation was carried out in the outer bailey between 1992 and 1993 by the City of Hereford Archaeology Unit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} conflicting interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK {{food store}} development {{process in the}} late 1990 s. In particular, an attempt is made to unpack critical dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debate which surrounds <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment's</b> Planning Policy Guidance Notes 6 and 13 and the so-called 'Gummer effect' which is seen as having actively discouraged green-field out-of-town development and provided a mandate for reinvestment in town centre retail development. By exploring new evidence on <b>the</b> changing economics <b>of</b> superstore development, <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> tightened land-use planning regulation, and shifting patterns of capital investment, I provide a conceptual framework in which to understand a radically transformed retail development picture. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a £2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then {{have been the same}} size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, although some of the bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a £2million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the British Railways Board, London Transport Executive, Greater London Council and the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> {{produced}} a report examining the modernisation of London transport. It recommended high priority given to reconstructing Liverpool Street and Broad Street stations and recommended financing this through property {{development on the}} site. Liverpool Street {{had a number of}} design and access issues, many of which derived from the 1890 extension which had effectively created two stations on one site, with two concourses linked by walkways, multiple booking halls, and inefficient traffic flows within the station. Additionally the rail infrastructure presented limitations; only seven of the platforms could accommodate 12-carriage trains, and the track exit layout was a bottleneck. In 1975 British Railways announced plans to demolish and redevelop both stations. The proposed demolition met considerable public opposition and prompted a campaign led by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, leading to a public inquiry from November 1976 to February 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Peter and Barbara McGregor {{began to}} restore {{the ruins of the}} castle, {{with the support of the}} <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment,</b> Kent County Council and the British Army. As part of the project, archaeological {{investigations}} were carried out between 1975 and 1979 by Edward Harris. The part of the 1806 esplanade around the north-east bastion was excavated, revealing the lower 16th-century stonework of the tower and the east side of the 1859 magazine, and a retaining wall was built to support the newly exposed walls. This created two levels in the outer bailey: a higher level on the western side, which still covered the north-west tower, and a lower one on the eastern. The keep was turned into a private residence, with a new sun room built on top of the gun platform. In 2000, Geoffrey Boot and his wife acquired the castle, which is now used by Boot's company, AMT South Eastern Ltd.|$|E

50|$|Minitram was an {{automated}} guideway transit system studied by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment's</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Transport. <b>The</b> system was based on small, completely automated tram-like vehicles of about 25 passengers that could be connected together into three-car trains to increase capacity. Proposed designs were submitted by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics (HSD) and EASAMS (part of GEC). HSD's system used rubber wheels and EASAMS' steerable steel ones, but the projects were otherwise similar and notably shared a linear motor for propulsion and most braking. A series of failed sales efforts in the UK and to the GO-Urban system in Toronto, combined with decreased government spending in the 1970s, led to the concept being abandoned.|$|R
