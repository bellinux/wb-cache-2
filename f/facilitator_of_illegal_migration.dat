40|$|The {{debate on}} the {{immigration}} policies in OECD countries has turned its attention towards illegal migrants. Given that migration flows are determined by immigration laws, the probability of potential detection, penalties for unauthorised migrants and their employers, and on income differences between sending and receiving countries, this paper presents {{a new approach to}} the problem <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration,</b> grounded on the economic theory <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> behaviour. The framework considers the interaction of potential migrants, citizens, employers, and the government. After introducing the supply function <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> and its determinants, the trade-off between social costs and benefits of preventing and combating <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> is demonstrated. This trade-off results in an optimal level of migration larger than zero. A complete "market model" <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> is offered by presentation of a demand curve <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration,</b> based on the tolerance of the society towards clandestine foreigners. Equilibrium forces predict a non-zero level <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration.</b> The rule <b>of</b> law of our legal systems, according to which any illegal activity has to be reduced to zero, bears the danger of producing inefficient disequilibria. A reasonable policy of wanted and unwanted migration should address {{the question of how to}} allocate scarce resources. Ignoring social optima and equilibrium forces means to abandon public resources that could be used for other public assignments, such as schooling, or foreign aid, for instance, i. e., measures that could strike the problem <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> at its root...|$|R

40|$|The {{analytical}} and statistical services of border management organizations in Central and Eastern European countries have registered and accumulated a vast {{body of knowledge}} on the demographics and mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> over the last one-and-a-half decade. This paper attempts to tap this resource by summarising {{the results of a}} yearly survey among border guards of 17 countries. A set of quantitative indicators <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> is developed, presented and interpreted, based on the answers of the border services to a series of quantitative and qualitative questions. This empirical material is used to evaluate the dynamics and pattern <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> in Central and Eastern Europe on the one hand, and to examine the development of border management strategies on the other. The impacts of legal and institutional reforms are investigated in light of the temporal and spatial variations of border apprehension statistics. The interdependence of the two processes is reviewed {{from the point of view}} of national border management authorities, perhaps the most authoritative source of information on the issue. The results of the authors’ annual survey indicate that the progressive development of migration control mechanisms at national and international levels seems to have a significant impact on irregular migration flows as most indicators <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> have significantly decreased after the turn of the century. At the same time, the geographical distribution <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> flows in Central and Eastern European countries has become more complex over the years...|$|R

It offers overview of various forms <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> and points out the negative consequences of these kinds of forms of migration, from which it focuses specially on <b>illegal</b> employment <b>of</b> migrants. The thesis contains an analysis of the processes of one-time regularizations of irregular migrants as a softening-tool {{of the negative}} impacts <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration.</b> The case <b>of</b> Spain is used to provide the analysis.

First of all, it provides a complex survey of the problem. It views {{the problem in the}} context of international migration, labor migration and the legislative framework of the Czech Republic, as regards its relation to foreigners. The goal is to compare and evaluate individual possibilities <b>of</b> dealing with <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> {{from the point of view}} of governmental and non-governmental institutions, and to propose an optimal solution. The thesis presents indepth interviews with representatives of seven different institutions. It turns out that particular solutions <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> can not be separated, rather they must be viewed in the context of all other solutions. The priorities of the fight with <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> are the following: cooperation with countries of origin, enlightenment of both, potential immigrants as well as their potential employers, getting rid of "push factors in countries of origin, and elimination of the main "pull factor which is the possibility <b>of</b> getting an <b>illegal</b> job in the target country. The main output of my thesis research is pinpointing recommendations and conclusions which should be considered when looking for an optimal solution to the issue <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration.</b> I also present a few hypotheses for further research. When looking for an optimal solution the crucial task is played by the high-quality discussion on both levels, the professional as well as the public one.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on unregulated population movements suggests that <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> and undocumented migration for labor and other purposes {{is on the}} rise in Northeast Asia, and is demanding the attention of regional policy-makers. The last decade has also witnessed an increase in the criminalization of migration in the lucrative form of human trafficking, often related women and girls for prostitution. This paper reviews the scholarly debate on the linkages between security and <b>migration,</b> including how <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> has been incorporated into the discussion on traditional and non-traditional security, and human security. The emergence <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> as a security issue in the European Union is discussed before a consideration of whether, and how, <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> has been defined as a "security" issue among politicians and policy-makers in Northeast Asia.

40|$|<b>Illegal</b> <b>migration</b> is an impalpable {{phenomenon}} with complicated dimensions. Thousands {{of people}} leave their homelands every year {{due to a}} number of reasons such as civil wars, terrorism, economic difficulties, and social oppressions. With their flexible modus operandi, migrant smugglers benefit from individuals or groups that wish to immigrate for a more comfortable life. In order to reach a complete perception <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> one needs to draw an accurate profile of migrant smugglers. At this end, data collection from both smugglers as perpetrators and illegal migrants as the object of the smuggling process provides important information for a holistic definition of “smugglers”. In this study researchers interviewed 262 illegal migrants and 174 smugglers captured in Istanbul from 2007 to 2013 in order to identify and develop a profile of migrant smugglers and understand the operating methods <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> organizations.

40|$|Most {{migration}} surveys do not {{ask about}} {{the legal status of}} migrants due to concerns about the sensitivity of this question.

We show how, in principal, this can be used to both give an estimate of the overall rate <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> in the population being surveyed, as well as to determine <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> rates for subgroups such as more or less educated households. Our results suggest that there is some useful information in this method: we find higher rates <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> in countries where <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> is thought to be more prevalent and households who say they have a migrant are more likely to report having an illegal migrant. Nevertheless, some of our other findings also suggest some possible inconsistencies or noise in the conclusions obtained using this method, so we suggest directions for future attempts to implement this approach in migration surveys...|$|R
30|$|Whether or not {{potential}} migrants {{realize their}} migration goals, {{they provide a}} good indication of real guiding motivations. In the case <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration,</b> {{it is important to}} gain some evidence using subjective data. The willingness to migrate, and particularly to do so without proper authorization from the host country, is a good indicator of how frustrated people are with the living conditions in their country <b>of</b> origin. <b>Illegal</b> migrants who manage to arrive in the host country are not easily observable in the new country. Subjective pre-migration data are thus more valuable because they help elicit motivations, perceptions and expectations. They also allow a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> before migrants arrive in the host country and their motivations are contaminated by a new reality.
