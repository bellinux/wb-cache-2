40|$|Summary In {{clinical}} and observational studies, {{the event of}} interest can often recur on the same subject. In a more complicated situation, there exists a terminal event (e. g., death) which stops the recurrent <b>event</b> <b>process.</b> In many such instances, the terminal event is strongly correlated with the recurrent <b>event</b> <b>process.</b> We consider the recurrent/terminal event setting and model the dependence through a shared gamma frailty that is included in both the recurrent event rate and terminal event hazard functions. Conditional on the frailty, a model is specified only for the marginal recurrent <b>event</b> <b>process,</b> hence avoiding the strong Poisson‐type assumptions traditionally used. Analysis is based on estimating functions that allow for estimation of covariate effects on the recurrent event rate and terminal event hazard. The method also permits estimation {{of the degree of}} association between the two processes. Closed‐form asymptotic variance estimators are proposed. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations to assess the applicability of the asymptotic results in finite samples and the sensitivity of the method to its underlying assumptions. The methods can be extended in straightforward ways to accommodate multiple types of recurrent and terminal events. Finally, the methods are illustrated in an analysis of hospitalization data for patients in an international multi‐center study of outcomes among dialysis patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recontextualising the Event Management Life-Cycle Landscape Tim Brown and Prof Peter Stokes Current {{academic}} convention {{promotes the}} events life-cycle {{as being a}} singular and sequential process. This {{has a tendency to}} represent <b>event</b> management <b>processes</b> and life-cycles as if events were taking place as a single event at a time (Getz, 2005; Grant 2005; Bowdin, Allen, O’Toole, Harris & McDonnell, 2006; Shone & Parry, 2010; Silvers 2013). In many regards, this has constituted a useful conceptual approach to understanding the mechanisms and life-cycle of the <b>event</b> management <b>process</b> in a field wherein, given its youth, the conceptual development and analysis is relatively embryonic. In extant literature, there is a plethora of <b>event</b> <b>process</b> models, each indicating and providing insight into some nuance or novel dimension of events management. However, within the underlying conceptualisation of these models there is a propensity to build them around the notion of the events life-cycle as being a single process. However, this representation does not seem to reflect the lived experience felt by many event managers who {{are more likely to be}} working on numerous events simultaneously. Therefore, there is need and scope to reconceptualise the <b>event</b> <b>process</b> and lifecycle that incorporates the multi-event approach and practice. With regard to methodological approach of the study, in order to undertake the construction of a reconceptualization of the <b>event</b> <b>process</b> and life-cycle model the research was undertaken along two separate lines on enquiry. Firstly, an extensive review was conducted of the event management literature. This identified and examined more than 20 different models which had been developed by a range of authors. Secondly, field research was undertaken to gather primary data which involved conducting semi-structured interviews with 30 events managers to understand their experiences and practice of the event management lifecycle. In terms of findings, in the literature review, approximately fifty percent of the models displayed a serial and linear style of event life cycle representation (i. e. moving from the beginning to the end of the event) (Getz, 2005; Grant 2005; Bowdin, Allen, O’Toole, Harris & McDonnell, 2006; Shone & Parry, 2010; Silvers 2013). The remainder of the models in the literature followed this pattern however added some form of feedback loop which returned to the beginning of the <b>event</b> <b>process</b> (Watt, 1998; Masterman, 2003; Salem, Jones & Morgan, 2004; Tum, Norton & Wright, 2005; Mallen & Adams, 2008). Nevertheless, both sets of representations of the event lifecycle are inherently serial and linear in nature. The analysis of the literature operated in parallel with the empirical data collection. The field interview data determined that events managers did not strongly recognise the notion of a serial <b>event</b> <b>process</b> and indicated that, in fact, they tended to work on events simultaneously juggling multiple realities and challenges. The conjoined approach to the research thus problematized the serial approach and provided the data, insights and opportunity to generate an alternative representation of the <b>event</b> <b>process</b> life-cycle which reflected this. In terms of implications, this research offers a novel and valuable reconceptualization of the events management life-cycle and in so doing creates a new perspective on events management. Equally, a more accurate understanding and representation will assist academics and practitioners in better understanding the domain and enhancing a wide range of event-related processes including design, planning, operations, delivery and evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent event {{data are}} {{commonly}} encountered in longitudinal follow-up studies related to biomedical science, econometrics, reliability, and demography. In many studies, recurrent events serve as important measurements for evaluating disease progression, health deterioration, or insurance risk. When analyzing recurrent event data, an independent censoring condition is typically {{required for the}} construction of statistical methods. Nevertheless, in some situations, the terminating time for observing recurrent events could be correlated with the recurrent <b>event</b> <b>process</b> and, as a result, the assumption of independent censoring is violated. In this paper, we consider joint modeling of a recurrent <b>event</b> <b>process</b> and a failure time in which a common subject-specific latent variable is used to model the association between the intensity of the recurrent <b>event</b> <b>process</b> and the hazard of the failure time. The proposed joint model is flexible in that no parametric assumptions on the distributions of censoring times and latent variables are made and, under the model, informative censoring is allowed for observing both the recurrent events and failure times. We propose a ‘borrow-strength estimation procedure’ by first estimating the value of the latent variable from recurrent event data, and next using the estimated value in the failure time model. Some interesting implications and trajectories of the proposed model will be presented. Properties of the regression parameter estimates and the estimated baseline cumulative hazard functions are also studied...|$|R

40|$|The {{geometric}} {{process has}} attracted extensive research attention from authors in reliability mathematics since its introduction.
