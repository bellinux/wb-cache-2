5000|$|Ellona Santiago {{was picked}} in the Final 40, one of ten {{acts in the}} [...] "Girls" [...] {{category}} mentored by Demi Lovato. In the four-chair challenge, Ellona sang [...] "Clarity" [...] by Zedd. Lovato hesitated to put Santiago through to the next round, unsure {{of what to do}} stating [...] "When I see this panel and the four seats over there, <b>I</b> <b>cant</b> <b>see</b> myself letting any of them go." [...] Judge and mentor Simon Cowell argued saying that he strongly disagreed and that [...] "she was probably the best voice that the girls category has ever had." [...] The audience and Cowell began to rant urging Lovato to put her through. Lovato then made a decision to put her in her final 4, and switched out Jamie Pineda. She was chosen to be in the Final 16 that progressed through to the live shows and was chosen to be in Demi Lovato's top 3.|$|R

50|$|I {{would hope}} that people, no matter what age, would find {{something}} to identify with in my books, pick up one and experience a personal sense of discovery. Thats great. I think that if youre a creative person, you should just go about your business, do your work and not care about how its received. I never read reviews because {{if you believe the}} good ones you have to believe the bad ones too. Not that I dont care about success. I do, but only because it lets me do what I want. I was always prepared for success but that means that I have to be prepared for failure too. I have an ego, I have ideas, I want to be articulate, to communicate but in my own way. People who say they create only for themselves and dont care if they are published... I hate to hear talk like that. If its good, its too good not to share. Thats the way I feel about my work. So Ill keep on communicating, but only my way. Lots of things I wont do. I wont go on television because who am I talking to? Johnny Carson? The camera? Twenty million people <b>I</b> <b>cant</b> <b>see?</b> Uh-uh. And <b>I</b> wont give any more interviews.|$|R

5000|$|The {{return of}} The Comic Strip Presents... for a one-off episode was {{announced}} in June 2011 by Channel 4s Head of Comedy Shane Allen, who described the film as having an [...] "irresistibly hilarious script from the godfathers of modern comedy". It was also revealed that Mangan would feature {{in the role of}} Blair, while Jennifer Saunders would play former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Speaking about the forthcoming film, Jay Hunt, the television channels Chief Creative Officer said: [...] "Comic Strip defined comedy for a generation and its a real coup to have the team back tackling {{one of the most controversial}} subjects of our time in a way that only they can. Tony Blair on the run, Jennifer Saunders as Margaret Thatcher, a stellar cast and hotbed of political intrigue - <b>I</b> <b>cant</b> wait to <b>see</b> the rushes." ...|$|R

Flinders Petrie has counted nine attempts at civilization made by people exactly like us; {{and every one of them}} failed just as ours is failing. They failed because the citizens and statesmen died of old age or over-eating before they had grown out of schoolboy games and savage sports and cigars and champagne. The signs of the end are always the same: Democracy, Socialism, and Votes for Women. We shall go to smash within the lifetime of men now living unless we recognize that we must live longer.|$|R
5000|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} the album and wrote: [...] "This album, while patchy, confirms {{my opinion that}} they could still have something going for them... enough to make this record a worthwhile, if not exactly essential purchase, and enough possibly, to get the group back on an even keel. Their big problem, however, the one <b>I</b> <b>cant</b> seem to <b>see</b> a solution to, is the same old one of material: the oldies are still way the best. Slade are essentially a live band, {{no matter how good}} their records are, they'll never match up. All they will ever be are plastic souvenirs of a great live show." [...] Superpop commented: [...] "Slade {{have been one of the}} busiest live bands on the scene recently and this LP shows exactly what is actually going on. Somewhat unknown today seems very strange, but times change and believe it or not Slade have. Slade present us with a neat little package. One complaint though, they did not include their recent single [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Bolero", a classic no doubt, oh well, we can't expect too much can we?" ...|$|R

60|$|Lastly, When he saith {{he saw her}} {{descend from}} God out of heaven, he may refer to her glory, which at her declining {{departed}} from her, and ascended to God, as the sap returns into the root at {{the fall of the}} leaf; which glory doth again at her return descend, or come into the church, and branches of the same, as the sap doth arise at the spring of the year, for indeed the church's beauty is from heaven, and it either goeth up thither from her, or else comes from thence to her, according to the natures of both fall and spring (<b>Cant</b> 2).Thus <b>you</b> <b>see</b> what this heaven is, and what it is for this city to descend out of it; also what it is for this city to descend out of it from God.|$|R
