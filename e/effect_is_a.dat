5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> marbled appearance sometimes {{reminiscent of a}} leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only are}} groups useful {{to assess the}} {{implications}} of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The Jahn-Teller <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states {{that are related to}} each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.|$|E

The overall <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fusion of indigenous Australian music, rock, and improvisational jazz by European Australians, before indigenous rock artists Yothu Yindi and No Fixed Address created their own fusions of indigenous and rock music.|$|E

5|$|Mass <b>Effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{science fiction}} media {{franchise}} {{developed by the}} Canadian company BioWare, composed of multi-platform video games and associated media. The core of the franchise is an eponymous trilogy of action role-playing third-person shooter video games, which follow Commander Shepard's mission to save the galaxy from a race of mechanical beings known as the Reapers. The Mass Effect franchise also includes three mobile games, each with a different gameplay style; four novels, written by Drew Karpyshyn and William C. Dietz; three art books; ten comic book series or mini-comics and their anthologies; an animated film; and eleven soundtrack albums or singles. A fourth main series game, , was released on March 21, 2017, along with a tie-in novel by Jason M. Hough and K. C. Alexander, an art book, and a coloring book.|$|E
5|$|Mass <b>Effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single-player action {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} the player takes the role of Commander Shepard through a third-person perspective. Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training and first name {{are determined by the}} player before the game begins. There are six different character classes for the player to choose from and each of them has different talents that provide enhanced combat capabilities. For example, the Soldier class is trained in weapon damage and has improved health, while the Sentinel class is trained in protecting and healing allies. At one point in the game, players may evolve their base class talent into one of two specializations, which depend on the class chosen by the player. Although any class can use any weapon type, each class is only effective with the weapons they are trained in.|$|E
5|$|The founder <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{special case}} of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E
