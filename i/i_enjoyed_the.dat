He then joined the 138th Battery Royal Field Artillery. He {{wanted to be a}} pilot so he paid for private lessons in the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands and gained his aviators' certificate on 12 July 1912. He met Agatha Miller when he was invited to a ball on 12 October 1912 by Lady Clifford at her grand home Ugbrooke House in Chudleigh. A description of her meeting with Christie is given by Agatha in her autobiography:Christie came my way quite soon in the dance. He was a tall, fair young man, with crisp curly hair, a rather interesting nose, turned up not down, and a great air of careless confidence about him. He was introduced to me, asked for a couple of dances, and said that his friend Griffiths had told him to look out for me. We got on together very well; he danced splendidly and I danced again several more times with him. <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> evening thoroughly.|$|E

As she wears a {{transparent}} nightgown in the music video, some French television channels censored it. It was first aired on the French television programme Clip Clap in a shortened version. In an interview, Farmer deplored the censorship, saying: [...] " [...] has shocked many people. I find it pretty stupid. Jacques Dutronc said [...] "Merde in France" [...] and everyone went into raptures. As for me, I simply say that <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> controversy".|$|E

500|$|Biance Gracie from Idolator gave a {{positive}} review to the performance, saying that [...] "Instead of doing her usual bit of either singing 'Living for Love' or the current single 'Ghosttown', the entertainer decided to switch {{things up a}} bit—and we're so glad [...] did! Madge did a wild and super-fun version of 'Bitch I'm Madonna'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter listed the performance {{as one of the}} top five shocking moments by Madonna in 2015. Stereogums Caitlin White was amazed by Madonna's performance, saying that [...] "the fact that she can dance like... this at 56 is practically a superhuman feat, and I was surprised by how much <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> performance." [...] Bradley Stern also wrote a similar review for MuuMuse, describing the performance as [...] "one of the most all-out insane television performances of the entire Rebel Heart era... This was no basic stage performance: Instead, Madonna brought her noisy, bratty and utterly #Unapologetic banger to life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} Open Salon.com enjoyed the episode, writing [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> last eight weeks of {{alternate}} universe hijinks, this week's episode {{reminded me of}} what I had been missing from the earlier seasons... It's nice to know we'll {{be back with our}} good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted with just the right about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{reception}} {{ranged from}} positive to mixed. Critic Maureen Ryan was very {{positive about the}} episode in her blog at The Chicago Tribune, writing, [...] "I liked this week's episode, and for once, it wasn't a case of really wanting to like it {{and trying to find}} reasons to see past various flaws. I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "The Arrival" [...] a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. [...] "...After being more than prepared to give [...] "Fringe That's It For Me! status going into the episode, <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from [...] "Generation Kill" [...] toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit...

500|$|Not all reviews were {{completely}} negative. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote positively {{of the first}} part of the episode's humor and awarded it a B+. Handlen noted that [...] "the context of seeing actors in the wrong places" [...] is [...] "what’s funny about the episode". However, he did slightly criticize the episode's padding—specifically Nora Dunn's role as Fletcher's wife and the Duck Soup mirror gag—but argued that [...] "for every bit that doesn’t play in the episode, there are three that do." [...] Todd VanDerWerff, also from The A.V. Club, gave the second half of the episode a B– and wrote, [...] "I have basically nothing to add to what Zack said about the first 'Dreamland' last week. 'Dreamland II' is a fairly unnecessary hour of television, and there’s no reason this logy two-parter couldn’t have become a much tighter one-hour episode." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote that [...] "my final judgement on 'Dreamland' [...] is that <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> entertainment value it presented. It was fun and I'm not one to begrudge a little romp now and then." [...] Kessenich, however, did note that the second part [...] "felt strung out". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson, however, saw the episode in a more positive light and said, [...] "Season six included some more excellent episodes only peripherally related to the main story arc, [...] Dreamland parts one and two". Kerry Fall from DVD Journal wrote positively of the episodes and described them, together as [...] "one of the best episodes in years". Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone gave {{the first part of}} the episode an 8 out of 10 rating and highlighted the [...] "strong story-telling, clever dialogue, and good acting". Earl Cressey from DVD Talk concluded that both [...] "Dreamland" [...] parts one and two were among the [...] "highlights of season six".

2500|$|In {{regards to}} the final lap {{collision}} with Gasly, Heidfeld {{said that he did}} not encourage Gasly to run on the inside line, as he was attempting to remain close behind teammate Rosenqvist so there would be no space available to in which the latter could steer into: [...] "For sure I didn’t touch him on purpose, and it’s a pity to finish like this, but at least we both made it over the line." [...] Gasly claimed Heidfeld had placed him in a position to impact the wall following the later releasing his brake pedal. Nevertheless, he described his weekend as [...] "very positive", but did not anticipate his advancing into super pole after having only one day's worth of experience driving in the series: [...] "We had a very busy schedule, especially with me arriving later on during the event. There was a lot to learn but we did great. We scored important points for the team. It was a great opportunity to discover a new discipline and <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> challenge very much."

And that is why he is so committed to this. So the reason we’re all here today is not because some politician needs to knock off one more thing on his ‘to do’ list.

2500|$|An episode takes {{approximately}} {{one year to}} complete; Neely states that six or seven episodes may be produced simultaneously, all at various stages. Animation is done at Titmouse, Inc. in Los Angeles. When asked about the slideshow presentation of his animated shorts {{in an interview with}} The College Hill Independent, Neely felt that the approach was not [...] "an aesthetic choice, it was sort of the only thing I was able to do. I'm not an animator." [...] He stated that, out of [...] "ignorance and not having a whole lot of options", he hand-drew each frame on paper and scanned them into a computer; he felt the restrictions [...] "really paid off and <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> form. ... But, it never was something I felt I was needing to defend or stick to, or that it represented me artistically." [...] Other changes to the art style from the shorts were dictated by animation director, Mike L. Mayfield. Weidenfeld stated that Mayfield [...] "was instrumental in turning Brad's original style into what we had the first season." [...] Among them were the addition of pupils which, according to Weidenfeld, some of Neely's fans were unhappy over. Neely states that [...] "I had a long run of drawing those Orphan Annie style of eyes. That worked well for print. But as soon as things move, the characters start to look like zombies." ...|$|E

2500|$|The part of Liz Shaw {{was given}} to Caroline John who was {{recommended}} to the outgoing production team by James Cellan Jones. Although John had been working regularly on the stage (including at the National Theatre under Laurence Olivier), she was frustrated {{that she had not}} won any TV roles. According to several DVD releases in the Doctor Who series and interviews with the actress herself, taking dramatic steps, John had herself photographed in a bikini and sent the picture around to BBC producers. The photo ended up on Peter Bryant's desk and he offered her the part once they had met, without any formal audition or screen test. After appearing in the 25 episodes that made up the four stories of the seventh season, John left the programme because she was pregnant with her first child, and producer Barry Letts had already decided against renewing her contract. Letts and Terrance Dicks viewed the character as unsuccessful, feeling that she did not fill the companion's role of asking the Doctor for exposition and acting as an audience surrogate. In 1978, John expressed mixed feelings about her role as Liz, saying, [...] "I was excited at first to be a brainy girl, but all the directors wanted really was a sexy piece. It was such an effort looking glamorous on cold clay-pits and rubbish dumps. <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> series but found it restricting after a while." [...] John continued to appear at fan conventions from the 1990s onwards.|$|E

[...] He stated the win would put Techeetah's personnel in a positive state of mind {{and that they would}} return for the following the season as a stronger force in the series. Rosenqvist revealed that Bird was his main rival over the race weekend and that his focus was to secure third place in the Drivers' Championship. Nevertheless, he was delighted to finish in the top three driver's standings in his maiden Formula E season, [...] "I think it speaks volumes about the kind of effort we have made as a team. Big, warm thanks to Mahindra Racing for putting their trust in me and for giving me the tools to achieve this.” Third-place finisher López spoke of his pleasure finishing in the position following his first race retirement, [...] "I could tell straightaway what a difference the team had made to the car since my last race and it was frustrating our qualifying group meant we were unable to show this.
