50|$|The Swiss Federal Council and the Swiss Federal Assembly {{recommended}} that the initiative be rejected. The National Council opposed the initiative with 163 against 19 votes, the Council of States unanimously. All political parties in Switzerland {{with the exception of}} the Swiss People's Party and the Federal Democratic Union also opposed the initiative. The federal authorities argued that the initiative was vaguely phrased, making reference to the puberty of children, a developmental phase often difficult to exactly pinpoint in time and varying among children. They noted that the statute of limitations was necessary to prevent useless prosecutions, because after dozens of years the testimony of witnesses was often not reliable enough to secure a conviction. In the opinion of the federal authorities, <b>imprescriptibility</b> should remain reserved for crimes of exceptional gravity such as genocide and terrorist acts. Finally, the federal authorities argued that a previous change in law had already accomplished much of what the proponents desired, fixing the period of prescription at 15 years starting with the 18th birthday of the victim.|$|E
40|$|This article puts forward an {{analysis}} of the problem of the <b>imprescriptibility</b> of action and disciplinary sanctions for grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, committed by civil servants, particularly, members of the Military Forces and the National Police. The study deals with the regulation of disciplinary action for grave conduct within the disciplinary regime applicable to the Public Forces over the past thirty years and in the current Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Proceedures. I also illustrate the legal, political, social and economic consequences—for the Colombian State—of investigation and disciplinary sanctions for crimes against humanity or war crimes being ommitted or delayed through negligence of State offi- cials. The declaration of a prescription may be considered a means to impunity for administrative sanctions and, in turn, provides proof of the State’s failure to comply with International committments that guarantee and protect Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law. Finally, given the controversy regarding diciplinary <b>imprescriptibility,</b> this paper proposes a llegal reform which extends the term of prescription in order to preserve the rights of victims and the disciplined...|$|E

The term of juridical regime of the public domain has in view the assembly ofrules {{that can be applied}} to the goods belonging to the public domain as well as the juridical relations bornbetween the owners of these goods and third persons. The public property goods are subjected exclusivelyto a juridical regime by public law, while the private property goods belonging to the public domain aregoverned simultaneously by two types of juridical regimes and more exactly by a mixed juridical regimeby common right and by power.

40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{analyzed}} the genocide, the {{crimes against humanity}} and war crimes {{from the perspective of}} humanitarian law, in order to highlight the relevant aspects regarding the non-applicability of statutory limitations to these crimes. To obtain some efficient legal instruments of protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and preventing genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, United Nations has established in the international law the "principle of non-applicability of statutory limitations to war crimes and crimes against humanity". A brief analysis is made on legislative acts adopted at European level which regulate the institution of the <b>imprescriptibility</b> of the aforementioned crimes, such as The Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, which was ratified by Romania by Decree no. 547 / 1969 (B. Of. No. 83 of 30 July 1969). The Convention contains references regarding the statute of limitations for criminal liability and enforcement of sentences. The analysis of the Convention is intended to highlight the importance of this European legislative act, since it was the first legal instrument of the international community, through which it was possible to ensure the protection of rights and fundamental freedoms beyond the sovereignty of states, thus representing a success and an innovation in international law...|$|E
