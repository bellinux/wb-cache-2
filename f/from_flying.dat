5|$|September 18, 1918: A tornado cut a path 130 to 160feet (40 to 50m) wide from Groton, through Mystic, and {{out into}} Long Island Sound. Small buildings, roofs, trees and {{telephone}} poles were damaged heavily. Several people received minor injuries <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> debris.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{historic}} July 4, 1908, one-kilometer flight by Curtiss in the AEA June Bug, the Wrights warned {{him not to}} infringe their patent by profiting <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> or selling aircraft that used ailerons.|$|E
5|$|When Magnum XL-200 opened, it used pads {{similar to}} those still in use on Gemini. Shortly after its debut, however, these up-stop plates were {{replaced}} with more traditional up-stop wheels that keep the train <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> off its rails.|$|E

50|$|Ahmet Ali Çelikten (born İzmirli Alioğlu Ahmed; 1883 - 1969), {{also known}} as Arap Ahmet Ali or İzmirli Ahmet Ali, was an Ottoman aviator {{who was one of}} the first black pilots in {{aviation}} history. He was one of the few black pilots in World War I, like Afro-American Eugene Jacques Bullard, William Robinson Clarke <b>from</b> Jamaica (<b>flying</b> for Britain), Pierre Réjon <b>from</b> Martinique (<b>flying</b> for France) and Domenico Mondelli <b>from</b> Eritrea (<b>flying</b> for Italy). His grandmother was enslaved in Bornu (now in Nigeria) and brought to the Ottoman Empire.|$|R

5|$|Eaton was {{commissioned}} {{as a pilot}} officer upon graduation <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> school in January 1937, and posted to No.1 Squadron. Within six months {{he was promoted to}} flying officer and joined No.21 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton. In 1938, he became an instructor at Point Cook's No.1 Flying Training School, where he also took part in the RAAF's early long navigation exercises. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1September 1939.|$|E
5|$|In late 1972 {{and early}} 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard. He {{had moved to}} Montgomery, Alabama, {{to work on the}} {{unsuccessful}} U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount. In 1972, Bush was suspended <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> for failure to take a scheduled physical exam. He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974.|$|E
5|$|The average flying {{life of a}} RFC {{pilot in}} Arras in April was 18 hours and from 4–8 April, the RFC lost 75 {{aircraft}} and 105 aircrew on operations. The casualties created a pilot shortage and replacements {{were sent to the}} front straight <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> school; during the same period, 56 aircraft were crashed by inexperienced RFC pilots.|$|E

5|$|Wilcke claimed two {{victories}} on 24 November 1942, an Il-2 Sturmovik and a Yak-1, {{his first}} victories {{in support of}} the Stalingrad pocket. On 30 November he claimed the destruction of three aircraft of unknown type, one more on 2 December, and three more on 8 December. Four victories claimed on 12 December, one Lavochkin La-5 and three Yak-1s, took his total to 148 aerial victories. Wilcke became the fourth German fighter pilot to achieve 150 aerial victories in combat. He achieved this mark on 17 December 1942, claiming victories 149–151. The next day he claimed victory over three more aircraft. Following this 154th victory, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 23 December 1943, the 23rd member of the Wehrmacht to be so honored. Along with the Swords came the ban <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> further operational combat missions. Although banned <b>from</b> <b>flying,</b> he was credited with two more victories on the Eastern Front, a Yak-1 on 28 December and an aircraft of unknown type on 5 January 1943.|$|E
5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him <b>from</b> <b>flying.</b>|$|E

5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E
5|$|Born to a {{military}} family, Newall studied at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before taking a commission as a junior officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1905. After transferring to the 2nd Gurkha Rifles in the Indian Army, he saw active service on the North West Frontier, but after learning to fly in 1911 turned towards a career in military aviation. During the First World War he rose <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> instructor to command of 41st Wing RFC, the main strategic bombing force, and was awarded the Albert Medal for putting out a fire in an explosives store.|$|E
5|$|During the 17 May 1992 Fairchild air show, Holland {{was again}} the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} again violated several safety regulations, including several low-altitude, steep turns {{in excess of}} 45° of bank and a high pitch angle climb, estimated at over 60° nose high which Holland finished with a wingover maneuver. The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more safety regulations, Capotosti would ground him (remove him <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> status). Capotosti did not document his warning to Holland or take {{any other kind of}} formal action.|$|E

5|$|He {{was then}} {{grounded}} <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> on operations, as his experience and leadership qualities {{were regarded as}} too valuable to risk further in front line combat. He did fly on occasional sorties, the most famous involving the shooting down of a Lancaster bomber of No. 44 Squadron RAF piloted by Warrant Officer G. T. Rhodes in April 1942, during a rare RAF daylight raid on targets in Augsberg. It was his 101st kill. In August 1942, the Geschwaderstab of JG 2 exchanged their Bf 109 F aircraft for the FW 190 A–2s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes <b>from</b> <b>flying</b> over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E
5|$|Marseille had {{a narrow}} escape on 13 May 1942, when his Bf 109 was damaged during a dogfight with 12 Kittyhawks (Mk I) from No. 3 Squadron RAAF, {{southeast}} of Gazala {{and over the}} Gulf of Bomba ("Gazala Bay"). With a wingman, Marseille bounced the Kittyhawks. After he downed one of the Australian pilots, Flying Officer Graham Pace in AL172, Marseille's Bf 109 took hits in the oil tank and propeller, likely <b>from</b> <b>Flying</b> Officer Geoff Chinchen, who reported damaging one of the Messerschmitts. Marseille nevertheless managed to shoot down another Kittyhawk (Sergeant Colin McDiarmid; AK855), before nursing his overheating aircraft back to base. The repairs to Marseille's Bf 109 took two days. The aerial victories were recorded as numbers 57–58.|$|E
