5000|$|Methanol and ethanol fuels contain soluble and {{insoluble}} contaminants. Halideions, {{which are}} soluble contaminants, such as chloride ions, {{have a large}} effect on the corrosivity of alcohol fuels. Halide ions increase corrosion in two ways: they chemically attack passivating oxide films onseveral metals causing pitting corrosion, and they increase the conductivity of the fuel. Increased electrical conductivity promotes electrical, galvanic and ordinary corrosion in the fuel system. Soluble contaminants such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clogs the fuel system over time.To prevent corrosion the fuel system must be made of suitable materials,electrical wires must be properly insulated and the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> <b>sensor</b> must be of pulse and hold type, magneto resistive or other similar non-contact type. In addition, high quality alcohol should have a low concentration of contaminants and have a suitable corrosion inhibitor added. Scientific evidence reveals that also water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.The experiments are done with E50, which is more aggressive & speeds up the corrosion effect. It is very clear that by {{increasing the amount of}} water in fuel ethanol one can reduce the corrosion. At 2% or 20,000 ppm water in the fuel ethanol the corrosion stopped. The observations in Japan are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol. The reaction mechanism is 3 EtOH + Al -> Al(OEt)3 + [...] H2 will be the same at lower-mid blends. When enough water is present in the fuel, the aluminumwill react preferably with water to produce Al2O3, repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer. The aluminum alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer; water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer.|$|E

40|$|Safety {{in civil}} {{aviation}} is increasingly important {{due to the}} increase in flight routes and their more challenging nature. Like other important systems in aircraft, fuel level monitoring is always a technical challenge. The most frequently used level sensors in aircraft fuel systems are based on capacitive, ultrasonic and electric techniques, however they suffer from intrinsic safety concerns in explosive environments combined with issues relating to reliability and maintainability. In the last few years, optical fiber liquid level sensors (OFLLSs) have been reported to be safe and reliable and present many advantages for aircraft fuel measurement. Different OFLLSs have been developed, such as the pressure type, float type, optical radar type, TIR type and side-leaking type. Amongst these, many types of OFLLSs based on fiber gratings have been demonstrated. However, these sensors have not been commercialized because they exhibit some drawbacks: low sensitivity, limited range, long-term instability, or limited resolution. In addition, any sensors that involve direct interaction of the optical field with the fuel (either by launching light into the fuel tank or via the evanescent field of a fiber-guided mode) must be able to cope with the potential build up of contamination-often bacterial-on the optical surface. In this paper, a <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> <b>sensor</b> based on microstructured polymer optical fiber Bragg gratings (mPOFBGs), including poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and TOPAS fibers, embedded in diaphragms is investigated in detail. The mPOFBGs are embedded in two different types of diaphragms and their performance is investigated with aviation fuel for the first time, in contrast to our previous works, where water was used. Our new system exhibits a high performance when compared with other previously published in the literature, making it a potentially useful tool for aircraft fuel monitoring...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{different}} patented optical sensing solutions are reviewed, mostly for their application of measuring fluid level within tanks, containers or bio-mass boilers in condominiums, thus providing an intrinsically safe sensing scenario within harsh and hazardous environments, {{due to the}} passive nature of light. In general, the intensity modulation of the light is very attractive since it is simple in concept, reliable, and can produce optical sensors which offer {{a wide range of}} applications at lower costs, thus facilitating their final commercialization and market spread. The optical sensing solutions discussed in this work include a fiber-optic sensor for fluid detection/level with intrinsic self-referencing property thus solving one of the main drawbacks when using intensity-based sensors, namely the undesirable and unexpected optical power fluctuations when operating. Moreover, a low-cost intensity-based POF <b>sensor</b> for <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> measurements in paramotoring and powered paragliding is presented. It features a very simple and a very low-cost solution for these sports, attending the increasing demand of new and more sophisticated embedded sensors in the flight instrumental.
