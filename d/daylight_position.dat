5000|$|What is now {{established}} is that American and British {{aircraft carriers}} {{were off the}} shores of the enemy helping his war effort. Also, British aircraft raided, in broad <b>daylight,</b> <b>positions</b> of the Syrian and Egyptian fronts, in addition to operations by a number of American aircraft reconnoitering some of our positions... Indeed, it can be said without exaggeration that the enemy was operating with an air force three times stronger than his normal force.|$|R
5000|$|Daylight Redirecting Window Film (DRF) {{applied to}} windows is {{relatively}} new alternative to Light shelves. DRF {{is applied to the}} upper section of a window (clerestory or <b>daylighting</b> <b>position).</b> The principle method of light redirection is by Total Internal Reflection (TIR) of light transmitted through the microscopic elements of the film. When sunlight or skylight penetrates the film, internal microscopic [...] "louvers" [...] redirect the incoming light upward to the ceiling, where the typical ceiling redistributes the diffuse daylight deeper into the space. As window film does not alter the architectural nature of the building, Daylight Redirecting Film is an elegant and easy upgrade.|$|R
50|$|Seville has a {{subtropical}} Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). Like most Mediterranean climates, Seville has a drier {{summer and}} wet winter. The annual average temperature is 25.4 C {{during the day}} and 13 C at night. Summer is the dominant season and lasts from May to October, the latter in spite of the dwindling <b>daylight</b> and inland <b>position.</b>|$|R
60|$|The final task remained--the {{launching}} of the boat. This, of necessity, was the severest of all, {{for he had}} been compelled to load his comrade in aft of the balance. It meant a supreme effort at lifting. Daylight steeled himself and began. Something must have snapped, for, though {{he was unaware of}} it, the next he knew he was lying doubled on his stomach across the sharp stern of the boat. Evidently, {{and for the first time}} in his life, he had fainted. Furthermore, it seemed to him that he was finished, that he had not one more movement left in him, and that, strangest of all, he did not care. Visions came to him, clear-cut and real, and concepts sharp as steel cutting-edges. He, who all his days had looked on naked Life, had never seen so much of Life's nakedness before. For the first time he experienced a doubt of his own glorious personality. For the moment Life faltered and forgot to lie. After all, he was a little earth-maggot, just like all the other earth-maggots, like the squirrel he had eaten, like the other men he had seen fail and die, like Joe Hines and Henry Finn, who had already failed and were surely dead, like Elijah lying there uncaring, with his skinned face, in the bottom of the boat. <b>Daylight's</b> <b>position</b> was such that from where he lay he could look up river to the bend, around which, sooner or later, the next ice-run would come. And as he looked he seemed to see back through the past to a time when neither white man nor Indian was in the land, and ever he saw the same Stewart River, winter upon winter, breasted with ice, and spring upon spring bursting that ice asunder and running free. And he saw also into an illimitable future, when the last generations of men were gone from off the face of Alaska, when he, too, would be gone, and he saw, ever remaining, that river, freezing and fresheting, and running on and on.|$|R
50|$|Wearing {{the flag}} of Commander, Task Element (CTE) 95.1.1, Bataans mission was to {{blockade}} {{the west coast of}} Korea. While on station, Bataan generally flew 40 sorties a day - eight defensive CAP flights with the remainder divided between close air support (CAS), armed reconnaissance (AR), and interdiction missions. For CAS of ground forces, tactical air controllers usually called in Bataans Corsairs for bomb, rocket, and napalm attacks on known enemy <b>positions.</b> <b>Daylight</b> AR missions concentrated on halting enemy road traffic and bombing rail yards and bridges. The first patrol revealed the dangerous nature of this work when, between 16 and 26 January, VMF-212 lost three Corsairs, along with two pilots, to enemy small-arms fire.|$|R
500|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Arnhem, 1st Battalion, which had been joined by Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion, unsuccessfully attempted to fight through to the bridge then moved south {{in an attempt to}} flank the German line. They eventually ended up beside the river, whereafter 3rd Battalion advanced [...] along the bank until <b>daylight</b> revealed their <b>position</b> to the Germans. Divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart and Brigadier Lathbury accompanied 3rd Battalion until Lathbury was shot and wounded. Due to his injuries, they were unable to move him and he was left in the care of a Dutch family. The 1st and 3rd Battalions spent all day trying to force a way through to the bridge. By nightfall they had failed and the strength of both battalions was reduced to around 100 men.|$|R
30|$|Phase 1 : {{initial setup}} and {{preparation}} of the scanning device. The cameras are mounted on an aluminum frame structure on a robust tripod. The structure contains synchronization and data communication electronics, electric tension transformers, {{and all of the}} connecting cables. This frame is designed and built to allow the correct orientation with respect to the face to be scanned (Figure  3). The structure is positioned at a distance of about 1 m from the subject and connected to a laptop computer used for the remote control of the cameras and to record the images acquired. Two multi-phosphorus fluorescent <b>daylight</b> lamps are <b>positioned</b> for the diffuse illumination of the subject and to facilitate the focusing operations. The background is provided with coded targets, in front of which the subject is seated on a stool that is height adjustable.|$|R
50|$|A longer look at {{the picture}} {{indicates}} that it may not be so innocent as it seems. In contrast to the little girls in Wright's An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (1768, thought to be the earlier work), who shrink from the suffering of the bird, the girls in this painting seem to be enjoying themselves. The theme of cruelty is the same however. The girl on the left is placed forward, almost outside the scene, her index finger pointing to her sister, inviting the spectator to observe the proceedings. Her maniacal expression and the shadowy uplighting add a sinister dimension, suggesting that something unnatural is going on. If the scene was entirely innocent it would surely be taking place in <b>daylight</b> and the <b>positioning</b> of the spectator at about the eye level of the children enhances the feeling that the viewer is entering the secret world of the child with its attendant moral ambiguity.|$|R
40|$|Data storage tags (DSTs) {{were applied}} to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) smolts during their seaward {{migration}} {{in the spring of}} 2002 at a fish counting fence on Campbellton River, Newfoundland. Our objectives were to discover whether or not salmon smolts could carry DSTs and survive, whether or not useful data on thermal habitat could be obtained and interpreted, and whether or not salmon smolts moved vertically in the water column. Data were downloaded from 15 of the recovered tags and revealed the hourly water temperatures experienced by the fish for periods of 3 to 71 days. The data on the DSTs were analyzed for temperature patterns in relation to migration behavior and diurnal movement of the fish. While in the sea, the DSTs recorded night temperatures of 12. 5 °C, which were higher than day temperatures of 11. 6 °C; the record from moored recorders, however, indicated that sea temperatures actually declined at night. It is hypothesized that posts-molts avoid avian predators during <b>daylight</b> hours by <b>positioning</b> themselves deeper in the water column and that they were pursuing prey during the deeper vertical descents or ascents noted during the periods of more rapid changes in temperature...|$|R
60|$|Our {{situation}} was now far from pleasant. The tides and currents, in that high latitude, run with great velocity; and, then, {{at a moment}} when it was of the greatest importance to know precisely where the ship was, we were left to the painful uncertainty of conjecture, and theories that might be very wide of the truth. The captain had nerve enough, notwithstanding, to keep on the larboard tack until daylight, in the hope of getting in sight of the mountains of Terra del Fuego. No one, now, expected {{we should be able to}} fetch through the Straits; but it would be a great relief to obtain a sight of the land, as it would enable us to get some tolerably accurate notions of our <b>position.</b> <b>Daylight</b> came at length, but it brought no certainty. The weather was so thick, between a drizzling rain, sea-mist and the spray, that it was seldom we could see a league around us, and frequently not half a mile. Fortunately, the general direction of the eastern coast of Terra del Fuego, is from north-west to south-east, always giving us room to ware off shore, provided we did not unexpectedly get embarrassed in some one of the many deep indentations of that wild and inhospitable shore.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{practical}} and up-to-date consensus among experts is paramount to further improve patient care in actinic keratosis (AK). OBJECTIVES: To develop a structured consensus {{statement on the}} diagnosis, classification, and practical management of AK based on up-to-date information. METHODS: A systematic review of AK clinical guidelines was conducted. This informed the preparation of a 3 -round Delphi procedure followed by a consensus meeting, which combined the opinions of 16 clinical experts from 13 countries, to construct a structured consensus statement and a treatment algorithm <b>positioning</b> <b>daylight</b> photodynamic therapy (dl-PDT) among other AK treatment options. RESULTS: The systematic review found deficiencies in current guidelines with respect to new AK treatments such as ingenol mebutate and dl-PDT. The Delphi panel established consensus statements across definition, diagnosis, classification, and management of AK. While the diagnosis of AK essentially rests {{on the nature of}} lesions, treatment decisions are based on several clinical and nonclinical patient factors and diverse environmental attributes. Participants agreed on ranked treatment preferences for the management of AK and on classifying AK in 3 clinical situations: isolated AK lesions requiring lesion-directed treatment, multiple lesions within a small field, and multiple lesions within a large field, both requiring specific treatment approaches. Different AK treatment options were discussed for each clinical situation. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide practical recommendations for the treatment of AK, which are readily transferable to clinical practice, and incorporate the physician's clinical judgement. The structured consensus statement positioned dl-PDT as a valuable option for patients with multiple AKs in small or large fields...|$|R
40|$|Decisions made in {{the very}} first stages of a building’s design often have a {{significant}} impact on energy efficiency and internal environment of the building. Although many buildings have energy efficiency strategies embedded in their conceptual design, it is seldom that these concepts would be fully analysed at the initial design stages. In this paper, a case study based on current IES office building is presented as an example to explore an approach, which uses building simulation technology to evaluate a variety of envelope thermal characteristics and low carbon technologies in an integrated manner at the early design stage in order to assist the delivery of a sustainable green office building with a high rating of energy performance. To be able to achieve these aims, a building energy simulation software IES Virtual Environment (VE) is used to conduct a series of sensitivity analysis on a set of design parameters which have good prospects of influencing the building performance. The parameters include the building orientation, construction, natural ventilation scheme integrated with window type and opening area, shading devices and how they are <b>positioned,</b> <b>daylighting,</b> heating strategy. The daylighting calculation is conducted by using the Radiance module implemented in the IES VE. Additionally, an overheating analysis is performed to examine the thermal comfort within the whole office building. Finally, the paper discusses how each parameter interacts with one another and influences they have on the building’s performance to determine the effectiveness for the optimum design solutions of comfortable and energy efficient buildings...|$|R
40|$|Tunnel safety – an {{inventory}} of accidents in four road tunnels in Stockholm This report investigates traffic accidents in four road tunnels in Stockholm. The tunnels investigated are Klaratunneln, Söderledstunneln, Törnskogstunneln and Häggvikstunneln. The main purpose of this project was {{to work with a}} delimited part of the project TUFS (Tunnel Framkomlighet och Säkerhet, Tunnel practicability and safety, my translation) that is going to build a knowledge bank for Swedish road tunnel accidents. The goal of this project was to investigate if the forecasts for accident rates in the tunnels calculated from empirical data differ from the forecasts of the road network made by the forecast program used by Trafikverket, Lill-EVA, for the observed tunnels. Another goal was to determine where accidents occur in the tunnels. In addition, two different tunnel types were compared in terms of accident rates. The tunnel types are located in: countryside (high speed, low traffic flows, no on- and off ramps) or urban center (low speed, high traffic flows, on- and off ramps). Accident data has been collected from the data bases STRADA and NTS and compiled in histograms displaying accident type, light conditions, the seriousness of the accident and number of accidents/year. The results showed that there are no differences in accident rates calculated by Lill-EVA and empirical data for accident rate, serious accident rate and death rate. However, there was a difference in the results concerning light injuries. No difference was found regarding the two tunnel types. Rear-end collision was the most common accident type in Söderledstunneln and serial vehicle crashes in Törnskogstunneln and Häggvikstunneln. Vehicles that got stuck in the tunnel entrance dominated the accident type in Klaratunneln. The majority of the accidents occurred in <b>daylight.</b> The coordinate <b>positions</b> for the accidents showed that there was a concentration of accidents near the tunnel entrance in Klaratunneln, Söderledstunneln and Häggvikstunneln. This is not the case for Törnskogstunneln where accidents have occurred in the tunnel center...|$|R
