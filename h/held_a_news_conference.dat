25|$|On flight day 11, {{the crew}} of Space Shuttle Endeavour {{conducted}} a late inspection of the orbiter's Thermal Protection System. On most previous flights, this inspection was performed after the shuttle undocked from the ISS.

The joint Expedition 28/STS-134 crew <b>held</b> <b>a</b> <b>news</b> <b>conference</b> with reporters on the ground at NASA centers around the country and ISS partner agencies.

Astronauts Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff spent the night in the Quest Airlock with the air pressure reduced to 10.2 Psi, so as to avoid decompression sickness during their spacewalk. The crew and flight controllers on the ground opted not to use the In-suit Light Exercise (ISLE) protocol that was tested during EVA 3 earlier in the mission, opting instead to go with the standard campout protocol, since it was discovered that ISLE used more carbon-dioxide scrubbing capability. They wanted to save this capability, since a CO2 sensor in Chamitoff's suit had failed during EVA 1, cutting that spacewalk short.|$|E
