He lost again on appeal when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that hook designs were not patentable in 1929: With the lower court, we fail to find in plaintiffs' device any patentable novelty; certainly there is no invention in the <b>hook</b> <b>member.</b> Hooks of all shapes and materials are among the commonest things of life. In size, strength, and shape they are to be adapted to needs and tastes, and the adaptation of a hook to suit the pole, rod, bar, or rings from which the drapery is to hang is readily made by any person of common intelligence.

40|$|In Monmouth County, New Jersey the Upper Cretaceous Navesink Formation is well-exposed {{along the}} banks of Big Brook at the Boundary Road Bridge and {{along the banks}} of Poricy Brook, at Poricy Park on Middletown-Linecroft Road. Correlation between these two localities of a shell bed with a {{distinctive}} assemblage dominated by the oysters Pycnodonte and Agerostrea shows that only the upper section of the Navesink is exposed at Poricy Brook, including the base of the transition into the overlying Sandy <b>Hook</b> <b>Member</b> of the Red Bank Formation. This correlation is strengthened by similarities in the sediment characteristics between the two localities. The more complete stratigraphic section at Big Brook exhibits three distinct facies within the Navesink Formation: 1) a thin basal pebble lag (app. 30 cm) overlain by 2) pebbly quartz sands with abundant callianassid burrows (app. 2. 5 m), followed upsection by 3) bioturbated glauconitic sands (app. 7 m) bearing two distinct shell beds with dissimilar macrofossil assemblages (Fig. 1).

40|$|A Shuttle type of {{aircraft}} (10) with an escape hatch (12) has an arcuately shaped pole housing (16) attachable to an interior wall and ceiling with its open end adjacent to the escape hatch. The pole housing 16 contains a telescopically arranged and arcuately shaped primary pole member (22) and extension pole member (23) which are guided by roller assemblies (30, 35). The extension pole member (23) is slidable and extendable relative to the primary pole member (22). For actuation, a spring actuated system includes a spring (52) in the pole housing. A locking member (90) engages both pole members (22, 23) through notch portions (85, 86) in the pole members. The locking member selectively releases the extension pole member (23) and the primary pole member (22). An internal one-way clutch or anti-return mechanism prevents retraction of the extension pole member from an extended position. Shock absorbers (54) (150, 152) are for absoring {{the energy of the}} springs. A manual backup deployment system is provided which includes a canted ring (104) biased by a spring member (108). A lever member (100) with a slot and pin connection (102) permits the mechanical manipulation of the canted ring to move the primary pole member. The ring (104) also prevents retraction of the main pole. The crew escape mechanism includes a magazine (60) and a number of lanyards (62), each lanyard being mounted by a roller loop (68) over the primary pole member (22). The strap on the roller loop has stitching for controlled release, a protection sheath (74) to prevent tangling and a <b>hook</b> <b>member</b> (69) for attachment to a crew harness...|$|E

Founding <b>member</b> <b>Hook</b> stated that the band's shift from playing cold dark tracks from 1981 to producing electro/rock tracks from 1982 was inspired by the music of German electronic group Kraftwerk, US rock band Sparks who had produced disco/electro-rock music with producer Giorgio Moroder on their No. 1 in Heaven album, and also the Moroder/Donna Summer collaboration on [...] "I Feel Love". New Order's collaboration with New York dJ Arthur Baker was inspired by the records' sounds of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force.

40|$|Expression {{of human}} tau in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons causes {{accumulation}} of aggregated tau leading to neurodegeneration and uncoordinated movement. We used {{this model of}} human tauopathy disorders to screen for genes required for tau neurotoxicity. Recessive loss-of-function mutations in the sut- 2 locus suppress the Unc phenotype, tau aggregation and neurodegenerative changes caused by human tau. We cloned the sut- 2 gene and found it encodes a novel sub-type of CCCH zinc finger protein conserved across animal phyla. SUT- 2 shares significant identity with the mammalian SUT- 2 (MSUT- 2). To identify SUT- 2 interacting proteins, we conducted a yeast two hybrid screen and found SUT- 2 binds to ZYG- 12, the sole C. elegans <b>HOOK</b> protein family <b>member.</b> Likewise, SUT- 2 binds ZYG- 12 in in vitro protein binding assays. Furthermore, loss of ZYG- 12 leads to a marked upregulation of SUT- 2 protein supporting the connection between SUT- 2 and ZYG- 12. The human genome encodes three homologs of ZYG- 12 : HOOK 1, HOOK 2 and HOOK 3. Of these, the human ortholog of SUT- 2 (MSUT- 2) binds only to HOOK 2 suggesting the interaction between SUT- 2 and HOOK family proteins is conserved across animal phyla. The identification of sut- 2 as a gene required for tau neurotoxicity in C. elegans may suggest new neuroprotective strategies capable of arresting tau pathogenesis in tauopathy disorders...|$|R
