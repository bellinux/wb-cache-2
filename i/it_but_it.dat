5|$|Divorce was legalized by a {{law passed}} in 1987. The church opposed <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> had huge popular support that {{included}} even Catholic factions, who reasoned that marital separation already existed, and divorce simply made it explicit. The church opposed Alfonsín after that point. The church successfully exerted pressure {{to prevent the}} abolition of religious education. In line with the teachings of Pope John Paul II, the Church criticized what it perceived as an increase in drugs, terrorism, abortion and pornography.|$|E
5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about downsizing measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing to shut down the Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing this through a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking the door behind him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> rejects the card. When he inserts a manual override key, he is fatally electrocuted.|$|E

5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us.

Perhaps they are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> <b>it</b> is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis has {{a strong}} {{hereditary}} component, and many genes are associated with <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is unclear how those genes work together. Most of the identified genes relate to the immune system, particularly the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T cells. Genetic studies are valuable due {{to their ability to}} identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential drug targets.|$|E

5|$|A Malay {{language}} remake titled Aku Tak Bodoh (the {{translation of}} {{the title of the}} first film) was made as a Malaysian co-production between Grand Brilliance, J Team Productions, AMC Sdn Bhd RAM Entertainment, and PMP Entertainment with Jack Neo as the executive producer and directed by his protege Boris Boo. According to Neo himself, there was already a demand to adapt the first film itself into Malay after people requested for a dubbed version of <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> took 4 years for the plan to come into fruition. The film, starring Jalaluddin Hassan and Adibah Noor among others, was released on 14 April 2011 in Singaporean cinemas.|$|E

Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp {{with a piece of}} the ladder. Alec furiously retaliates by aiming the opening of the wizard's hat towards an electrical socket which Presto's fingers go into, shocking Presto into dancing wildly to bluegrass music.|$|E

5|$|Grant, {{demanding}} {{the truth from}} the Kirbys, learns they are actually a middle-class divorced couple, {{who are looking for}} their son Eric, and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who have been missing on the island for eight weeks. Later, the group finds the parasail with Ben's corpse attached. The group takes the parasail, and then encounter raptor nests. They find an abandoned InGen compound, where Amanda is ambushed by a raptor. The group manages to trap <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> escapes and contacts the rest of its pack. The group flees into a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing a stampede, separating Grant and Udesky from the others. Grant retrieves Billy's satchel, while Udesky is left on the ground barely alive by the raptors, who set a trap in an attempt to lure the others out of the tree they had climbed into. Amanda is nearly killed by the raptors when she tries to descend to help Udesky, and upon the failure of their trap, the raptors kill Udesky before departing.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it {{remained}} successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon {{is thought to}} have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodons fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out {{at the same time that}} most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.|$|E
5|$|John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{is shown}} {{working in an}} office {{building}} for a box company. He has a cruel manager named Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion) who is constantly taunting and demeaning Locke. At one point Locke tells Randy off and feels great about it. He tells a woman named Helen on the phone about <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is revealed that she charges by the hour to talk with Locke, {{and that they have}} been conversing for eight months. Locke reveals to Helen that he is going on a walkabout and would like for Helen to go with him; she tells him that she can't meet customers in person and that his paid hour on the phone with her is up.|$|E

5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{hoped to}} be posted to Britain {{at the end of}} his training, and was {{initially}} told that this was going to happen, but he was instead sent to the Middle East. He was despatched to Idku, a small RAF base near Cairo, in late 1942, from where he was posted to an operational training unit based at Baalbek in Lebanon. He spent six weeks there, flying over much of the Levant in a Hawker Hurricane fighter, before being posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron to begin active service, again piloting Hurricanes. The squadron was stationed near the Iranian capital of Tehran when Smith joined <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> almost immediately transferred to Kirkuk in Iraq, to help guard the oil wells and pipelines there. In March 1943, it was again committed to the Western Desert Campaign in North Africa, having previously served there during 1941–1942, and Smith served on this front as a Hurricane pilot. He was promoted to flying officer on 25 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E

5|$|The gangsters {{have bought}} a weapon off the Brotherhood {{which can help}} them fight against Inhumans. They open the box {{containing}} the weapon, and unleash a mystical being who turns the gangsters berserk. She secretly infects May as well, as the strike force takes out the gangsters. Johnson meets with Rodriguez, who stole medication from S.H.I.E.L.D. during their brief check with her which can help Johnson heal—her recent over use of her Inhuman abilities as Quake has been fracturing her bones. Johnson then tracks down the Ghost Rider and confronts <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> defeats her, explaining that it only murders people that deserve to die. She thinks this should include her, but it refuses to kill her. She later sees the Ghost Rider's human form, Robbie Reyes, looking after his disabled brother Gabe.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{documentation}} of what inspired Nielsen {{to write his}} Fifth Symphony or {{when he started to}} write <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is generally understood that the first movement was composed in Humlebæk during the winter and spring of 1921. He stayed at his summer house at Skagen in the early summer. At the end of July he moved to a friend's home at Damgaard to compose the cantata Springtime on Funen, and was therefore only able to resume working on the second movement of the symphony in September, during his free time from his conducting work in Gothenburg.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the act, the canal company {{inherited}} the debts of the Conservators, and paid them an additional £2,000. They were required to rebuild part of the North Town Bridge in Taunton, and to return the Tone Navigation to good order. The Conservators were empowered to carry out an annual inspection, and to re-possess the river if the canal was not properly maintained. The £2,000 was held by the Conservators until 1838, when they applied for an order to dispose of <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was not until 1843 that the order was granted. £1,000 was used to build a new wing for the Taunton and Somerset Hospital, and £1,000 was invested in the Taunton Market Trust, in line with the intentions of the 1699 act.|$|E
