40|$|AbstractExperimental and {{theoretical}} calculations {{indicate that the}} dipole moment of the four Trp side chains in gramicidin A (gA) channels modify channel conductance through long-range electrostatic interactions. Electrostatic ion/side-chain interaction energies along the channel were computed with CHARMM using ab initio atom charges for native and 4 -, 5 -, or 6 -fluorinated Trp side chains. The bulk water reaction to the polar side chains was included using the method of images as implemented by Dorigo et al. (1999), and channel waters in idealized structures were included. Ion/Trp interaction energies were ∼− 0. 6 kcal/mol throughout the channel for {{all four of the}} native Trp pairs. Channel waters produced a modest reduction in the magnitude of interactions, essentially offsetting images representing the bulk water outside the channel. The effects of side-chain fluorination depended on ring position and, to a lesser extent, residue number. Compared with native Trp, 5 -fluorination reduces the translocation barrier with minor effects on the <b>exit</b> <b>barrier.</b> In contrast, 6 -fluorination primarily reduces <b>exit</b> <b>barrier.</b> 4 -Fluorination produces a more complex double-well energy profile.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes several three-body dissociations and the photodissociation of methyl radicals studied using photofragment translational spectroscopy. The {{first chapter}} provides {{an introduction to}} three body dissociation, examines current experimental methodology, and includes a discussion on the treatment of photofragment translational spectroscopy data arising from three-body fragmentation. The ultraviolet photodissociation of azomethane into two methyl radicals and nitrogen is discussed in chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes the photodissociation of acetone at 248 nm and 193 nm. At 248 nm the translational energy release from the initial C-C bond cleavage matches the <b>exit</b> <b>barrier</b> height and a comparison with results at 266 nm suggests that is invariant to the available energy. A fraction of the nascent CH{sub 3 }CO radicals spontaneously dissociate following rotational averaging. The for the second C-C bond cleavage also matches the <b>exit</b> <b>barrier</b> height. At 193 nm the experimental data can be successfully fit assuming that the dynamics are analogous to those at 248 nm. A simplified model of energy partitioning which adequately describes the experimental results is discussed. Experiments on acetyl halides provide additional {{evidence to support the}} proposed acetone dissociation mechanism. A value of 17. 0 {+-} 1. 0 kcal/mole for the barrier height, CH{sub 3 }CO decomposition has been determined. The photodissociation of methyl radical at 193 nm and 212. 8 nm is discussed in the chapter 5.

5000|$|The {{applicability}} of the theory to real-world situations may be questioned, however, particularly as {{there are very few}} markets which are completely free of sunk costs and entry and <b>exit</b> <b>barriers.</b> Low-cost airlines remain a commonly referenced example of a contestable market; entrants have the possibility of leasing aircraft and should be able to respond to high profits by quickly entering and exiting.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the effects}} of <b>exit</b> <b>barriers</b> on {{customer}} relationships with service providers is limited. Some empirical evidence suggests that moderate <b>exit</b> <b>barriers</b> enhance customer commitment. Some authors have argued; however, that high <b>exit</b> <b>barriers</b> can damage marketing relationships, but little empirical evidence of this exists. This study examines the effect of high <b>exit</b> <b>barriers</b> on a marketing relationship after a service failure and service failure recovery attempt has occurred. ^ Sixteen structured interviews were conducted for the purpose of further understanding the relationships between the constructs in this study as well as to help create scales for some of these constructs. Later an experiment was conducted using 320 subjects that were recruited by the help of several community groups. ^ The key constructs in this study include trust, commitment, powerlessness, grudge holding, illusory control, predictive control, and the desire to retaliate. Trust was measured before and after the service failure to determine what differences exists between firms that have high and low <b>exit</b> <b>barriers</b> even before a service failure occurs. In addition to the experiment, a model was created that illustrates what may happen in a marketing relationship when a service failure occurs. ^ The results indicate that initially, customers trust firms more that have low <b>exit</b> <b>barriers</b> than firms that have high <b>exit</b> <b>barriers.</b> After a good service recovery, customer trust in high exit barrier relationships increased almost to the level of customer trust of high exit barrier firms. After a service failure, customers of high exit barrier firms felt more powerless than customers of low exit barrier firms. ^ The results from this research imply that the strength of <b>exit</b> <b>barriers</b> is an important component of marketing relationships and should be investigated in the future. In addition, the importance of a good service recovery is still important to a marketing relationship, despite the size of the <b>exit</b> <b>barriers.</b> ...|$|E

Furthermore, entry through a divacancy is significantly more energetically favorable than exit, implying that divacancies may be beneficial for thermal creation of intercalated bilayers.
