Our aim was to statistically describe police <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries. MethodsWe described police <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries by comparing them with domestic (non-police) <b>dog</b> <b>bites.</b> We retrospectively analyzed their demographic and specific injury data drawn from their medical records. The police <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims came from the Los Angeles Police Department K 9 Unit from 1988 to 1990. The domestic <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims came from King-Drew Medical Center, an inner-city public hospital from 1989 to 1996. All of the police dog victims’ medical records that could be located were included (595 out of 957). All domestic <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims that arrived for treatment were included (n= 1109). ResultsPolice <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims were usually bitten multiple times, whilst domestic bite victims were not. Police <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims were bitten more often in the head, neck, chest and flank. They were hospitalised more often, underwent more operations and had more invasive diagnostic tests.

40|$|My {{presentation}} {{follows a}} set of logical arguments: 1. The vast majority of scholarly research addresses how one or more things affect in some way(s) one or more other things. This is true {{of much of the}} general literature too: (gardener) (grow) (flowers) (<b>dogs)</b> (<b>bite)</b> (mail carriers) [I illustrate this point in Szostak (2003). Note that works that describe only one thing will also be well handled by the classification outlined below. ] 2. If a book is about dogs biting mail carriers, the ideal subject entry is “(mail carriers) (bitten by) (dogs). ” The classification system then reflects the actual structure of works. 3. This is best done by allowing ‘things ’ (dogs, mail carriers) and ‘relationships ’ (biting) to be freely combined in both classification and search (In the right order, so as not to mistakenly recall the smaller but more intriguing literature on mail carriers biting dogs.). This spares the classificationist from having to enumerate a vast array of combinations, and the user from having to ascertain how a particular combination was treated. 4. The real beauty of this approach is that the terms “dog, ” “biting, ” and “mail carrier ” are far less ambiguous than any term the classificationist might have derived to capture this complex relationship. (Szostak, 2011). 5. So we simultaneously get: Subject headings that better capture the essence of work...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{suggests}} some {{goals for}} knowledge representation for natural language processing: natural form, conceptual completeness, structure sharing. To address these goals, an augmentation to {{the representation of}} variables so that variables are not atomic terms is suggested. This leads to an extended, more &quot;natural &quot; representation language whose use and representations {{are consistent with the}} use of variables in natural language. It is shown how this representation simplifies the representation and use of complex noun phrases and resolves some representational difficulties with sentences involving nonlinear quantifier scoping, in particular, donkey sentences. 1 Introduction The intent of the work in this paper is to specify a knowledge representation and reasoning formalism for natural language processing. To this end, I believe the following natural-language-specific goals must be addressed. First, the mapping from natural language sentences into the representation language should be as direct as possible, and the representation should reflect the structure of the natural language (NL) sentence it purports to represent. I call this the &quot;natural form &quot; constraint. This is particularly well illustrated by rule-type sentences, such as small <b>dogs</b> <b>bite</b> harder than big dogs, where the representation takes the form of an implication whose antecedent constraints specify what kind of dog bite harder than another type. This representation, as a logical rule, contrasts with the predicate-argument structure of the original sentence, as below: 8 x; y((small(x) ^ dog(x) ^ large(y) ^ dog(y))) bites-harder(x; y)) (1) By comparison, the representation of Fido bites harder than Rover is more consistent with the structure of the original sentence...|$|E

40|$|The {{individuality}} of {{the human}} dentition frequently allows the Forensic Odonto-Stomatologist (FOS) to reach a strong opinion of association in cases of identification and bite mark analy-sis. Such analysis can often be useful during the investigation of violent crimes, especially those involving sexual assault. Bites from animals are rarely the object of bite mark analysis. The teeth of animals leave patterned injuries that appear quite different from those created by human teeth. This is especially true with dogs, which are predominant culprits in bites to humans. <b>Dogs</b> <b>bite</b> humans at a rate eight times more frequently than humans bite each other. However, such bites {{may need to be}} analyzed in order to distinguish what species of animal may have been the attacker, or exclude one or more animals when {{there is more than one}} possible offender. Typical cases of routine bite mark analysis encountered by the FOS are presented. Two cases of dog bites appearing as possible accidents and two human bites report about this spectrum. In another case, a child abuse with several specific bite marks shows the potential to detect the perpetrator. The last case representing a bite mark in a fruit is obtained from criminal routine case work. It is hoped that these cases will demonstrate the significant role the analysis of bite marks might play alongside other criminalistic routines.

In this study we assessed the prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. infections in wild boars from northeastern Portugal, for which novel PCR testing assays targeting Sarcocystis genus, S. miescheriana and S. suihominis were implemented, and risk factors potentially associated with these infections were evaluated. Samples from muscle tissue, namely diaphragm (n = 102), oesophagus (n = 96) and heart (n = 101), were collected from a total of 103 wild boar hunted between October 2011 and February 2012. Diaphragm muscle was used for the PCR detection of Sarcocystis nucleic acids since a higher proportion of samples showed the presence of cysts during histological examination. PCR assay targeting Sarcocystis genus yielded a 73. 8 % infection rate, which indicate a high level of exposure to these protozoan parasites among wild boars. These samples showed to be positive with the S. miescheriana-specific PCR assay and no sample was positive with the S. suihominis-specific assay, suggesting that a single species infecting wild boar is circulating in Portugal. These results were confirmed by the partial sequencing of the 18 S rRNA gene amplified from selected samples from different geographic regions. Adults, young adults and female wild boars were found to be more likely infected. Hunters have an important role in the life cycle of S. miescheriana since potentially infected viscera and carcasses can be left behind promoting the protozoan dissemination to the scavenging final hosts.

Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between 20 - 22 / 11 / 2013 in the town and surrounding areas. Line list was developed from registration book. Questionnaire was developed & used to elicit the required information. Epi Info 3. 5. 3 software & Microsoft Excel 2007 did analysis & entry. Result: Starting from 01 / 11 / 2013 to 30 / 11 / 2013, total of 16 animal bites reported from kebribeyah. Both sexes were equally bitten eight (50 %) each. Majority of the victims 10 (62. 5 %) were in the age group of one - 20 years. Most of the victims exposures 14 (87. 5 %) were WHO Classification of category III, whereas 2 (12. 5 %) victims were category I. common site of bite was the leg 8 (50 %) victims. About eight (50 %) of the victims has been reported within 24 h of the bite. Majority of the victims 13 (81. 3 %) were Unprovoked bites. All bites were due to stray dogs.

40|$|Published Online First 27 January 2017 INTRODUCTION: Preventing <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> is an {{intractable}} problem {{given the}} complex <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injury environment. Desexing of dogs {{has the opportunity}} of creating a safer injury environment, given the potential links between desexing and behaviour change in dogs. METHODS: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was conducted to examine the evidence for desexing of dogs to reduce <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> risk within a population health paradigm. Medline and CAB Abstracts were searched for studies that reported data on the association of dog neuter status with the risk of <b>dog</b> <b>bite.</b> All definitions of <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> were included and all empirical studies were included in the review, limited to those published in English. Quality appraisal and data extraction were based on the 2013 evidence-based practice and critical appraisal tool from the University of Auckland. RESULTS: Five out of six observational studies, from four study populations found evidence that intact dogs were associated with an increased risk of <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> compared with desexed dogs. The effect sizes ranged across the studies and given the heterogeneity of the studies no single effect size on the association between desexing and <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> risk could be estimated. CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent evidence that desexing dogs is associated with a reduced risk of <b>dog</b> <b>bite,</b> although the studies reflect association and may not be causal. Although recent publications have suggested desexing is associated with health and behavioural costs in some breeds, population level evidence supports desexed dogs having a longer lifespan, and being less likely to wander with the added benefit of reducing unwanted litters. Thus, mandatory desexing presents a possible opportunity for prevention of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> expanding <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> prevention beyond an education-only approach.

Although Animal Services data severely underestimates the incidence of <b>dog</b> <b>bites,</b> it is sensitive to detect patterns of occurrence and is readily available for local decision-making. ...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} : Rabies is an acute and fatal infectious disease {{that is very}} important due to high economic losses to livestock and the amounts of expenditures that are paid for purchasing serum and vaccine. The main way of disease transmitting is bites by rabid animals. Animal bite is an important threat for human health. The main aim of this research was epidemiological study of animal bite in the students of Hashtrood town. Material and Methods : In this cross-sectional study, animal bitten students’ data were collected trough the records of Hashtrood health centers registry lists between 2006 - 2009. The census data collecting method was used and the data were analyzed with statistical software SPSS 15. Results : The incidence of animal bites in the past 5 years was 9. 07 per 1, 000 students. From 439 animal bitten students, 80. 9 % were male and 19. 1 % were female. According to the results, 88. 4 % were rural and 11. 2 % were urban residents. <b>Dogs</b> <b>bite</b> was the cause of 87. 92 %. In 86. 5 % of the cases, the bite was superficial and in 8. 4 % of the cases, bites were deeper. Among them, 16. 6 % received anti rabies serum, 16. 2 % received vaccine. This study showed that 4. 8 % had a previous history of bite. Of total, 78. 8 % made a visit to health centers in the first 24 hours, 11. 4 % within 25 to 48 hours, and 3. 6 % within 49 to 72 hours after bites. There was no human death report from rabies. Results showed that 95. 2 % were given incomplete vaccination and 4. 1 % had received five complete vaccines. Conclusion : Regarding the high prevalence of animal bites among students, educating students about the importance of rabies, students’ behavior with dogs and immediate visit to health centers after exposure to dogs should be taken serious.

40|$|Background:. Incidence of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> {{continues}} to rise among the pediatric population {{and serves as a}} public health threat for the well-being of children. Plastic surgeons are at the forefront of initial management and eventual outcome of these devastating injuries. This study set out to determine the nature of <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries treated over a 3 -year period at a large level 1 pediatric trauma center. Methods:. A retrospective review of emergency room records of all pediatric patients (age, 0 – 18 years old) who sustained <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> between January 2012 and December 2014 were gathered. All details about age of patient, location and severity of <b>dog</b> <b>bites,</b> type of <b>dog</b> breed, antibiotics given, and emergency versus operative treatment were recorded and analyzed. Results:. One hundred eight patients aged 5 months to 18 years old were treated in the emergency department after suffering <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries during the study period. The highest incidence of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> occurred in preschool children. The mean age for patients who required operative repair was lower than the mean age for patients who underwent primary closure in the emergency department. The location of injury was most commonly isolated to the head/neck region. Of the 56 cases that had an identified dog breed, pit bulls accounted for 48. 2 % of the <b>dog</b> <b>bites,</b> and 47. 8 % of pit bull bites required intervention in the operating room. Conclusion:. Children with large <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries require more immediate care in a level 1 pediatric trauma hospitals in order to optimize their hospitalization course and eventual outcome...|$|R
