5|$|President Dmitry Medvedev {{announced}} in May 2010 that the Russian government would strongly consider purchasing electricity generated from {{renewable energy sources}} {{in an attempt to}} encourage development of renewable energy. The government has plans for 4.5% of Russia's energy output to come from non-hydroelectric renewable energy sources. Additionally, in November 2010, the government approved a US$300billion program to make factories and buildings more energy efficient; it also announced plans to construct eight energy-efficient lamp production plants, promote recycling and support the construction of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>car</b> plant. Medvedev {{announced in}} late 2009 that he wanted to cut Russian energy consumption by 40% by 2020. At the moment, development is slowed by low investment, economic instability, low public demand and low tariffs on heat and electricity. Subsidies for natural gas are another obstacle to renewable energy development.|$|E
