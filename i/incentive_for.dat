30|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new perspective}} by classifying active labor market programs (ALMPs) depending on their objectives, relevance and cost-effectiveness during normal times, a crisis and recovery. We distinguish ALMPs providing <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> retaining employment, <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> creating employment, <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> seeking and keeping a job, <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> human capital enhancement and improved labor market matching. Reviewing evidence from the literature, we discuss especially indirect effects of various interventions and their cost-effectiveness. The paper concludes by providing a systematic overview of how, why, when {{and to what extent}} specific ALMPs are effective.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> facility-based firms {{to invest in}} infrastructure upgrades and to foreclose service-based firms. We focus on asymmetric regulation regarding servicebased firms' access to the infrastructure held by a facility-based firm. Spillovers from the infrastructure upgrades made by a regulated facility-based firm on service-based firms {{play a key role}} in the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> making these upgrades. The spillover effect can enhance the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> the regulated facility-based firm to make upgrades if access prices are not regulated. The existence of rival facility-based firms strengthens the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> a regulated facility-based firm to make infrastructure upgrades, especially when the spillover effect is significant. Furthermore, if access prices are not regulated, the existence of rival facility-based firms weakens the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> a regulated facility-based firm to foreclose service-based firms...|$|R
5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until about}} 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed {{exchange}} rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, {{which was one of}} the design objectives of the systems' architects. Additionally, global growth was generally very high in this period, so there was little <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> currency war even if it had been possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> the private sector to invest.|$|E

40|$|Since {{governments can}} {{influence}} the demand for a new abatement technology through their environmental policy, {{they may be able}} to expropriate innovations in new abatement technology ex post. This suggests that <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> environmental R&D may be lower than the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> market goods R&D. This in turn may be used as an argument for environmental R&D getting more public support than other R&D. In this paper we systematically compare the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> environmental R&D with the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> market goods R&D. We find that the relationship might be the opposite: When the innovator is able to commit to a licence fee before environmental policy is resolved, incentives are always higher for environmental R&D than for market goods R&D. When the government sets its policy before or simultaneously with the innovator’s choice of licence fee, <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> environmental R&D may be higher or lower than for market goods R&D.

5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. The best pelts are from winter {{trapping}} with secondary quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> catching this species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, {{there could be}} a strong <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> {{individuals}} to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimation}} that 300 senators were proscribed {{was presented}} by Appian, although his earlier contemporary Livy asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} workhouse labour was never clear {{according}} to historian M. A. Crowther. In {{the early days}} of workhouses it was either a punishment or a source of income for the parish, but during the 19thcentury the idea of work as punishment became increasingly unfashionable. The idea took hold that work should rehabilitate the workhouse inmates for their eventual independence, and that it should therefore be rewarded with no more than the workers' maintenance, otherwise there would be no <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> them to seek work elsewhere.|$|E

In vitro propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds). This technology has, to a large extent, removed the <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> collectors to travel to Sabah to collect the plant illegally, and demand for wild-collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years.|$|E
5|$|A total {{prize money}} pot of US$245,000 was {{available}} to athletes at the championships, with awards being given those placing from first to sixth in both the individual and team sections. The amounts on offer for each competition were equal across the sexes. The top prize for the individual race winners was $30,000, while the three athletes in the winning teams earned a share of $15,000. A further $50,000 was provided as in <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> runners who improved upon the half marathon world record mark, but ultimately this award was not claimed at the 2010 championships. All athletes receiving prize money needed to submit to – and pass – a doping test in order to claim their award.|$|E
40|$|A firm’s {{impact on}} social {{objectives}} such as environmental standards {{can often be}} moderated by procedures–the workplace rules that guide employee behavior. The legal framework can provide <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> firms to adopt such procedures. For example, firms could be immunized from liability for harm when a suitable procedure has been put in place. However, such immunization tends to deliver excessive <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> proceduralization, and sometimes also insufficient <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> firms to enforce procedures. Despite these disadvantages, there are cases in which procedural immunization is socially desirable. ...|$|R

5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has been slow and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E

The venture, however, was predicated upon receiving $342 million in federal stimulus funds; in August 2009, those funds were denied, and officials conceded it was unlikely that the plant would be built.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the mule {{breeding}} industry collapsed with the advent of mechanization. By 1922, Poitevin foals became difficult to sell, and the population dropped dramatically as there was no economic <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> breeding. A continued breeding of mules caused the breed to decline faster than other draft breeds, as purebred horses were not bred as often. By 1945, breed selection was oriented towards the production of meat, as the only remaining economic opportunity for farmers. The conformation of the breed changed slightly to become shorter, but the Poitevin remained unprofitable for horse meat, as breeders preferred to invest in herds of Comtois and Breton horses, which were faster growing and higher yielding.|$|E
5|$|On 11October Valckenier unsuccessfully {{requested}} that officers control their troops {{and stop the}} looting. Two days later the council established a reward of two ducats for every Chinese head surrendered to the soldiers as an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> the other ethnic groups {{to assist in the}} purge. As a result, ethnic Chinese who had survived the initial assault were hunted by gangs of irregulars, who killed those Chinese they found for the reward. The Dutch worked with natives in different parts of Batavia; ethnic Bugis and Balinese grenadiers were sent to reinforce the Dutch on 14October. On 22October Valckenier called for all killings to cease. In a lengthy letter in which he blamed the unrest entirely on the Chinese rebels, Valckenier offered an amnesty to all Chinese, except for the leaders of the unrest, on whose heads he placed a bounty of up to 500 rijksdaalders.|$|E
5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that {{there ought to be a}} political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E
