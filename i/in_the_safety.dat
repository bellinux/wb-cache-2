5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} discusses <b>the</b> {{fulfillment of}} <b>safety</b> needs of <b>the</b> students’ activity unit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of full body contact sports in Yogyakarta State University. This research study {{is aimed at}} investigating <b>the</b> efforts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fulfillment of <b>safety</b> needs conducted by the students’ activity unit of full body contact sports {{in order to prevent}} accidents which can end in injury, physical defect, or even death during the training sessions. This is a descriptive research study involving <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> needs as <b>the</b> only variable. <b>The</b> population involved <b>in</b> this research was the students of Yogyakarta State University who were the members of the students’ activity unit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of full body contact sports. The researcher took 100 samples out of 465 members using proportionate stratified random sampling. The instrument to collect <b>the</b> data was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of questionnaires.

The results of this study show that <b>the</b> efforts <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> needs conducted by the students’ activity unit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of full body contact sports in Yogyakarta State University were generally good (66 %).

5|$|King was {{overtaken}} by Markelov {{on the same}} lap. Marciello overtook Matsushita at the third corner to retake the lead on lap six. Armand crashed into the turn one barriers on the same lap, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> car's second appearance. Most drivers elected to make their mandatory pit stops during the safety car period. Marciello remained ahead of Matsushita and maintained the lead when the safety car drove into the pit lane shortly afterwards. Marciello fended off a challenge by Matsushita to retain first position. Pic squeezed Markelov towards the turn five barrier on the ninth lap and both drivers damaged their cars, causing Markelov to retire. Pic drove on for a short distance before retiring because of the damage resulting from the collision. The safety car was sent onto the track for the third time. Marciello maintained his lead at the restart, while Matsushita ran wide at the first turn, allowing Jeffri to pass him for second place. Matsushita dropped to fifth position. Rowland passed both drivers by taking the inside line. Marciello {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Having run in clean air, Giovinazzi had moved into third place by the 12th lap, but moved into second two laps later when he overtook Rowland on the start/finish straight with DRS assistance.|$|E
5|$|Rowland ran wide while de Jong {{reversed}} {{onto the}} run-off area. This {{was caused by}} both drivers not gaining optimum brake temperature. De Jong dropped to fifth while Rowland fell to third after the latter was passed by Sirotkin. Armand spun in the seventh corner, triggering the safety car's second appearance. It remained on the track {{for the next three}} laps. On the restart, Matsushita utilised a tactic of backing the field up before driving away. However some drivers accelerated away after passing the safety car line, while others remained at the pace dictated by Matsushita. This resulted in Malja colliding with the rear-end of Evans's car, removing his front wing, and sending debris from it airborne. Malja then hit Rowland in the first corner. He spun but managed to continue. Gelael was forced to collide with the barrier, causing him to retire. The incident resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> car's third deployment which remained on track for the next two laps. At the lap 13 restart, Marciello got away faster than Matsushita and drove around the inside of him but locked his tyres. The two made contact when they steered into turn one. The incident allowed Gasly to inherit the lead, with teammate Giovinazzi moving into second.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely {{populated}} {{communities around the}} bay transformed during the 20th century. Following the devastating 1900 hurricane, donations by the newly created Red Cross, including millions of strawberry plants to Gulf Coast farmers, helped revive area communities. This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena an important fruit producer for many years afterward. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain. In fact, because the port had opened just before the 1900 hurricane, {{it was able to}} handle Galveston's diverted shipping traffic until the island's damaged port was repaired. Following another hurricane in 1915, the Texas City Dike was built to protect the Texas City ship channel from sediment movement in future storms, thus helping to build confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of the port. One of the most immediate effects of the dike, however, was to increase the salt levels in West Bay, between Galveston and the southwest coastline.|$|E

5|$|Waray guerrillas under {{a former}} schoolteacher named Captain Nieves Fernandez fought the Japanese in Tacloban. Nieves {{extensively}} trained her men in combat skills and making of improvised weaponry, {{as well as}} leading her men in the front. With only 110 men, Nieves managed to take out over 200 Japanese soldiers during the occupation. The Imperial Japanese Army posted a 10,000 Pesos reward on {{her head in the}} hopes of capturing her but to no avail. The main commander of the resistance movement in the Island of Leyte was Ruperto Kangleon, a former Filipino soldier turned resistance fighter and leader. After the fall of the country, he successfully escaped capture by the Japanese and established a united guerrilla front in Leyte. He and his men, the Black Army, were successful in pushing the Japanese from the mainland province and further into the coastlands of Southern Leyte. Kangleon's guerrillas provided intelligence for the American guerrilla leaders such as Wendell Fertig, and assisted in the subsequent Leyte Landing and the Battle of Leyte soon after. The guerrillas in Leyte were also very instrumental not only in the opposition against Japanese rule, but also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> and aid of the civilians living in the island. In the book The Hidden Battle of Leyte: The Picture Diary of a Girl taken by the Japanese Military by Remedios Felias; a former comfort woman, revealed how the Filipino guerrillas saved the lives of many young girls raped or to-be raped by the Japanese. In her vivid account of the Battle of Burauen, she recounts how the guerrillas managed to wipe out entire Japanese platoons off the various villages in the municipality, eventually saving the lives of many.|$|E
