5|$|The <b>Exchequer</b> of Pleas or Court of <b>Exchequer</b> was a {{court that}} dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal {{principles}} based on natural law and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the curia regis, or King's Council, the <b>Exchequer</b> of Pleas split from the curia during the 1190s, to sit as an independent, central court. The Court of Chancery's reputation for tardiness and expense resulted in much of its business transferring to the <b>Exchequer.</b> The <b>Exchequer</b> and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years, until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts was unnecessary. As a result, the <b>Exchequer</b> lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the <b>Exchequer</b> was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council of 16December 1880.|$|E

5|$|Many {{high-ranking}} Unionists {{refused to}} serve under Bonar Law {{to the benefit}} of Chamberlain who rose over the course of ten months from backbencher to Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer.</b> Bonar Law initially appointed Chamberlain Postmaster General and Chamberlain was sworn of the Privy Council. When Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen, the Minister of Health, lost his seat in the 1922 general election and failed to win a by-election in March 1923, Bonar Law offered the position within the Cabinet to Chamberlain. Two months later, Bonar Law was diagnosed with advanced, terminal throat cancer. He immediately resigned, and was replaced by Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer</b> Stanley Baldwin. In August 1923, Baldwin promoted Chamberlain to the position of Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue {{concerning}} the <b>Exchequer,</b> written in about 1178, details {{the workings of}} the <b>Exchequer</b> and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain {{the inner workings of the}} <b>Exchequer,</b> and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used. The Dialogue also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the <b>Exchequer</b> clerks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Exchequer</b> {{stood on}} an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of the}} Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the <b>Exchequer</b> to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the <b>Exchequer,</b> necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The <b>Exchequer</b> maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The <b>Exchequer</b> had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the <b>Exchequer,</b> particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E

5|$|The {{appointment}} {{of the second}} and third Dukes of Norfolk as Lord High Treasurers from 1501 to 1546 led to a gradual reduction in the Exchequer's power. The Dukes were seen by the government as too independent to be trusted with any real power, but too useful to be removed; as a result, to indirectly reduce their power, the <b>Exchequer</b> was deliberately weakened. When William Paulet was appointed Treasurer in 1546 the <b>Exchequer</b> again increased in power, absorbing the Court of Augmentations and Court of First Fruits and Tenths by 1554. The <b>Exchequer</b> was also assisted in this period by Thomas Fanshawe, the Queen's Remembrancer; a capable man, Fanshawe was often consulted by the Barons of the <b>Exchequer</b> as to the best way to administer the court, and helped standardise pleadings, allowing the <b>Exchequer</b> to cope during a period of increased business. Fanshawe's administrative reforms were considered excellent, and his work continued to be used as the standard until the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{head of the}} <b>Exchequer</b> {{for much}} of its {{existence}} was the Lord High Treasurer, who was tasked with collecting royal revenues. Originally a clerk, he was supervised by the Chief Justiciar, and only became head of the court after this position was abolished {{during the reign of}} Henry III. During the reign of Elizabeth I the Treasurer's other duties began to increase, and he played less of a role in the Exchequer's affairs. By the 17th century, the Lord High Treasurer had been replaced by a dedicated Treasurer of the <b>Exchequer</b> (although earlier writs show that the Lord High Treasurer had been independently given this title), who was ceremoniously presented with a white staff by the monarch. The Treasurer, while active in the revenue side of the <b>Exchequer,</b> played little or no active role in the <b>Exchequer</b> of Pleas.|$|E
5|$|There are few records {{known to}} date from before 1580, as bills were not dated before then. Until the 16th century, the <b>Exchequer</b> carried out its duties with little {{variation}} in its function or practice. A small court, the <b>Exchequer</b> handled around 250 cases a year, compared to 2,500 in the Court of King's Bench and 10,000 in the Court of Common Pleas. Under the Tudors, however, the Exchequer's political, judicial and fiscal importance all increased. This was partially {{thanks to the}} Lord High Treasurer; although the Lord Chancellor was more traditionally important, the Lord High Treasurers from 1547 to 1612 were politically influential figures, including Robert Cecil, Thomas Sackville and William Paulet; since the Lord High Treasurer {{was head of the}} <b>Exchequer,</b> with the Treasurer's increased influence came increased importance for the <b>Exchequer.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{doctoral}} {{graduate of}} the University of Edinburgh, Brown spent his early career working as both a lecturer at a further education college and a television journalist. He entered Parliament in 1983 as the MP for Dunfermline East. He joined the Shadow Cabinet in 1989 as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade, and was later promoted to become Shadow Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer</b> in 1992. After Labour's victory in 1997, he was appointed Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer,</b> becoming the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history.|$|E
5|$|After {{working in}} {{business}} and local government and after a short spell as Director of National Service in 1916 and 1917, Chamberlain followed his father, Joseph Chamberlain, and older half-brother, Austen Chamberlain, in becoming a member of parliament in the 1918 general election at age 49. He declined a junior ministerial position, remaining a backbencher until 1922. He was rapidly promoted in 1923 to Minister of Health and then Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer.</b> After a short Labour-led government, he returned as Minister of Health, introducing a range of reform measures from 1924 to 1929. He was appointed Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer</b> in the National Government in 1931.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{appeals to}} the <b>Exchequer</b> Chamber, the court also allowed {{appeals to the}} House of Lords, which was first used in 1660 for the case of Fanshawe v Impey and {{confirmed}} in 1677.|$|E

5|$|Gordon Brown was an {{important}} figure in Blair's Labour government and {{played a key role}} in developing the party's philosophy. Brown served as Shadow Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer</b> from 1992 to 1997 and was appointed Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer</b> following Labour's election victory in 1997. He attempted to control public spending and sought to increase the funding for education and healthcare. His economic strategy was market-based, attempting to reform the welfare state through a tax credit scheme for poorer working families, and he assigned the Bank of England to set interest rates.|$|E

5|$|Most {{information}} about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, {{but there is no}} detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the <b>Exchequer</b> given in the Dialogue Concerning the <b>Exchequer,</b> written in about 1180. Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E

50|$|In 1897, Murray was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} Board of Inland Revenue.

On Hamilton's retirement in October 1907, Murray became sole permanent secretary. In 1909, Murray was involved in lobbying various Crossbench peers in the House of Lords to reject the Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer's</b> proposed budget. He retired on 23 July 1911.|$|R
5|$|Neville, who was illegitimate, had {{at least}} three brothers: Nicholas de Neville, a canon at Chichester Cathedral; William de Neville, {{treasurer}} of the see of Chichester; and Robert de Neville, holder of a prebend at Chichester. The identity of their father is unknown, but another likely sibling was Roger, who held land in Lincolnshire. Robert became Chancellor of the <b>Exchequer,</b> and Nicholas a baron of the <b>Exchequer.</b> Ralph Neville was also related to Hugh de Neville, King John of England's chief forester.|$|E
5|$|Nigel was {{a married}} bishop, {{and his son}} Richard fitzNeal was later Lord Treasurer and Bishop of London. Another son was William, called William the Englishman. Richard, who wrote the Dialogus de Scaccario, or Dialogue {{concerning}} the <b>Exchequer</b> about the procedures of the <b>Exchequer,</b> had been taught those procedures by his father. Nigel's uncle Roger {{had at least one}} son, Roger, who was King Stephen's chancellor; Adelelm, who succeeded Nigel as treasurer after his first term, was probably Roger's son also. Another relative was William of Ely, who succeeded Richard fitzNeal as treasurer in 1196, although the exact relationship is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, <b>Exchequer,</b> King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The Court of Common Pleas thus ceased to exist, except as the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the <b>Exchequer</b> died in 1880, allowing for {{the abolition of the}} Common Pleas Division and <b>Exchequer</b> Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.|$|E
