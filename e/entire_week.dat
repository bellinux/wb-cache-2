5|$|Before December 1981, {{the show}} did not feature a bonus round. Under the bonus round's {{original}} rules, no letters were provided automatically. The contestant asked for five consonants and a vowel, {{and then had}} fifteen seconds to attempt solving the puzzle. Also, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant {{at the start of}} the round. The current time limit and rules for letter selection were introduced on October 3, 1988. Starting on September 4, 1989, the first episode of the seventh syndicated season, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant choosing from one of five envelopes labeled W, H, E, E, and L. One prize was always $25,000 in cash, and the rest were changed weekly. Any prize that was won was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week. During seasons 16 through 18 (1998â€“2001), the $25,000 remained in-place the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> of shows regardless if it was won. At the start of season 19 in 2001, there were three car envelopes and two $25,000 envelopes, which were available the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> of shows. These envelopes were replaced with the bonus wheel on October 22, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Later the Crown {{prosecutor}} {{conceded that}} Richards had procured the drugs after arrival. Despite the incident, {{the band played}} two shows in Toronto, only to raise more controversy when Margaret Trudeau, then-wife of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was seen partying with the band after one show. The band's two shows were not advertised to the public. Instead, the El Mocambo had been booked for the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> by April Wine for a recording session. 1050 CHUM, a local radio station, ran a contest for free tickets to see April Wine. Contest winners who selected tickets for Friday or Saturday night were surprised to find the Rolling Stones playing.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{relatively}} long-lived hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season that affected countries from Central America to the United Kingdom. Lili formed on October14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October4. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October16 and then to hurricane status on October17. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas. For almost an <b>entire</b> <b>week,</b> Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{prompted}} the closures {{of public and}} private schools, businesses, offices, and factories throughout the Northeast. In some areasmdash&such as the city of Boston and parts of New Jerseymdash&classes were canceled for the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> following the snowstorm. In New York City, student attendance remained extremely low in the days after schools reopened. The New York Public Library was forced to close its main location and all of its 80 branches. Non-essential government offices in Washington, D.C. were also closed because of the storm. Air and ground transportation came to a halt, with multiple major airports closed and rail service suspended. At La Guardia and Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy International) airports alone, over 100 flights were canceled. Railroads reported {{tens of millions of dollars}} in lost revenue and storm-related expenses.|$|E
5|$|According to Oricon, Avex Trax had {{expected}} to ship approximately 400,000 total units in its first week of sales; as a result, the sales mark were printed and distributed for several stores throughout Japan. Rock 'n' Roll Circus debuted at {{number one on the}} Japanese Daily Oricon Albums Chart, staying there for an <b>entire</b> <b>week.</b> This resulted in the album debuting atop the Japanese Weekly Oricon Albums Chart, with an estimated 205,000 sold units in its first week of sales. This became the highest selling album by a female artist for first week sales of 2010. Rock 'n' Roll Circus became Hamasaki's tenth studio album to debut atop the Oricon Albums Chart for both Daily and Weekly rankings, making Hamasaki the first artist to have at least one album {{at the top of the}} charts for 12 consecutive years. Hamasaki also became the only female artist to have the most number one albums on Oricon since her debut with eleven entries, apart from Guilty which reached number two. It slipped to number three the following week, shifting 45,686 in Japan. It stayed in the top 10 for five weeks, and the top 300 with 23 weeks overall.|$|E
5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E

50|$|The Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar (HHPC) is a {{proposal}} for calendar reform. It {{is one of many}} examples of leap week calendars, calendars which maintain synchronization with the solar year by intercalating <b>entire</b> <b>weeks</b> rather than single days. It is a modification of a previous proposal, Common-Civil-Calendar-and-Time (CCC&T). With the Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar, every calendar date always falls on the same day of the week.|$|R
5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> the crime {{was supposed to have been}} committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E
25|$|In Hasidic congregations, Tachanun is omitted on {{the anniversary}} of the death of various Rebbes (except Lubavitch makes a point of saying), since that is {{considered}} a day for religious renewal and celebration. There is a Hasidic custom of omitting Tachanun the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> of Purim (11-17 Adar) and the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> of Lag BaOmer (14-20 Iyar). Some communities omit Tachanun on 7 Adar because it is the anniversary of the death of Moses. Additionally some Hasidic congregations omit Tachanun on Friday mornings (getting ready for Shabbat), and some even on Sunday mornings (revival from Shabbat).|$|E

25|$|A {{symbol of}} the Passover holiday is matzo, an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is {{continually}} worked from mixing through baking, {{so that it is}} not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the <b>entire</b> <b>week</b> of Passover. Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the Passover Seder. There are several explanations for this.|$|E
