50|$|Also {{known as}} a double arm suplex, reverse nelson suplex, double axe handle suplex, and a {{butterfly}} suplex, the wrestler and opponent face each other, the opponent bent forward. The wrestler hooks the opponent's arms back in a reverse nelson, placing his forearms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crooks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's elbows, with his hands on top of <b>the</b> opponent's back <b>in</b> a butcher's grip. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into an upside-down vertical position and falls back, shifting the opponent to one side as the opponent flips over. The wrestler executing the suplex may release the reverse nelson hold during the throw, or can maintain the grip and attempt a bridging pin or submission hold transition upon impact.|$|R

[...] It rests on a cement base; attached to the base is a black label that reads [...] "COMMERCE" [...] in large gold letters. The sculpture is a female figure representing commerce. She is dressed in Hellenistic robes which are belted at the waist, and her hair is styled in a bun (with a few tendrils loose on her neck). She holds a caduseus, a classic symbol of commerce, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> her proper right arm.

2500|$|History is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a female figure draped in Hellenistic robes, holding a feathered quill in her proper right hand and an open book cradled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> her proper left arm. She wears a floor-length tunic with a wide, slightly pleated neckline underneath a loosely draped mantle which is approximately a foot shorter than the tunic itself. The mantle is draped over her proper left shoulder, encircles her body about the proper right hip, and is gathered at her proper left waist. Her proper right sleeve is rolled halfway up her arm above the elbow, and her proper right arm is crossed {{in front of her}} body, horizontal to her waist. She holds a feathered quill delicately in her proper right hand, and little finger of which is curled and raised slightly. The little finger of her proper left hand, which holds the open book, is also curled slightly, adding a sense of delicacy to her pose. Some of the pages of the book have been delineated from one another, in order to give it a more realistic appearance. Her hair is pulled back into a braid, and wound around itself several times, creating a thick bun. Her features have an idealized cast to them, and her eyes are lowered, gazing at the pages of the book in her proper left hand. The sculpture's proper right foot is raised slightly at the heel, and she stands with the majority of her weight on her proper left foot. This sculpture, like the other seven, is carved from Italian Carrara marble, and sits upon a cement pedestal. Approximately three feet below the base of the statue is a black plaque, upon which is the word [...] "HISTORY" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E

5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MUL.APIN. <b>The</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed {{from most of the}} stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present <b>in</b> Greek mythology. <b>The</b> association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|R

5|$|The only goal of {{the game}} {{followed}} shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff, who passed it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. However, as he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and slipped <b>in</b> between <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> his left elbow and body. With a couple of Cardiff City forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but despite it looking promising, Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly {{could have had a}} second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal had he received the ball as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil. The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.|$|R

His cutter has a very neat little cabin, quite big enough for two men not only to sleep but to sit and smoke in. We left the scuttle wide open, of course. As to his provisions for supper, they were not of a luxurious kind. He complained that the shops in the village were miserable. There was a big village within a mile and a half.

Then of a sudden Eric put out his strength, and they {{staggered}} round the ring, tearing at each other till their jerkins were rent from them, leaving them almost bare to the waist. Suddenly, Eric seemed to give, and Ospakar put out his foot to trip him. But Brighteyes was watching.

60|$|And {{there when}} he turned was the grim, kindly face of old Doctor Jordan facing him. He carried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> his arm a brown shawl with {{something}} round and small muffled up in it. There was one slit in front, and through this came a fist {{about the size of}} a marble, the thumb doubled under the tiny fingers, and the whole limb giving circular waves, as if the owner were cheering lustily at his own successful arrival. 'Here am I, good people, hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!' cried the waving hand. Then as the slit in the shawl widened Frank saw that behind the energetic fist there was a huge open mouth, a little button of a nose, and two eyes which were so resolutely screwed up that it seemed as if the owner had made a resolution never under any circumstances to take the least notice of this new world into which it had been transported. Frank dropped his pipe and stood staring at this apparition.|$|E

A man could get his hand upon it and tear away {{one side of the}} neck; or he could place the muzzle of a rifle on it and blow away all the head in a flash.

Why should Losson be able to sleep when Simmons had to stay awake hour after hour, tossing and turning on the tapes, with the dull liver pain gnawing into his right side and his head throbbing and aching after Canteen? He thought over this for many nights, and the world became unprofitable to him. He even blunted his naturally fine appetite with beer and tobacco; and all the while the parrot talked at and made a mock of him.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} explores how an agriculture-based community <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River Watershed <b>of</b> Central Oregon {{responds to}} a series of water resource and environmental challenges, some associated with projected climate change, amid increasing pressure to change management practices to better accommodate environmental needs. A key part of this research assesses the collaborative capacity of the community to work together toward solutions to these challenges. This semi-arid watershed is vulnerable to a changing climate, with current climate models predicting significant changes in seasonal flows that will negatively impact existing water and agricultural systems and management practices. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> agriculture community <b>in</b> this area is currently struggling to deal with a multi-year drought situation and is under pressure from regulators and other Central Oregon stakeholders to change their management practices to better accommodate environmental needs. This research addresses the following questions: How is <b>the</b> agricultural community <b>in</b> this area responding to these challenges? What are their ideas for responding to the challenges such that the agriculture community maintains, or even improves, its viability, productiveness, and integrity of its values, while also balancing its needs against societal demand for stronger environmental protection?...|$|R
