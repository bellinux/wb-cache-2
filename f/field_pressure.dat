5000|$|Let’s first {{consider}} the simple {{model of a}} plasma supported by a magnetic field B in a uniform gravitational field g. To simplify matters, assume that the internal energy {{of the system is}} zero such that static equilibrium may be obtained from the balance of the gravitational force and the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>pressure</b> on the boundary of the plasma. The change in the potential is then given by the equation:.If two adjacent flux tubes lying opposite along the boundary (one fluid tube and one magnetic flux tube) are interchanged the volume element doesn’t change and the field lines are straight. Therefore, the magnetic potential doesn’t change, but the gravitational potential changes since it was moved along the z axis. Since the change in is negative the potential is decreasing. A decreasing potential indicates a more energetically favorable system and consequently an instability. The origin of this instability is in the J × B forces that occur at the boundary between the plasma and magnetic field. At this boundary there are slight ripple-like perturbations in which the low points must have a larger current than the high points since at the low point more gravity is being supported against the gravity. The difference in current allows negative and positive charge to build up along the opposite sides of the valley. The charge build-up produces an E field between the hill and the valley. The accompanying E × B drifts are {{in the same direction as}} the ripple, amplifying the effect. This is what is physically meant by the “interchange” motion.These interchange motions also occur in plasmas that are in a system with a large centrifugal force. In a cylindrically symmetric plasma device, radial electric fields cause the plasma to rotate rapidly in a column around the axis. Acting opposite to the gravity in the simple model, the centrifugal force moves the plasma outward where the ripple-like perturbations (sometimes called “flute” instabilities) occur on the boundary. This is important for the study of the magnetosphere in which the co-rotational forces are stronger than the opposing gravity of the planet. Effectively, the less dense “bubbles” inject radially inward in this configuration. Without gravity or an inertial force, interchange instabilities can still occur if the plasma is in a curved magnetic field. If we assume the potential energy to be purely magnetic then the change in potential energy is:. If the fluid is incompressible then the equation can be simplified into [...] Since (to maintain pressure balance), the above equation shows that if the system is unstable. Physically, this means that if the field lines are toward the region of higher plasma density then the system is susceptible to interchange motions. To derive a more rigorous stability condition, the perturbations that cause an instability must be generalized. The momentum equation for a resistive MHD is linearized and then manipulated into a linear force operator. Due to purely mathematical reasons, it is then possible to split the analysis into two approaches: the normal mode method and the energy method. The normal mode method essentially looks for the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies and summing the solutions to form the general solution. The energy method is similar to the simpler approach outlined above where is found for any arbitrary perturbation in order to maintain the condition [...] These two methods are not exclusive and can be used together to establish a reliable diagnosis of the stability.|$|E
40|$|As well as {{generating}} the far <b>field</b> <b>pressure,</b> which allows wave propagation in the cochlea, the vibration {{of an individual}} element of the basilar membrane (BM) will also generate a near <b>field</b> <b>pressure,</b> which increases its mass and gives rise to local longitudinal coupling.

The <b>pressure</b> <b>field</b> is obtained from numerically solving the Poisson equation, {{taken into account}} the axisymmetry of the flow.
