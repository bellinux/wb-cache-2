Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} episode, 2% may {{experience}} a further episode {{within the first}} month. After this, there is a 1% annual risk of recurrence.

5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> incidence of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.|$|E
5|$|However, because {{intravenous}} linezolid may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, {{people may be}} discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing the length of hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> acquisition cost—that is, {{it may be more}} expensive—than comparable antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|While health {{insurance}} premium costs have moderated, {{some of this}} is because of insurance policies that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> deductible, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums that shift costs from insurers to patients.

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
