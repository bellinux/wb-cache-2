50|$|Pharmacokinetic {{interactions}} (for example, {{mediated by}} CYP liver enzymes or transporter proteins) are different {{for the individual}} substances; for most triptans, they are mild to absent. <b>Eletriptan</b> blood plasma levels are increased by strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, and frovatriptan levels by CYP1A2 inhibitors such as fluvoxamine.|$|E

5000|$|Triptans are {{specific}} and selective agonists for the 5-HT1 receptors. Sumatriptan binds to 5-HT1D receptors, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D and <b>eletriptan</b> binds to 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors. Triptans {{are believed to}} exert their effects through vasoconstriction, leading to reduced carotid arterial circulation without affecting cerebral blood flow, peripheral neuronal inhibition, or inhibition of transmission through second order neurons of the trigeminocervical complex.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eletriptan</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 26, 2002, for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. [...] It is available only by prescription in the United States and Canada. It is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine. It is available in 20 mg and 40 mg strengths.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eletriptan</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with various diseases {{of the heart and}} circulatory system, such as angina pectoris, severe hypertension, and heart failure, as well as in patients that have had a stroke or heart attack. This is due to the unusual side effect of coronary vasoconstriction due to serotonin 5HT1B antagonism, which can precipitate a heart attack in those already at risk. It is also contraindicated in severe renal or hepatic impairment due to its extensive liver metabolism through CYP3A4.|$|E
50|$|All triptans have an indole {{structure}} {{identical to}} the neurotransmitter 5-HT. Classic triptan structure contain side chain on the indole ring, and a basic nitrogen in a similar distance from the indole structure. The main structural difference of the triptans is {{the position of the}} sulfonamide and the side chain attached to it (see figure 1 and table 1). Rizatriptan and zolmitriptan have instead of a sulfonamide a triazole and 2-oxazolidone respectively. Another exception to the classic structure is seen on <b>eletriptan</b> where the nitrogen-alkyl chain connected to the indole ring is replaced with a dimethyl-pyrrolidine, and in naratriptan where the nitrogen-alkyl chain is replaced with an 1-methyl-piperidine ring.|$|E
50|$|Sumatriptan was {{the pioneer}} drug in this class. The second generation's triptans such as zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, <b>eletriptan</b> and {{frovatriptan}} soon became available.Different triptans {{are available in}} different formulations and in different strengths (see table 2). They have been formulated as subcutaneous injections, oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal spray and as rectal suppositories. Delivery system of the triptans may {{play an important role}} in the onset of action. The selection of anti-migraine drug for patients depends on their symptoms. The first selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan, was first synthesized as a subcutaneous injection, then as an oral tablets and more recently as a nasal spray, it is also available in some countries as suppositories. The subcutaneous injection is the fastest way to stop a rapidly progressing migraine attacks. The sumatriptan nasal spray provides faster onset of action than the tablets but it produces a similar headache response at 2 hours. Some patients prefer the nasal spray as it works more rapidly than the tablets and does not have as many adverse effects as the subcutaneous injection. Nasal spray is although not suitable for all patients, because some patients experience bad taste and lack of consistency of response. Zolmitriptan was developed with the strategy to create a more lipophilic compound, with faster absorption and better ability to cross the blood brain barrier than sumatriptan. It is available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets and as nasal spray in some countries. Rizatriptan is available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets but naratriptan, almotriptan, <b>eletriptan</b> and frovatriptan are only available in tablets, for now.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eletriptan</b> has higher {{affinity}} for the receptor, which is probably {{a result of the}} bulky substituents of the structure. The amine is protonated at physiological pH condition, triggering better uptake. The uptake rate of the agonist is different depending on whether the amine in R2 is primary, secondary or tertiary but the latter seem to give the best results. For the R1 substituent an electron rich sulfonamide groups and amide group has shown the best results in receptor binding and activity. It has been observed that a relationship is between absorption and molecular size hence larger hydrophilic molecules tended to have poor absorption. A small R1 substituent is necessary to maintain the rapid oral bioavailability of triptans.|$|E

40|$|Objective. -To {{confirm the}} {{efficacy}} advantage of <b>eletriptan</b> 40 mg over sumatriptan 100 mg. Background. -Eletriptan 80 mg has demonstrated significantly greater efficacy {{when compared to}} both sumatriptan 50 mg and 100 mg in two studies. <b>Eletriptan</b> 40 mg demonstrated significantly greater efficacy than sumatriptan 100 mg in one previous trial. Methods. -Two thousand one hundred thirteen patients with a diagnosis of migraine according to International Headache Society criteria were randomized using a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group design, and treated for a single migraine attack with either <b>eletriptan</b> 40 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was 2 -hour headache response. Secondary endpoints included headache response rates at 1 hour, pain-free rates, absence of associated symptoms, functional response at 1 and 2 hours, and sustained headache response. Results. -Headache response rates at 2 hours postdose were significantly higher for <b>eletriptan</b> 40 mg (67 %) than for sumatriptan 100 mg (59 %; P<. 001) and placebo (26 %; P <. 0001). <b>Eletriptan</b> 40 mg consistently showed significant (P<. 01) efficacy over sumatriptan 100 mg across secondary clinical outcomes, including 1 -hour headache response; 2 -hour pain-free response; absence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia; functional improvement; use of rescue medication; treatment acceptability; and sustained headache response (P<. 05).

MethodsThe study employs data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparison of oral <b>eletriptan</b> (40 and 80 mg) and oral sumatriptan (50 and 100 mg). Analyses were undertaken using two composite measures of treatment outcome constructed to reflect the requirements of patients more comprehensively than the conventional efficacy indicator of headache response at 2 hours. On the cost side of the equation, reflecting the health-care system perspective of the analysis, drug costs for initial dosing, second dosing for nonresponse, and recurrence and rescue medication were taken into account.

40|$|Nociceptive axons and {{terminals}} in the supratentorial cerebral {{dura mater}} display an intense calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity. In an experimental migraine model, {{it has been}} shown that electrical stimulation of the rat trigeminal ganglion induced an increase in the lengths of CGRP-immunoreactive axons, increased size and number of pleomorphic axonal varicosities in the dura mater, and an increased number of c-jun and c-fos protein-expressing nerve cells in the trigeminal complex. We demonstrate the effect of the highly specific and moderately lipophilic serotonin agonist <b>eletriptan</b> (Pfizer) which prevents the effects of electrical stimulation in the dura mater. <b>Eletriptan</b> also affected the caudal trigeminal complex; it markedly reduced the numbers of the oncoprotein-expressing cells, mainly after stimulation and to some extent also in nonstimulated animals. <b>Eletriptan</b> also affected expression of CGRP in perikarya of trigeminal ganglion cells, insofar as the number of small nerve cells exhibiting a compact CGRP immunoreaction was decreased to one quarter of the original value. In all these respects, <b>eletriptan</b> acted in a similar way to sumatriptan, with the notable exception that <b>eletriptan</b> also blocked the stimulation-induced effects in the nucleus caudalis trigemini and the upper cervical spinal cord (trigeminal complex), whereas sumatriptan did not. It is concluded that <b>eletriptan,</b> acting on perikarya and both the peripheral and the central axon terminals of primary sensory neurons, exerts its antimigraine effect by an agonist action on 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors throughout the entire trigeminal system, probably by passing the blood-brain-barrier because of its lipophilic character...|$|E

The objective of this literature review was to summarize the available data on the pharmacoeconomics of <b>eletriptan</b> relative to other triptans. Articles meeting the following three criteria {{were included in the}} review: 1) contained pharmacoeconomic data on a marketed dose of eletriptan; 2) included data on at least one other comparator triptan; and 3) was in English. A MEDLINE® search yielded a total of eight studies (from the European Union [n= 5] and from the USA [n= 3]) across multiple regions. Seven of the studies examined the pharmacoeconomics of <b>eletriptan</b> relative to other triptans, and a further study examined the health care costs of <b>eletriptan</b> 40 mg versus sumatriptan 100 mg. <b>Eletriptan</b> 40 mg was among a group of triptans, including rizatriptan 10 mg and almotriptan 12. 5 mg, demonstrating the greatest cost-effectiveness. This result held across different definitions of efficacy (2 hours pain-free, sustained pain-free, and sustained pain-free with no adverse events) and also held when cost-effectiveness models accounted for second doses and use of rescue medication, management of adverse events, and productivity loss, in addition to drug acquisition costs. Only limited head-to-head comparator data were available. The majority of pharmacoeconomic studies utilized the same set of efficacy and/or tolerability data, and indirect costs were rarely included {{despite the fact that the}} majority of per capita migraine costs are attributable to indirect costs. In summary, although the market is now dominated by generics, <b>eletriptan</b> 40 mg is among the most clinically and cost-effective oral triptans available for the management of acute migraine.

The low value of the RSD expressed the good repeatability and precision of the method. Experimental design and a response surface method were used to test robustness of the analytical procedure and to evaluate the effect of variation of the method parameters, namely the mobile phase composition, pH and temperature. They showed small deviations from the method setting. The good recovery and low RSD confirm the suitability of the proposed RP HPLC method for the routine determination of <b>eletriptan</b> hydrobromide and its impurity UK 120. 413 in Relpax ® tables...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the regulation of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) promoter activity in primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglia neurons. A viral vector was used to circumvent the potential complication of examining only a small subpopulation of cells in the heterogeneous cultures. Infection with high titers of recombinant adenovirus containing 1. 25 kb of the rat CGRP promoter linked to the beta-galactosidase reporter gene (AdCGRP-lacZ) yielded expression in about 50 % of the CGRP-expressing neurons. The CGRP-lacZ reporter gene was preferentially expressed in neurons, with 91 % co-expression with endogenous CGRP. In contrast, an adenoviral vector containing a CMV-IacZ reporter was predominantly expressed in non-neuronal cells, with only 29 % co-expression with CGRP. We then asked whether the CGRP promoter in the viral vector could be regulated by serotonin receptor type 1 (5 -HT 1) agonists. Promoter activity was decreased two- to threefold by treatment with five 5 -HTIB/D agonists, including the triptan drugs sumatriptan, <b>eletriptan,</b> and rizatriptan that are used for migraine treatment. As controls, CMV promoter activity was not affected, and 5 -HTIB/D receptor antagonists blocked the repression caused by sumatriptan and <b>eletriptan.</b> Thus, adenoviral gene transfer {{can be used in}} trigeminal ganglia neurons for studying the mechanisms of triptan drug action on CGRP synthesis.

40|$|Migraine {{headache}} is {{a highly}} prevalent chronic, episodic condition. The direct and indirect costs of migraine headache have a tremendous economic impact in the US. Research has shown that serotonin (5 HT 1 B/D) receptor agonists reduce healthcare costs, improve health-related QOL (HR-QOL), decrease migraine disability and keep patients effective in the workplace. The purpose of this manuscript {{is to examine the}} cost effectiveness of oral 5 HT 1 B/D receptor agonists for the treatment of migraine headache. In general, 5 HT 1 B/D receptor agonists are associated with increases in direct healthcare costs; however, they are also associated with reductions in the indirect costs associated with migraine headache. Therefore, it appears that the relatively high acquisition cost of these medications is offset and, as a class, these medications appear to be cost effective and demonstrate net benefits from the societal perspective. Based on meta-analyses in which data on <b>eletriptan</b> were not available, it appears that within the class, almotriptan and rizatriptan are the most cost effective. In a prospective study comparing <b>eletriptan</b> with sumatriptan, it appears that the former may be more cost effective than the latter. Additional investigations are needed to further explore the application of the friction-cost approach and QALYs to cost-effectiveness analyses of this class of medication.

40|$|Prescription drugs {{abuse is}} an {{important}} cause of mortality, morbidity, and healthcare expenditure worldwide. Chronic migraineurs frequently overuse triptans (almotriptan, <b>eletriptan,</b> frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan), which are selective 5 -HT 1 B-D agonists and specific anti-migraine drugs. Routine methods to monitor triptan overuse in clinical settings are currently lacking. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the accuracy of hair analysis in detecting triptan overuse. One hundred and fifty migraineurs were diagnosed as triptan overusers or occasionally users according to the criteria of The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3 rd edition (beta version), calculating the doses of triptans taken in the last 3 months from the headache diary. For every patient a nuchal hair sample was collected and 3 centimetres-long proximal section was analysed by LC-MS/MS with a validated method. The accuracy of hair analysis in detecting triptan overuse was analysed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis; the cut-off of hair concentrations discriminating overusers from occasionally users were determined with Liu's method. The accuracy of hair analysis in distinguishing occasionally users from overusers was high for almotriptan (ROC AUC = 0. 9013), <b>eletriptan</b> (ROC AUC = 0. 8305), rizatriptan (ROC AUC = 0. 9250) and sumatriptan (ROC AUC = 0. 9015). The cut-off of hair concentrations discriminating overusers from occasionally users were: 526 pg/mg for almotriptan (sensitivity = 77...|$|E
30|$|Migraine is {{a primary}} {{headache}} which causes pulsate, one-sided headache, and common symptoms including vomiting, nausea, and environmental sensitivity which often last 4 – 48  h (Kristoffersen and Lundqvist 2014). Migraine has four possible phases including prodrome (hours or days before the headache), aura (right before headache), pain (main headache), and postdrome (following effects of headache) (Lauritzen 1994). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and acetaminophen are effective treatments, but in case of severe and chronic migraine, triptans family such as sumatriptan, <b>eletriptan,</b> zolmitriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, frovatriptan, and rizatriptan must be used (Gilmore and Michael 2011; Wang et al. 2007).|$|E
