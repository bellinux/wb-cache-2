5|$|After {{ten minutes}} {{interval}} {{the ball was}} again put in play, this time being kicked off by the Cliftons. The rest period <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> stiffened the Cliftons, for the Academy making a vigorous spurt got the ball thru them, and Street, following it up well, scored a touchdown for the Academy.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Orlowski, a {{frequent}} Wikipedia critic and writer for The Register—a British technology news and opinion website—criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded Wikia and for appointing {{him to the}} Wikipedia Arbitration Committee after Essjay <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> admitted his previously claimed academic and professional credentials were false. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions betrayed a dangerous community mindset within Wikipedia.|$|E
5|$|Critics of the Illinois Militia, mostly {{members of}} the Regular Army, {{attacked}} their behavior at the debacle at Stillman' Run. They began {{to refer to the}} battle at Old Man's Creek as the Battle of Stillman's Run, because Stillman <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> fled with the panicked militia.|$|E

5|$|Manning {{said she}} gave WikiLeaks a video, in late March 2010, of the Granai airstrike in Afghanistan. The airstrike {{occurred}} on May 4, 2009, {{in the village}} of Granai, Afghanistan, killing 86 to 147 Afghan civilians. The video was never published; Julian Assange said in March 2013 that Daniel Domscheit-Berg had taken it with him when he left WikiLeaks and <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|Many {{details of}} West Corums post-Navy career are unknown, but {{mentions}} in shipping reports in contemporary newspapers offer hints at her activities. The New York Times reports on West Corums impending arrival from Bordeaux in October 1919, and from Antwerp in May and August 1920. By November 1920, West Corum <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> begun sailing to Argentine ports.|$|E

5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, hoping that he might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in {{the bones}} of Majungasaurus. Scientists examined the remains of at least 21 individuals and discovered four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had been studied in large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had been examined in this manner. No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was a phalanx (toe bone) of the foot, which <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} {{shortage of}} coinage {{in all of}} the colonies prompted Massachusetts to establish a mint on May 27, 1652, and begin production of coins from its silver reserves. This act solved a practical problem, but the colony had no authority to do so from the crown. Although this did not become an issue while Endecott was governor, it eventually became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> ceased operations around 1682.|$|E

5|$|After this {{successful}} {{series of}} patrols, Davis {{was ordered to}} conduct only one patrol a day {{in order to minimize}} the risk to him. The order had previously been sent on December 1, but Davis <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> ignored it. Both the Air Force and Davis' family had growing concerns that Chinese and Soviet pilots would be gunning for Davis, given his success and fame. By this point, Davis had 12 victories, and the second-highest scoring aces each had 6 victories. Davis was averaging one victory for three missions.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's former bandmates, Lennon {{initially}} {{agreed to}} take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner Yoko Ono, as Harrison <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> stipulated. Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a result of this agreement and left New York in a rage two days before the concerts. Starr's commitment had never been in question, and he interrupted the filming of his movie Blindman in Almeria, Spain, in order to attend. Paul McCartney declined to take part, however, citing the bad feelings caused by the Beatles' legal problems on their break-up.|$|E
5|$|At a {{literary}} salon in January 1909, Pound met the novelist Olivia Shakespear {{and her daughter}} Dorothy, who became his wife in 1914. Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to her former lover W. B. Yeats, in Pound's view the greatest living poet. Pound had sent Yeats a copy of A Lume Spento the previous year, {{before he left for}} Venice, and Yeats <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> found it charming. The men became close friends, although Yeats was older by 20 years.|$|E

5|$|During Boone's absence, {{his wife}} and {{children}} (except for Jemima) had returned to North Carolina, assuming he was dead. Upon his return to Boonesborough, some of the men expressed doubts about Boone's loyalty, since after surrendering the salt-making party, he <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> lived quite happily among the Shawnees for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnees across the Ohio River, and then by helping to successfully defend Boonesborough against a 10-day siege led by Blackfish, which began on September 7, 1778.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, DoD {{officials}} {{met with}} the White House Military Office to discuss the program's future; the Pentagon <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> wanted to terminate the VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems. The White House overruled a decision to cancel; the program was effectively placed on hold while options were considered. In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010. The {{second phase of the}} development, VH-71B (Increment 2) was expected to start entering service in 2017.|$|E
5|$|In July 1915, the Truxtun {{was on its}} way to Alaska when {{it broke}} down and was unable to {{continue}} its mission. Initially, the blame fell on Callaghan, who <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> ordered incorrect parts for the condenser. He was suspended from duty and ordered to appear before a court-martial. Subsequent investigation, however, found that another man was responsible for the error and Callaghan received a full acquittal and was reinstated. A few months later, he was appointed as commanding officer of the Truxtun, but the stress of his trial appeared to have left its mark—at the age of 25 years, his hair had already turned gray.|$|E

5|$|Kovalainen's car <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> been {{fitted with}} {{mismatched}} tyres {{at the front}} of the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun in the opposite direction to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Monday {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, Charles again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York in charge of operations.|$|E
5|$|Morris died in 1896, and {{the health}} of the devastated Burne-Jones {{declined}} substantially. In 1898 he suffered an attack of influenza, and <b>had</b> <b>apparently</b> recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died on 17June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an artist had been so honoured. Burne-Jones was buried in the churchyard at St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean, a place he knew through summer family holidays.|$|E
