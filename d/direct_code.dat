40|$|Motivation: International {{sequencing}} {{efforts are}} creating huge nucleotide databases, {{which are used}} in searching applications to locate sequences homologous to a query sequence. In such applications, it is desirable that databases are stored compactly, that sequences can be accessed independently of {{the order in which}} they were stored, and that data can be rapidly retrieved from secondary storage, since disk costs are often the bottleneck in searching. Results: We present a purpose-built <b>direct</b> <b>coding</b> scheme for fast retrieval and compression of genomic nucleotide data. The scheme is lossless, readily integrated with sequence search tools, and does not require a model. <b>Direct</b> <b>coding</b> gives good compression and allows faster retrieval than with either uncompressed data or data compressed by other methods, thus yielding significant improvements in search times for high-speed homology search tools.

40|$|To {{assess how}} future {{progress}} in gravitational microlensing computation at high optical depth {{will rely on}} both hardware and software solutions, we compare a direct inverse ray-shooting code implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU) with both a widely-used hierarchical tree code on a single-core CPU, and a recent implementation of a parallel tree code suitable for a CPU-based cluster supercomputer. We examine {{the accuracy of the}} tree codes through comparison with a <b>direct</b> <b>code</b> over a much wider range of parameter space than has been feasible before. We demonstrate that all three codes present comparable accuracy, and choice of approach depends on considerations relating to the scale and nature of the microlensing problem under investigation. On current hardware, there is little difference in the processing speed of the single-core CPU tree code and the GPU <b>direct</b> <b>code,</b> however the recent plateau in single-core CPU speeds means the existing tree code is no longer {{able to take advantage of}} Moore's law-like increases in processing speed. Instead, we anticipate a rapid increase in GPU capabilities in the next few years, which is advantageous to the <b>direct</b> <b>code.</b> We suggest that progress in other areas of astrophysical computation may benefit from a transition to GPUs through the use of " brute force" algorithms, rather than attempting to port the current best solution directly to a GPU language - for certain classes of problems, the simple implementation on GPUs may already be no worse than an optimised single-core CPU version...|$|E

40|$|With the {{continuing}} {{growth of the}} Internet and network protocols, {{there is a need}} for Protocol Development Environments. Simulation environments like ns and OPNET require protocol code to be rewritten in a discrete event model. <b>Direct</b> <b>Code</b> Execution Environments (DCEE) solve the Verification and Validation problems by supporting the execution of unmodified protocol code in a controlled environment. Open Network Emulator (ONE) is a system supporting <b>Direct</b> <b>Code</b> Execution in a parallel environment- allowing unmodified protocol code to run on top of a parallel simulation layer, capable of simulating complex network topologies. Traditional approaches to the problem of Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) broadly fall into two categories. Conservative approaches allow processing of events only after it has been asserted that the event handling would not result in a causality error. Optimistic approaches allow for causality errors and support means of restoring state – i. e., rollback. All standard approaches to the problem of PDES are either flawed by their assumption of existing event patterns in the system or cannot be applied to ONE due to their restricted analysis on simplified models like queues and Petri-nets.

40|$|The <b>direct</b> mode <b>coding</b> in the bi-predictive {{pictures}} (B-pictures) can efficiently {{improve the}} performance of bi-predictive coding, because it exploits the temporal correlation by bi-directional prediction from both forward and backward reference pictures, and meanwhile {{it does not require}} any bits for coding the motion vectors. Accordingly, how to accurately calculate the motion vectors in terms of <b>direct</b> mode <b>coding</b> is very important to obtain better prediction values. In other words, it is more desirable to obtain the true motion vectors, because the derived motion vectors need not be <b>coded.</b> The traditional <b>direct</b> mode <b>coding</b> usually derives the motion vector of the current block by scaling the motion vector of the co-located block in the subsequent reference picture. It {{is based on the assumption}} that the near blocks would have the same motion trajectory. In this paper, we present an improved method based on combining motion vector tracking technique and spatial motion vector prediction technique. The proposed method can accurately calculate the motion vectors for the <b>direct</b> mode <b>coding...</b>|$|R

40|$|The primary {{issue with}} {{developing}} new networking protocols is testing how the protocol will behave when deployed {{on a large}} scale; of particular interest is how it will interact with existing protocols. Testing a protocol using a network simulator has drawbacks. First, the protocol must be written for the simulator and then rewritten for actual deployment. Aside from the additional work, this allows for software bugs to be introduced between testing and implementation. More importantly, there are correctness issues. Since both the new and existing protocols must be specially written for the simulator, and not actual real-world implementations, the question remains if the behavior observed and, specifically, the interactions between the protocols are valid. <b>Direct</b> <b>code</b> execution environments solve the correctness problem, but there {{is the loss of}} control that a simulator provides. Our solution is to create an environment that allows <b>direct</b> <b>code</b> execution to occur on top of a network simulator.
