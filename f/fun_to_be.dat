500|$|Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave The Flash episode a score 7.5 out of 10. He was {{critical}} of the episode's [...] "wonky pacing and story progression" [...] and given its [...] "legitimate two-part storyline" [...] was disappointed it was not more cohesive than the previous year's crossover. He felt the [...] crossover [...] "had a fairly rocky start" [...] and wondered whether Arrows characters were actually necessary to the storyline. Even so, Scheden said, [...] "there {{was a lot of}} <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> had in seeing both teams cross paths and grapple with an increasingly strange world of heroes and villains" [...] and was looking forward to a focused conclusion.

Fitzpatrick added that he was [...] "still not crazy about whatever’s going on with “Lucy” and her terrible ghost effects", and felt the Aida story was being pushed aside in favor of a seemingly corporate-mandated Ghost Rider focus. Terri Schwartz at IGN gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] 8.5 out of 10, praising the executive producers for their timing in bringing the season's different groups of characters together in this episode. Schwartz praised the car chase, the handling of the relationship between Simmons and Fitz in regards to his keeping Aida a secret from her, and the use of James, taking advantage of the audience's familiarity of him from the previous season.|$|E
500|$|Entren Los Que Quieran {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics.

[...] Mariano Prunes of Allmusic gave Entren Los Que Quieran three and a half stars out of five, and felt that while the album was strong overall, the shock value employed in the group's earlier records had become less impactful: [...] "As the album progresses, while the beats remain strong and the lyrics clever, this maximum-impact approach tends to eventually exhaust itself." [...] Jasmine Garsd of NPR praised the album and referred to the song [...] "Latinoamérica" [...] as [...] "a gorgeous ode to Latinos everywhere". [...] Garsd commented on the band's appeal to Latin American listeners, explaining [...] "They are fighters who endure and struggle against the very real horrors of Latin America.

It is said that he does not plan or do what people expect of him, is <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> around and could be running away from life. A writer for the BBC said that he lives [...] "like there's no tomorrow", and makes decisions {{based on the results of}} a coin flip. The coin, described as [...] "lucky", is inspired by the Bollywood film Sholay, in which two friends make decisions based on the flip of a coin, though one friend does not know that both sides of the coin are the same. Ganatra stated in an interview on This Morning that he did not think that the two sides of AJ's coin were the same. Sharma described AJ as [...] "the clown who loves to play" [...] and [...] "a little bit of a hippy", saying [...] "he's got a real wheeler-dealer, Del Boy aspect to his character."

During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's a gleam in her eye and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, it was <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E

He summarised, [...] "Limited options keep Destruction Derby out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun." [...] Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground stated that [...] "the beauty of the game" [...] is the strategy involved in making [...] "calculated strikes" [...] against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, [...] "If you go all {{out and try to}} make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds." [...] He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode [...] "is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either Wipeout or Ridge Racer", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were [...] "most <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> had" [...] in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, [...] "Destruction Derby is a winner in every capacity."
