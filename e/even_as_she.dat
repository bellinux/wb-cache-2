5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When a mystic smuggles himself out of India, Scully and Doggett give chase as his murderous spree starts terrorising two families in suburban Washington, D.C. But Scully soon comes upon a crisis of faith when she realises how dissimilar her techniques are from those of Mulder, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> tries to be the believer.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough {{for two or three}} weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald's {{visits to}} Long Island's south shore and his {{experience}} attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsbys setting. Today, {{there are a}} number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party. Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success. Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich. In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> led him toward everything he despised.|$|E
25|$|In 1142, Geoffrey {{was asked}} by Matilda for {{assistance}} but refused; he had become more interested in Normandy. Following the capture of Avranches, Mortain and Cherbourg, Rouen surrendered to him in 1144 and he then had himself anointed as Duke of Normandy. In exchange for Gisors, he was formally recognised by Louis VII. However, Geoffrey still didn't assist Matilda <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{was on the verge}} of defeat. After Geoffrey's investment as duke, further rebellion occurred in Anjou, including Geoffrey's younger brother, Helie, demanding Maine. It was during this period of Angevin unrest that Geoffrey then dropped the title of duke and formally invested his son Henry as Duke of Normandy in 1150, though still dominating Norman affairs.|$|E
25|$|Wehrmacht officer Heinrich Gimpel astonishes his 10-year-old daughter, Alicia, with {{a secret}} that has been hidden from her all her life: the family is Jewish. He {{explains}} that the Gimpels, friends Walther and Esther Stutzman, and their extended families all belong to those remnants of Jews who now survive by hiding in plain sight within the very society that wants them dead. Now old enough, by family tradition, to be trusted with this life-or-death deception, Alicia is obliged to hide the truth from her friends, her classmates, and even her younger sisters <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is forced to regard her school's racist curriculum from a new perspective that leaves her sick and angry over all the anti-Semitic propaganda that she always learned and parroted without question.|$|E

25|$|In Japan, it is {{generally}} {{believed to have been}} influenced by Beheiren's anti-Vietnam War activists in the late 1960s and Konica's advertisement in 1971. A more colorful account of this practice claims it was influenced by the American figure skater Janet Lynn during the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Hokkaidō. She fell during a free-skate period, but continued to smile <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat on the ice. Though she placed third in the competition, her cheerful diligence and persistence resonated with many Japanese viewers. Lynn became an overnight foreign celebrity in Japan. A peace activist, Lynn frequently flashed the V sign when she was covered in Japanese media, and she is credited by some Japanese for having popularized its use since the 1970s in amateur photographs.|$|E
25|$|The {{battles between}} the Kimpanzu and Kinlaza {{continued}} plunging the kingdom into a chaos not known in centuries. The fighting {{between the two}} lineages led to the sack of São Salvador in 1678. Ironically, the capital built by the pact of Mpemba and Mbata was burned to the ground, not by the Portuguese or rival African nations but by its very heirs. The city and hinterland around Mbanza Kongo became depopulated. The population dispersed into the mountain top fortresses of the rival kings. These were the Mountain of Kibangu east of the capital and the fortress of the Águas Rosadas, a line founded in the 1680s from descendants of Kinlaza and Kimpanzu, the region of Mbula, or Lemba where a line founded by the Kinlaza pretender, Pedro III ruled; and Lovota, a district in southern Soyo that sheltered a Kimpanzu lineage whose head was D Suzanna de Nóbrega. Finally, D Ana Afonso de Leão founded her own center on the Mbidizi River at Nkondo and guided her junior kinsmen to reclaim the country, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sought to reconcile the hostile factions.|$|E
25|$|After her {{quest to}} win Scott ends, Greenlee turns her {{attention}} to Ryan Lavery. Ryan {{is in love with}} Gillian Andrassy, but pursues a sexual relationship with Greenlee. During this time, Greenlee meets fellow schemer Leo du Pres, and the fast friends go so far to make a bet to see if Leo can take Becca's virginity. Greenlee continues to pursue Ryan <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> and Leo are growing closer. Greenlee and Leo would eventually make love, but both insist that it did not mean anything and they go back to their pursuit of Ryan and Becca. When Ryan steals $3 million from his internet company, Greenlee covers for him, by borrowing the money from loan shark Wade Randall. Wade attempts to use his leverage with Greenlee by threatening her grandfather, hoping to have Greenlee convince her grandfather to help him launder his dirty money. When she learns that Ryan took the money to help Gillian rescue Jake Martin from war-torn Chechnya, she turns him in to the police cuts her ties with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose sister Glegg {{should call}} her money in; it 'ud be very awkward {{for you to}} have to raise five hundred pounds now," [...] said Mrs. Tulliver to her husband that <b>evening,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> took a plaintive review of the day.|$|R
60|$|That <b>evening,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had dreaded, her {{grandfather}} stole away, {{and did not}} come back until the night was far spent.

25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E
500|$|... "The Getaway" [...] is {{the fourth}} season finale of the American {{television}} drama series Dexter, and the 48th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Showtime on December 13, 2009. In the episode, Dexter goes {{to great lengths to}} stop Arthur, who now knows Dexter's true identity. Meanwhile, Debra learns the truth about Dexter's mother, the homicide division closes in on the Trinity Killer, and Rita reaffirms her support for Dexter, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> acknowledges his hidden demons.|$|E
500|$|According to Drew Grant of The New York Observer, Claire's season-long storyline {{was similar}} to the real life efforts of United States Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's to legislate an end to {{military}} sexual assault. Based upon the 4-episode preview, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times says that in season 2 Claire [...] "is still ruthlessly pursuing her own agenda as well as her husband’s. She remains an enigma <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> reveals more and more disturbing secrets from her past." [...] Claire remains composed and stylish with or without her husband and plays the press with aplomb.|$|E
5000|$|In a twist {{departing from}} the {{standard}} superhero formula, White Dragon is a narcissist, forever worried about her good looks, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she's</b> fighting with Feather, a blind assassin nicknamed [...] "Chicken Feathers" [...] because of his propensity for using chicken feathers as his calling card.|$|R
60|$|One <b>evening,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was {{studying}} in the parlour, her head buried in her hands, she heard new {{voices in the}} kitchen speaking.

500|$|It {{is worth}} pondering what {{the title of}} Mariah Carey's {{eleventh}} studio album could refer to. Emancipation, maybe, in a nod to her 2005 comeback album, The Emancipation of Mimi; or perhaps {{the energy of the}} original equation, a statement that Carey still has what it takes to party all night at the age of 37, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> describes herself as [...] "eternally 12". Then again, she could just be identifying herself alongside Einstein as a fellow genius. Either way, 'E=MC²' finds Carey loopier than ever, embracing her own larger-than-life image with gusto: Mariah Carey Squared indeed.|$|E
500|$|At the {{bachelor}} party, Bob Vance refuses a lap dance, so Michael volunteers. During the lap dance, Michael becomes {{concerned that this}} is cheating on Jan Levenson (Melora Hardin) and brings the show to an abrupt close. Dwight decides to get the [...] "three hours of work" [...] they paid the stripper for by having her answer calls. After consulting with [...] "Ben Franklin" [...] and the stripper, Michael decides to tell Jan about the lap dance. However, Jan is less upset by his unfaithfulness to her than by his violation of company policy. Relieved, Michael makes lovey dovey talk to Jan <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> suggests firing him over the incident.|$|E
500|$|I Never Liked You is {{a graphic}} novel by Canadian {{cartoonist}} Chester Brown. [...] The story first ran between 1991 and 1993 {{under the title}} Fuck, in issues [...] of Brown's comic book Yummy Fur; published in book form by Drawn and Quarterly in 1994. [...] It deals with the teenage Brown's introversion and difficulty talking to others, especially members of the opposite sex—including his mother, to whom {{he is unable to}} express affection <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lies dying in the hospital. [...] The story has minimal dialogue and is sparsely narrated. [...] The artwork is amongst the simplest in Brown's body of work—some pages consist only of a single small panel.|$|E
50|$|After {{arriving}} at the hotel, Yella discovers she has no deposit for her room. She gives the hotel manager the cash from her father.

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] was mixed. Keri Mason from Billboard believed that tracks like [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] made the Teenage Dream album [...] "get heavier sonically and lyrically, with a boom-boom-pow electro punch". Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole found the singer to be virtually less sympathetic than her former lover. This being because her [...] "put-downs are alternately pedantic" [...] and hypocritical <b>even,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> finds offense to his substance use before foreplay, but was singing about blacking out and hooking up on {{another of the}} album's tracks – [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)". Chris Richards of The Washington Post had a similar reaction, finding it impossible to take any of the cautionary advice [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] offered, as Perry had just bragged about being very drunk on the very same record.|$|E
500|$|<b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{was being}} built, Furious was {{modified}} {{with a large}} hangar capable of housing ten aircraft on her forecastle replacing the forward turret. A 160-foot (49m) flight deck was built along its roof. Aircraft were flown off and, less successfully, landed on this deck. Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun trialled, {{it was not long}} before Furious returned to her builders for further modifications. In November 1917 the rear turret was replaced by a 300-foot (91m) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar. Her funnel and superstructure remained intact, with a narrow strip of decking around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks. Turbulence from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden. Her 18-inch guns were reused on the [...] monitors [...] and [...] during the war.|$|E
500|$|<b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{continued}} to win against fellow Americans in 1982 and 1983, however, she was slumping and falling behind her international competition. [...] She set no new international records, and was increasingly frustrated {{with her own}} performances. [...] At the 1982 World Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador, she finished a distant third in both the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley events against her East German competition, and failed to place in the third event {{in which she was}} entered. [...] At the 1983 U.S. Long-Course Championships in Fresno, California, she finished five seconds slower than her own American record in the 400-meter individual medley and finished second behind Mary T. Meagher in the 200-meter butterfly. [...] At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, held later the same month, she likewise won her two signature events in the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley, but did not approach her own personal bests.|$|E
60|$|And one <b>evening,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{went from}} the edge of the town into the country, stones came flying at her. Then the passion of shame and anger surpassed her.
