25|$|In turn, Masters demands $30,000 in <b>front</b> <b>money,</b> {{which is}} three times the {{authorized}} agency limit for buy money. To get the cash, Chance persuades Vukovich to aid him in robbing Thomas Ling, a man whom Ruth previously told Chance is bringing $50,000 cash to purchase stolen diamonds. Chance and Vukovich intercept Ling {{at the train station}} and seize the cash in an industrial area. Ling's cover people follow them, though, open fire and accidentally shoot Ling. Chance and Vukovich try to evade them through the streets, freeways and even one of the flood control channels, before a final escape by going the wrong way on the freeway. The next day, the end of their daily briefing includes an FBI bulletin that Ling was its undercover agent, kidnapped, robbed and murdered while on a sting operation. Only a generic description of the assailants and their vehicle is given. While Chance and Vukovich did not kill Ling, Vukovich is nonetheless consumed by guilt, while Chance is apathetic and focused solely on getting Masters. Unable to persuade Chance to come clean about their role in Ling's death, Vukovich meets with Grimes, who advises him to turn himself in and testify against Chance in exchange for a lighter sentence. Vukovich refuses to implicate his partner.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityHigh-fidelity {{simulation}} {{is being}} used more commonly in nursing education practice laboratories and the increased use is applauded by most faculties. Simulation is a method of evaluating learning objectives that engages the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains of learning. Simulation requires big investments {{on the part of}} a college or hospital, not just in up <b>front</b> <b>money,</b> but in faculty/staff time and laboratory space. Therefore, central to simulation in nursing is the evaluation of simulation and its addition to the college's or hospital's curriculum. To date there has not been a systematic study exploring the relationship between the use of high-fidelity simulation and a student's clinical judgment skills and to this point there has not been an effective tool to assess clinical judgment in a simulation setting. This paper will consolidate and present the current findings along with identifying strengths and weaknesses of the simulation experience in order to identify any gaps in research so areas for future studies can be identified...|$|E

50|$|In 1989, a new {{community}} owned team named the Calgary Strikers purchased the CSL franchise under coach Tony Towers, {{but the team}} did little better than the previous season {{on and off the}} field. They earned an 8-3-15 record and by September injuries and player availability due to finances affected results especially the final away game in which only twelve players traveled. The team was in a back and forth competition for third place with Winnipeg most of the season. They earned it with a late season surge of three wins including their final game 2-3 over Winnipeg. Their third-place finish meant they got the last Western Division playoff spot in the Play-In Round against the Edmonton Brickmen who defeated them 1-3 and 0-0 to end their season.
