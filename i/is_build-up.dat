5000|$|Pick's {{disease is}} a term {{that can be used}} in two {{different}} ways. It has traditionally been used as a term for a group of neurodegenerative diseases with symptoms attributable to frontal and temporal lobe dysfunction. Common symptoms that are noticed early are personality and emotional changes, as well as deterioration of language. This condition is now more commonly called frontotemporal dementia by professionals, and the use of Pick's disease as a clinical diagnosis has fallen out of fashion. The second use of the term (and the one now used among professionals) is to mean a specific pathology that is one of the causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. These two uses have previously led to confusion among professionals and patients and so its use should be restricted to the specific pathological subtype described below. It is also known as Pick disease and PiD (not to be confused with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or Parkinson's disease (PD)).

Due to the potential function threatening defects, the quality of these protein subunits is constantly under tight control by specialized proteins. The recognition and selective removal of defective mitochondrial proteins is carried out by specific mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteases.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{elliptic}} flow (v_ 2) of ϕ-mesons {{in the framework}} of a multi phase transport (AMPT) model at LHC energy. In the realms of AMPT model we observe ϕ-mesons at intermediate transverse momentum (p_T) deviate from the previously observed (at RHIC) particle type grouping of v_ 2 according to the number of quark content i. e, baryons and mesons. Recent results from the ALICE Collaboration have shown that ϕ-meson and proton v_ 2 has a similar trend, possibly indicating that particle type grouping might be due to the mass of the particles and not the quark content. A stronger radial boost at LHC compared to RHIC seems to offer a consistent explanation to such observation. However, recalling that ϕ-mesons decouple from the hadronic medium before additional radial flow <b>is</b> <b>build-up</b> in the hadronic phase, similar pattern in ϕ-meson and proton v_ 2 may not be due to radial flow alone. Our study reveals that models incorporating ϕ-meson production from KK̅ fusion in the hadronic rescattering phase also predict a comparable magnitude of ϕ-meson and proton v_ 2 particularly in the intermediate region of p_T. Whereas, v_ 2 of ϕ-mesons created in the partonic phase is in agreement with quark-coalescence motivated baryon-meson grouping of hadron v_ 2. This observation seems to provide a plausible alternative interpretation for the apparent mass-like behaviour of ϕ-meson v_ 2. We have also observed a violation of hydrodynamical mass ordering between proton and ϕ-meson v_ 2 further supporting that ϕ-mesons are negligibly affected by the collective radial flow in the hadronic phase due to the small in-medium hadronic interaction cross sections.

40|$|Amyloid fibrils {{are long}} fibrillar homopolymers of self-assembled proteins. They can be formed by {{essentially}} any polypeptide, but {{are of particular}} interest because of their occurrence in several incurable and debilitating human diseases, e. g. Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A central pathological event in AD <b>is</b> <b>build-up</b> of amyloid fibrils by the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. This thesis describes my {{work in the field}} of biochemistry and biophysics to understand the molecular mechanisms and events that lead to amyloid fibril formation in general, and Aβ assembly in particular. One of the most widely used fluorescent dyes in amyloid research is thioflavin-T (ThT); despite this, its fibril-binding and fluorescent properties are not completely understood at a molecular level. In this thesis, I show that the binding of ThT to fibrils, and consequently its fluorescence, can vary depending on fibril morphology, and that ThT exhibits significant self-quenching at high binding density. These findings are important contributions to the understanding of how ThT functions as an amyloid dye, and can therefore help in the experimental design of biophysical assays involving ThT fluorescence. In addition, I also detail the use of YOYO- 1 for amyloid fibril detection. Biogenesis of Aβ occurs in and around lipid-rich environments, and lipids have been proposed to have a central role in AD pathology. In this thesis I have investigated fibril-lipid interactions. I show that DOPC lipid vesicles augment Aβ fibril formation, and that they do so through interaction with growing fibrils, thereby reinforcing secondary mechanisms such as fibril fragmentation and secondary nucleation. This demonstrates how, on a molecular level, lipids may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, I have studied amyloid fibril formation by the hormone insulin, a blood-glucose regulating protein used in treatment of diabetes. I demonstrate that mildly acidic solutions and presence of alcohols as co-solvents has a retarding effect on fibril formation. This has strong implications on the purification and long-term stability of pharmaceutical insulin...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{research}} initiatives into automated {{detection of}} archaeological objects were focussed on feature engineering to detect individual object types. These {{methods have been}} criticised for their lack in accuracy which is mostly caused by their inability to capture the variability within an object type and the objects’ appearance across different land cover types. Recently, rather than further optimizing features, research has shifted towards feature learning which offers more flexibility. This shift was triggered by the overwhelming successes of deep learning (shown for e. g. self-driving cars and medical imagery). A {{deep convolutional neural network}} <b>is</b> <b>build-up</b> out of many layers and learns features from images of known objects which are fed to the network. In the early layers of a network only basic abstractions such as lines and edges are learned and as the deeper layers are reached the features get more refined and are able to extract the key characteristics of the object type. This process is very similar to how a human learns although there are some important advantages to the structure of deep networks. For example, they can be designed to incorporate different types of remote sensor data and can hence internally compare this variety of data. In his manner a network will quickly identify obvious false positives and adapt the weights of the layers accordingly. Another important point is that a network can fully appreciate the small variation of pixel values without any image enhancements. For LiDAR data this effect can be demonstrated with a network that identifies a slope in the first layers of the network and later on learns that the slope direction and local relief are important features for a specific object type. The above listed approaches just scratch the surface of the wide range of possible methods to using deep learning for aerial archaeology. In the end, the shift in research is mainly driven by the far-future concept of a national model which automatically retrains with newly acquired remote sensing data to allow for new discoveries that can further improve the networks...|$|E
