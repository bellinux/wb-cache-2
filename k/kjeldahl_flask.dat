Similar to the reaction flask, the distillation flasks usually have only one narrow neck and a ground glass joint and are made of thinner glass than the reaction flask, so that it is easier to heat.

40|$|The {{addition}} of manganese dioxide to hasten the «digestion» in the semi-micro determination of nitrogen from solid fuels, gives irregular and low results, which are {{likely due to}} the oxidant action of the dioxide being too much violent If the quantity of dioxide is diminished, these results do agree better each other but a longer time of digestion is required. Since 1 ange and Winzen apply a lower proportion of catalyst (1, 5 g for 8 ml of acid) than that recommended by the ISO (2 g for 4 ml of acid), it is also probable the necessary boiling temperature to change nitrogen into ammonia will not be reached. On the other hand, with the 1 ange-Winzen operating technique, {{it has been very}} often observed the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the distillate, occasionally arriving to produce, by precipitation of sulphur, a turbidness which distuibes the final titration. The method recommended by the ISO gives right results and it is rapid enough, with the only reservation that the time to distill should not be pointed out rigidly, as it depends upon the apparatus employed. The one utilized by the author presents over the Markham's the advantage of not precising the transfuse of the «digest» from the <b>Kjeldahl's</b> <b>flask</b> to the apparatus, since distillation is carried out inside the flask, the mouth of which having for this objet a standard ground glass joint. This method results to be very practical for determinations in series, for the 25 - 30 minutes period necessary to the «digestion» affords to the operator time enough to distill the «digests» from a previous batch.

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{development}} regarding analysis of polonium (Po) in environmental samples since the 1960 ies. This {{is due to the}} straightforward spontaneous deposition of this element on silver (Ag), nickel (Ni) or copper (Cu) without any radiochemical separation. For many years, no radiochemical yield determinant was used and it was generally supposed that the yield was 100 % after two depositions. Counting was often done using ZnS scintillation counter coupled to a photomultiplier tube. However, the use of the yield determinants (208) Po and (209) Po and the development of alpha spectrometry showed that the yield was lower. Furthermore, the tendency of Po to volatilize at low temperatures constrains the sample preparation techniques; dry-ashing cannot be used. But during the wet-ashing procedure, there are still some losses. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the Po losses during wet-ashing by the use of a double-tracer technique. We have found that the losses were about 30 % when open glass beakers were used and about 17 % when the samples were digested in microwave oven. When long-necked bottles (<b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>flasks)</b> were used, a loss of about 20 % was registered. It has also been observed that (210) Pb to some extent is plating out together with its daughter nuclide Po during the electrochemical deposition. This will result in a systematic error since an unknown amount of supported (210) Po will be produced from the (210) Pb decay depending on the fraction of (210) Pb being deposited on the disc and the waiting time between deposition and measurement of the sample. A further consequence of this is that in the assessment of the (210) Pb content in the sample, very often the remaining liquid is stored after deposition for build-up of (210) Po. Since some (210) Pb is lost on the disc, the result for (210) Pb will be too low. Both these systematic errors give rise to a too high (210) Po/(210) Pb ratio. The fraction of (210) Pb which is plating out has been assessed in this study for different matrices and is about 50 - 90 %. During the measurement by solid state Si-detectors, some Po is evaporated in the vacuum conditions contaminating the detectors. Experiments have here been done by heating the discs after deposition which indicate that less Po is evaporated from Ag than from Ni. The losses from Ag are less than that from the other metals probably due to a deeper penetration into the surface of Po. We conclude that in most aspects, Ag is better to use than the other plating metals...|$|R

40|$|Interest in the {{physiological}} significance of gallium was aroused {{when it was}} noted that this element is contained in fission products (1). As a first approach to the problem the published methods for determining gallium in biological material (2, 3) were critically surveyed and tested in the laboratory. While these methods are useful in the range of 1 to 10 mgm. of gallium, it was necessary to develop an analytical procedure which could measure micro and semimIcro quantities of this element. The method herein described is based on the fluorescence of gallium 8 -hydroxy-quinolate in chloroform (4). This procedure has been applied to tissues of rats and rabbits which had been used in the toxicological and biochemical studies of gallium. These results appear to be the first published quantitative deter-minations of the distribution of gallium in the animal organism.

Faeces and urine were collected using a total collection method in which urine was collected into containers with toluene as preservative. Fractional aliquot of feed, faeces and urine samples were brought to laboratory for further processing. The dry matter (DM) of feed, faeces and residue was determined by drying to a constant weight in a forced air oven (NSW- 143, Narang Scientific Works Ltd., New Delhi) at 70 °C. The dried samples of each day collections were pooled for 6 d, ground to pass a 1  mm screen and preserved for chemical analysis.

The contents of the flask was transferred into a 50 -ml measuring flask and was diluted with water to the mark. The absorbance of the solution was measured at the wavelength of 630 nm with a 50 -mm glass cell. Beer's law was obeyed over the range of 0 〜 1000 ppm COD. The calibration curves using glycine, glucose, ethanol and starch, as the reference, gave their slope of 7. 05 × 10 ^ as the mean. Therefore, the COD value can be calculated from the following equation : GOD=absorbance/ 7. 05 × 10 ^. An appropriate volume ratio of sulfuric add to phosphoric acid for the decomposition of glycine was found to be 3 : 2. The reaction time could be reduced to about one fourth of JIS(COD_) method.
