25|$|In 1921, {{he entered}} politics. He {{was elected to}} the Madras Legislative Council as an {{outstanding}} educationalist. For a short {{while he was in the}} Justice party. The Justice Party (India) found him far too brilliant and individualistic for keeping proper party control over him. In 1926 January, when it was decided to establish Andhra University at Waltaire, Reddy was the natural choice for appointment as its first Vice-Chancellor. He made Andhra University a great centre of higher education and outstanding research in both sciences and humanities. Towards the end of 1930, he did the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>thing</b> of resigning his Vice-Chancellorship in protest against the repressive policy of the Government of India in arresting the great leaders of Congress Salt Satyagraha movement. He wrote a classic letter in this context to the Governor of Madras. When he resigned his post as Vice-Chancellor, he was succeeded by Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.|$|E

500|$|As {{leader of}} the Alberta Liberals, Boyle corresponded {{extensively}} with Liberal Party of Canada leader (and Prime Minister of Canada) William Lyon Mackenzie King; according to Foster, Boyle's letters to King were [...] "a mixture of useless information and pleas to be rescued by an appointment to the bench." [...] It is possible {{that one of his}} letters had some impact on history, however: in 1924, while Greenfield was attempting to negotiate control of Alberta's natural resources from King's federal government, Boyle sent King a letter warning him that the UFA was doomed in the next election unless [...] "something extraordinary happens. That <b>extraordinary</b> <b>thing</b> which Greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." [...] King drew out negotiations until Greenfield returned to Alberta empty-handed; soon after, Greenfield was forced from office by his own backbenchers, and replaced by Brownlee.|$|E

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{received}} especially positive {{reviews and}} {{has been described as}} one of the [...] "classic episodes" [...] of Homicide: Life on the Street. It ranked number 74 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 greatest television moments, and number 15 among the top television moments from the 1990s. David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode [...] "remains one of TV's best drama hours ever", Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts said the episode was [...] "one of the most powerful prime-time hours ever" [...] and literary critic John Leonard called it [...] "the most <b>extraordinary</b> <b>thing</b> I've ever seen in a television hour". Emily Nussbaum of The New York Times called [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] the standout episode of the series, and described it as [...] "a potent showcase for the series' smartly mordant dialogue, and its willingness to explore the cliches of TV detectives instead of merely repeating them".|$|E
500|$|Early press {{coverage}} was [...] "mixed", generally {{a combination of}} [...] "embarrassment and puzzlement". The historical novelist and poet Maurice Hewlett published {{a series of articles}} in the literary journal John O' London's Weekly, in which he concluded: [...] "And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them." [...] The Sydney newspaper Truth on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; [...] "For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children." [...] Some public figures were more sympathetic. Margaret McMillan, the educational and social reformer, wrote: [...] "How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed." [...] The novelist Henry De Vere Stacpoole decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: [...] "Look at Alice's [...] face. Look at Iris's [...] face. There is an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>thing</b> called Truth which has 10million faces and forms– it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it." ...|$|E
500|$|Brownlee {{became the}} province's chief {{negotiator}} on resource questions in October 1921. [...] Though early attempts at reaching agreement were {{hampered by the}} unwillingness of the Maritime provinces {{to agree to the}} necessary constitutional amendments unless their own annual subsidies were increased, negotiations between the provincial and federal government continued intermittently throughout the 1920s. [...] Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King occasionally appeared receptive to Alberta's demands, but never fully agreed to them. A possible explanation for this is found in a 1924 letter from Alberta Liberal Party leader John R. Boyle to King, explaining that the UFA was likely to lose the next provincial election to Boyle's Liberals [...] "unless something extraordinary happens. That <b>extraordinary</b> <b>thing</b> which Greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." [...] Despite this letter, the sides seemed close to agreement in early 1925: at a January conference Alberta accepted in principle a federal offer of three years of continuing subsidy after the transfer of resource rights. [...] After an exhaustive series of meetings between Brownlee and the federal counsel, the agreement went back to the governments for approval. [...] As Greenfield and Brownlee expressed their impatience with federal inaction, an intergovernmental meeting was convened in May. The meeting proceeded at a leisurely pace into June, after which King announced that his cabinet would like the summer to consider the agreement in greater detail. The Albertans returned home in disgust.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia awarded it {{a perfect}} 10/10 and said, [...] "It's the Watchmen film you {{always wanted to}} see, but never {{expected}} to get." [...] Also praising the film along with another perfect score (4/4) was Kyle Smith of the New York Post, comparing it to some of Stanley Kubrick's films: [...] "Director Zack Snyder's cerebral, scintillating follow-up to 300 seems, to even a weary filmgoer's eye, as fresh and magnificent in sound and vision as [...]" [...] Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "It's a compelling visceral film—sound, images and characters combined into a decidedly odd visual experience that evokes {{the feel of a}} graphic novel." [...] Richard Corliss of Time concluded [...] "this ambitious picture is a thing of bits and pieces," [...] yet [...] "the bits are glorious, the pieces magnificent." [...] Total Film awarded it 4/5 stars, stating: [...] "It's hard to imagine anyone watching the Watchmen as faithfully as Zack Snyder's heartfelt, stylised adap. Uncompromising, uncommercial, and unique." [...] When comparing the film to the original source material, Ian Nathan of Empire felt that while [...] "it isn't the graphic novel... Zack Snyder clearly gives a toss, creating a smart, stylish, decent adaptation." [...] Nick Dent of Time Out Sydney gave the film 4/6 in his review of February 25, praising the film's inventiveness but concluding, [...] "While Watchmen is still as rich, daring, and intelligent an action film as there's ever been, it also proves Moore absolutely right [...] As a comic book, Watchmen is an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>thing.</b> As a movie, it's just another movie, awash with sound and fury." ...|$|E
500|$|Rocky Mountain News critic Dusty Saunders {{said the}} episode was [...] "as good as {{dramatic}} television gets", and showed how {{the quality of}} Homicide is anchored in strong writing and acting rather than action. John Leonard, a literary and television critic, called it [...] "the most <b>extraordinary</b> <b>thing</b> I've ever seen in a television hour". Leonard praised the tension, the setting and the writing, particularly when Tucker turned the tables on the detectives. He said the episode was better than such works as Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden and author Don DeLillo's books about men in small rooms. Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun-Times called it a [...] "relentless masterpiece". Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News considered [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{one of the best}} Homicide episodes and particularly praised the performance of Moses Gunn. Mendoza also said, [...] "The claustrophobia of The Box contributes to the palpable tension. The Baltimore Sun television critic David Zurawik said the episode established The Box as [...] "the main stage for Pembleton and the moral center of the Homicide universe". Zurawik also said, [...] "Stark and minimalist, the episode was musical theater as much as television, a celebration and explosion of language; an angry, urban opera with the voices of Bayliss and Pembleton coming together and then falling back as Tucker sings a final aria of rage and contempt." [...] Calgary Herald writer Bruce Weir said the episode [...] "is Homicide at its finest: brilliantly written, intensely acted and continuously surprising." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New York Times called [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] the standout episode of the series, and described it as [...] "a potent showcase for the series' smartly mordant dialogue, and its willingness to explore the cliches of TV detectives instead of merely repeating them". Los Angeles Times writer Howard Rosenberg described it as a [...] "mesmerizing (and) complex character study", and said Gunn delivered the best guest performance of the television season. Grant Tinker, former CEO of NBC, said of the episode, [...] "I thought it was stunning." ...|$|E
500|$|Fantasia {{garnered}} significant {{critical acclaim}} {{at the time}} of release and was seen by some critics as a masterpiece. The West Coast premiere at the Carthay Circle Theatre was a grand affair, attracting some 5000 people, including Shirley Temple, Cecil B. DeMille, Forrest Tucker, James Cagney, Robert Montgomery, James Murphy, Edgar Bergen, [...] and many other notables in the film industry. Among those at the film's premiere was film critic Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times who considered the film to be a magnificent achievement in film which would go down in film history as a landmark film, noting the rapturous applause the film received by the audience during the various interludes. He stated that Fantasia was [...] "caviar to the general, ambrosia and nectar for the intelligentsia" [...] and considered the film to be [...] "courageous beyond belief". Music critic of the newspaper, Isabel Morse Jones, was highly praising of the soundtrack to the film, believing it to be a [...] "dream of a symphony concert", an [...] "enormously varied concert of pictorial ideas, of abstract music by acknowledged composers, of performers Leopold Stokowski and orchestra players of Hollywood and Philadelphia, and, for the vast majority, new and wonderful sound effects". Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, also at the premiere, noted that [...] "motion-picture history was made last night... Fantasia dumps conventional formulas overboard and reveals the scope of films for imaginative excursion... Fantasia... is simply terrific." [...] Peyton Boswell, an editor at Art Digest, called it [...] "an aesthetic experience never to be forgotten". Time magazine described the premiere as [...] "stranger and more wonderful than any of Hollywood's" [...] and the experience of Fantasound [...] "as if the hearer {{were in the midst of}} the music. As the music sweeps to a climax, it froths over the proscenium arch, boils into the rear of the theatre, all but prances up and down the aisles." [...] Dance Magazine devoted its lead story to the film, saying that [...] "the most <b>extraordinary</b> <b>thing</b> about Fantasia is, to a dancer or balletomane, not the miraculous musical recording, the range of color, or the fountainous integrity of the Disney collaborators, but quite simply the perfection of its dancing". Variety also hailed Fantasia, calling it [...] "a successful experiment to lift the relationship from the plane of popular, mass entertainment to the higher strata of appeal to lovers of classical music". The Chicago Tribune assigned three writers to cover the film's Chicago premiere: society columnist Harriet Pribble; film critic Mae Tinee; and music critic Edward Barry. Pribble left amazed at the [...] "brilliantly-attired audience", while Tinee felt the film was [...] "beautiful... but it is also bewildering. It is stupendous. It is colossal. It is an overwhelmingly ambitious orgy of color, sound, and imagination." [...] Barry was pleased with the [...] "program of good music well performed... and beautifully recorded" [...] and felt [...] "pleasantly distracted" [...] from the music to what was shown on the screen. In a breakdown of reviews from both film and music critics, Disney author Paul Anderson found 33% to be [...] "very positive", 22% both [...] "positive" [...] and [...] "positive and negative", and 11% negative.|$|E
