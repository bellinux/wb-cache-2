5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in Delaware {{resulted}} {{in one of}} only thirteen presidential disaster declarations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Delaware. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over Pennsylvania the next day. The storm's center remained {{to the south and}} west of Delaware, and was about 175miles (280km) from Delaware at its closest approach.
