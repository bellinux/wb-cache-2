5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often <b>damages</b> <b>the</b> mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Hitman Ah Jong is on {{his last}} job for the Hong Kong Triad, but accidentally <b>damages</b> <b>the</b> eyes of a young nightclub singer named Jennie with a muzzle flash in a shootout. After the attack, Ah Jong begins to watch Jennie perform at the nightclub and escorts her home when she is {{attacked}} by thugs.

5|$|Hypersensitivity is {{an immune}} {{response}} that <b>damages</b> <b>the</b> body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I– IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.|$|E
5000|$|A fire during <b>the</b> 1930s <b>damaged</b> <b>the</b> {{roof and}} steeple of the church, {{but these were}} {{obviously}} repaired successfully.

5|$|In some European countries, such as Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, the muskrat is {{considered}} an invasive pest, as its burrowing <b>damages</b> <b>the</b> dikes and levees on which these low-lying countries depend for protection from flooding. In those countries, it is trapped, poisoned, and hunted to attempt to keep the population down. Muskrats also eat corn and other farm and garden crops growing near water bodies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased out of many applications. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, <b>damages</b> <b>the</b> nervous system, and causes blood disorders. It is particularly problematic in children: even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment, permanent brain damage may result.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{decides that}} they need to know what {{happened}} to the Valiant, and the Enterprise crosses the edge of the galaxy where it encounters a strange barrier which <b>damages</b> <b>the</b> ship's systems and warp drive, forcing a retreat. At the same time, nine crewmembers are killed and both helmsman Gary Mitchell and ship's psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Dehner are knocked unconscious by the barrier's effect. When he awakens, Mitchell's eyes glow silver, and he begins to display remarkable psychic powers.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} left {{thousands of}} people homeless in Florida; property damage was estimated at $25million ($). It is estimated if a similar storm were to strike as of the year 2003, it would cause $18.7billion in <b>damages.</b> <b>The</b> cyclone remains one of three Atlantic hurricanes to strike the southern mainland of Florida with a central pressure below 940mbar (27.76inHg), the others being the 1926 Miami hurricane and Hurricane Andrew of 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} press {{reporting}} on {{aspects of the}} case led to legal proceedings against several UK newspapers.

5|$|The storm caused {{minor damage}} in {{northern}} Madagascar. In Mozambique, the cyclone affected 200,000people, and left at least sixteen fatalities. Cyclone Jokwe destroyed over 9,000houses and damaged over 3,000more, with the heaviest damage in Angoche and the Island of Mozambique in Nampula Province. The storm also caused widespread power outages and crop <b>damages.</b> <b>The</b> name Jokwe was {{submitted to the}} World Meteorological Organization by Botswana.|$|E
5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary <b>damages.</b> <b>The</b> court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary <b>damages.</b> <b>The</b> court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times <b>damages.</b> <b>The</b> actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times <b>damages.</b> <b>The</b> actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E

50|$|The {{prognosis}} for complete recovery {{is dependent upon}} many factors. The {{most important of these}} is the severity and duration of compression upon <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> nerve(s).

5|$|A.phalloides {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{poisonous}} of all known toadstools. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. It has been the subject of much research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is α-amanitin, which <b>damages</b> <b>the</b> liver and kidneys, causing hepatic and renal failure that can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|After the riots, Bishop Kenrick {{ended his}} efforts to {{influence}} the public education system and began encouraging the creation of Catholic schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in <b>damages.</b> <b>The</b> city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty {{and could not be}} property owners. The Augustinians ended up proving the Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act and because the state had not {{lived up to its}} obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new reservation, and buying land for the new reservation from within the old reservation). The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of trespass <b>damages.</b> <b>The</b> Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it <b>damages</b> <b>the</b> equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E
5|$|In its path, Charlie {{caused more}} than 250 deaths.
