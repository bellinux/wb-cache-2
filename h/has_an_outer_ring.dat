50|$|The park <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> road {{called the}} Outer Circle (4.45 km) and an {{inner ring road}} called the Inner Circle (1 km), which {{surrounds}} the most carefully tended section of the park, Queen Mary's Gardens. Apart from two link roads between these two, the park is reserved for pedestrians. The south, east and most of {{the west side of the}} park are lined with elegant white stucco terraces of houses designed by John Nash and Decimus Burton. Running through the northern end of the park is Regent's Canal, which connects the Grand Union Canal to the former London docks.The 166 ha park is mainly open parkland with a wide range of facilities and amenities, including gardens; a lake with a heronry, waterfowl and a boating area; sports pitches; and children's playgrounds. The northern side of the park is the home of London Zoo and the headquarters of the Zoological Society of London. There are several public gardens with flowers and specimen plants, including Queen Mary's Gardens in the Inner Circle, in which the Open Air Theatre is located; the formal Italian Gardens and adjacent informal English Gardens in the south-east corner of the park; and the gardens of St John's Lodge. Winfield House, the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, stands in private grounds in the western section of the park. Nearby is the domed London Central Mosque, better known as Regent's Park mosque, a highly visible landmark.|$|E
40|$|This work investigates {{upsetting}} of the tri-metallic cylindrical billets both experimentally and analytically with {{a reduction}} ratio 30 %. Steel, brass, and copper {{are used for}} the outer and outmost rings and aluminum for the inner core. Two different models {{have been designed to}} show material flow and the cavity took place over the two interfaces during forming after this reduction ratio. Each model has an outmost ring material as steel. Model 1 <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> between the outmost ring and the solid core material as copper and Model 2 has a material as brass. Solid core is aluminum for each model. Billets were upset in press machine by using parallel flat dies. Upsetting load was recorded and compared for models and single billets. To extend the tests and compare with experimental procedure to a wider range of inner core and outer ring geometries, finite element model was performed. ABAQUS software was used for the simulations. The aim is to show how contact between outmost ring, outer ring and the inner core are carried on throughout the upsetting process. Results have shown that, with changing in height, between outmost ring, outer ring and inner core, the Model 1 and Model 2 had very good interaction, and the contact surfaces of models had various interface behaviour. It is also observed that tri-metallic materials have lower weight but better mechanical properties than single materials. This can give an idea for using and producing these new materials for different purposes...|$|E

50|$|In {{countries}} where the theft of alloy wheels is a serious problem, locking nuts (or bolts, as applicable) are available - or already fitted by the vehicle manufacturer - which require a special adaptor ("key") between the nut and the wrench to fit and remove. The key is normally unique to each set of nuts. Only one locking nut per wheel is normally used, so they are sold in sets of four. Most designs can be defeated using a hardened removal tool which uses a left-hand self-cutting thread to grip the locking nut, although more advanced designs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> spinning <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> to frustrate such techniques.|$|R

40|$|We present {{observations}} of newly discovered 24 micron circumstellar structures detected with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) around three evolved {{stars in the}} Cygnus-X star forming region.

A second, HBHA 4202 - 22, a Wolf-Rayet candidate, shows a circular shell of 24 micron emission suggestive of either a limb-brightened shell or disk seen face-on. No diffuse emission was detected around either of these two objects in the Spitzer 3. 6 - 8 micron Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands. The third object is the luminous blue variable candidate G 79. 29 + 0. 46. We resolved the previously known inner ring in all four IRAC bands. The 24 micron emission from the inner ring extends ~ 1. 2 arcmin beyond the shorter wavelength emission, well beyond what {{can be attributed to}} the difference in resolutions between MIPS and IRAC. Additionally, we <b>have</b> discovered <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> of 24 micron emission, possibly due to an earlier episode of mass loss. For the two shell stars, we present the results of radiative transfer models, constraining the stellar and dust shell parameters.

40|$|Abstract. The unusual {{morphology}} of the Andromeda Spiral (Messier 31, {{the closest}} spiral galaxy to the Milky Way) <b>has</b> long been <b>an</b> enigma. Although regarded for decades as showing {{little evidence of}} a violent history, M 31 <b>has</b> <b>a</b> well-known <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> 1 − 7 of star formation at a radius of 10 kpc whose center is offset from the galaxy nucleus. In addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped as seen at both optical 8 and radio 9 wavelengths. The halo contains numerous loops and ripples. Here we report the discovery, based on analysis of previously-obtained data 10, of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions 1. 5 by 1 kpc and offset by ∼ 0. 5 kpc {{from the center of}} the galaxy. The two rings appear to bedensity waves propagating in the disk. Numerical simulations offer a completely new interpretation for the morphology of M 31 : both rings result from a companion galaxyplunging head-on through the center of the disk of M 31. The most likely interloper is M 32. Head-on collisions between galaxies are rare, but it appears nonetheless that one took place 210 million years ago in our Local Group of galaxies. Newly-acquired images 10 of M 31 secured by the Infrared Array Camera 11 (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope span the wavelength regime of 3. 6 to 8. 0 microns.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model for the growth of a maar-{{diatreme}} complex in a shallow marine environment. The Miocene-age Costa Giardini diatreme near Sortino, in the region of the Iblei Mountains of southern Sicily, <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> tuff <b>ring</b> formed by the accumulation of debris flows and surge deposits during hydromagmatic eruptions. Vesicular lava clasts, accretionary lapilli and bombs in the older ejecta indicate that initial eruptions were of gas-rich magma. Abundant xenoliths in the upper, late-deposited beds of the ring suggest rapid magma ascent, and deepening of the eruptive vent is shown by the change in slope of the country rock. The interior of the diatreme contains nonbedded breccia composed of both volcanic and country rock clasts of variable size and amount. The occurrence of bedded hyaloclastite breccia in an isolated outcrop in the middle-lower part of the diatreme suggests subaqueous effusion at a low rate following the end of explosive activity. Intrusions of nonvesicular magma, forming plugs and dikes, occur on the western side of the diatreme, and at the margins, close to the contact between breccia deposits and country rock; they indicate involvement of volatile-poor magma, possibly during late stages of activity. We propose that initial hydromagmatic explosive activity occurred in a shallow marine environment and the ejecta created a rampart that isolated for a short time the inner crater from the surrounding marine environment. This allowed explosive activity to draw down the water table {{in the vicinity of the}} vent and caused deepening of the explosive center. A subsequent decrease in the effusion rate and cessation of explosive eruptions allowed the crater to refill with water, at which time the hyaloclastite was deposited. Emplacement of dikes and plugs occurred nonexplosively while the breccia sediment was mostly still soft and unconsolidated, locally forming peperites. The sheltered, low-energy lagoon filled with marine limestones mixed with volcaniclastic material eroded from the surrounding ramparts. Ultimately, lagoonal sediments accumulated in the crater until subsidence or erosion of the tuff ring caused a return to normal shallow marine conditions...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that {{continually}} adapt their morphology by fusion and fission events. An imbalance between fusion and fission {{has been}} linked to major neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. A member of the Dynamin superfamily, dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP 1), a dynamin-related GTPase, is required for mitochondrial membrane fission. Self-assembly of DRP 1 into oligomers in a GTP-dependent manner likely drives the division process. We show here that DRP 1 self-assembles in two ways: i) {{in the presence of the}} non-hydrolysable GTP analog GMP-PNP into spiral-like structures of ~ 36 nm diameter; and ii) in the presence of GTP into rings composed of 13 - 18 monomers. The most abundant rings were composed of 16 monomers and <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> and inner <b>ring</b> diameter of ~ 30 nm and ~ 20 nm, respectively. Three-dimensional analysis was performed with rings containing 16 monomers. The single-particle cryo-electron microscopy map of the 16 monomer DRP 1 rings suggests a side-by-side assembly of the monomer with the membrane in a parallel fashion. The inner ring diameter of 20 nm is insufficient to allow four membranes to exist as separate entities. Furthermore, we observed that mitochondria were tubulated upon incubation with DRP 1 protein in vitro. The tubes <b>had</b> <b>a</b> diameter of ~ 30 nm and were decorated with protein densities. These findings suggest DRP 1 tubulates mitochondria, and that additional steps may be required for final mitochondrial fission...|$|R
40|$|Well {{preserved}} {{specimens of}} the Early Palaeozoic craniiform brachiopods Orthisocrania and Craniops retain {{clear evidence of}} a lecithotrophic larval stage, indicating the loss of planktotrophy early in their phylogeny. The size of the earliest mineralized dorsal shell was < 100 mu m across, and the well preserved shell structure in these fossil craniiforms allows their earliest ontogeny to be compared directly with that of living Novocrania, in which the first mineralized dorsal shell (metamorphic shell) is secreted only after settlement of the lecithotrophic larvae. Immediately outside this earliest shell (early post-metamorphic or brephic shell) and {{in the rest of}} the dorsal valve the primary layer in both fossil and living craniiforms has characteristic radially arranged laths, which are invariably lacking in the earliest dorsal shell. The ventral valve of the fossil specimens commonly preserves traces of an early attachment scar (cicatrix), which is equal in size to the dorsal metamorphic shell, and the brephic post-metamorphic ventral valve also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> primary shell with radially arranged laths. However, a primary shell with radial laths is completely lacking in the ventral valve of living Novocrania, indicating that heterochrony may have been involved in the origin of the encrusting mode of life in living craniids; the entire ventral valve of Recent craniids (with the possible exception of Neoancistrocrania) may correspond to the earliest attachment scar of some fossil taxa such as Orthisocrania. It is also probable that the unique absence of an inner mantle lobe as well as the absence of lobate cells in Novocrania could be the result of heterochronic changes. The dorsal valve of both fossil and living craniiforms <b>has</b> <b>a</b> marked <b>outer</b> growth <b>ring,</b> around 500 mu m across, marking the transition to the adult, and a significant change in regime of shell secretion. The earliest craniiform attachment is considered to be homologous to the unique attachment structures described recently in polytoechioids (e. g. Antigonambonites) and other members of the strophomenate clade. However, unlike the craniiforms, polytoechioids and strophomenates all have planktotrophic larvae, and planktotrophy is most probably a plesiomorphic character for all Brachiopoda...|$|R
