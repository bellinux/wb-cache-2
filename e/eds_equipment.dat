30|$|Structural {{properties}} of synthesized nanocomposite were measured using JSM- 6510 LV {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). JEM- 2100 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further used to characterize the morphology in detail. GO and DNA were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). P, N, O, and Mn elements were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). FTIR transmittance spectra were obtained from NICOLET 6700. UV- 2550 spectrophotometer recorded UV-vis absorption spectra, and the background contribution of the FTO glass to the absorption spectra was eliminated. The electrode of DNA@Mn 3 (PO 4) 2 /GO was examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (<b>EDS,</b> <b>equipment</b> with JSM- 6510 LV, Japan).|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{application}} of the UMSA device (Universal Metallurgical Simulator and Analyzer) has allow to determine the liquidus/solidus thermal points of solidified alloy, as well the thermal points, where phase- or eutectic crystallisation occurs. Design/methodology/approach: Investigations were performed using cast aluminium-silicon alloys, known as EN AC- 4 XXXX according to the PN-EN 1706 : 2001 standard. The solidification process was investigated using the metallurgical UMSA simulator connected to recording devices equipped with simulating cooling system. For the alloy microstructure investigation the optical microscope and transmission and scanning electron microscope with <b>EDS</b> <b>equipment</b> were used for evaluation of the chemical composition of the phases occurred in the investigated alloy. Findings: Investigation of the interdependences occurred between phase morphology and cooling rate using thermo-analysis has given the main results. Practical implications: In the metal casting industry {{the improvement of the}} quality of components depends mainly on proper control over the production parameters. Originality/value: The performed investigations allow to determine the microstructure changes as well the derivative curves in comparison to the cooling rate applied for the alloy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA), {{the general}} {{strategy}} of characterizing specimens with their depth-dependent composition consists {{of changing the}} incident beam energy, E°, in order to change the effective thickness of the electron-irradiated volume. Initiated by two pioneering works an alternative way consists of changing the take-off angle of the measured characteristic x-ray line intensities but keeping unchanged the excitation conditions and the detector's position. In continuity to these previous investigations the present contribution suggests several improvements and applications for Angle-Resolved Electron Probe Microanalysis (AR-EPMA). In particular optimized angular conditions are defined and a new sample set-up is proposed. A simple model of Φ(z) function {{is also used to}} simulate various angular profiles relative to a variety of situations including inhomogeneous in-depth concentration profiles and multi-stratified samples, etc. Comparisons to published data are also performed when available and the relative advantages of AR-EPMA to conventional EPMA are discussed. The suggested device may be implemented into dedicated electron microprobes but its implementation into a SEM (+ <b>EDS</b> <b>equipment)</b> seems the most promising for rapid and automatic acquisitions of angular profiles at selected points of a sample. The same device may also be used for other beam techniques such as Auger Electron Spectroscopy: AR-AES...|$|E

A theoretical model is developed to compare with existing ight test data. In particular, {{the frequency of the}} aircraft spin is analysed {{as a function of the}} mass distribution of the aircraft to determine the e ect of the fuel load. It is found that the spin frequency is minimally a ected by the fuel load since the moments of inertia corresponding to the engine, for example, are far more signi cant. However, it is con rmed that the yawing e ect of the propeller causes the aircraft to spin faster to the right than to the left...|$|R
40|$|Objective All {{emergency}} departments (EDs) {{should be}} adequately equipped {{and prepared to}} deal with unexpected neonatal deliveries and resuscitation. A study was undertaken to determine what neonatal resuscitation equipment is available in EDs in the UK and to formulate recommendations for improvement. Methods A prospective telephone survey of all UK EDs was conducted between November 2008 and February 2009 to determine the type of neonatal resuscitation equipment available as recommended in the fourth edition of the APLS guidelines. Results 169 EDs were identified, 137 (81 %) of which successfully completed the survey. The majority of EDs followed APLS recommendations for provision of neonatal resuscitation equipment. There was a particularly good availability of basic airway equipment (99 %), but 11 % did not have a source of warmth, 5 % lacked advanced airway equipment and 31 % had no equipment for obtaining umbilical access. A Resuscitaire was present in 47 % of EDs surveyed. Conclusion There is a good level of provision of neonatal resuscitation <b>equipment</b> in UK <b>EDs,</b> although certain areas need to be addressed. There is a particular need for improving the provision of warming and advanced airway equipment. The authors consider that {{it is not necessary to}} have a neonatal Resuscitaire in the <b>ED</b> provided other <b>equipment</b> is readily available. The findings of this survey prompt the recommendation that all EDs should review their neonatal resuscitation equipment in accordance with APLS guidance, and ensure that staff have immediate access to this equipment and are comfortable with its use...|$|R
40|$|An ED (electrodialysis {{pilot plant}} {{achieved}} high desalting recoveries of nearly 95 {{percent at the}} YDTF (Yuma Desalting Test Facility, Arizona) and 92 percent at LVS (La Verkin Springs, Utah) during over 4000 hours of operation. Brine TDS (total dissolved solids) concentrations of nearly 100 000 g/m 3 were obtained at LVS, which is a greater brine concentration than is possible using RO (reverse osmosis). The LVS required ED energy (while producing a product TDS concentration of about 1000 g/m 3) {{is estimated to be}} about one-third the energy requirements of a commercially available distillation brine concentrator. Lowering product TDS concentration by <b>ED</b> requires increased <b>equipment</b> size and energy consumption. Special modifications of a standard ED design by its manufacturer were required for the pilot plant to achieve the high brine concentrations through a minimization of both the wastage of water and the dilution of brine that usually occurs with polarity reversal. During initial ED operation (at the YDTF) about 60 000 g/m 3 brine TDS concentration caused the bronze brine-recirculation pump to erode and lose its required capacity and contributed to electrical shorting at the stack electrodes in nonflow areas. Subsequent replacement of the pump by one of plastic and the electrodes by ones specially encapsulated with plastic for higher electrical insulation allowed the pilot plant to operate for over 2000 hours producing high brine concentrations without additional <b>equipment</b> problems. The <b>ED</b> process {{has been shown to be}} highly feasible technically for achieving very high brine concentrations and desalting recoveries, which are particularly important to inland-desalting applications where brine disposal volumes need to be minimized because of the high brine-disposal costs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Directly Observed Treatment Short course {{strategy}} (DOTS) {{has proved}} to have potential improvement in tuber-culosis (TB) control in Tanzania. The objective of this cross sectional study {{was to assess the}} capacity of health facilities in implementing DOTS, in Arumeru and Karatu districts, Tanzania. Information sought included the capacity to offer TB service and availability of qualifi <b>ed</b> staff and <b>equipment</b> for TB diagnosis. Information on availability and utilization of TB registers and treatment outcome for the year 2004 were also collected. A total of 111 health facilities were surveyed, 86 (77. 5 %) in Arumeru and 25 (22. 5 %) in Karatu. Only 23. 4 % (26 / 111) facilities were offering TB treatment services in the two districts. Majority 17 / 26 (65. 38 %) of them were government owned. Thirty eight (44. 7 %) facilities were offer-ing TB laboratory services. All facilities with TB services (TB laboratory investigation and treatment) had TB registers. Seventy two (85. 0 %) of health facilities which do not provide any TB services had qualifi ed clinical offi cers and at least a microscopy. Of the 339 cases notifi ed in Arumeru in 2004, 187 (60. 7 %) had treatment outcome available, 124 (66. 3 %) were cured and 55 (29. 4 %) completed treatment. In Karatu 638 cases were notifi ed in 2004, 305 (47. 8 %) had treatment outcome available, 68 (22. 3 %) cured and 165 (54. 1 %) completed treatment. In conclusion, the overall capacity for imple-menting DOTS among the facilities surveyed is found only in about 20 % and 30 % for clinical and laboratory components of DOTS, respectively. The capacity to provide TB diagnosis and treatment in Karatu district was relatively lower tha...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{standard}} manual decontamination, {{hospital equipment}} remains contaminated with microorganisms, contributing to nosocomial transmission and hospital acquired infections. This {{has the potential}} to negate the effects of healthcare workers' hand-washing protocols. In order to decrease the likihood of equipment contamination, there has been a rise in the use of disposable pieces of equipment, especially non-critical disposables. However, these carry a significant cost, both a direct financial cost (running into billions of dollars), as well as a cost to the environment. This is important because we hope to contain the cost of healthcare, one way to do that, is to look to the hospitals themselves, for innovative solutions that maintain the standard of care. Objective To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an simple decontamination device for use with portable hospital equipment, by comparing rates of residual contamination after use of the novel device versus those seen with standard manual decontamination methods. Methods The Self-cleaning Unit for the Decontamination of Small instruments (SUDS) is a user-friendly, automated instrument developed via multi-disciplinary collaboration for decontamination in the clinical area. Pre- and post- utilization of portable medical equipment in an emergency department (ED) setting were cultured. To evaluate durability of the decrease in antimicrobial contamination, objects were re-cultured 48 hours after SUDS cleaning and following re-introduction into the clinical setting. Results After manual decontamination, 25 % (23 / 91) of the tested objects in the ED were found to be culture positive with clinically significant microorganisms(CSO). Fifteen percent (<b>ED)</b> of non-critical <b>equipment</b> tested had multiple organisms. Following the use of SUDS, the colonization rate decreased to 0 %. Following SUDS treatment and re-introduction into the clinical settings, after 48 hours the contamination rates as reflected by the cultures remained 0 %. Conclusion Standard non-critical equipment is contaminated with clinically significant microorganisms. The SUDS device allows for effective and durable decontamination of hospital equipment of varying sizes in the clinical area without disrupting patient care. </p...|$|R
