40|$|Abstract. Collapse-type {{shrinkage}} is {{the greatest}} obstacle to prevent planted eucalypts from being used for solid wood products. In {{order to make the}} suitable drying schedules for high effective utilization of eucalypt wood, the total shrinkage and collapse on two species of difficult-to-dry E. urophylla and E. grandis wood under continuous and <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> regimes were measured. The results show that total shrinkage and collapse in both eucalypts exhibited higher values for continuous drying than <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying.</b> With increasing drying temperature, total shrinkage and collapse increase in both drying regimes, while the increasing magnitude of both parameters becomes apparently larger for continuous drying than <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> regime, in particular higher temperature condition. Properly elevating drying temperature {{to make up for the}} intermittent-waiting time may be allowed for <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> regime. Drying duration at each <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> period has a greater effect on total shrinkage and collapse of eucalypt wood. When more than a drying duration of 6 hours at an <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> period is used, the differences in shrinkage and collapse between both drying regimes are very slight. Intermittent duration at an <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> period has a comparatively larger effect on total shrinkage and collapse.

In this paper, the REA is implemented to model <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying,</b> which is usually practiced for saving energy consumption and maintaining product quality during drying, under time-varying drying air temperature and humidity, which is a challenging drying case to model. For this purpose, the equilibrium activation energy (Delta E(v,b)) is defined according to the drying settings in each time period and combined with the relative activation energy (Delta E(v) /Delta E(v,b)) generated from the convective drying experimental data obtained under constant drying conditions. The mass and heat balances also implement the corresponding drying settings in each time period during the <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying.</b> The results indicate that the REA can describe both the moisture content and temperature profiles of the <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> under time-varying drying air temperature and humidity well.

A drying cycle includes heating time and tempering time. In a drying cycle, the drying time is used to be fixed and the tempering time changes and signifcantly affects the drying rate and milling quality of rice. this study focus on the effectof tempering time on drying rate and milling quality of rice for recirculating drying. the testing items of quality includethe percentage of brown rice, polished rice, head yield and germination rate. According to the experimental results, the following conclusions are drawnas below: If the tempering time is not included, the heating time is fixed and the tempering time in a cycle increase, the total heating time become longer. It points out extending the tempering time for drying cycle can increase the average drying rate for only the heating period. On the contrary, if the tempering time is counted, the drying rate will decrease {{with the increase of}} the tempering time. When the drying air temperature is above 50 ℃,the percentage of polished rice for <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> is higher than continuous drying. Tempering process benefits the production of polish rice. The drying air temperture influences more on the head yield than the time ratio of heating and tempering. When the drying air temperature is over 50 ℃, head yield drops obviously for both <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> and continuous drying. The percentage of head yield of <b>intermittent</b> <b>drying</b> is always higher than continuous drying. the percentage of head yield decrease with the decrease of the tempering time. When tempering time is less then 70 minites, the percentage of head yield declines significantly. Therefore, in order to prevent the loss of the percentage of head yield, the tempering time in a drying cycle should not be less then 1 / 7. Drying air temperature influence the percentage of germination more then tempering. When the drying air temperature is above 60 ℃, the percentage of germination drops apparently.

Powdered basalt rock was weathered using solutions with pH of 4. 5, 5. 5, and 7. 0 under two conditions: continuous and alternate wetting and drying.

Weathering with alternate wetting and drying showed more cumulative ion removal than continuous weathering for Mg, Na, K, Ca, Fe, and Si.

Ecosystem CO 2 and fluxes increased significantly with greater precipitation and were positively correlated with soil moisture. A repeated 10 day dry down period following 11 days of variable precipitation inputs strongly depressed net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) across a range of season precipitation totals, and plant community types. Ecosystem respiration (Re), evapotranspiration (ET) and leaf level photosynthesis (Amax) showed greatest sensitivity to dry down periods in low precipitation plots. Nitrogen additions significantly increased NEE, Re and Amax, particularly as water availability was increased. These results demonstrate that N availability and intermittent periods of soil moisture deficit (across a wide range of cumulative season precipitation totals) strongly modulate ecosystem gas exchange...|$|R
