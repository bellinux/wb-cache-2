5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|Winckelmann’s {{theories}} {{on the evolution}} of art culminated in the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of complete political and religious liberty. The theories idealised Ancient Greece and increased people’s desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He convinced 18th-century Europe that life in Ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”. Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.|$|E
25|$|On 27 December 1960, Phoumi lodged {{a protest}} with the United Nations because the Soviet Union was airlifting {{supplies}} to Kong Le's troops.

6000|$|In fine, {{no other}} American writer ever had so slight a human basis for his work; no other ever labored more patiently or more carefully. The unending {{controversy}} over Poe commonly reduces itself to this deadlock: one reader asks, [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{was worth a}} man's effort in the doing?" [...] and another answers, [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> was not cleverly, skillfully done?" ...|$|R

25|$|Cortez {{called a}} timeout and brought both fighters {{to the center}} of the ring for a lecture in the fourth round. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> after both of them had {{committed}} fouls - Calzaghe for holding and hitting and Hopkins for hitting on the break. Calzaghe still managed to land a couple of blows to the back of Hopkins' head at the end of the fifth round.|$|E
25|$|Preaching, on {{the other}} hand, was by then {{problematic}} for Conyers, despite his reputation, for other clergy and the general public. He turned down an invitation from John Thomas, his bishop, to preach in another church. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> just once, at St Mary the Virgin, Stone, Kent, by Dartford, for an archidiaconal visit, at personal cost. He was short of breath, and suffered from fainting.|$|E
25|$|Like {{his earlier}} directorial ventures Asoka and The Terrorist (a.k.a. Malli), Santosh {{was also the}} cinematographer for Anathabhadram. Kavya Madhavan {{replaced}} Meera as the female lead and gave a performance that established her as the top heroine of the Malayalam Film Industry that year, aided by both commercial success and critical acclaim. Prithviraj Sukumaran as the male lead also had his biggest success of 2005, out of the five films <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> year. Manoj K Jayan {{was to have a}} sannyasin look with long hair in the proposed Sabu Cyril version, but sported a more contemporary look in the version that was eventually shot, winning much critical accolades.|$|E

25|$|Oladotun has {{an innate}} {{affinity}} for dance and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> {{a whole lot}} as a kid, his love for legendary Michael Jackson's and Soul Brothers' James Brown's moves fueled the passion and had him take it much more seriously, and while in the university, he instituted a dance group he called Xtreme, they rocked different events {{on and off the}} university campus, shuttering between pursuit of passion and academic excellence. He became popular on campus as a result. Shortly after school he joined (now P-Square's official choreographer), Nonso Asobe's (a.k.a. Don Flexxx) dance group Ignite and performed in many events. Then in 2006 he featured on popular African act, D'banj's smashing hit, Why Me video as a dancer and on DJ Zeez's, Same Ni video. His dancing career was steady-rising towards peak when busy radio schedules among other activities choked out the time he made out for professional dancing.|$|E
25|$|J.T. and Colleen become {{embroiled in}} Lily Winters' (Christel Khalil) drama with {{internet}} predator Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). They discourage Lily from being with him. After Lily engages in illegal intercourse with him, Colleen tells Lily's parents, Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Drucilla (Victoria Rowell). They have him arrested. In retaliation, Kevin attempts to murder Colleen by locking {{her in a}} freezer inside a burning building. J.T. rescues her and carries {{her out of the}} building. The couple moves on from the Kevin ordeal as J.T. begins to focus on his music career. This serves as a roadblock in their romance as Colleen becomes jealous of J.T.'s closeness with other girls in his music video. During a press conference, he also lies to a reporter about not having a girlfriend. Though he attempts to explain why <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> Colleen decides to move back to New York to live with her mother so she will not be {{standing in the way of}} J.T.'s career. During her time away, he develops romantic feelings for his long-time friend Brittany, who plans to marry Bobby Marsino (John Enos III). Colleen returns to Genoa City briefly and J.T. deals with his feelings for both her and Brittany. She ultimately leaves town again and returns in 2006 intent on reuniting with J.T. However, he is dating Mackenzie Browning (then played by Rachel Kimsey) at the time. Colleen attempts to break them up. Ultimately, Mac's dependence on Kevin during her pregnancy and miscarriage, as well as J.T.'s cheating with Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), break the couple up. Not long after that, he and Colleen reunite.|$|E
500|$|Elgar's {{other works}} of his middle period include {{incidental}} music for Grania and Diarmid, a play by George Moore and W. B. Yeats (1901), and for The Starlight Express, a play {{based on a}} story by Algernon Blackwood (1916). Of the former, Yeats called Elgar's music [...] "wonderful in its heroic melancholy". Elgar also wrote a number of songs during his peak period, of which Reed observes, [...] "it cannot be said that he enriched the vocal repertory {{to the same extent}} as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> of the orchestra." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{key issue}} was whether Bamber {{received}} a call from his father that night to say Sheila had [...] "gone berserk" [...] with a gun. Bamber said that <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> he alerted police, and that Sheila fired the final shot while he and the officers were standing outside the house. It became a central plank of the prosecution's case that the father had made no such call, and that the only reason Bamber would have lied about it—indeed, {{the only way he could}} have known about the shootings when he alerted the police—was that he was the killer himself.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker {{summarized}} Hartman's comedic style: [...] "He could momentarily fool audiences {{into thinking}} he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until you started laughing." [...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day. I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic." ...|$|E
500|$|Julie Benz {{initially}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Buffy Summers, but that later went to Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had previously won the part of Cordelia Chase. Benz was offered the small role of the vampire Darla in the pilot episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her performance was so well-received that her character appeared in a few more episodes. In an interview with TheTVAddict.com, Benz said of her casting: [...] "I was supposed to die in the pilot, but about halfway through the pilot Joss Whedon was like, 'We're giving you a name and we're not going to kill you.' And <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> for a while until it finally came time to kill me, and kill me, and kill me and killed [...] me." [...] She later went on to say: ...|$|E

500|$|The inquiry panel {{into the}} {{accident}} consisted of Vice Admiral John B. Nathman and Rear Admirals Paul F. Sullivan and David M. Stone. [...] At Fargo's invitation the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) sent Rear Admiral Isamu Ozawa {{to participate in}} the inquiry as a non-voting adviser. [...] The three named [...] "affected" [...] parties of the inquiry were Waddle, Pfeifer, and Coen, who were present in the hearing room throughout the inquiry. Commander Mark Patton, a classmate of Waddle's at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. 20 years ago, was quoted as saying [...] "The general opinion on the waterfront was that it was important that he stand up and take responsibility. We wanted to see that happen. It was important for the public to see that happen. And <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> very well." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale also adapted Sharpe's Gold for ITV in 1995, as part {{of their}} series of adaptations of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels. This was an {{assignment}} that surprised his agent; [...] "We didn't think he'd want to bother with them but <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>That</b> was probably because he liked the producer." [...] He returned to writing for radio {{for the first time since}} the 1950s in 1996, when he wrote the drama-documentary The Quatermass Memoirs for BBC Radio 3. Partly composed of Kneale looking back at the events that led to the writing of the original three Quatermass serials and using some archive material, there was also a dramatised strand to the series, set just before the ITV Quatermass serial and featuring Andrew Keir, star of the Hammer version of Quatermass and the Pit, as the Professor.|$|E
500|$|Kelly died in Toronto, Canada, {{following}} an epileptic seizure, on April 12, 1971. He had traveled there from New York {{to play in}} a club with drummer George Reed and vocalist Herb Marshall. Kelly had a longstanding epilepsy problem, and had to monitor his condition carefully. An account of his death was given by his friend, Cobb: [...] "Wynton called his girlfriend in New York and said, 'You know, I don't feel good.' She said, 'Why don't you go downstairs to the bar and if something happens somebody could tend to you.' We don't know if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> because when they found him he was in the room." [...] Kelly was found in his room in the Westminster Hotel on Jarvis Street by Marshall. He was reported to have had almost no money {{at the time of his}} death. A memorial concert was held on June 28 in New York and featured numerous well-known musicians of the period.|$|E

50|$|Stefan (Paul Wesley) asks Klaus (Joseph Morgan) {{to remove}} his hybrids from the town {{otherwise}} he will start killing them one by one. When Klaus threatens him <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will kill everyone starting from Damon, Stefan answers back <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> will never see his family again. To prove Klaus {{that he is not}} bluffing, Stefan kills one of the hybrids in front of him. When Stefan leaves, Klaus calls Tyler (Michael Trevino) asking him to bite Caroline but Tyler refuses to do it.|$|R

500|$|The {{role of the}} Evil Queen/Regina went to Lana Parrilla. She {{explained}} the character, [...] "There's always two stories being told when playing Regina. There's the threat of her knowing she's an evil queen and then there's just the pure simple fact that the biological mother has stepped into her world {{and the threat of}} losing her son is just enormous. That's a fear that I think any adopted mother would have. I think that's going to really help the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would never accept the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard back from her management staff.|$|E
500|$|With Indicud, {{on several}} tracks Cudi took a {{backseat}} in vocals to rather showcase his production skills. [...] "The {{focus was on}} producing the record for Kendrick, I wanted to shine as a producer first. I wanted to show that side off {{more than anything else}} and that's why I had my one verse then let Kendrick go ape-sh-- crazy all over the rest of it." [...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick. I just wanted to hear him say something a little bit more thoughtful, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> — he showed up. I was blown away by his craftsmanship, his professionalism and his overall mojo." ...|$|E
500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E
5000|$|Comedian Dara Ó Briain said: [...] "Very sad {{news about}} Gerry Ryan. How long <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> show? Twenty, 25 years? That is some achievement. Condolences to his family".|$|R
