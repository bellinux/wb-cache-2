40|$|The {{increase}} of needs for renewable and vegetable based materials {{will help to}} drive the market growth of vegetable waxes. Because of their highly variable composition and physicochemical properties, plant waxes have found numerous applications in the: food, cosmetic, candle, coating, polish etc [...] . The aim of this project {{is to determine the}} effect of solvent extraction (petroleum ether and ethanol) on Tunisian <b>esparto</b> <b>wax</b> composition. The GC-MS was applied {{in order to determine the}} waxes compositions. Then, physicochemical parameters of these two samples of waxes: acid value, saponification value, iodine value and melting point were measured in order to deduct their properties and possible fields of uses. Results showed that <b>esparto</b> <b>wax</b> composition depended on the solvent extraction and that major components of the two samples of waxes were: alkanes, esters of fatty acids and phenols. Furthermore, esparto waxes were characterized by an antioxidant and antibacterial activities but the potential of these activities depended on the solvent of wax extraction...|$|E
