40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{integrate}} tolerance synthesis for manufacturing dimensions in CAPP systems, an automated process plan simulation module {{has previously been}} developed. This module permits the verification of the manufacturing pre-projects and the optimization of the manufacturing dimensions. The module used an optimization procedure which was realized through an equal distribution of the <b>excess</b> <b>tolerance</b> which {{is that of the}} design functional requirement. However in reality, this distribution should take into account the stochastic aspects of the dispersions and the complexity or cost of the manufacturing dimensions. In the present work, in order to overcome these drawbacks, a statistical and cost based tolerance synthesis model has been developed. It is shown that this model performs an objective and global distribution of the residual (excess) tolerances of the design functional dimensions on all the manufacturing dimensions of the process plan. The dispersions method is used in the modelling process to determine the variables of the objective function and to automatically extract the manufacturing tolerance chains. These chains are then used to construct the functional constraints of the optimization model. The whole process has been programmed as an automated tolerancing tool for manufacture and validated for several examples...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Zinc (Zn) participates of {{numerous}} metabolic processes in plants. However, {{it can become}} toxic to plants in excessive concentrations in the soil. Pfaffia glomerata is a Brazilian medicinal species that has stood out because of its numerous chemical and functional properties, mainly by the triterpene saponins and ecdysteroids accumulated in its roots. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of zinc excess on many root morphological parameters of Pfaffia glomerata. A 4 x 3 factorial design was employed in a completely randomized scheme with 3 replicates. The treatments consisted of four concentrations of Zn (2, 100, 200, and 300 µM) and three accessions of P. glomerata (BRA, GD, and JB) grown in a hydroponic system for 7 and 14 days. Differences in root morphology and dry mass production were observed among the three accessions in response to excessive Zn. Some growth parameters of GD accession increased {{with the addition of}} Zn, ranging from 36 to 79 µM. However, the GD and JB accessions presented reduction in dry mass production, root area, length, and volume with increasing Zn levels. The BRA accession, which had the lowest growth among accessions, presented chlorotic leaves. The shoot/root dry mass ratio and root diameter increased linearly for BRA and GD accessions at 7 days. Based on the evaluated parameters, we observed the following order of Zn <b>excess</b> <b>tolerance</b> in P. glomerata accessions: GD> JB> BRA...|$|E
40|$|Boron (B) deficit {{as well as}} excess may {{significantly}} {{limit the}} organic production in plants. In extreme cases they may kill the affected plants. Boron excess occurs primarily in arid and semiarid regions, in saline soils or in consequence to human action. Excessive boron concentrations retard plant growth and cause physiological and morphological changes (chlorosis and necrosis) first of all in leaf tips and then in marginal or intercostal parts of the lamina. Physiological mechanisms of plant tolerance to boron excess have not been studied in sufficient detail. The predominant opinion holds that {{they are based on}} restricted uptake and accumulation of boron in the root and aboveground plant parts. Significant differences in boron <b>excess</b> <b>tolerance</b> have been observed not only between different crops but even between different genotypes of the same crop. This has enabled the breeding of crop genotypes and crops adapted to growing on soils rich in available boron and intensified the research on the inheritance of plant tolerance to high B concentration. Sources of tolerance to high B concentration have been found in many crops (wheat, mustard, pea, lentil, eucalypt). Using different molecular techniques based on PCR (RAPD, SRAP), plant parents and progenies have been analyzed in an attempt to map as precisely as possible the position of B-tolerant genes. Small grains have been studied in greatest detail for inheritance of B tolerance. B tolerance in wheat is controlled by at least four additive genes, Bo 1, Bo 2, Bo 3 and Bo 4. Consequently, there exists a broad range of tolerance levels. Studies of Arabidopsis have broadened our understanding of regulation mechanisms of B transport from roots to above ground parts, allowing more direct genetic manipulations...|$|E

40|$|Maize crops grown during summer-rainy {{season in}} Asian tropics {{are prone to}} face both drought and excess {{moisture}} stress due uneven distribution patterns of monsoon rains in the region. We attempted to identify the relationship between drought and <b>excess</b> moisture <b>tolerance</b> through evaluation {{of a set of}} elite maize inbred lines, including lines with known performance under drought, excess moisture and normal inbred lines with unknown performance under either of the stresses. Under normal moisture, performance of normal lines was slightly better than drought and excess moisture lines. However, under stress condition performance of normal lines was very poor with average yield 9. 1 % under drought and 18. 7 % under excess moisture stress in comparison to normal moisture. On the other hand, drought lines yielded up to 61. 8 % under drought and 52. 1 % under excess moisture in comparison to their yields under normal moisture. Performance of excess moisture lines was also good across stress environments with average yield 68. 2 % under excess moisture and 35. 6 % under drought. Relationship between yields under drought and excess moisture stress was strong and significant with drought lines (R 2 = 0. 587 **), but it was relatively weak with excess moisture lines (R 2 = 0. 288 *), while the relationship highly weak with normal lines (R 2 = 0. 043 ns). Our results suggest that improved performance of drought tolerant lines across environments might be related to constitutive changes in stress-adaptive secondary traits such as - anthesis-silking interval < 5. 0 days, reduced barrenness, delayed senescence and minimum loss of leaf chlorophyll under stress conditions. These constitutive changes with selection and improvement for flowering stage drought tolerance might resulted in improved performance of genotypes under both drought and excess moisture stress, without any yield penalty under normal moisture...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) {{are crucial}} in {{mediating}} immune homeostasis and promoting {{the establishment and}} maintenance of peripheral <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Excess</b> body weight and obesity are typified by 'low-degree' chronic inflammation and are {{associated with an increased}} risk of atherosclerosis, diabetes, fatty liver disease, autoimmune diseases and cancer. All these pathological conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, abnormal cytokine production, elevated acute-phase reactants, and the activation of several inflammatory signaling pathways. In this context, the discovery of the adipose tissue-derived hormone leptin has shed fundamental insights on how these processes might occur. Leptin represents a link among metabolic disorders and immune tolerance; indeed, leptin can negatively affect the generation and proliferation of Treg cells, key players in this context. Treg cells play also a central role in tumor progression; different reports have proposed that tumor microenvironment can induce the recruitment of Treg cells which can promote tumor tolerance and angiogenesis through expression of suppressive molecules, cytokines and angiogenic factors (i. e. vascular endothelial growth factor, leptin). This work aims to discuss some of the most recent advances on the relationship between angiogenesis, leptin and immune tolerance, focusing on the role of Treg cell function in this context...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of increasing urbanization and shortage of good quality water, wastewater irrigation is a growing phenomenon in many arid and semi-arid countries. A common characteristic of wastewater is high salinity, with cities typically adding 200 – 500 mg l- 1 of total dissolved solids compared to the source water supplied to the city. Wastewater {{from the city of}} Hyderabad in southern India is discharged to the Musi river. Downstream of the city this water, supplemented with groundwater and runoff captured in small reservoirs, is an important source for irrigation. Comparisons between upstream and downstream monitoring sites, over a distance of 39. 7 km, revealed changes in the salinity of the river water. A simple mass-balance model was developed to simulate the observed differences. Results indicate that 94 % of the salt load originates in the city. Downstream salinity increased by about 9 %. In fields irrigated with wastewater, soil salinity increased with time with salt retention of approximately 34 kg ha- 1 y- 1.

DC. The high concentrations found in higher plants (up to 250 lmol g 21 dry weight) suggest an important role, but though many functions have been suggested (including methylating agent, detoxification of <b>excess</b> sulphur, salt <b>tolerance,</b> and herbivore deterrent), its actual functions remain unclear. The fact {{that the ability to}} produce DMSP in high concentrations is found in species that have no taxonomic or ecological relationship suggests that the compound evolved independently and serves different functions in different plants.

While DMSP concentrations in W. biflora have been found to increase with increasing salinity, suggesting a role in osmotic control, such a relationship has not been found for DMSP in Spartina species. Recent observations on tissue culture showed that, while undifferentiated tissue of W. biflora produced DMSP, such material of Spartina alterniflora Loisel. did not. Ongoing studies with tissue culture of both species have opened up new avenues of research on DMSP in higher plants, ultimately to elucidate the functions of this enigmatic compound...|$|R

In addition, the Mn-sensitive var. Kneja 605 with markedly expressed first visible Mn toxicity symptoms had higher levels of total phenolic acids than var.

In contrast, non-protein SH content increased to a higher extent in the Mn-tolerant var. Kneja 434.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{yield of}} wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), an {{important}} crop, is {{adversely affected by}} heat stress in many regions of the world. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying thermotolerance are largely unknown. Results A novel ferritin gene, TaFER, was identified from our previous heat stress-responsive transcriptome analysis of a heat-tolerant wheat cultivar (TAM 107). TaFER was mapped to chromosome 5 B and named TaFER- 5 B. Expression pattern analysis revealed that TaFER- 5 B was induced by heat, polyethylene glycol (PEG), H 2 O 2 and Fe-ethylenediaminedi(o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid (Fe-EDDHA). To confirm the function of TaFER- 5 B in wheat, TaFER- 5 B was transformed into the wheat cultivar Jimai 5265 (JM 5265), and the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced thermotolerance. To examine whether the function of ferritin from mono- and dico-species is conserved, TaFER- 5 B was transformed into Arabidopsis, and overexpression of TaFER- 5 B functionally complemented the heat stress-sensitive phenotype of a ferritin-lacking mutant of Arabidopsis. Moreover, TaFER- 5 B is essential for protecting cells against heat stress associated with protecting cells against ROS. In addition, TaFER- 5 B overexpression also enhanced drought, oxidative and <b>excess</b> iron stress <b>tolerance</b> associated with the ROS scavenging. Finally, TaFER- 5 B transgenic Arabidopsis and wheat plants exhibited improved leaf iron content. Conclusions Our results suggest that TaFER- 5 B {{plays an important role}} in enhancing tolerance to heat stress and other abiotic stresses associated with the ROS scavenging...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{radiotherapy}} (RT) {{have allowed}} an increased proportion {{of lung cancer}} patients to be treated curatively. High doses delivered to critical thoracic organs can result in <b>excess</b> mortality with <b>tolerance</b> doses poorly defined. This work presents a novel method of identifying anatomical dose-sensitive regions within the thorax. A high-resolution, normal-tissue dosimetric analysis was performed to identify regions in the heart that correlate with poorer survival. A total of 1101 patients treated with curative-intent RT were selected and all computed tomography imaging and dose distributions were deformed to a reference. Mean dose distributions were created for patients who survived versus {{those who did not}} at a set time point. Statistical significance of dose differences was investigated with permutation testing. The dose received by the most statistically significant region of the thorax was collected in all patients and included in a multivariate survival analysis. The permutation testing showed a highly significant region across the base of the heart, where higher doses were associated with worse patient survival (p < 0. 001). Cox-regression multivariate analysis showed region dose, tumour volume, performance status and nodal stage were significant factors associated with survival, whereas cardiac mean dose, V 5 and V 30 showed no significance. Survival curves, controlling for these factors, were plotted with patients receiving doses greater than 8. 5 Gy to the identified region showing worse survival (log-rank p < 0. 001, hazard ratio 1. 2). The application of this novel methodology in lung cancer patients identifies the base of the heart as a dose-sensitive region for the first tim...|$|R
40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} the hyperbaric index (HBI) for first trimester prediction of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. Methods Participants were low-risk and high-risk nulliparous women and high-risk multiparous women, and were recruited between April 2004 and June 2006. At a gestational age of 9 weeks (range 8 - 11 weeks), blood pressure (BP) was measured first by sphygmomanometry and thereafter by ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) for 48 h. The first 90 low-risk women who had an uneventful pregnancy formed the reference group for calculation of a time-specified tolerance interval with 90 % confidence limits. In the validation group, consisting of the remaining women, the HBI was calculated as the time-specified BP <b>excess</b> over this <b>tolerance</b> limit for SBP, DBP and mean arterial pressure. Results The validation group contained 101 women. Fifteen women developed preeclampsia and 13 developed gestational hypertension. For preeclampsia, the maximum HBI had the best predictive capacity with a sensitivity of 73 % and a specificity of 86 %. However, the difference with standard ABPM measurement or sphygmomanometry was small with a sensitivity between 75 and 73 % and a specificity between 86 and 95 %. The predictive efficacy for gestational hypertension was poor with all methods (sensitivity between 54 and 77 %, specificity between 41 and 78 %). Conclusion Standardized sphygmomanometry, ABPM measurement and the HBI calculated from 48 -h ABPM had a comparable, restricted predictive efficacy. The high predictive value of HBI as observed in earlier studies could not be reproduced. J Hypertens 28 : 127 - 134 (C) 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkin...|$|R
40|$|Excess {{cortisol}} {{has been}} demonstrated to impair hepatic and extrahepatic insulin action. To determine whether glucose effectiveness and, in terms of endogenous glucose release (EGR), gluconeogenesis, also are altered by hypercortisolemia, eight healthy subjects were studied after overnight infusion with hydrocortisone or saline. Glucose effectiveness was assessed by a combined somatostatin and insulin infusion protocol to maintain insulin concentration at basal level {{in the presence of}} prandial glucose infusions. Despite elevated insulin concentrations (P < 0. 05), hypercortisolemia resulted in higher glucose (P < 0. 05) and free fatty acid concentrations (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, basal insulin concentrations were higher during hydrocortisone than during saline infusion (P < 0. 01), indicating the presence of steroid-induced insulin resistance. Postabsorptive glucose production (P = 0. 64) and the fractional contribution of gluconeogenesis to EGR (P = 0. 33) did not differ on the two study days. During the prandial glucose infusion, the integrated glycemic response above baseline was higher in the presence of hydrocortisone than during saline infusion (P < 0. 05), implying a decrease in net glucose effectiveness (4. 42 ± 0. 52 vs. 6. 65 ± 0. 83 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1; P < 0. 05). To determine whether this defect is attributable to an impaired ability of glucose to suppress glucose production, to stimulate its own uptake, or both, glucose turnover and "hot" (labeled) indexes of glucose effectiveness (GE) were calculated. Hepatic GE was lower during cortisol than during saline infusion (2. 39 ± 0. 24 vs. 3. 82 ± 0. 51 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1; P < 0. 05), indicating a defect in the ability of glucose to restrain its own production. In addition, in the presence of excess cortisol, glucose disappearance was inappropriate for the prevailing glucose concentration, implying a decrease in glucose clearance (P < 0. 05). The decrease in glucose clearance was confirmed by the higher increment in [3 - 3 H]glucose during hydrocortisone than during saline infusion (P < 0. 05), despite the administration of identical tracer infusion rates. In conclusion, short-term hypercortisolemia in healthy individuals with normal -cell function decreases insulin action but does not alter rates of EGR and gluconeogenesis. In addition, cortisol impairs the ability of glucose to suppress its own production, which due to accumulation of glucose in the glucose space results in impaired peripheral glucose clearance. These results suggest that cortisol <b>excess</b> impairs glucose <b>tolerance</b> by decreasing both insulin action and glucose effectiveness...|$|R
