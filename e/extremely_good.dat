5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|As {{the road}} {{condition}} required <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> driving skills, the China Relief Fund decided to test drivers {{and established a}} driving institute on a vacant piece of accessible land behind the Siong Lim Temple. Venerable Pu Liang, the monastery's 10th abbot, supported the China Relief Fund. Qualified volunteers from Nanyang converged in Singapore to form a batch. In 1939, about 3,200volunteers left in nine batches that included not only Chinese men, but also Indians, Malays, and four Chinese women. About 1,000 of them died in service, 1,000 settled in China and others returned to Nanyang after the war. The Venerable {{and two of his}} disciples were later arrested and executed during the Sook Ching Massacre in 1942.|$|E
5|$|First Light {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of two protagonists, Peter, who lives {{with his mother and}} father in New York but is in Greenland for his father's research, and Thea, who lives in an underground colony in Greenland called Gracehope. Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under the ice in Greenland where they could live in peace.|$|E

5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> writer {{and even those}} who do not specialise in {{technical}} fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|While {{walking around}} her house, Thea finds a map {{in her room}} of Gracehope. The map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface. Thea and her cousin Mattias find the tunnel and meet Peter who helps them back to Gracehope. Reaching Gracehope, Peter realizes that several talismans {{of the people are}} in the shape of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, which his mom is studying. After waking up from a headache, Peter finds his mom next to his bed. She explains that she used to live in Gracehope, but was banished with her sister, after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured. She also explains that her research of mitochondrial DNA relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body, which could cause their <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> vision and hearing. In the end, she warns Peter that global warming is causing Gracehope to slowly melt away. The entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape. One obstacle lies in their way: Rowen, Thea and Peter's grandmother who banished Peter's mom and did nothing to help Thea's mom when she was on her deathbed from an illness when she ventured aboveground. Rowen {{is the head of the}} Council in Gracehope and is strictly against going aboveground.|$|E

This study uses a willingness-to-accept experimental second price auction to elicit such values from farmers. Results indicate farm records are extremely valuable and that some diversity in values is explained by the characteristics of the records and farmers. We find that experimental auctions can be used to elicit values for <b>extremely</b> high-valued <b>goods,</b> and we demonstrate how they can be used to value a complex good comprised of many sub-components.

25|$|The board {{determined}} the oxygen tank failure {{was caused by}} an unlikely chain of events. Tanks storing cryogens, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, require either venting, <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> insulation, or both, {{in order to avoid}} excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization of the tanks' contents. The Service Module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain supercritical hydrogen and oxygen for years. Each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen, which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water. The construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible.|$|E
25|$|The first ARM {{application}} {{was as a}} second processor for the BBC Micro, where it helped in developing simulation software to finish development of the support chips (VIDC, IOC, MEMC), and sped up the CAD software used in ARM2 development. Wilson subsequently rewrote BBC BASIC in ARM assembly language. The in-depth knowledge gained from designing the instruction set enabled the code to be very dense, making ARM BBC BASIC an <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> test for any ARM emulator. The original aim of a principally ARM-based computer was achieved in 1987 {{with the release of}} the Acorn Archimedes. In 1992, Acorn once more won the Queen's Award for Technology for the ARM.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{ground-based}} methods of detecting cosmic rays currently in use. The first detection method {{is called the}} air Cherenkov telescope, designed to detect low-energy (<200nbsp&GeV) cosmic rays by means of analyzing their Cherenkov radiation, which for cosmic rays are gamma rays emitted as they travel faster {{than the speed of}} light in their medium, the atmosphere. While these telescopes are <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> at distinguishing between background radiation and that of cosmic-ray origin, they can only function well on clear nights without the Moon shining, and have very small fields of view and are only active for a few percent of the time. Another Cherenkov telescope uses water as a medium through which particles pass and produce Cherenkov radiation to make them detectable.|$|E

25|$|Maharaja Kameshwar Singh Bahadur (ruled 1929 to the {{independence}} of India in 1947) (born 28 November 1907, died 8 November 1964). He was member of the Council of State 1933–1946, member of the Constituent Assembly 1947–1952, and the Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha-Upper House) 1952–1958 and 1960–1962. He {{was the first person}} in India to get a bust of Mahatma Gandhi made, by celebrated artist Clare Sheridan, cousin of Winston Churchill. The bust was presented to the viceroy of India, Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, to be displayed in Government House (now Rashtrapati Bhawan). This was acknowledged by Gandhi in a letter to Lord Linlithgow in 1940. Gandhi, in an interview during his visit to Bihar in 1947, said that the Maharaja Kameshwar Singh was an <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> person and like a son to him.|$|E
25|$|All {{species of}} {{capuchin}} {{tend to have}} a rather similar diet in broad terms; they are omnivores, eating fruits and small invertebrates, small vertebrates and birds' eggs, which they forage {{at all levels of the}} forest, frequently descending to the forest floor. In northern Colombia during the dry season when there are few fruits to be found, the white-fronted capuchin spends more than half its time on the ground, searching for and capturing small prey. It is <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> at manipulating objects, and spends a great deal of time examining dry leaves from which it collects invertebrates (for example small beetles and ants' eggs) from rolled up leaves. It hunts frogs and drinks the water which accumulates in the spaces between the bracteoles of the common plant Phenakospermum guianense, where the frogs hide. Hunting amphibians seems to be a cultural phenomenon which the members of each group learn. P. guianense is commonly present in large, dense stands in some types of forest.|$|E
25|$|Briseis wasn't {{the only}} {{sensation}} surrounding the 1876 Melbourne Cup. Two {{months before the}} event, on Saturday 9 September, the City of Melbourne sailed for Melbourne from Sydney with a cargo including 13 racehorses, {{many of whom were}} considered serious contenders for the Melbourne Cup. The following day the ship ran into a savage storm and was hit by several rogue waves, with Nemesis (the winner of the 1876 AJC Metropolitan Handicap in Randwick, Sydney and favourite for the Cup, owned by John Moffat) and Robin Hood (another favourite, owned by Etienne de Mestre) being among the 11 horses that were killed. Betting on the big race was paralysed. To the dismay and anger of the public, bookmakers, showing no feeling, presented a purse (loaded with coins) to the captain as token of their appreciation for his part in saving them many thousands of pounds in bets already laid on the favourites who had perished. Perhaps they should have kept their money, however. The outsider Briseis comfortably won by 1 length in the biggest field of all time, and in an <b>extremely</b> <b>good</b> time, so {{it is unlikely that the}} horses who perished could have beaten her.|$|E
