60|$|The {{elaborate}} and careful {{examination of the}} whole subject by Mr. Darwin, who has brought together a vast mass of evidence {{from the experience of}} agriculturists and horticulturists, as well as from scientific experimenters, has demonstrated {{that there is no such}} fixed law in nature as was formerly supposed. He shows us that crosses between some varieties are infertile or even sterile, while crosses between some species are quite fertile; and that there are besides a number of curious phenomena connected with the subject which render it impossible to believe that sterility is anything more than an <b>incidental</b> <b>property</b> of species, due to the extreme delicacy and susceptibility of the reproductive powers, and dependent on physiological causes we have not yet been able to trace. Nevertheless, the fact remains that most species which have hitherto been crossed produce sterile hybrids, as in the well-known case of the mule; while almost all domestic varieties, when crossed, produce offspring which are perfectly fertile among themselves. I will now endeavour to give such a sketch of the subject as may enable the reader to see something of the complexity of the problem, referring him to Mr. Darwin's works for fuller details.|$|E

Generally, the area around guyed masts is not developed into private residences, owing to the likelihood of <b>incidental</b> <b>property</b> damage from ice (rare at this latitude) or grease (from periodic maintenance of the guys) falling from the guys to the ground below. Another factor is that the high proximal intensity of radio and television transmissions can be a source of electromagnetic interference, affecting the electronic devices of nearby homeowners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{description}} is given {{of the state}} of the art and the functionality of MAX, an expert system for supporting conceptual design of mechatronic systems. Three model building principles are combined in MAX: – embedding equations in networks: a tight coupling between the graphical model formulation and the underlying equations assists the user in model building and evaluation. – multiple model formulations: one system can be manipulated and inspected simultaneously in multiple formulations (languages). – polymorphic modelling: a submodel definition is divided into a type that defines essential properties, and a specification that defines <b>incidental</b> <b>properties.</b> One type generally has multiple specifications, and types are organised hierarchically inside the library. By means of a simple case study, the utility of these principles is demonstrated. It is shown that MAX is a powerful model building environment that is well adapted to usage by designers. ...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{engineering}} systems requires {{creativity and}} ingenuity, and therefore involves steps that are hardly suitable for automation. However, these steps are complemented by {{a multitude of}} routine tasks. Automation of these routine tasks, if tailored to complement non-automated tasks, allows the modeler {{to focus on the}} creative and innovative aspects of modeling and design. To this end, three important principles for automated modeling have been formulated and incorporated in the MAX (Modeling and Analysis eXpert) system: – The polymorphic modeling concept provides hierarchical models, in which each subsystem consists of a type, defining essential properties, and a specification, defining <b>incidental</b> <b>properties.</b> Subsystem types can be organized hierarchically in a library, and each type can have multiple specifications. – Information about a model is processed using multiple formulations. Different formulations of one model can be used simultaneously. The task at hand determines which formulation is appropriate for inspection and manipulation. – By embedding equations in networks in an intuitively appealing way, MAX provides the same kind of support for network models and equation models. The utility of these concepts is demonstrated in a case study involving a fourth order servo system...|$|R
40|$|The null energy {{condition}} has sweeping {{consequences in}} general relativity. I argue here {{that it has}} been misunderstood as a property exclusively of matter, when in fact it arises only in a theory of both matter and gravity. I then derive an equivalent geometric formulation of the null energy condition from worldsheet string theory, where it arises beautifully as simply Einstein's equations in two dimensions. But further, I show that this condition also has a thermodynamic origin, following from a local version of the second law of thermodynamics, applied to gravitational entropy. Thus, far from being an <b>incidental</b> <b>property</b> of matter, the validity of the null energy condition hints at the deep dual origins of gravity. Comment: 11 pages, Int. J. Mod. Phys.

40|$|The task of {{discovering}} interesting regularities in (large) {{sets of data}} (data mining, knowledge discovery) has recently met with increased interest in Machine Learning in general and in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) in particular. However, {{while there is a}} widely accepted definition for the task of concept learning from examples in ILP, definitions for the data mining task have been proposed only recently. In this paper, we examine these so-called "nonmonotonic semantics" definitions and show that non-monotonicity is only an <b>incidental</b> <b>property</b> of the data mining learning task, and that this task makes perfect sense without such an assumption. We therefore introduce and define a generalized definition of the data mining task called the ILP description learning problem and discuss its properties and relation to the traditional concept learning (prediction) learning problem. Since our characterization is entirely on the level of models, the definition applies independently of the ch [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores habitualness in the English {{language}} and modal verbs used to and would as traditional markers of Habituality. According to Bernard Comrie, Habitual Aspect and Progressive Aspect are sub-categories of imperfectivity. Nevertheless, {{it is essential}} to make a difference between the two. The term habitual refers to plural events, but even so, it {{is not the same as}} accidental event of plurality. The feature common to all habituals, whether or not they are also iterative, is that they describe a situation viewed over an extended period of time. Regarding this, Comrie also reminds that the 'trait referred to is a characteristic feature of the whole period and not an <b>incidental</b> <b>property</b> of the moment' (Comrie, 1976, p. 27). Would and used to are the most explicit markers of habituality and are most commonly used forms to express habitualness. Simple forms are also known to have a habitual meaning, as well as the modal auxiliary can, which may occasionally convey the habitual reading as well. The matter of what exactly makes a feature characteristic for the certain period of time is in fact more conceptual than linguistic. When we manage to determine what repeated action proves to be really habitual, we can then use explicitly habitual forms. Even then, it will be more of a conceptual matter than a linguistic one...|$|E
40|$|Health {{games are}} {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} means to address issues from therapy and rehabilitation. Yet, as a transformative technology, rarely have such games been explored or exploited to assist research into pathologies. Serious games for research (SGR) to uncover pathologies would allow clinicians to develop new differential diagnostics while providing a positive experience for the subject. This paper is not about game design; nevertheless it presents an outlook to considerations that could be taken forward when developing health-based SGRs for pathomechanics, etiopathogenesis and biofeedback. This work relates to preliminary studies on balance challenges manifested in pathologies of the central nervous system. As technology advancements seek to augment human sensory contact between virtual and real worlds this may impact on how virtual environments are used and designed in future. As a consequence heightened sensory (or lack of thereof) may result in falls, for example users with vestibular disorder – because postural stability is a key aspect of motor ability that allows individuals to sustain and maintain the desired physical position of their body Here, our investigation is specific to functional correspondence of the <b>incidental</b> <b>properties</b> in human body sway between healthy subjects and subjects with dyslexia. Our early results suggest postural sway between healthy subjects and those with mild disorders can be distinguished...|$|R
40|$|For most of us, {{recognising}} a face is effortless and instantaneous, {{yet there}} are striking differences between individuals' ability to do so. Although several models of face recognition have been proposed (see Ellis & Young, 1990; Bruce & Young, 1986), no systematic investigation of how individual differences might arise at each stage of face processing exists. To this end, the current thesis sought to identify the sources of individual variability in face processing. Seven stages of face processing consisting of the ability to: (i) disregard <b>incidental</b> <b>properties,</b> (ii) code 1 st order relations, (iii) code 2 nd order relations as well as (iv) retain information in short-term memory, (v) retrieve semantic information (vi) filter out visual distracters and (vii) engage in a task were examined. Using an old/new paradigm, participants were first categorized into 'good' or 'poor' face recognizers. Then their performance under each of the experimental conditions, designed to probe the seven key stages of face recognition, was assessed. Individual differences emerged at four of the seven stages investigated: First, 'good' recognizers were more sensitive to targets than poor performers when 40 faces (high load) had to be remembered, suggesting {{that they were able}} to maintain more faces in memory. Next, good performers were more sensitive to target faces during both upright and inverted conditions suggesting that they shifted more flexibly between local and global processing strategies. Differences in face recognition were also predicted by the ability to filter out visual distracters. That is, good performers became less sensitive to target faces when the number of distracter faces increased from 1 to 5, whilst poor performers did not. This ability also distinguished between face recognition of congenital prosopagnosics and individuals without reported face processing difficulties. The fourth key finding from this thesis is that individual differences in face processing can be partly accounted by volitional factors associated with motivation and task engagement. In sum, this thesis identifies factors which can explain why 'some individuals never forget a face' whilst others do, and establishes conditions under which these differences are eliminated. The following chapters discuss these findings with reference to current theories of face recognition. Wider implications including the development of new strategies with which to enhance face recognition performance are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|The {{rule for}} {{immovable}} property (called real property in common law states) {{is that the}} lex situs applies to all questions of title. Movable property (called personalty in common law states) claims are governed by {{the law of the}} state in which the property is located at the time the rights are supposedly created. An important distinction, however, must be made for a contract which has some <b>incidental</b> effect on <b>property,</b> both immovable and movable, such as a loan with property pledged as a collateral. If the <b>property</b> is <b>incidental</b> to the contract, then the contract is evaluated under traditional choice of law principles for a contract. If, however, {{the primary purpose of the}} contract is to transfer the property, then the entire contract will be evaluated under the law of the state where the property is located.|$|R
40|$|We used {{scanning}} {{in earlier}} research {{as a way}} to show that when people do scan, they take longer to traverse greater distances – as expected if a depictive representation were processed. To our knowledge, no depictive researcher has ever claimed that scanning is always used to inspect images. Critique 2 : Assuming that images have a depictive format does not constrain the possible empirical phenomena. Response: The issue is whether the properties that are intrinsic to depictions can be altered at will. Whereas one can describe an object without noting its orientation, one must include orientation in a depiction – even if orientation is a non-defining, <b>incidental</b> <b>property.</b> So too with size – a depiction (but not a description) must specify a visual angle, even if it serves no purpose in individuating the object. Theories that posit a depictive format make clear predictions that hinge on the geometric properties of the representation (such as the existence of the oblique effect in imagery – poorer acuity for diagonal sets of lines than vertical or horizontal). Critique 3 : Colors cannot be mixed in imagery; Emmert’s law doesn’t hold; and one cannot smoothly shift one’s eyes to track a moving image. Response: Imagery relies primarily on top-down perceptual processes, and thus depictive imagery representations need not affect low-level, bottom-up, processes such as those underlying color mixing, Emmert’s law and smooth pursuit. Conclusion The closing parts of Pylyshyn’s article offer a clear choice. One can attempt to work out a scientific theory, which guides empirical research and leads to new discoveries (as the depictive theory of visual images has), or one can argue that such efforts are a dead end and speculate that imagery is an ineffable phenomenon that cannot be illuminated by scientific research. We leave the choice up to the reader...|$|E
30|$|In sum, if SOD {{reflects}} learned strategies under conscious control, {{we should}} find {{at least a}} modest main effect of spatial learning intentionality on spatial knowledge acquisition, because people with good SOD would learn better under intentional instructions than incidental (it is unclear if people with poor SOD could learn the spatial layout better when intentionally attending to spatial properties of the environment or not). In particular, however, we should find an interaction between learning intentionality and SOD, because individual differences in spatial knowledge acquisition would be diminished when the spatial layout of an environment was experienced incidentally, without the intention to learn it. When people with varying SODs are not told {{to pay attention to}} spatial <b>properties</b> (<b>incidental</b> learning), they would not be as likely to apply their strategies and thus would not differ much in the spatial knowledge they acquire. When the spatial layout of an environment is experienced intentionally, however, individuals with good SOD would learn spatial aspects of environments better because they would better apply particular strategies to learning when told to do so. Therefore, we would expect that we might find a main effect of learning intentionality but that we would definitely find an interaction between SOD and learning intentionality.|$|R
40|$|Persons {{engaged in}} the {{business}} of rendering service are consumers, not retailers, of the tangible personal property which they use incidentally in rendering the service. Tax, accordingly, applies to the sale of the property to them. If in addition to rendering service they regularly sell tangible personal property to consumers, they are retailers with respect to such sales and they must obtain permits, file returns and remit tax measured by such sales. If their purchases of tangible personal property are predominantly for consumption rather than for resale, they should not give resale certificates covering such purchases but should follow the procedure prescribed in the regulation governing “Tax-Paid Purchases Resold. ” The basic distinction in determining whether a particular transaction involves a sale of tangible personal property or the transfer of tangible personal <b>property</b> <b>incidental</b> to the performance of a service is one of the true object of the contract; that is, is the real object sought by the buyer the service per se or the property produced by the service. If the true object of the contract is the service per se, the transaction is not subject to tax even though some tangible personal property is transferred. For example, a firm which performs business advisory, record keeping, payroll and tax services for small businesses and furnishes forms, binders, and other property to its clients as an incident to the rendition of its services is the consumer and not the retailer of such tangible personal property. The true object of the contract between the firm and its client is the performance of a service and not the furnishing of tangibl...|$|R
