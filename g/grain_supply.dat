His position in Judaea further granted him {{the advantage of being}} nearest to the vital province of Egypt, which controlled the <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> to Rome. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire city garrison of Rome.

Vespasian accepted, and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian himself travelled to Alexandria, leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, Diocletian {{effected}} a large {{increase in}} the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it. The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the civil service doubled from 15,000 to 30,000. The classicist Roger Bagnall estimated that there was one bureaucrat for every 5–10,000 people in Egypt based on 400 or 800 bureaucrats for 4 million inhabitants (no one knows the population of the province in 300 AD; Strabo 300 years earlier put it at 7.5 million, excluding Alexandria). (By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century Song dynasty China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50–65 million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per diocese depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13–15,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their comitatus, with the praetorian prefects, with the <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, the extremist {{leaders of the}} {{revolution}} had begun constructing fortifications on Eetioneia, a dominant point in {{the entrance to the}} harbor of Piraeus, ostensibly to protect the harbor against an attack from the fleet at Samos. With internal dissent increasing, they joined these new fortifications to existing walls to form a redoubt defensible against attacks from land or sea, which contained a large warehouse into which the extremists moved most of the city's <b>grain</b> <b>supply.</b> Theramenes protested strongly against the building of this fortification, arguing that its purpose was not to keep the democrats out, but to be handed over to the Spartans; Thucydides testifies that his charges were not without substance, as the extremists were actually contemplating such an action. Initially cautious (as enemies of the regime had been executed before), Theramenes and his party were emboldened and galvanized into action by several events. First, a Peloponnesian fleet, ostensibly dispatched to assist anti-Athenian forces on Euboea, was moving slowly up the coast of the Peloponnese; Theramenes charged that this fleet was planning to seize the fortifications on Eetioneia, in collaboration with the extremists. Second, an Athenian militiaman, apparently acting on orders from conspirators higher in the ranks of the government, assassinated Phrynichus, the leader of the extremist faction. He escaped, but his accomplice, an Argive, was captured; the prisoner, under torture, refused to state the name of his employer. With the extremists unable to take effective action in this case, and with the Peloponnesian fleet overrunning Aegina (a logical stopping point on the approach to Piraeus), Theramenes and his party decided to act.|$|E
25|$|The Palmyrene {{rebellion}} in Egypt had probably reduced the <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> to Rome, thus disaffecting {{the population to}} the emperor.

25|$|After {{the conquest}} of Galilee, Roman General Vespasian {{established}} his headquarters at Caesarea Maritima and camped there until spring 68, preparing for another campaign in Judean and Samarian highlands. Jews, who were driven out of Galilee rebuilt Joppa (Jaffa), which had been destroyed earlier by Cestius Gallus. Surrounded and cut off by the Romans, they rebuilt the city walls, and used a light flotilla to demoralize commerce and interrupt the <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> to Rome from Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|Alaric's {{military}} operations centred {{on the port}} of Rome, through which Rome's <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> had to pass. Alaric's first siege of Rome in 408 caused dreadful famine within the walls. It was ended by a payment that, though large, was less {{than one of the}} richest senators could have produced. The super-rich aristocrats made little contribution; pagan temples were stripped of ornaments to make up the total. With promises of freedom, Alaric also recruited many of the slaves in Rome.|$|E
25|$|Historically most U.S. ethanol {{has come}} from corn and the {{required}} electricity for many distilleries came mainly from coal. Debate ensued about ethanol's sustainability. The primary {{issues related to the}} large amount of arable land required for crops and ethanol production's impact on <b>grain</b> <b>supply,</b> indirect land use change (ILUC) effects, as well as issues regarding its energy balance and carbon intensity considering its full life cycle. Recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some of these concerns.|$|E

25|$|A dairy {{was built}} at the station in 1910. A four-story granary was {{built at the}} station in 1918. With the {{break-out}} of the First World War, the authorities were concerned for the continued <b>grain</b> <b>supply.</b> It was later taken over by Felleskjøpet and {{was used as a}} grain elevator. The station was originally named Kraakstad, but took the modern spelling in April 1021. The line was electrified on 5 December 1958. At the same time direct services to the capital were reintroduced. An interlocking system was installed on 30 May 1959.|$|E
25|$|Genseric settled his Vandals as {{landowners and}} in 442 {{was able to}} {{negotiate}} very favourable peace terms with the Western court.

Huneric's Gothic wife was suspected of trying to poison her father-in-law Genseric; he sent her home without her nose or ears, and his Gothic alliance came to an early end.

25|$|With {{the rise}} of Rome the biggest fleet of quinqueremes {{temporarily}} ruled the Mediterranean, but during the civil wars after Caesar's death the fleet was {{on the wrong side}} and a new warfare with light liburnas was developed. By Imperial times the fleet was relatively small and had mostly political influence, controlling the <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> and fighting pirates, who usually employed light biremes and liburnians. But instead of the successful liburnians of the Greek Civil War, it was again centred around light triremes, but still with many marines. Out of this type of ship, the dromon developed.|$|E

In the same year he was hired as municipal agronomist in Sandar, but he moved to become a teacher at Eidsvoll Folk High School. In 1918 he became a rations inspector in Vestfold county, but from 1919 to 1927 {{he worked at the}} Norwegian College of Agriculture. From 1928 to 1940 he managed the state <b>grain</b> <b>supplies</b> of Oslo and Aker, located at Sinsen, and from 1940 to 1945 he managed Buskerud Agricultural School.

50|$|Equestrians {{were also}} the chief {{financial}} officers (also called procuratores Augusti) of the imperial provinces, and the deputy financial officers of senatorial provinces. At Rome, equestrians filled numerous senior administrative posts such as the emperor's secretaries of state (from the time of Claudius e.g. Correspondence and Treasury) and the praefecti annonae (director of <b>grain</b> <b>supplies).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lucius Minucius Augurinus, as praefectus annonae in 439 BC, {{attempted}} to alleviate a famine by purchasing <b>grain</b> <b>supplies</b> from abroad and regulating grain prices.

25|$|The equestrian {{class was}} one of the two upper social classes of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. Officially, they were the second tier of the elite, behind the patrician or senatorial class. This made them {{relatively}} harmless and consequently, suitable for important offices of state such as Praetorian prefect or governor of Egypt; the former post which {{was in charge of the}} Emperor's personal bodyguard, the latter which controlled the <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> of Rome. A senator who occupied such positions might develop ambitions of making himself emperor, a danger Augustus was well aware of.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 190, Rome was afflicted by a food shortage, for which the praefectus annonae Papirius Dionysius, the {{official}} actually {{in charge of the}} <b>grain</b> <b>supply,</b> contrived to lay the blame on Cleander. At the end of June, a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the Circus Maximus: he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances, but Pertinax, who was now City Prefect of Rome, dispatched the Vigiles Urbani to oppose them. Cleander fled to Commodus, who was at Laurentum in the house of the Quinctilii, for protection, but the mob followed him calling for his head.|$|E
25|$|He {{furthermore}} successfully regulated the <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> of Constantinople, {{which came}} chiefly from Egypt and {{was under the}} authority of the urban prefect. In the past, shortages had occurred {{due to the lack of}} available ships, resulting in famines, the most recent one being in 408. In 409 therefore, Anthemius reorganized the grain transport and granted tax remits to the transporters, took measures to procure grain from elsewhere, and created an emergency fund for the procurement and distribution of corn to the citizens. He also took measures to ensure the regular collection of taxes (409), but in 414, he also gave a tax remit of all arrears for the years 368-407.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Union Navy {{seized control}} {{of much of the}} Confederate {{coastline}} from Virginia to South Carolina. It took over plantations and the abandoned slaves. Federals there began a war-long policy of burning <b>grain</b> <b>supplies</b> up rivers into the interior wherever they could not occupy. The Union Navy began a blockade of the major southern ports and prepared an invasion of Louisiana to capture New Orleans in early 1862.|$|R

25|$|Pompey was {{supposedly}} infatuated with his bride. The personal charms of Julia were remarkable: {{she was a}} kind woman of beauty and virtue; and although policy prompted her union, and she was thirty years younger than her husband, she possessed in Pompey a devoted husband, to whom she was, in return, devotedly attached. A rumor suggested that the aging conqueror was losing interest in politics in favor of domestic life with his young wife. In fact, Pompey {{had been given the}} governorship of Hispania Ulterior, but had been permitted to remain in Rome to oversee the Roman <b>grain</b> <b>supply</b> as curator annonae, exercising his command through subordinates.|$|E
25|$|The war {{lasted for}} about 10 years (from ca. AD 15 to 24) and engaged four {{successive}} Roman proconsuls (governors) {{of the province}} of Africa (modern Tunisia), which, although {{a small part of}} the empire, was economically vital as the source of most of Rome's <b>grain</b> <b>supply.</b> It is unlikely that the Romans were ever in danger of being driven out of the province altogether, although in at least two periods, Tacfarinas' forces greatly outnumbered the Roman garrison. But the incapacity of Tacfarinas' lightly armed forces to defeat the Romans in set-piece battles or to assault Roman fortified points prevented him from achieving a decisive victory. Nevertheless, Tacfarinas' large-scale raids caused severe disruption of the province's grain production, which in turn threatened civil disorder in Rome.|$|E
25|$|With the French Revolution of 1790 making war inevitable, the Navy again {{expanded}} and Harvey {{was subject to}} special request from Admiral Lord Howe who desired him to command the new and powerful 74-gun ship of the line HMS Brunswick in the Channel Fleet.

Howe had been chasing the French fleet protecting the convoy for some days, and several short and sharp actions had been fought without conclusion. On 1 June 1794 however, Howe finally gained the wind on the French and overhauled them in a long line of battle.|$|E
50|$|The game {{consists}} of yearly turns, beginning in 1400; each turn involves {{the allocation of}} grain, counted in steres, and funds, counted in florins, attempting to grow the colony in both population and size. A ruler must ensure that sufficient <b>grain</b> <b>supplies</b> are available to feed his people; by distributing excess grain, a ruler can encourage more citizens to move into his city-state. However, often famine and rats cause grain reserves to diminish.|$|R
