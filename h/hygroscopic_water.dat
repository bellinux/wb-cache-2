The wet boiling point, which is usually much lower (although above most normal service temperatures), refers to the fluid's boiling point after absorbing {{a certain amount of}} moisture. This is several (single digit) percent, varying from formulation to formulation. Glycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are <b>hygroscopic</b> (<b>water</b> absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels.

50|$|Xerocoles get a {{substantial}} amount of <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>water</b> from their food. Many feed on moisture-filled plants: the aardvark obtains water from the wild cucumber and the camel eats succulents and bushes in the winter, getting enough water to go two months without drinking. The oryx eats Acacia leaves late at night, when water content is highest: in the hot, arid daytime the leaves are only 1% water; but in cooler, more humid night the leaves are 40% water. Some xerocoles are able to obtain water from halophytic (saltwater) plants, as they can metabolize high amounts of oxalic acid and produce very concentrated urine. The chisel-toothed kangaroo rat also mitigates the saltiness of the halophyte it eats (the shadscale) by using its broad, sharp lower incisors to scrape off the leaves' salty outerlayer to reach the less-salty center.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{texture and}} the soil water {{characteristic}} are key properties {{used to estimate}} flow and transport parameters. Determination of clay content is therefore critical for understanding of plot-scale soil heterogeneity. With increasing interest in proximal soil sensing, there {{is the need to}} relate obtained signals to soil properties of interest. Inference of soil texture, especially clay mineral content, from instrument response from electromagnetic induction and radiometric methods is of substantial interest. However, the cost of soil sampling and analysis required to link proximal measurements and soil properties, for example, clay mineral content, can sometimes outweigh the benefits of using a fast proximal technique. In this paper, we propose that determination of a soil's <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>water</b> content at 50 % atmospheric relative humidity (RH 50), which is time and cost efficient, and particularly suitable for developing countries, can act as a useful surrogate for clay content in interpreting soil spatial patterns based on proximal signals. We used standard clays such as kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite to determine the water release characteristic as a function of <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>water</b> content. We also determined clay content of soils from temperate (Arizona, United States) and tropical (Trinidad) regions using the hydrometer method and <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>water</b> content for soils equilibrated at RH 50. We found linear dependence of clay percentage and RH 50 for a range of soil mineralogies. <b>Hygroscopic</b> <b>water</b> measurements offer an inexpensive and simple way to estimate site-specific clay mineral content that in turn can be used to interpret geophysical signal data in reconnaissance surveys...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} permittivity of soil is {{a function}} of the water content, which facilitates water content measurements. The permittivity of soil is also a function of the frequency of the applied electric field. This frequency dependence can be described by the relationship between the dielectric relaxation frequency and the activation enthalpy of the water, which in turn is related to the soil matric pressure. The activahas tion enthalpy or soil matrix pressure is a measure of the binding forces acting on a water molecule in the soil matrix. Each water molecule is differently bound, varying from tightly bound to free water. The permittivity of the bulk soil results from the contribution of all the water molecules in the soil matrix. Therefore, the permittivity of soil as a function of frequency is related to the soil matrix pressure. It is realistic to consider <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>water</b> as ice like. A relatively sharp transition can be observed from free to <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>water</b> at matric pressure – 100 MPa corresponding to relaxation frequency ƒr » 8 GHz. Therefore, for the interpretation of dielectric data using a dielectric mixture equation, the water content of soil can be split conveniently in “free” water and “hygroscopic” water...|$|E

However, the decrease in humidity and temperature may be slow and the benefit on nebulization is questionable [23]. An effective way to reduce humidity during nebulization is to use a dedicated dry ventilator circuit during nebulization.

The high sensitivity of the technique together with the wide range of probed time scales makes it a powerful method for investigating the relaxation spectra of liquids. One particularly important class of glass-forming liquids that is often studied using this technique consists of liquids dominated by hydrogen (H) bond interactions. When investigating such liquids, particular caution has to be taken during sample preparation due to their often highly <b>hygroscopic</b> nature. <b>Water</b> can easily be absorbed from the atmosphere, and dielectric spectroscopy is a very sensitive probe of such contamination due to the large dipole moment of water.
