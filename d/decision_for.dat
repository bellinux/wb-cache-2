40|$|In both {{organizational}} and social arenas, people make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> themselves {{and for other}} people. But research in decision making has provided little input into how these decisions are psychologically different. In this paper, I propose that decisions- depending on whether people are deciding for themselves or others-vary according to regulatory focus, such that, people who make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> themselves are in a prevention focus, whereas people who make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> others are in a promotion focus. Drawing on regulatory focus, in particular work on errors of omission and commission, I hypothesize that people who make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> others experience {{a reversal of the}} choice overload effect. In seven studies, including a field study and a mini meta-analysis, I found that people who make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> themselves are less satisfied after selecting among many compared to few options, yet, people who make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> others are more satisfied after selecting among many compared to few options. Implications and suggestions for other differences in self-other decision making are discussed. 2020 - 10 - 2...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an incentivized {{experiment}} {{to investigate the}} degree of loss aversion when people make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> their current selves and future selves under risk. We find that when participants make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> their future selves, they are less loss averse compared to when they make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> their current selves. This {{finding is consistent with}} the interpretation of loss aversion as a bias in decision-making driven by emotions, which are reduced when making <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> future selves. Our findings endorsed the external validity of previous studies on the impact of emotion on loss aversion in a real world decision-making environment...|$|R

5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} theoretical <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> White is {{to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
40|$|Risky {{decisions}} {{are at the}} core of economic theory. While many of these {{decisions are}} taken on behalf of others rather than for oneself, the existing literature finds mixed results on whether people take more or less risk for others then for themselves. Recent studies suggest that taking <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> others reduces loss aversion, thereby increasing risk taking on behalf of others. To test this, we elicit loss aversion in three treatments: making risky <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> oneself, for one other subject, or <b>for</b> the <b>decision</b> maker and another person combined. We find a clear treatment effect when making <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> others but not when making <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> both...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that people make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> others as often as they make <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> themselves, little is known about how <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> others are {{different}} from those made for the self. In two experiments, we investigated the effect of social distance (i. e., making <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> oneself, a friend, or a stranger) on risk preferences in both gain and loss situations. We found that people were more risk averse in gain situations when they made <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> themselves than for a stranger (Studies 1 and 2), but were equally risk averse for themselves and their friends (Study 2). However, people were more risk seeking in loss situations when they made <b>decisions</b> <b>for</b> themselves than for their friends as well as for a stranger, and were more risk seeking for their friends than for a stranger (Study 2). Furthermore, the effect of social distance on risk preferences was stronger in loss than in gain situations. Mediation analysis indicated that outcome-induced loss aversion was responsible for effects of social distance on risk preferences. These findings demonstrate that social distance influences risk preferences via perceived loss aversion, which sheds new light on self-other differences in decision making...|$|R

He earned a gold medal as a member of the 1964 Olympic basketball team and was the NCAA Player of the Year in 1965, when Princeton finished third in the NCAA Tournament.

In March 2010, HBO's decision to greenlight the series including the pilot was announced, with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010. HBO however demanded extensive reshoot of the pilot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped. A cameo appearance by George RR Martin as a Pentoshi nobleman at Daenerys's wedding filmed in Morocco was therefore also cut. In all 90 percent of the pilot was re-shot in 2010, with some cast changes and a different director.|$|E
