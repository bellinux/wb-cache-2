Secretary of the Interior Cecil D.

25|$|In February 1983 the two <b>assistant</b> <b>directorates,</b> {{created in}} 1973, were merged to promote {{efficiency}} {{and recognize that}} the cultural resource programs associated with both directorates were interdependent. Rogers, described as a skilled administrator who was sensitive {{to the need for}} the NPS to work with SHPO, academia and local governments, was picked to lead this newly merged associate directorate. When the NPS had reorganized in the mid-1960s it had eliminated the positions of regional historians and chosen instead to merge those positions into Utley's Washington office. The 1983 reorganization of the directorates in control of Register activities represented a return to the organization pre-MISSION 66.|$|R

40|$|MM thesis - P&DMEvaluation of {{projects}} and programmes in most developing countries has consistently been a challenge from {{various factors such as}} capacity, and institutional constraints. Ghana is no exception to these challenges for developing technical capacity for evaluation in the public sector. In this study, technical capacity refers to human capacity of individuals within organisations involved in executing Monitoring and Evaluation functions. The study sought to establish the challenges for building and developing technical capacity for evaluation in the public sector. In addition, it sought to recommend interventions to improve technical capacity building challenges in the public sector. A qualitative research approach was used with the National Development Planning Commission as a case study. The study focused on <b>directorates</b> and technical <b>assistants</b> who are members of the senior management service. The study established that although developing technical capacity has an important role to play in developing the nation, its implementation is hindered by several challenges that were identified as the main challenges in the implementation of developing and building technical capacity, these include: Inadequate resources and managerial authority; political interference; inadequate leadership; inadequate training and development; systems and processes challenges; organisational culture and a weak implementation strategy. The study recommends interventions to improve the developing and building technical capacity. These include: the development of a comprehensive technical evaluation capacity development strategy that takes cognisance of the identified challenges and the provision of adequate political and administrative leadership...|$|R
