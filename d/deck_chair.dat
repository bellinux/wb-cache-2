An autopsy of Jones's body also showed levels of the barbiturate Pentobarbital, {{which may have been}} lethal to humans who had not developed physiological tolerance.|$|E

25|$|Written in 17 {{days in a}} <b>deck</b> <b>chair</b> on Morecambe Pier, Look Back in Anger was a {{strongly}} autobiographical piece based on Osborne's unhappy marriage to actress Pamela Lane and their life in cramped accommodation in Derby. While Osborne aspired towards a career in theatre, Lane was more practical and materialistic, not taking Osborne's ambitions seriously while cuckolding him with a local dentist. It also draws from Osborne's earlier life; for example, the wrenching speech of witnessing a loved one's death was a replay {{of the death of}} his father, Thomas.|$|E
25|$|With {{the illness}} still afflicting him, Witt decided {{to travel to}} Europe in late spring of 1875 to seek the {{restoration}} of his health. He sailed for Europe on the SS Suevia. A severe storm struck the ship {{after a few days}} at sea. The storm appeared to have significantly abated, and Witt ventured on deck with other passengers on April 28. He was thrown from his <b>deck</b> <b>chair</b> by a sudden wave, and injured his head. The wound appeared minor, but around the following day he began to suffer from a migraine. He was attended to by his own personal physician and the ship's doctor. He appeared to rally, but died peacefully in his sleep at about 11 PM local ship's time on April 29.|$|E
2500|$|Written in 17 {{days in a}} <b>deck</b> <b>chair</b> on Morecambe pier where Osborne was {{performing}} in a creaky rep show called Seagulls over Sorrento, Look Back in Anger was largely autobiographical, based on his time living, and arguing, with Pamela Lane in cramped accommodation in Derby while she cuckolded him with a local dentist. It was submitted to agents all over London and returned with great rapidity. In his autobiography, Osborne writes: [...] "The {{speed with which it}} had been returned was not surprising, but its aggressive dispatch did give me a kind of relief. It was like being grasped at the upper arm by a testy policeman and told to move on". Finally it was sent to the newly formed English Stage Company at London's Royal Court Theatre.|$|E

60|$|MacShaughnassy, on the contrary, was {{of opinion}} {{that we should}} work better on a houseboat.
