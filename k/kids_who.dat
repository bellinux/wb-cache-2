Teens and young adults may be pulled out of high school from the ages as young as 15.

The radio dispatcher had alerted {{to be on the}} lookout for a black suspect, so they drove past him without stopping; the mix-up in descriptions remains unexplained to this day. A search ensued, but no possible suspects were found. The three teen witnesses worked with a police artist to prepare a composite sketch of Stine's killer; then, a few days later, this police artist returned, working with the witnesses to prepare a second composite sketch of the killer.|$|E

25|$|An {{engineer}} who {{is often seen}} hanging out with Wally. He is referenced by name more often in older comics, {{but he is still}} seen occasionally now. He has been accepted into Dilbert's clique. He has been fired and killed numerous times (for example, being pushed {{down a flight of stairs}} and becoming possessed), so it is likely that he is rehired and brought back to life in a similar way to the other main characters who die and come back. In addition to this, he is often promoted and given benefits over the other employees. Ted has a wife and <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> are referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion. Adams refers to him as Ted the Generic Guy because whenever he needs to fire or kill someone he uses Ted, but slowly over time Ted has become his own character.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fictional}} Inkwell Isle, Cuphead {{and his brother}} Mugman are two fun-loving <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> live {{under the watchful eye}} of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the {{brothers}} wander into the Devil's Casino and play craps. When the brothers go on a winning streak, the casino's manager King Dice calls upon the Devil, who raises the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win another time, they will own the entire casino; if not, the Devil will have their souls. Cuphead rolls snake eyes and he and Mugman must give up their souls. The brothers beg for mercy, so the Devil makes a deal with them: collect the contracts of other inhabitants of Inkwell Isle who have lost their souls by midnight the next day, and he might let them off the hook. They visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest.|$|E
