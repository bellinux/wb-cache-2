[...] Chino Moreno, vocalist of Deftones, {{rejected the}} nu metal label saying [...] "We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't {{going to be with}} them". As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn's 2002 album Untouchables; he said, [...] "As Korn go on, it's the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan ? Thirty? How long has <b>it</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> he lived with his parents?" [...] Davis responded saying, [...] "Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood." [...] Moreno also said, [...] "A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn't exist if it weren't for me, straight up!". Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with NME, saying [...] "We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that." [...] Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he [...] "never liked or condoned" [...] the term [...] "nu metal" [...] in any way, and said he does not understand [...] "how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into" [...] the nu metal genre. Mike Wengren of Disturbed said that he doesn't think Disturbed [...] "were ever a nu-metal band to begin with".|$|E

Of all the creatures of the wild, there was none Tublat so cordially hated as he did this hideous, hairless, white-skinned, caricature of an ape. But for Tarzan's nimbleness, and the zealous watchfulness of savage Kala's mother love, Tublat would long since have rid himself of this stain upon his family escutcheon. So long had <b>it</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> Tarzan {{became a member of}} the tribe, that Tublat had forgotten the circumstances surrounding the entrance of the jungle waif into his family, with the result that he now imagined that Tarzan was his own offspring, adding greatly to his chagrin.|$|E

Bearded and gray was Manu, the monkey, and to his dim old eyes came the fire of recollection of those days when Tarzan of the Apes had ruled supreme, Lord of the Jungle, over all the myriad life that trod the matted vegetation between the boles of the great trees, or flew or swung or climbed in the leafy fastness upward to the very apex of the loftiest terraces.|$|E

60|$|Dust! They were dust on {{the floor}} or {{at the foot of}} the shelf, and their habitations and {{utensils}} endured. Venters felt the sublimity of that marvelous vaulted arch, and it seemed to gleam with a glory of something that was gone. How many years had passed since the cliff-dwellers gazed out across the beautiful valley as he was gazing now? How long had <b>it</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> women ground grain in those polished holes? What time had rolled by since men of an unknown race lived, loved, fought, and died there? Had an enemy destroyed them? Had disease destroyed them, or only that greatest destroyer--time? Venters saw a long line of blood-red hands painted low down upon the yellow roof of stone. Here was strange portent, if not an answer to his queries. The place oppressed him. It was light, but full of a transparent gloom. It smelled of dust and musty stone, of age and disuse. It was sad. It was solemn. It had the look of a place where silence had become master and was now irrevocable and terrible and could not be broken. Yet, at the moment, from high up in the carved crevices of the arch, floated down the low, strange wail of wind--a knell indeed for all that had gone.|$|E

Why; how long had <b>it</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> she had left their parish? It was still October, and she had been there just before the murder--only the other day! Captain Walter Marrable! No; he didn't think he had ever heard of him. Some fellow with a moustache and a military strut--just the man that he had always hated; one of a class which, with nothing real to recommend it, is always interfering with the happiness of everybody. It was in some such light as this that Mr. Gilmore at present regarded Captain Marrable. How could such a man make a woman happy,--a fellow who probably had no house nor home in which to make her comfortable? Staying with his uncle the clergyman! Poor Gilmore expressed a wish that the uncle the clergyman had been choked before he had entertained such a guest. Then he read the concluding sentence of poor Mary's letter, in which she expressed a hope that they might be friends. Was there ever such cold-blooded trash? Friends indeed! What sort of friendship could there be between two persons, one of whom had made the other so wretched,--so dead as was he at present! ...|$|E

S. 137 [1803]) is the single most {{important}} decision of the United States Supreme Court and, with its bicentennial at hand, that conclusion will, no doubt, be stated and restated many times. Those of us who teach American government and politics have explained its significance in establishing judicial review countless times to count-less students across the years, and we thought we knew what we were talking about. Yet, how long has <b>it</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> we actually sat down and read the opin-ion? How long has <b>it</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> we went beyond the conventional textbook wisdom and read it afresh? After having taught American government and poli-tics off and on for 30 years, I recently sat down and read Chief Justice John Marshall’s masterpiece from start to fin-ish for the first time since I was in graduate school and, in doing so, I made an interesting discovery: in writ-ing his opinion, Marshall seriously mis-quoted the relevant part of Article III of the Constitution, and I believe he did so intentionally, to serve his purpose.

40|$|How {{long has}} <b>it</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> {{we knew that}} age-imposed changes in the circulatory milieu {{are to blame for}} the {{progressive}} attrition of organs and degenerative disorders that invariably accompany human aging? Some say, we've known for millennia, from the Ancient Greeks and Medieval stories of vampires. Others say that it was McKay’s 1950 s experiments, where old rats were sutured with young rats to establish parabiosis, aka, a joined blood circulation that suggested better health of largely non-cellular cartilage [2]. Yet, another answer is that it has been 10 years since the paradigm-shifting observations that in heterochronic parabiosis, the young systemic milieu rapidly and broadly rejuvenates organ stem cells in muscle, brain/hippocampus and liver, while the old systemic milieu rapidly and broadly ages myogenesis, liver regeneration and neurogenesis, with the responsible biochemical pathways being re-set to their young or old states ([1], and Figure 1). What paradigms have been shifted? Before this work, the prevalent theories of tissue decline in aging focused on cumulative cell intrinsic changes as culprits: telomere attrition, DNA damage, oxidativ...|$|E
