5|$|Spiders often attach <b>highly</b> <b>visible</b> silk bands, called decorations or stabilimenta, {{to their}} webs. Field {{research}} suggests that webs with more decorative bands captured more prey per hour. However, a laboratory study showed that spiders reduce the building of these decorations if they sense the presence of predators.|$|E

At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the lunch counters were a good objective because they were <b>highly</b> <b>visible,</b> easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.|$|E

25|$|The funeral {{procession}} is a <b>highly</b> elaborate, <b>visible</b> and competitive public spectacle, designed {{to impress the}} public with altars, canopies, flowers, paper figurines, burnt offerings and most importantly, with the display of impressive tomb figurines. The competitive nature of {{funeral procession}}s got so out of hand, that the emperor had to issue imperial edicts to regulate the quantity and size of tomb figurines, according to the deceased’s social status. Tomb artefacts were meant to glorify its deceased master and the master’s living family.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{represents a}} <b>highly</b> enhanced <b>visible</b> light photocatalytic removal of 450 ppb level of nitric oxide (NO) in air by utilizing flower-like hierarchical porous BiOI/BiOCl composites synthesized by a room temperature template free method {{for the first}} time. The facile synthesis method avoids high temperature treatment, use of organic precursors and production of undesirable organic byproducts during synthesis process. The result indicated that the as-prepared BiOI/BiOCl composites samples were solid solution and were self-assembled hierarchically with single-crystal nanoplates. The aggregation of the self-assembled nanoplates resulted {{in the formation of}} 3 D hierarchical porous architecture containing tri-model mesopores. The coupling to BiOI with BiOCl led to down-lowered valence band (VB) and up-lifted conduction band (CB) in contrast to BiOI, making the composites suitable for visible light excitation. The BiOI/BiOCl composites samples exhibited <b>highly</b> enhanced <b>visible</b> light photocatalytic activity for removal of NO in air due to the large surface areas and pore volume, hierarchical structure and modified band structure, exceeding that of P 25, BiOI, C-doped TiO 2 and Bi 2 WO 6. This research results could provide a cost-effective approach for the synthesis of porous hierarchical materials and enhancement of photocatalyst performance for environmental and energetic applications owing to its low cost and easy scaling up.

50|$|Perceived {{popularity}} {{is used to}} describe those individuals who are known among their peers as being popular. Unlike sociometric popularity, perceived {{popularity is}} often associated with aggression and dominance and is not dependent on prosocial behaviors. This form of popularity is often explored by the popular media. Notable works dealing with perceived popularity include Mean Girls, Odd Girl Out, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Individuals who have perceived popularity are often <b>highly</b> socially <b>visible</b> and frequently emulated but rarely liked. Since perceived popularity is a measure of visible reputation and emulation, this form of popularity is most openly discussed, agreed upon within a group, and what most people refer to when they call someone popular.|$|R

Despite career setbacks, Mansfield remained a <b>highly</b> <b>visible</b> celebrity during the early 1960s, through her publicity antics and stage performances. In early 1967, Mansfield filmed her last film role: a cameo in A Guide for the Married Man, a comedy starring Walter Matthau, Robert Morse, and Inger Stevens. Mansfield is listed as one of the technical advisers, along with other popular stars in the opening credits.|$|E

Along with later public figures who became associated with HIV/AIDS, such as the Ray brothers, Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe, The Brady Bunch's Robert Reed, Tim Richmond, Elizabeth Glaser, Liberace, Freddie Mercury and Charlie Sheen, Ryan White helped to increase public awareness that HIV/AIDS was a significant epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Since {{birds are}} <b>highly</b> <b>visible</b> and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E

Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at <b>highly</b> <b>visible</b> points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities.

The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a <b>highly</b> <b>visible</b> presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E

5|$|Military {{camouflage}} was {{spurred by}} the increasing range and accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with the rifle made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the First World War. On land, artists such as André Mare designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees. At sea, merchant ships and troop carriers were painted in dazzle patterns that were <b>highly</b> <b>visible,</b> but designed to confuse enemy submarines as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the Second World War, a variety of camouflage schemes were used for aircraft and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{preparation}} and characterization of C@Ag/TiO 2 nanospheres compound photocatalysts was reported. C@Ag nanosphere was firstly synthesized via hydrothermal reaction, {{and followed by}} a sol-gel process to obtain the functionalized C@Ag/TiO 2 nanosphere which has <b>highly</b> efficient <b>visible</b> light catalytic ability towards methyl orange (MO). The morphology of the obtained compound was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technologies. From which {{we can see that}} the as-prepared samples show a spherical structure with a diameter of approximately 200 nm, and the silver particle in core was about 10 nm. The cata lytic ability of the synthesized photocatalysts under visible light irradiation shows that C@Ag/TiO 2 possesses higher photocatalytic activity towards MO degradation than that of N-P 25 (TiO 2). Furthermore, the C@Ag/TiO 2 photocatalysts exhibited excellent reusability with almost no change after five runs. Finally, the possible photocatal y tic mechanism of catalyst under visible light was discussion and proposed. </div...|$|R
