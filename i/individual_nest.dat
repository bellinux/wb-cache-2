50|$|Macrotera portalis are {{communal}} bees {{that are}} ground nesting, with many females often {{sharing the same}} nest while provisioning their own <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> cells. The species is found in arid grassland and desert regions in northern Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico. Macrotera portalis nests contain tunnels that consist of pollen and nectar in storage for development of larva. The species collect pollen only from plants in the genus Sphaeralcea. The nests are usually recycled for several generations and last {{for a long period}} of time.One study by Cornell professor Bryan Danforth demonstrated that nests were shallow, at most 15 cm deep, with some complex nests that contained more than 200 cells and an area with a 20 cm diameter. The main tunnels was absent of loose soil and stretched straight down with waterproof lining coated the cells. The nests were open during nesting period and did not have tumuli. Completed cells can range to a great number, with over 200 in some nests. Generally, there are about 2 to 29 adult females in one nest. Nests generally stay in the same location each year since nests are isolated, large and some prepupae are in diapause for more than a year. Further, since nests are used frequently, bees within a nests may be very closely related to each other.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Monitoring {{sentinel}} species in environments undergoing ecosystem change {{is essential to}} understanding how the organisms living in these habitats will respond. Seabirds are considered sensitive to shifts in their local environment and {{have been used as}} sentinels but many species occupy remote locations, posing logistical challenges for long-term studies. Remote camera techniques offer a possible alternative to other methods of monitoring seabirds during their breeding seasons. To investigate the use of remote camera techniques to study cliff-nesting seabirds and identify factors influencing their productivity, a remote video-camera system was used to collect 6 years (2010 - 2015) of reproductive data from a sub-colony of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) in Resurrection Bay near Seward, Alaska. The first objective was to refine remote camera techniques by investigating the influence of 1) observation frequency and 2) observation type (video or still image) on estimates of productivity. Observation frequency from daily up to one week intervals did not {{have a significant effect on}} estimates of productivity. Observations made twice annually were found to be significantly different from estimates of productivity calculated using daily observation frequency. Still image and video methods of observation did not significantly affect estimates of productivity. The second objective was to identify factors that influence reproductive success of kittiwakes at Cape Resurrection by 1) determining the effect of nest characteristics on <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> success, 2) identifying the effect of behavior of breeding adults during the incubation period on hatch success, 3) determining the effect of seasonal weather patterns on loss events, and 4) investigating the relationship between annual productivity and sea surface temperature (SST) over a 5 year period. Model analysis of nest characteristics on <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> success indicated that mainland/island location and nest height above water influenced <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> success. Behavior of breeding adults did not influence hatch success. Nest loss was influenced by average wind speeds. Annual SST was not correlated with annual productivity over a 5 year time period. Based on the results of this study, I recommend remote camera technologies for the purpose of studying cliff-nesting seabirds in remote locations and found them a useful tool for identifying and tracking factors that influence the breeding success of these populations over a multiyear time period...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{link between}} {{individual}} variation in resource selection (e. g., functional response) and fitness creates {{a foundation for}} understanding wildlife-habitat relationships. Although many anthropogenic activities adversely affect these relationships, it is largely unknown whether projects implemented to benefit wildlife populations actually achieve this outcome. For sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) obligate species such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse), expansion of juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon-pine (Pinus spp.; conifers) woodlands into sagebrush ecosystems {{has been identified as}} a conservation threat. This threat is intensified when a sagebrush ecosystem is bounded by naturally unsuitable habitats. As such, federal, state, and private land managers have implemented landscape-level management to remove conifers on thousands of hectares of sagebrush habitat across the western United States. Despite the scale of contemporary conifer treatments, little was previously known whether sage-grouse will occupy these manipulated landscapes and whether occupancy has consequences on fitness components. To address these questions, we monitored nest and brood success rates for 96 radio-marked sage-grouse from 2012 - 2015 that inhabited conifer-dominated landscapes in the Box Elder Sage-grouse Management Area in Utah where mechanical conifer removal projects were completed. We then linked sage-grouse resource selection to <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> (n = 95) and brood (n = 56) success by incorporating random-slope Resource Selection Functions as explanatory predictors in a logistic brood success model. Using the novel approach of random slope covariates, we demonstrated that sage-grouse selected for nest and brooding sites closer to conifer removal areas and that the probability of <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> and brood success declined (β = − 0. 10 and β = − 0. 74, respectively) as sage-grouse females selected sites farther from conifer removal areas.

40|$|Monitoring {{of animal}} populations is {{essential}} for conservation management. Various techniques are available to assess spatiotemporal patterns of species distribution and abundance. Nest surveys are often used for monitoring great apes. Quickly developing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{can be used to}} complement these ground-based surveys, especially for covering large areas rapidly. Aerial surveys have been used successfully to detect the nests of orang-utans. It is unknown if such an approach is practical for African apes, which usually build their nests at lower heights, where they might be obscured by forest canopy. In this 2 -month study, UAV-derived aerial imagery was used for two distinct purposes: testing the detectability of chimpanzee nests and identifying fruiting trees used by chimpanzees in LoangoNational Park (Gabon). Chimpanzee nest data were collected through two approaches: we located nests on the ground and then tried to detect them in UAV photos and vice versa.

40|$|Although snow petrels are {{ubiquitous}} {{around the}} Antarctic, population estimates of this “not so charismatic” top predator are generally limited. Such information is highly valuable for the {{monitoring and management}} of Antarctic and Southern Ocean ecosystems, especially in a climate change context. There {{is a need to}} complement long–term temporal demographic information obtained at a limited number of monitoring sites with spatial distribution data. Systematic surveys of snow petrels and Wilson’s storm petrels were undertaken at Casey (2002 - 2003) and Mawson (2004 - 2005) in order to provide better regional population estimates and test the performance of predictive distribution models based on topographic and substrate variables for refining such estimates. As habitat selection modelling is rarely used in Antarctic regions, methodological developments focus on dealing with the peculiarities of a semi-colonial hollow-nesting species, testing habitat selection modelling approaches and comparing the output of four types of models (Generalized Linear and Generalized Additive Models, Classification Trees and Ecological Niche Factor Analysis) across a range of scales. Snow petrel nest distribution was directly related {{to the nature of the}} rock substrate and to major topographic/geomorphological parameters such as hill slope and the direction of the prevailing winds. Model performance varied with the scale at which models were implemented, suggesting that nest selection processes happen predominantly at the habitat unit and <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> scales. Further study at the nest scale highlighted that the influence of biotic related parameters such as conspecific attraction (modelled as autocorrelation due to coloniality) may be of lesser influence than selection based on <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> quality. An alternative modelling method, ENFA, which creates environmental envelopes for the niche of the species with presence data only was identified as valuable for Antarctic data sets, which often lack comprehensive records of species absence. The validation of the models created at Casey with nest data collected in the Mawson region returned satisfactory prediction rates in two different habitat types, coastal islands and inland mountains, suggesting that it may be possible to predict snow petrel distribution across East Antarctica using remotely sensed information on topography and geomorphology, for example high-resolution aerial photography to guide in the design of and complement ground surveys. Similar modelling procedures applied to Wilson’s storm petrels produced more mitigated results and selection for this species appeared to be based principally on nest microhabitat characteristics.

40|$|Incubation is {{a crucial}} aspect of avian life history where {{differences}} in incubation techniques and investments can have long lasting effects on offspring and parental well- being and reproductive success. The factors limiting why some birds, such as shorebirds, have fixed clutch sizes has intrigued life history theorist to propose different hypotheses about the evolution of clutch size.

Dipteran invasion of necrotic nest remains were significantly greater in green and loggerhead turtle nests at Heron Is. and Mon Repos respectively than in flatback turtle nests at Peak Is. Three dipteran species were frequently collected from sea turtle nests. Duomyia foliata (F. Platystomatidae) was the predominant species from loggerhead turtle nests at Mon Repos, and Plagiostenopterina enderleini (F. Platystomatidae) and Sarcophaga australis (F.

40|$|Weather {{extremes}} are {{one important}} element of ongoing climate change, but their impacts are poorly understood because they are, by definition, rare events. If the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increase, there is an urgent need to understand and predict the ecological consequences of such events. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of snow storms on nest survival in Antarctic petrels and assess whether snow storms are an important driver of annual breeding success and population growth rate. We used detailed data on daily <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> survival in a year with frequent and heavy snow storms, and long term data on petrel productivity (i. e., number of chicks produced) at the colony level. Our results indicated that snow storms are an important determinant of nest survival and overall productivity.

Snow storms are a key driver of Antarctic petrelbreeding success, and potentially population dynamics.

Little Terns generally placed their nests approximately two thirds of the distance between mean high water and the seaward edge of the dunes, with a tendency to avoid vegetated areas but with a preference for a higher coverage of debris. Nesting success was about 35 % higher in coarse sand compared to fine sand and was higher for nests closer to their nearest neighbor. Nests placed up to about 20 m distant from the nearest neighbor were about 5 % more likely to succeed earlier in the season but nests at distances of 30 m or more to the nearest conspecific had a much higher probability of success later in the season. The combination of interacting abiotic and biotic factors identified as explaining Little Terns' nest site selection and nesting success provide insights relevant to the conservation management of birds breeding on sandy beaches...|$|E
40|$|Social {{behaviours}} are {{an important}} component of evolutionary success. This is perhaps most evident in the societies of social insects: the interactions between individuals underlie the organisation of their highly complex, and highly successful, societies. An important socially organised determinant of ecological success for social insects is nesting strategy. Many ant species can have a polydomous nesting strategy: a polydomous colony inhabits several spatially separated, but socially connected, nests. How this complex nesting strategy is organised is largely unknown. I undertook a series of studies to investigate how polydomous colonies of the ecologically important red wood ant Formica lugubris are organised at the <b>individual,</b> <b>nest</b> and colony levels. I found that resources are redistributed locally, between nests, within polydomous wood ant colonies. Further investigation showed that this local resource redistribution is mediated by individual workers treating other nests of the colony as food sources. I also investigated the role that nests which {{do not appear to be}} foraging are playing in polydomous wood ant colonies. I found that these non-foraging nests, rather than having a specialised role, are part of the colony expansion process. I explored the importance of resource acquisition to individual nests by investigating the effect that position in the colony nest-network has on the survival, reproduction and growth of nests within a polydomous colony. I found that position within a dynamic nest-network was an important determinant of life-history success for individual nests in wood ant colonies. My results suggest that little behavioural innovation is needed for a colony to become polydomous, and indicate benefits a polydomous nesting strategy may provide a colony. These results highlight how understanding the proximate mechanism and development of a social behaviour, can give important insights into the ultimate function and evolution of a life-history strategy...|$|E
40|$|Estimating nest {{success and}} {{evaluating}} factors potentially {{related to the}} survival rates of nests are key aspects of many studies of avian populations. A strong interest in nest success {{has led to a}} rich literature detailing a variety of estimation methods for this vital rate. In recent years, modeling approaches have undergone especially rapid development. Despite these advances, most researchers still employ Mayfield’s ad-hoc method (Mayfield, 1961) or, in some cases, the maximum-likelihood estimator of Johnson (1979) and Bart & Robson (1982). Such methods permit analyses of stratified data but do not allow for more complex and realistic models of nest survival rate that include covariates that vary by <b>individual,</b> <b>nest</b> age, time, etc. and that may be continuous or categorical. Methods that allow researchers to rigorously assess the importance of a variety of biological factors that might affect nest survival rates can now be readily implemented in Program MARK and in SAS’s Proc GENMOD and Proc NLMIXED. Accordingly, use of Mayfield’s estimator without first evaluating the need for more complex models of nest survival rate cannot be justified. With the goal of increasing the use of more flexible methods, we first describe the likelihood used for these models and then consider the question of what the effective sample size is for computation of AICc. Next, we consider {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these different programs in terms of ease of data input and model construction; utility/flexibility of generated estimates and predictions; ease of model selection; and ability to estimate variance components.

In Florida, it occurs in 21 of 67 counties. Monk parakeets build a bulky nest structure of sticks, and they often build on electric utility substations and support structures for distribution and transmission lines. This nesting activity is incompatible with reliable electric service because nest material creates short circuits that cause power outages. Nest removal by electric utility personnel is ongoing but provides only short-term relief, as buds readily rebuild their nests. In h s study, we evaluated passive and active methods to trap monk parakeets, and we documented the effectiveness of trapping to reduce rates of nest rebuilding on distribution poles. At electric substations, we tested two passive trap designs: a drop-in style trap, and a walk-in style trap. Monk parakeets were wary of traps, however, and were not easily captured even with extensive pre-baiting {{and the use of}} decoy birds. At distribution poles, we actively trapped birds at 47 nest sites using specially designed nets placed over nest entrances at night while birds roosted. Birds were then caught as they flew out of the nests into the net. Capture success at <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> sites ranged from 0 to 100 % with an overall average of 51 %. Of the 47 sites where birds were trapped at night, 43 nests were removed immediately or shortly after netting.

I use a combination of theoretical and empirical studies to examine how resource and sex allocation decisions toward offspring were altered in response to changing ecological conditions. My empirical work was done using the haplodiploid alfalfa leafcutter bee (Megachile rotundata), where sex of offspring can be controlled and mothers do all offspring provisioning. My theoretical research demonstrated no single factor determining sex allocation; instead, there is some ‘optimal balance’ between factors. Empirical work results suggest a similar situation. All three experiments demonstrated different factors that impacted sex allocation decisions: flight distance to resources, resource levels, and local population density. Longer flight distances resulted in fewer offspring produced throughout the season, but a greater proportion of daughters produced {{in the first half of}} the season and a lower proportion of daughters in the second half of the season compared to mothers with short distance to resources. Lower resource-level treatments had similar effects during the first half of the season as with long flight distance; however, during the second half mothers continued to produce a greater proportion of daughters under low resource conditions compared to high. Lower local population density resulted in both a greater proportion of daughters being produced as well as a greater number of offspring per <b>individual</b> <b>nest</b> compared with high-density conditions. We also addressed two other allocation decisions. We used flight distance to address the question of what foraging currency mothers maximize when collecting resources for offspring. We found mothers increased load size with increased flight distance, suggesting that they are behaving in a manner that maximizes efficiency as opposed to net rate of energy intake. In regards to nest defence, mothers slightly increased nest defense as the nest size increased. However, unlike traditionally studied organisms, this increase in defense continued more steeply until the nest was basically completed and sealed, after which defense dropped suddenly. In combination, these studies contribute to our basic understanding of offspring allocation decisions in solitary organisms...|$|E

Adult dormice may have overlapping feeding ranges, but they live in <b>individual</b> <b>nests</b> and feed separately, coming together briefly in the breeding season to mate. The pocket gopher is also a solitary animal outside the breeding season, each individual digging a complex tunnel system and maintaining a territory.|$|R
40|$|Voter {{mobilization}} {{experiments are}} often conducted using individual-level randomization, {{which can be}} diffi-cult to implement. A simpler approach is to randomly assign voting precincts, rather than <b>individuals</b> <b>nested</b> within them, to treatment and control groups. Not only is it easier and potentially less expensive to implement, it may allow researchers to study vote preference effects without collecting survey data. This article explores vari-ous methodological concerns that researchers should consider when designing and analyzing precinct-level experiments. These concerns are illustrated using data from a precinct-level randomized field experiment con-ducted in Kansas City, Missouri...|$|R
