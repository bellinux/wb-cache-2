5|$|Tests were {{conducted}} with a frequency modulated type radar altimeter known as AYD and a pulse type known as 718. The AYD modifications {{were made by the}} Norden Laboratories Corporation under an OSRD contract. When the manufacturer of 718, RCA, was contacted, it was learned that a new tail warning radar, AN/APS-13, later nicknamed Archie, was just entering production, which could be adapted for use as a radar altimeter. The third unit to be made was delivered to Los Alamos in April 1944. In May it was tested by diving an AT-11. This was followed by full-scale drop testing in June and July. These were very successful, whereas the AYD continued to suffer from problems. Archie was therefore adopted, although the scarcity of units in August 1944 precluded wholescale <b>destructive</b> <b>testing.</b> Testing of Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft with Thin Man bomb shapes was carried out at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944.|$|E
2500|$|The monoliths are {{extremely}} long-lived and reliable machines, {{able to survive}} {{for millions of years}} buried in the ground or resisting meteorite impacts and radiation in space with no apparent damage. The two monoliths recovered and examined by humans are virtually indestructible and impenetrable, resisting all attempts to analyse their composition or internal structure right up {{to the end of the}} series. Dr. Heywood Floyd proposes they have some sort of force shield, an impression he gets from touching it; this hypothesis is later accepted as probable because the monoliths resist <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> beyond the theoretical limits of material strength. However, they are not completely indestructible: the TMA-4 has suffered from damage caused by a giant meteorite of solid diamond that collided with Europa in [...] In the final book, , all three monoliths known to humankind are deactivated by being infected with a powerful computer virus.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Francis Welham and Arthur Levell {{conceived}} a new single spar duralumin wing structure that promised weight savings without loss of strength. It {{was quite different}} from the already established Monospar design. [...] The wing was built around a cross braced, girder-like box, with the front and rear members attached to it with cantilever ribs. [...] With financial support from S.W. Cole of EKCO radio, they set up a company known by their initials as CLW Aviation, based at Gravesend, Kent and built a wing for testing. [...] This performed to the calculations even under <b>destructive</b> <b>testing,</b> and the company decided to produce a small aeroplane using it. The CLW Curlew was intended both as a demonstrator and as a trainer for those pilots going on to modern, fast monoplanes. It was also seen as a contender in the open two-seater market, particularly for the richer buyer after a machine with [...] "snappier" [...] performance. [...] It made its first flight on 3 September 1936 at Gravesend, flown by the ex-Beardmore pilot A.N. Kingwill.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  11 that the {{ultrasound}} results for the evaluation of seam loop c and the areas a and b correlate. Consequently, the transmission measurement from array A to array C shows a defect at a bond position between 3 and 4  cm. The <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows a large defect in area a in this seam section. In the area b, the transmission measurement from the array B to the array C shows a defect at the position between 1.5 and 5  cm. Here too, the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows a significantly reduced amount of adhesive than in the following areas. However, the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows that test area c is filled with adhesive over the entire sample length.|$|R
40|$|Stone decay is {{affected}} by the influence of climatic factors. In particular marble degradation, that could be expressed by decohesion and /or bowing, is mainly due to the action of temperature and water (rains and relative humidity). In this work non <b>destructive</b> and <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed to evaluate the decay of marble slabs subjected both to natural exposition and to artificial ageing tests (Lab - Bow test). Measurements of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocities (UPV) and bowing have been executed periodically on marble slabs exposed for a period of four years as preliminary field tests. On the base of this work an integrated test methodology to monitoring and previewing the behaviour of faÃ§ade slabs have been set up. The methodology has been applied on the marble faÃ§ade of modern building of centre Italy and consists of in situ and laboratory tests. In laboratory a <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> (flexural strength) has been added to the non <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> to evaluate the decay before and after cycles of an ageing test. The results of the analysis, show an evaluative trend of the decay, though it changes its slope after 25 cycles of the ageing test. Moreover this work confirms the effectiveness of the employed non <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> and their god correlation with the mechanical tests...|$|R
50|$|Analysis of {{a failed}} part can be done using <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> or {{non-destructive}} testing. <b>Destructive</b> <b>testing</b> involves removing a metal component from service and sectioning the component for analysis. <b>Destructive</b> <b>testing</b> gives the failure analyst the ability to conduct the analysis in a laboratory setting and perform tests on the material that will ultimately destroy the component. Non <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> is a test method that allows certain physical properties of metal to be examined without taking the samples completely out of service. NDT is generally used to detect failures in components before the component fails catastrophically.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} on the testing of concrete elasticity {{has been done in}} order to measure concrete compressive strength using a non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> based on sonic wave velocity. An equipment that was used for this research was a Sonic Wave Analyzer (SOWAN). In this research, concrete samples were formed in cylindrical shape with 15 cm diameter and 30 cm length. The compressive strengths of this concrete were 19, 23, and 25 (⁄). After that the time delay of sonic wave was measured. The research results showed that primary and secondary sonic wave velocity, elasticity, and compressive strenght were = 3525 m/s, = 1950 m/s, 23240 x N/, and 24 x (⁄) respectively. Based on the data, it was concluded that this non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> based on sonic wave velocity can be used to measure the concrete compressive strength, because the values obtained were comparable to the values obtained using the Universal Testing Machine (UTM) which is a <b>destructive</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|Non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} {{applied in the}} industrial context for their strong potentialities in improving and standardizing quality control. Especially in the intermediate manufacturing stages, early detection of defects on semi-finished products allow their direction towards later production processes according to their quality, with consequent considerable savings in time, energy, materials and work. However, the raw data coming from non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> systems are not always immediately suitable for sophisticated defect detection algorithms, due to noise and disturbances which are unavoidable, especially in harsh operating conditions, {{such as the ones}} which are typical of the steelmaking cycle. The paper describes some pre-processing operations which are required in order to exploit the data coming from a non <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> system. Such a system is based on the joint exploitation of Laser and Electro-Magnetic Acoustic Transducer technologies and is applied to the detection of surface and subsurface cracks in cold and hot steel slabs...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of an oxide core <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> {{program at the}} Spert I reactor facility are reviewed. The proposed experimental program of <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> on a low-enriched oxide core, the experimental results of nondestructive transient tests that were obtained on the test core and the extrapolation of these results to the destructive case, {{an analysis of the}} hazards involved in performing such <b>destructive</b> <b>tests,</b> and {{a detailed description of the}} reactor facility and environmental conditions are presented. The supervision and control of personnel during and after each <b>destructive</b> <b>test,</b> and of the plans for reentry, cleanup, and restoration of the facility are discussed. The water- moderated core that will be used for these experiments is mounted in the Spert I open-type reactor vessel, which has no provision for pressurization or forced coolant flow. The core is comprised of approximately 600 4 %-enriched UO/sub 2 / fuel rods clad with stainless steel, and four blade-type, gang-operated control rods for reactor control. Reactor transients are initiated at ambient temperature by step-insertions of reactivity, using for this purpose a special control rod that can be quickly ejected from the core. On the basis of the results obtained from previous nondestructivelkinetic tests, an analysis was made to determine the nature of the results to be expected for an assumed 1. 8 - sec- period test in which tetal core destruction occurs. An evaluation of hazards involved in conducting the 1. 8 -msec test, based on conservative assumptions regarding fission product release and weather conditions, indicated that with the procedural controls normally exercised in the conduct of any transient test at Spert and the special controls to be in effect during the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> series, no significant hazard to personnel or to the general public will be incurred.

40|$|Abstract — In this study, {{the method}} of drill {{resistance}} was applied to wood to estimate the Janka hardness rating and the shear strength of tropical woods. For validation of the nondestructive <b>tests,</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> were performed of apparent density, shear strength and Janka hardness in the three orthotropic directions of wood- longitudinal, tangential and radial. All the <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> were adjusted for moisture content of 12 %. To obtain correlations between nondestructive and <b>destructive</b> <b>tests,</b> seven types of wood were used: angelim pedra (Hymenolobium petraeum), angelim vermelho (Dinizia excelsa), castanheira (Bertholletia excelsa), garapa (Apuleia leiocarpa), muiracatiara (Astronium lecointei), pequi (Caryocar villosum) and roxinho (Peltogyne discolor). The density interval was from 650 to 1150 kg/m. For estimation of Janka hardness, {{the method of}} drill resistance in wood exhibited good correlations, with R greater than 85 %. For shear strength, positive results were also found, however, with intermediate R values, ranging from 59 % to 75 %. This nondestructive method {{proved to be an}} efficient and practical alternative for estimation of wood mechanical properties.
