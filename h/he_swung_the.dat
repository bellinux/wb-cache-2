5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E
25|$|The two men {{moved to}} {{face each other}} within a few feet. At some point, Smith {{suddenly}} swung his rifle off his shoulder and struck at Reid. Whether intending to shoot at that moment or to club Reid aside is uncertain. Reid raised his left arm to block the fast-approaching barrel. It struck and cut his arm, {{but he managed to}} grab the barrel and yank it away from the general direction of his head and press it downward. The Daily Alaskan wrote that Reid grabbed the rifle barrel without being cut, but that during the scuffle, Smith pulled it free and hit Reid’s arm as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> rifle at Reid again.|$|E
25|$|The England innings {{began with}} 10 extras from Jeff Thomson with Rod Marsh leaping behind the stumps in vain as one ball lifted {{over the heads}} of the batsman and wicketkeeper for four. Thereafter wickets fell {{regularly}} with the Hillites cheering on the fast bowlers, but it was Max Walker (2/77) who made the breakthrough when <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> ball to the edge of Dennis Amiss's bat to see it superbly caught by Mallett in the gully. Thomson took a surprisingly good catch to dismiss Lloyd off a Lillee bouncer and then beat Cowdrey three balls in a row before the master was caught by McCosker at short leg. This left England 69/3, but Edrich and Fletcher saw the day out safely enough. One ball from the captain was driven full into McCosker's face, knocking him unconscious for five minutes and he was helped off the field. Mallet was brought on at the end of the day, but asked to be taken off after one over because of his bruised had from that morning. Returning on the third day Thomson was bowling at his fastest and took 1/12 off five overs, having Edrich missed by Redpath in the slips, Greig caught by Greg Chappell and almost having Alan Knott out on the second, third and fourth balls he faced, dropped by Marsh, a caught behind not given and almost bowled by an inswinger. Fletcher was hit on the head by a bouncer and was caught by Redpath off Walker to leave England were 123/5, their top order failing again. After his escape Knott rode his luck and sliced 11 fours in an innings of 82, adding 57 with Edrich (50), 60 with Fred Titmus (22) and 33 with Derek Underwood (27). Knott and Underwood took 14 runs off one Lillee over and Ian Chappell had to set a defensive field for the first time in the series. The wicketkeeper was finally dismissed leaning back ready to cut the short ball and had his stumps flattened by a Thomson half-volley, but Lillee repeatedly bounced the tailenders and gave Bob Willis a beamer which fortunately missed his head. Willis was bowled by Thomson (4/74) and Lillee took the last wicket, having Underwood caught by Walker when he drove high into the covers. England were out for 295, having saved the follow on, which looked unlikely at one point, but still 110 runs behind.|$|E
60|$|Her teeth gleamed {{white in}} <b>the</b> moonlight. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> open <b>the</b> gate.|$|R
60|$|With {{a passionate}} gesture of abhorrence <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> towards <b>the</b> door. Her clutch upon his arm arrested him.|$|R

500|$|After {{getting married}} in early 1946 to Jeanne Dillinger, Seerey started the 1946 Cleveland Indians season working with Boudreau to fix his hitting, as his lunge when <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> bat was causing him to strike out too often and not hit enough home runs. The change worked, as {{by the start of}} July Seerey had a team-leading 11 home runs. His second half {{performance}} included a doubleheader against the Chicago White Sox where he hit a home run in each game; the second home run landed in the upper deck of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, a feat that at the time had only been matched by fellow Indians outfielder Jeff Heath. He finished the season with a [...]225 batting average, 26 home runs, 62 RBIs, and 101 strikeouts. The 26 home runs were fourth in the league, and for the third straight year Seerey led the league in strikeouts.|$|E
500|$|The attack began before dawn, {{when the}} two leading light horse squadrons were heavily fired on by rifles and machine guns from several {{outposts}} at 04:25, causing nearly 100 horse casualties. No reconnaissance by the light horse had been possible, but the 19th Lancers reported that the village and station buildings lay {{at the end of}} a flat plain [...] wide, without any cover and no apparent obstacles to a cavalry charge. This unexpected fire revealed the garrison was deployed covering the open plain for some [...] south of Samakh, extending on either side to the mountains. The 11th Light Horse Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. W. Parsons, had planned to attack the garrison's flank, but as no flank attack was possible, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> regiment around to attack straight on. A and B squadrons galloped on either side of the railway line, with all 12 machine guns of the 4th Machine Gun Squadron providing covering fire for the charging squadrons. They fired at the flashes created by the Ottoman rifles and machine guns.|$|E
2500|$|... "From {{the first}} ball <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> bat with great power and {{precision}} at anything within striking distance", tells {{a report of}} the day, [...] "and the ball hummed to all parts of the field at an extraordinary pace". Callaway's fifty came up in 67 minutes. At 41, he was missed by McAndrews at point off a tough chance. His second fifty took 27 minutes and the hundred was reached with a [...] "magnificent straight drive that landed on the pickets at the southern end". At {{the end of the first}} day he was 125 not out in 130 minutes with 16 fours. He outscored Macartney by 112 runs to 57 during the time they were together.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>swung</b> open <b>the</b> wooden {{gate of the}} churchyard, {{by which}} they were standing. There was a row of graves {{on either side of}} the prim path.|$|R
60|$|He {{smiled at}} me, half {{proud of his}} speech. Then <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> into <b>the</b> seat of the machine, having {{attended}} to the horses' heads. He lifted the knife.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{take the}} side trail," [...] said Stewart, shortly, as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> upon <b>the</b> big black. Then {{he led the}} way, and the other cowboys trotted in the rear.|$|R
2500|$|After his brigade {{endured a}} {{three or four}} mile double-time march in 45 minutes, Weedon {{arranged}} his troops on a reverse slope behind a fence. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> right flank forward behind a fence and some woods so as to take any attackers in enfilade. Henry Monckton's 2nd Grenadier Battalion blundered into Weedon's trap as dusk fell. As his men came under heavy fire, Monckton asked Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald to ride and get help. The Hessian found James Agnew who brought up his 4th Brigade on Monckton's left. One of Agnew's regiments, the 64th Foot was roughly treated, losing 47 of its 420 men in the vicious firefight that followed. The Pennsylvania State Regiment was evidently part of the thrown-forward right flank. One witness recalled the unit's colonel, [...] "Stewart on foot, in its rear, animating his men." [...] An officer in the regiment wrote that, [...] "Our regiment fought at one stand about an hour under incessant fire, and yet the loss was less than at Long Island; neither were we so near each other as at Princeton, our common distance being about 50 yards." [...] With the assistance of some artillery, the British finally forced the Americans back, but the exhausted victors did not pursue in the dark.|$|E
2500|$|Ichiro {{made his}} Pacific League debut in 1992 {{at the age}} of 18, but {{he spent most of his}} first two seasons in the farm system because his then-manager, Shōzō Doi, refused to accept Ichiro's unorthodox swing. The swing was nicknamed [...] because of the pendulum-like motion of his leg, which shifts his weight forward as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> bat, and goes against {{conventional}} hitting theory. Even though he hit a home run off Hideo Nomo, who later won a National league Rookie of the Year Award as a Dodger, Ichiro was sent back to the farm system on that very day. In his second career game, he recorded his first ichi-gun (Japan's major professional league) hit in Japan's Pacific League against Hawks pitcher Keiji Kimura. In 1994 he benefited from the arrival of a new manager, Akira Ōgi, who played him every day in the second spot of the lineup. He was eventually moved to the leadoff spot for the Orix BlueWave, where his immediate productivity dissolved any misgivings about his unconventional swing. He set a Japanese single-season record with 210 hits, the first player ever to top 200 hits in a single season. Five other players have since done so: Matt Murton, Norichika Aoki (twice), Alex Ramírez, Tsuyoshi Nishioka, and Shogo Akiyama. Ichiro's record was eventually surpassed in 2010 by former major leaguer Matt Murton, who had 214 hits in a 144-game season. Also, in 2015, current Saitama Seibu Lions Outfielder Shogo Akiyama had 216 hits in a 143-game season. Ichiro's 210 hits had come in a 130-game season.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{retirement}} of Keith Miller, Bill Johnston, Ken Archer and Ian Johnson in 1956 Australia needed to rebuild their bowling attack. Ray Lindwall would continue to play until 1960, and would overtake Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record of 216 wickets. However, he was now 37 and {{was no longer the}} fast-bowler who had terrorised the England team in the 1940s even though <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> ball heavily. Considering the bent elbows of Australia's latest talent and the purists dubbed him [...] "the last of Australia's straight-arm bowlers". Fortunately the all-rounders Alan Davidson and Richie Benaud came good in the 1957-58 South African tour after years of underperforming. [...] "Davo" [...] was a left-handed fast-medium swing bowler who came round the wicket and could move the ball either way off the pitch or through the air. Dogged by perennial injuries he took only 16 wickets (34.06) between 1953 and 1957, but starting in 1957-58 he would take 23 wickets or more in six out of seven series. Tom Graveney thought he was [...] "possibly the greatest left-arm new-ball bowler in the history of cricket" [...] and with the exceptionally low Test average of 20.53 it is difficult to argue with him. The captain Richie Benaud had in the last year emerged as probably the finest leg spinner in the world and his 31 wickets (18.83) in the series was the most taken for Australia against England since Monty Noble in 1901-02. No great spinner of the ball, he was able to produce subtle variations, and unlike most leg-spinners was very economical. After these three greats Australia's bowling was less dependable, or acceptable. Ian Meckiff took 17 wickets (17.17) with his fast left hand swing bowling, but was never able to overcome the accusations of throwing that beset his career. His unusual style gave him the ability to swing the ball at high speed and the flick of his hand made it difficult for the batsman to read the ball. Meckiff was definitely fast, saying he [...] "likes to make them whistle", but erratic, sometimes bowling balls two feet off the stumps {{on either side of the}} wicket. When Meckiff was ill the 6'5" [...] Giant Rorke came in and proved to be just as dangerous, taking 3/23 in the first innings of the Fourth Test and was sometimes almost unplayable as many balls pitched wide of the crease.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{made another}} desperate attempt, but a {{splashing}} sea broke about the bows, driving the canoe off her course again, and while <b>he</b> savagely <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> paddle Harry surveyed him contemptuously.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{want you}} and the missis {{to come to the}} funeral, Gladman," [...] said Mr. Clodd, as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> into <b>the</b> stationer's shop; [...] "and bring Pincer with you. I'm writing to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blood!" [...] shrilled {{the little}} man. [...] "O 'Sblood! A pirate!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> to <b>the</b> Colossus who {{followed}} him--"A damned pirate, van der Kuylen. Rend my vitals, but we're come from Scylla to Charybdis." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> gate wide, made a {{few paces}} into the gloom of the enclosure, and retraced his steps suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear me, he's got {{a button}} unbuttoned," [...] worried Erik, kneeling. Carol frowned, then noted the {{strength}} with which <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> {{baby in the}} air.|$|E

60|$|Tarzan {{shook his}} head and growled; then on and on through <b>the</b> jungle <b>he</b> <b>swung,</b> and <b>the</b> farther <b>he</b> {{traveled}} and the more he thought upon his wrongs, the nearer he approached becoming an irreclaimable misogynist.|$|R
60|$|Thorne helped Alison up, and as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> {{himself into}} <b>the</b> vehicle several loungers hurled {{laughing}} questions at him.|$|R
60|$|The meat safely cached, Tarzan trotted {{along the}} {{elephant}} trail after the Gomangani. Two or {{three miles from}} the cage he overtook them and then <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> into <b>the</b> trees and followed above and behind them--waiting his chance.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no great}} crowd on the train. They easily found a second-class {{compartment}} without occupants. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> luggage {{on the rack}} and sat down, facing Helena.|$|E

60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> door back I slipped behind it, but as {{luck would}} have it he shut it again behind him, and there we were left {{standing}} face to face.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the upper}} terrace of <b>the</b> tree-tops <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> with <b>the</b> grace {{and ease of}} a monkey. But for the heavy burden upon his heart {{he would have been}} happy in this return to the old free life of his boyhood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look {{out for the}} rope!" [...] roared one of the {{lifeboat}} men, as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> and discharged <b>the</b> loaded stick with a line attached.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I think." [...] He {{reached his}} pump and {{blew up the}} tire. She watched his softly-applied force. What physical, muscular force there was in him.

60|$|As {{he spoke}} <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> little craft {{around to the}} westward, thus {{bringing}} the full {{strength of the wind}} on the port side, which caused her to make more leeway than headway.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't," [...] she said, and as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> gourd in tacit {{question}} {{what to do}} with it since she did not offer to take it, she bade him, [...] "Put it down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're goin' {{to search}} us, an' {{it may be}} I'll have an invite to stop aboard quite a spell." [...] Darius said half to himself as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>the</b> pungy around preparatory to obeying orders.|$|E
60|$|The large oak-panelled, book-lined {{room had}} a curtain {{hung in the}} further corner. When this was drawn it {{disclosed}} a large, brass-bound safe.
