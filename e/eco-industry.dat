This foresight study aimed at developing long-term visions for <b>eco-industries</b> (Horizon 2035), identifying relevant trends and drivers, highlighting implications for EU policies and describing realistic and desirable possible futures. A systemic approach to <b>eco-industries</b> was taken by defining them as a stream of business activities across and within the entire industrial segment of society encompassing "Green industries" (environmental industries), "Industries greening"(other industries adopting eco-innovations) and "Eco-innovative solution providers" (R&D, new business models, organisational/social innovation, integrators). The study followed a classic foresight approach to develop four scenarios (Multiple Connected Initiatives, Shared Circular Strategies, Compact Green Innovation and Local Self-Resilience). For each scenario, an imaginary <b>eco-industries</b> landscape was built allowing for a systemic understanding of the alternative worlds and for the identification of four sets of policy recommendations to promote sustainability. The scenarios were constructed around societal values (varying between individualistic and collaborative) and the fiscal framework (varying between traditional and strongly supporting sustainability. They took into account a set of likely megatrends: world population reaching 8. 6 billion, a global consuming class having increased by 4 billion people, the first generation of "digital natives" in power, global warming having already reached 2 °C (with the accompanying consequences) and increasing urbanisation. All this would happen in a context of continuing technological development (ICT, biotechnologies, materials, mobile technologies, sensors…) that will lead to a hyper-connected world. In order to help communicate the scenarios, four characters (Clement, Sophia, Leo and Leila) were created. They were given life in four narratives corresponding to the four scenarios. Each character is most successful in a different scenario. The robust intellectual framework created by these four scenarios has proven its worth as a platform to engage in systemic reflections with a very wide range of people.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the political}} economy of environmental policies in the presence of an <b>eco-industry</b> pressure group. Previous studies have dealt with two types of lobbies: capitalists and environmentalists. We introduce a third pressure group representing the <b>eco-industry</b> sector. Under this type of economy, the incumbent government maximizes its chances of being re-elected. Its objective functions include social welfare as well as political contributions. The introduction of the <b>eco-industry</b> lobby introduces a new political contribution and modifies the incentives of the traditional lobbies. Furthermore, we underline the conditions under which environmentalists and eco-industries can become political allies. We also explain that, considering the overall profit of a vertical structure, an industrial lobby group can be favourable to a more stringent environmental policy. Next, we assume an open economy. In two countries, two polluting sectors are subject to an environmental policy. Therefore, an <b>eco-industry</b> sector which supplies pollution abatement goods and services arises. Abatement goods and services are assumed to be internationally traded, creating the only industrial interaction between both countries. The pollution, which can be transboundary or purely local, affects consumers in both countries; we analyse both cases. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, eco-industries lobby in favour of more stringent environmental policies, except if the impact of foreign competition more than compensates the turnover increase induced by a tighter environmental policy. Polluting firms always lobby against tighter environmental policies. However, an industrial pressure group, representing the industry as a whole and considering upstream and downstream profits, can sometimes be favourable to an increase in the environmental policy, as it leads to increased profits. We also show that an environmental pressure group can ask for a decrease in the environmental policy at home to decrease pollution abroad. This result does not rely on interactions between countries within the polluting sector. Interaction within the <b>eco-industry</b> sector is a sufficient condition for demonstrating that environmentalists can be favourable to a decrease in the local environmental policy. The impact of lobbying activities on the politically optimal environmental policy is ambiguous and depends on the relative concentration of each pressure group.

The entrepreneur is defined as “somebody who starts his own business of small dimensions. ” It {{is a mistake to}} assume that the entrepreneurial system and innovation are natural and spontaneous phenomena. The good aspect is that the entrepreneurial system can be learnt. This means that the firm has to be receptive to innovation and perceive the change as an opportunity not as a threat. It is believed that the entrepreneurial system is very risky. The eco-businesses are poorly represented in Romania, in comparison with the average of EU.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the need for}} further clarifications concerning the emerging concept of the “bio-economy”, the present study scrutinizes this concept in order to better delineate its analytical scope. It also describes methodologies of potential relevance to evaluation and monitoring of the bio-economy. Although not directly intended to prepare the ground for the future EU Bio-economy Observatory (BISO), the material presented herein may also meaningfully inform the design of monitoring activities which will be undertaken within the BISO framework. The introductory section sheds some light on the bio-economy’s multi-dimensional nature, scope, drivers, challenges and economic potential. In order to clearly distinguish between their specific features and coverage, a comparative description of <b>eco-industries</b> versus the bio-economy is included here. The current EU policy approach to the bio-economy is sketched in the second section of this report. With the purpose of defining the bio-economy’s scope and its internal flows, the third section advances an integrated analytical perspective on the EU bio-economy. This perspective builds upon descriptions provided in the related Commission documents. Its potential use in support of the future Bio-economy Observatory is elaborated, together with several associated methodological aspects. In the fourth section, the datasets, methods and models which could be used for measuring and monitoring the bio-economy’s drivers, development and impact are identified and grouped into five inter-related methodological modules. Further methodological clarification is provided as to i) the need for complementing a sectoral approach to the bio-economy with other perspectives, including the product-chain approach, and ii) the usefulness of inventory data from the European Commission’s life-cycle based resource efficiency indicators. Other relevant data sources are also described. In addition, in light of the limited availability of statistical data on new bio-based products and processes, the need for further disaggregated product-level statistics for bio-based products and company-level research is also discussed. Current standardization and research activities on issues such as harmonization of sustainability certification systems for biomass production, conversion systems and trade, sustainability assessment of technologies, and environmental performance of products are reviewed in the fifth section. Based on the observation that {{it would be impossible to}} obtain all required data for bio-economy monitoring from official statistical sources, we propose in the sixth section a general-purpose questionnaire which could serve as a basis for prospective surveys.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to support the European Parliament’s ITRE Committee in its work on the EU's industrial and energy policy and to give advice on the following issues: Why is the issue of resource scarcity back on the agenda? What are the strategic conclusions for the EU? What can the EU expect from eco-innovation in a large range of industrial sectors? Are existing measures meeting the EU aims and expectations, and what new policy initiatives should be set forward? To meet these objectives, this study is structured as follows: Chapter 2 will give an overview on resource scarcities. Chapter 3 elaborates on ecoinnovation, including trends, barriers and driving forces. Chapter 4 outlines proposals for future EU policies. Chapter 5 sketches out a possible vision for the future. Chapter 2 reveals recent findings on resource scarcity: Global extraction of natural resource is steadily increasing. Since 1980, global extraction of abiotic (fossil fuels, minerals) and biotic (agriculture, forestry, fishing) resources has augmented from 40 to 58 billion tonnes in 2005. Scenarios anticipate a total resource extraction of around 80 billion tonnes in 2020 (200 % of the 1980 -value), necessary to sustain the worldwide economic growth. On average, a European consumes per year around three times the amount of resources of a citizen in the emerging countries while producing twice as much. Analysis on patterns of current resource use (direct and indirect use) is still in its infancy and shows data gaps. Based on country studies, however, one can arrive at tentative conclusions. A recent study on Germany reveals that ten production sectors account for more than 50 % of German Total Material Requirements (TMR). Industries of three areas are of strategic importance because here a huge number of technological interactions among production sectors take place: • Stones, construction, and housing = housing • Metals and car manufacturing = mobility • Agriculture, food and nutrition = food. The rapidly increasing demand for resources has led to an unprecedented boost in resource prices, especially during the last five years until the breakout of the financial crisis in Fall 2008. The EU is the world region that outsources the biggest part of resource extraction. In comparison to the overall global growth rate (45 % over the last 25 years), Europe’s resource extraction grew only by 3 %, but studies show that these domestic raw materials are increasingly substituted by imports from other world regions. World reserves in fossil fuels and metals are unevenly distributed across the world regions. Additionally, for various commodities, the peak of extraction has already been reached or is currently about to be reached. Not only for oil and gas, but also for critical metals such as Antimon, Gallium, Indium, Platinum and others the supply for European industry is at risk. Natural gas cannot replace oil as main energy source, once the latter is depleted. From this, the following main conclusions are derived: • The European economy is increasingly dependent on resource imports from other world regions. • Scarcity of ‘Critical metals’ will affect the European economy more subtle, but furtherreaching. High-tech industries, in particular the electronic industry, will be affected by deWuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation iv clining availability of precious metals. Also the development of new eco-technologies, such as photovoltaic electricity generation, could be slowed down by resource scarcity. • It can be expected that worldwide competition for these resources will significantly increase in the near future, potentially leading to serious conflicts related to the access to resource reserves. • In order to deal with this increased scarcity of natural resources, a significant reduction of the worldwide resource use will be necessary. Chapter 3 gives a definition of eco-innovation as well as an overview of different types of eco-innovation and deals with measurement issues. Furthermore, it illustrates selected ecoinnovations in key areas, and highlights also trends, drivers and barriers analysed for these examples and illustrated by fishbone diagrams. The scrutinised eco-innovations and the regarding key conclusions are (1) In the area of housing a. “Deep Renovation”, which enables a minimisation of negative impacts on environment and health by system design and choice of components and is possible in nearly every building, though standardisation is limited, and b. “Smart Metering”, for which there is worldwide evidence that giving consumers appropriate, relevant information on their energy and water use is an important basis for additional measures leading to a reduction in this use and thus in GHG emissions. (2) In the area of mobility a. the “Green Electric Car” and b. “Car sharing”; (3) In the area of food and drink (a) the “Community Supported Agriculture” (CSA) and (b) “Sustainable Sourcing of Retailers”. The chapter concludes that eco-innovation has a crucial role to play in putting the EU on the path to a resource and energy efficient economy and thus significantly reducing the environmental impacts in each of the areas, housing, mobility and food and drink. Experts estimate that this is likely to become an $ 800 billion market worldwide by 2015 and a $ trillion market afterwards. Overcoming the barriers and building up <b>eco-industries</b> for energy and resource efficiency however calls for an active European Union. It requires the engagement of many different actors in society, and strategies should be implemented from many different sides. For an ecoinnovation to be fully accepted and diffused into wider society, a concerted effort must be made to engage people and target the emotional and psychological aspects required to reinforce its uptake. Chapter 4 (How to speed up eco-innovation in the EU) undertakes an attempt to analyse existing EU policies and initiatives; selected member states’ efforts are also considered. This is done via a comparative methodology with a joint format. The annex to this study contains three further briefing notes on this issue written by other authors. The following policies, initiatives and instruments are considered in this study: • The Eco-design Directive (2005 / 32 /EU) – focuses on energy use for a number of products and neglects other environmental dimensions, functional innovation and system innovation are not yet covered; Wuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation v • The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) – first experience suggests a bias in favour of recycling technologies and energy along existing technology trajectories, less visibility of resource efficiency and new pathways; • The Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP 7); • The Environmental Technology Action Plan (ETAP) – Despite many achievements, environmental technologies still remain a niche market; further green procurement, greater financial investments, the establishment of technology verification and performance targets systems, and focussing on sectors with high gains is needed; • The Directive on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD) – good ambitions, but a lack of implementation in many Member states, implementation requires both a speeding up and a scaling up, addressing the resource efficiency of buildings is desirable; • The European Union Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy • The European Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) • The UK Aggregates Levy and Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF) • Environment-driven Business Development in Sweden • The European Union Energy Label. The analysis identifies specific gaps in the areas of entrepreneurship, pre-commercialisation and mass market development; in addition, the opportunities to refurbish buildings in Europe have not fully been deployed yet (see Figure 1). Based on this and supported by an expert workshop conducted by the ITRE on 12 November 08, the study formulates proposals that could support the EU to speed up eco-innovation. They promote market-based incentives and the reform of existing initiatives; in addition, new proposals are presented that address specific gaps in the areas of entrepreneurship, pre-commercialisation as well as the opportunities to refurbish buildings in Europe. Bearing in mind the importance of construction as a driving forces of resource use, the relevance of the construction industry in the EU Lead market Strategy and current deficits, and the overall success of market-based instruments, this study proposes to extend the existing eco-tax base in Europe by establishing a minimum tax directive on construction minerals. It is expected to drive up eco-innovation because it gives incentives to improve resource efficiency and to refurbish old buildings. In addition, it generates revenues, which can be utilized for specific eco-innovation programmes. A greening of the EU budget would be the material basis for speeding up eco-innovation beyond 2009. This would have to follow two strategic lines: on the one hand unsustainable spending would have to be cut, on the other hand the money saved by this activity could be shifted to support investments in structural eco-innovation. A budgetary strategy could include the following elements: • Further redirecting CAP from direct payments towards integrated rural development schemes, which support eco-innovation in the area of sustainable production of highquality food and biomass. These integrated rural development schemes should include integrated logistical, economic and technological strategies for adapted sustainable natural resource management in the landscape (food, water, soil, biodiversity and closed-loop biomass production and use). These strategies would have to be highly adapted to local economies and landscape conditions thus inducing local eco-innovation and employment schemes. Wuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation vi • Rigorous environmental appraisal and reduction of Regional Policy schemes for large infrastructure projects which could support long-term unsustainable development paths, shifting towards funding for eco-innovation e. g. in the area of decentralized electricity grids (supporting green electric cars and renewable energies) and lighthouse projects on resource efficient construction and resource recovery. • Redirection of Regional Funds from end-of-pipe technologies towards integrated solutions and eco-innovation (e. g. decentralized water treatment) • More advanced schemes for improving energy and material productivity of economies would require an implementation of the CREST guidelines for improved coordination between Structural Funds, the Research Framework Program and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP). Only such a concentration of forces could achieve a measurable improvement of resource productivity in Europe by means of regional eco-innovation clusters and a European network of regional resource efficiency agencies. • Integration spending of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for improved cofinancing of eco-innovation Figure 1 : Gaps of current EU programmes on eco-innovation Engaging industry in developing eco innovation for sustainable ways of living is considered to be essential. The study identifies six strategy areas where industry can act: 1. Strategy Area 1 : Creating and satisfying demand for green and fair products 2.

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} {{in this study}} to examine the stability of ecological industry chain network based on entropy theory. This methodology is developed {{according to the associated}} dissipative structure characteristics, i. e., complexity, openness, and nonlinear. As defined in the methodology, network organization is the object while the main focus is the identification of core enterprises and core industry chains. It is proposed that the chain network should be established around the core enterprise while supplementation to the core industry chain helps to improve system stability, which is verified quantitatively. Relational entropy model can be used to identify core enterprise and core <b>eco-industry</b> chain. It could determine the core of the network organization and core <b>eco-industry</b> chain through the link form and direction of node enterprises. Similarly, the conductive mechanism of different node enterprises can be examined quantitatively despite the absence of key data. Structural entropy model can be employed {{to solve the problem of}} order degree for network organization. Results showed that the stability of the entire system could be enhanced by the supplemented chain around the core enterprise in <b>eco-industry</b> chain network organization. As a result, the sustainability of the entire system could be further improved. Qingsong Wang, Shishou Qiu, Xueliang Yuan, Jian Zuo, Dayong Cao, Jinglan Hong, Jian Zhang, Yong Dong, Ying Zhen...|$|E

40|$|This note {{investigates the}} impact of (international) {{technology}} transfer on optimal pollution taxation. To use a patented pollution abatement technology, the polluters subject to the emissions tax only pay fixed license fees to an (international) <b>eco-industry</b> (whose profits are shared among national and foreign suppliers). The second-best emissions tax is shown to decrease as the exogenous share of imported technology increases. When the domestic polluting industry is imperfectly competitive, this tax is always lower than the marginal damage. In contrast, when the polluting industry is perfectly competitive, the second-best emissions tax {{is lower than the}} marginal damage only in the case of incoming technology transfer. If the technology is transferred domestically, the second-best emissions tax is equal to the marginal damage. These results contrast with the literature on {{the impact of}} market power in the <b>eco-industry</b> on optimal policy design, initiated by David and Sinclair-Desgagné (2005) ...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{policies}} are discussed when two countries {{differ in their}} ability to abate pollution. Northern eco-industries (the industry supplying abatement activities) are more efficient than Southern ones. Segmented environmental markets and a Northern monopoly yield identical second-best taxes in both countries. When markets are global, Southern countries underestimate the market power of eco-industries. Introducing competition creates positive (resp. negative) rent-shifting distortions in South (resp. North). Cooperation could reduce Northern pollution but has ambiguous consequences in South. <b>Eco-Industry,</b> Strategic Environmental Policy, Asymmetric Oligopolies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article investigates {{environmental}} regulations on <b>eco-industry</b> in vertical oligopolies, {{in which the}} upstream industry produces abatement goods reducing pollutants and the downstream industry produces consumption goods emitting pollutants. We devise the optimal combination of appropriate policy instruments and show that an optimal pollution tax {{should be used for}} the negative externality and output restrictions in final production, and an optimal abatement subsidy should incorporate the effect of upstream market restrictions on abatement activity. We also examine the welfare effect of the subsidy policy on the abatement technology in tax/subsidy combination...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on the micro-economics of the <b>eco-industry</b> often assumed interiority of pollutant net emissions. In a perfectly competitive final good market vertically integrated with an upstream monopoly supply this assumption implies that an optimal tax is always greater than its associated marginal social damage. In this short note we will relax this assumption and challenge that result. The market structure generates a unique threshold {{on the scale of}} the marginal social damage, whereby for any value above the threshold an optimal tax is strictly lower and net emissions are zero...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{analyzes}} the output and abatement choices of perfectly competitive down-stream polluters who {{are subject to}} environmental liability law and procure abatement from an imper-fectly competitive <b>eco-industry.</b> Under strict liability, polluting firms choose suboptimal abatement, but socially optimal output given abatement. Under neg-ligence with firm-specific abatement standards, pol-luting firms choose suboptimal output but socially optimal abatement given output. Under negligence with industry-wide abatement standards, the output and abatement choices of most firms are socially sub-optimal. Second-best considerations are offered for each case. Under strict liability (negligence), these apply {{to the level of}} liability (the behavioral stan-dard). (JEL H 23, Q 58...|$|E

This paper studies the consequences of imperfect competition in an ecoindustry on the equilibrium choices of the competitive polluting …rms. It then characterizes the second best pollution cap. By comparing this situation to a competitive one, we show that Cournot competition on the abatement good market contributes not only to a non optimal level of emission reduction but also to a higher permit price, which reduces the production level. These distortions increase with market power measured by the margin taken by the non competitive …rms and suggest a second best less stringent pollution cap...|$|E
