5|$|James Murrell (c. 1785 – 16 December 1860), {{also known}} as Cunning Murrell, was an English cunning man, or {{professional}} folk magician, who {{spent most of his}} life in the town of Hadleigh in the eastern English county of Essex.

40|$|Untreated <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> excreta once being {{released}} into the environment can be a hazard to the environment <b>and</b> <b>human</b> health by possible pathogens and drug residues.

Meanwhile the demand of livestock <b>and</b> <b>humans</b> manure reuse in agriculture and fisheries requires that the hygienic safety of both treated <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> excreta is ensured and their nutrient contents remain high. This research aims to assess the situation of <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> excreta management based on regulation documents and environmental health impact approaches and to introduce some initial researches on integrated <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> <b>human</b> waste management.

5|$|Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, {{and many}} {{organoboron}} compounds are relatively nontoxic to <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> (with toxicity {{similar to that}} of table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} 16S ribosomal DNA suggest that S.iniae {{is closely related}} to other streptococcal pathogens of <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b> Specifically, it is clustered in the pyogenic group, along with other pathogenic streptococci such as S.pyogenes, S.agalactiae, S.uberis, S.canis, S.porcinus, S.phocae, and S.intestinalis. Of these related species, it is most closely related to S. porcinus. Genomic restriction fragment analysis of diverse host and geographical panels of S.iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains, though multiple pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns have been identified among human isolates.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{arrived in}} the area where the park is located in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had {{plentiful}} wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Thomas Henry Flewett {{suggested}} the name rotavirus after observing that, when viewed through an electron microscope, a rotavirus particle {{looks like a}} wheel (rota in Latin); the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> worldwide. Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, rotavirus from humans was first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys, by adding trypsin (an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate) to the culture medium. The ability to grow rotavirus in culture accelerated the pace of research, and by the mid-1980s the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated.|$|E
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals,</b> go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E
5|$|Runrigs, of a furrow and ridge, usually ran {{downhill}} so {{that they}} included both wet and dry land, helping to offset {{some of the problems}} of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective on heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill. Key crops included kale (for both <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals),</b> and hemp and flax for cloth production. Sheep and goats were probably the main sources of milk, while cattle were raised primarily for meat. The rural economy appears to have boomed in the thirteenth century and {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Black Death, probably the bubonic plague, which reached Scotland in 1349 and killed perhaps over a third of the population, was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes that can be seen in clerical benefices, of between a third and half compared with the beginning of the era, to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century. Towards the end of the period average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E

Overall, 84. 1 % (90 / 107) and 75. 5 % (40 / 53) of the gentamicin-resistant isolates from <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> sources, respectively, were found to possess the aacC 2 gene. The aacC 2 gene for 20 isolates (10 each for <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> isolates) was sequenced. Two alleles were found that were equally distributed in <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> isolates. PFGE showed that the gentamicin-resistant isolates exhibited diverse patterns with little clonality. In some isolates, the aacC 2 gene was encoded on large transferable plasmids of multiple incompatibility groups (IncF, IncI 1 and IncN). An IncFII plasmid of 140 kb in size was shared by one <b>human</b> <b>and</b> three <b>animal</b> isolates.

5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b> The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E
