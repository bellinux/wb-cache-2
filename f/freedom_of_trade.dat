5|$|In the General Theory and later, Keynes {{responded to}} the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, {{especially}} during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and {{a high degree of}} <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade),</b> then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later {{to the creation of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.|$|E
5|$|Though both England and Scotland {{recognised}} Anne {{as their}} queen, only the English Parliament had settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as the heir presumptive. The Parliament of Scotland (the Estates) had not formally settled the succession {{question for the}} Scottish throne. In 1703, the Estates passed a bill that declared that their selection for Queen Anne's successor {{would not be the}} same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies. At first Royal Assent was withheld, but the following year Anne capitulated to the wishes of the Estates and assent was granted to the bill, which became the Act of Security 1704. In response the English Parliament passed measures which threatened to restrict Anglo-Scottish trade and cripple the Scottish economy if the Estates did not agree to the Hanoverian succession. Eventually, in 1707, both Parliaments agreed on an Act of Union which united England and Scotland into a single political entity, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and established the rules of succession as laid down by the Act of Settlement 1701. The union created the largest free trade area in eighteenth-century Europe.|$|E

25|$|The six {{member states}} {{individually}} strongly intervened in their agricultural sectors, {{in particular with}} regard to what was produced, maintaining prices for goods and how farming was organised.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 297 - 330). This {{doctoral thesis}} deals with <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and <b>trade</b> unionism in South Africa. <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> association {{is one of}} the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in a number of legal instruments both at the international and municipal levels. Progress and democracy require respect for human rights, including the right to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association at the workplace. Trade unionism is the expression of this right. The development <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> unionism in South Africa is closely related to that <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and was instrumental to the demise of apartheid. This work provides a theoretical, historical and legal background to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and <b>trade</b> unionism, both from a comparative and international law perspective. It then investigates the legal and jurisprudential protection <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and <b>trade</b> unionism under apartheid before dealing with their protection under the post-apartheid legal order. The thesis argues that international law in general and international labour law in particular contributed a lot to the development <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and <b>trade</b> unionism in South Africa. It concludes that South Africa has gone a long way in protecting <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association at the workplace and trade unions {{played a critical role in}} the consolidation of democracy in the country. The prospects for the protection <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and <b>trade</b> unions are good. However, there are also a number of challenges, political, social, economic, and intellectual. These challenges need to be overcome to consolidate democracy and a culture of human rights. The thesis ends with some recommendations for further research to ensure the best protection <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and <b>trade</b> unions in South Africa and the rest of our continent...|$|R

By {{the time of his}} arrival, a land tenure system known as the Native Customary Rights (NCR) have been practised by the indigenous communities. As Brooke's main priority is to abolishing headhunting among the indigenous communities in the interior, the kingdom authorities conduct persistent raids to Sea Dayak villages and forcing them to practice horticultural modes as a new method to sustain their lives. This was done as most of the Sea Dayak at the time refused to abandon the culture and only agreed after been stopped through their major rebellion. Other Dayaks like the Land Dayak were also previously involved in headhunting, but most of them are peaceful people who abide by the laws and only attacking if attacked by other tribes; which subsequently became Brooke loyal followers as they agreed to leaving the former culture. Most Malays coastal villages were also raided as part of the kingdom's policy to combating piracy and slavery. These policy turned to be successful but the kingdom was plagued by high debt as a result from several major rebellions in response to the ongoing supression campaign especially with the stagnant economic situation at the time.|$|E

Anne had declared it [...] "very necessary" [...] to conclude a union of England and Scotland in her first speech to the English Parliament, and a joint Anglo-Scots commission met at her former residence the Cockpit to discuss terms in October 1702. The negotiations broke up in early February 1703 having failed to reach an agreement. The Estates of Scotland responded to the Act of Settlement by passing the Act of Security, which gave the Estates the power, if the Queen had no further children, to choose the next Scottish monarch from among the Protestant descendants of the royal line of Scotland.
