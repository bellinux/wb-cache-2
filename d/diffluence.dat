5|$|Cyclone Kate {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure that was first identified on 22 February 2006, within a monsoonal trough. The system rapidly intensified throughout the day, with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing their first advisory on the system that evening. Upon being classified, the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate, skipping tropical low status. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P. The storm had developed well-defined, upper-level outflow enhanced by <b>diffluence</b> over the system.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and <b>diffluence</b> aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E
5|$|On August14, 2015, a {{well-defined}} tropical wave, accompanied by significant surface pressure falls, traversed Western Africa and emerged over the Atlantic Ocean that evening. A broad surface low developed along the wave on August15. Embedded within monsoon flow, various environmental factors enabled gradual {{development of the}} disturbance, including low wind shear, above-average sea surface temperatures, moderate moisture content, and favorable <b>diffluence.</b> A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system generally west-northwest throughout its entire existence. On August17, the surface low became increasingly defined and convection more persistent. It subsequently acquired enough organization to be classified a tropical depression—the fourth of the 2015season—at 06:00UTC on August18. At this time, it was situated about 825mi (1,325km) west-southwest of Praia, Cape Verde.|$|E

40|$|The {{wandering}} river pattern {{represents one}} of the last remaining river patterns that are not well understood. Many aspects of these rivers are not well known, particularly the processes of their creation and maintenance. The term wandering describes gravel or cobble bedded rivers, transitional between braided and meandering, with multiple channel sections around semi-permanent islands connected by single channel sections. This dissertation investigates the controls on the characteristics of wandering rivers within the Miramichi region of New Brunswick through time and at three nested spatial scales. At the scale of rivers, three factors appear to be needed for wandering to occur: (1) wide valleys, (2) channel energy between braiding and meandering, and (3) avulsion triggers, frequent overbank flows caused by icejams in the Miramichi. Principal component analysis showed that larger wandering rivers displayed greater anabranching intensity than smaller rivers, perhaps related to higher stage ice jams within larger rivers. At the scale of channels, the wandering pattern of the Renous River was found to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, with channel creation balanced by channel abandonment. The anabranch cycle model was developed to illustrate the temporal dynamics of anabranch creation, maintenance and abandonment within wandering rivers. Also at the channel scale, principal component analysis of channel reaches within the Renous River displayed differences in grain size and hydraulic efficiency between side-channels and main-channels. Energy and sediment mobility within side-channels was related to their formation, maintenance and abandonment. Energy and sediment mobility within main-channels was related to mega bedforms called bedwaves. The apex of some bedwaves occurred at <b>diffluences.</b> At the scale of channel elements, <b>diffluences</b> are stable where a large bar is formed and accretes upstream, creating a large reservoir of sediment upstream of anabranch channels to buffer their degradation. Where <b>diffluences</b> are unstable, a large bar forms within one anabranch channel to partially block flow and may cause its abandonment. The dissertation illustrates that within wandering rivers, processes occurring at multiple spatial and temporal scales interact to create and maintain the pattern...|$|R

5|$|On June24, 2004, {{an area of}} low {{pressure}} associated with developing convection formed about 1,110km (690mi) to the east-southeast of Guam. Early the next day, as the system began to intensify, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the {{low pressure}} as a tropical depression. With low wind shear and favorable <b>diffluence,</b> the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the storm at 0000UTC, classifying it as Tropical Depression 11W twelvehours later. The depression traveled towards the northwest along the edge of a mid-latitude ridge. Outer bands began developing around the system, although the ridge to its north restricted outflow. About 24hours after the JMA designated the depression, the agency upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Tingting, which was contributed by Hong Kong and is a fairly common pet name for young girls. At 0600UTC on June26, the JTWC also classified Tingting as a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression originated {{from an area}} of low pressure in the South China Sea on September1. Scattered convection was associated with the system, with the center devoid of showers and thunderstorms, as the low slowly tracked westward in a weak steering environment. Weak outflow had formed along the northern edge of the system; however, intensification was not anticipated. The following day, convection began to form around the center of circulation and weak <b>diffluence</b> was noted around the system due to an anticyclone to the north. With low wind shear, convective banding features began to develop and the possibility of the system becoming a tropical cyclone increased. Early on September3, the JMA began issuing advisories on the cyclone, classifying it as a {{tropical depression}}, the twentieth depression to be monitored by the JMA during the season.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Vamei {{weakened}} {{quickly as}} it crossed the extreme southern portion of the Malay Peninsula, and late on December 27 the JMA downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the Straits of Malacca. The JTWC initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm, though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the center again approached land. Early on December 28, Vamei moved ashore along northeastern Sumatra, and at 0600UTC the JMA classified the storm as dissipated. However, convection persisted near the circulation over land, {{believed to have been}} caused by the process known as upper-level <b>diffluence.</b> On December 29, what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern Bay of Bengal. In a post-season re-evaluation, the JTWC classified the system as a continuation of Vamei, based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of Vamei crossed Sumatra without dissipating. Convection re-developed, and late on December 30 the JTWC classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390km (245mi) west-southwest of the northwestern tip of Sumatra; initially, due to being treated as a separate system, it was classified as Tropical Cyclone05B. Vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization, though increased wind shear on December 31 rapidly weakened the storm; by late that day, the center was exposed from the deep convection, and Vamei quickly dissipated.|$|E
40|$|Braided rivers produce flow confluences and divergences (<b>diffluences)</b> {{in roughly}} equal numbers, but braided river {{research}} has focused mainly on confluences. Divergences, however, are of equal importance dynamically: they are sites of formation of central bars {{and the development of}} flow divisions that can steer the flow toward one part of the braided network or another. In a series of experiments on flow in isolated, welldefined bifurcations, we found that although a central bar always develops, the divided flow may continue to flow {{on both sides of the}} bar (‘‘stable’’ bifurcation) or may eventually be forced entirely to one side of the bar or the other (‘‘unstable’’ bifurcation). We found that an unstable bifurcation forms when the flow field is characterized by both a low Shields stress and a nonuniform incoming flow. We also found that divergences with erodible banks tend to an equilibrium configuration that depends mainly on the widening ratio of the channel...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has examined the}} factors controlling the geometrical configuration of bifurcations, determined the range of stability conditions {{for a number of}} bifurcation types and assessed the impact of perturbations on bifurcation evolution. However, the flow division process and the parameters that influence flow and sediment partitioning are still poorly characterized. To identify and isolate these parameters, three-dimensional velocities were measured at 11 cross-sections in a fixed-walled experimental bifurcation. Water surface gradients were controlled, and systematically varied, using a weir in each distributary. As may be expected, the steepest distributary conveyed the most discharge (was dominant) while the mildest distributary conveyed the least discharge (was subordinate). A zone of water surface super-elevation was co-located with the bifurcation in symmetric cases or displaced into the subordinate branch in asymmetric cases. Downstream of a relatively acute-angled bifurcation, primary velocity cores were near to the water surface and against the inner banks, with near-bed zones of lower primary velocity at the outer banks. Downstream of an obtuse-angled bifurcation, velocity cores were initially at the outer banks, with near-bed zones of lower velocities at the inner banks, but patterns soon reverted to match the acute-angled case. A single secondary flow cell was generated in each distributary, with water flowing inwards at the water surface and outwards at the bed. Circulation was relatively enhanced within the subordinate branch, which may help explain why subordinate distributaries remain open, {{may play a role in}} determining the size of commonly-observed topographic features, and may thus exert some control on the stability of asymmetric bifurcations. Further, because larger values of circulation result from larger gradient disadvantages, the length of confluence-diffluence units in braided rivers or between <b>diffluences</b> within delta distributary networks may vary depending upon flow structures inherited from upstream and whether, and how, they are fed by dominant or subordinate distributaries.

5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and was providing good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear the depression was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to the depression by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being fueled by a poleward <b>diffluence</b> despite being in an area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to wrap in to its low level circulation center which started to weaken the depression after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a peak pressure of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the baroclinic zone approached the depression late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure as the baroclinic zone was approaching the depression, as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on the depression until early the next morning when the depression was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E
25|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Hamish {{was first}} {{identified}} on 4 March 2009 by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) as a tropical {{low over the}} Coral Sea. Drifting westward, the system steadily became better defined, developing convective banding features later that day. Situated in an area favouring tropical cyclone development, characterised by warm waters, low wind shear and upper-level <b>diffluence,</b> the low was able to quickly strengthen. The following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as convection wrapped around the centre of circulation and an anticyclone developed over the system, allowing for good outflow. Hours later, the BoM classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Hamish as the storm began to moved southward {{in response to a}} mid-level ridge situated to the east. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC also began monitoring Hamish as a tropical storm.|$|E
25|$|Tracking southwest, {{the storm}} was named Tropical Cyclone Ami at {{approximately}} 0000UTC on January 12 under favorable upper-level <b>diffluence</b> facilitated by the nearby ridge of high pressure. Influenced by an upper-level trough, Ami slowed in forward movement and turned on a more southerly course. With minimal wind shear and a good outflow pattern, Ami achieved severe tropical cyclone intensity at 0600UTC on January 13. A poorly defined eye feature became visible on satellite imagery, at which point {{the storm was}} situated around 160mi (260km) north-northeast of Labasa. The cyclone made landfall on Vanua Levu with a minimum barometric pressure of 960mbar (28.4inHg) before subsequently crossing the western tip of Taveuni. Broadly turning toward the southeast, Ami traversed the Lau Islands. While located about 60 miles south of Lakeba– at 0600UTC on January 14– the storm reached its peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 90mph (140km/h) and a pressure of 950mbar (28.0inHg). At the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm with 1-minute winds of 125mph (201km/h).|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} week of October, an unusually large, monsoon-like lower-level {{circulation}} and a broad area of disturbed weather developed over much of the Caribbean Sea. The system was enhanced by <b>diffluence</b> from an upper-level low across the southwestern Atlantic. By October 13, a broad area of low pressure developed and persisted about [...] southeast of Jamaica, possibly aided by the passage of tropical waves through the area at the time. Convection increased and became slightly better organized, though upper-level wind shear initially prevented development. The system drifted westward, and early on October 14 the convection became more concentrated and a little better organized as upper-level wind shear lessened slightly.|$|E
500|$|Typhoon Meranti {{originated}} {{out of an}} area of {{low pressure}} about 475km (295mi) south of Wake Island on August2. Little deep convection accompanied the weak system despite being situated within an area of moderate <b>diffluence</b> and weak to moderate wind shear. Initially, the system was thought to have been [...] much closer to Wake Island; however, following the development of deep convection, the location of the center of circulation was corrected. Around 0000UTC on August3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific basin, designated the system as a tropical depression. Development continued as the depression moved into an area of divergence near a tropical upper-tropospheric trough cell. Several hours after the JMA issued their advisory on the depression, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, stating that the system was likely to develop into a tropical storm within 24hours.|$|E
500|$|An area of disorganized {{convection}} persisted east-northeast of Palau on April 11 {{in association}} with a sharp easterly wave, and within the system, a low pressure area was evident between Palau and Yap. Located beneath a developing anticyclone, with limited wind shear and enhanced <b>diffluence,</b> the system encountered favorable conditions for development. By April 13, a low-level circulation had formed and started consolidating about 260km (160mi) southeast of Bislig City on Mindanao island in the Philippines. At around the same time, weak rainbands began wrapping into the center. At 1200UTC on April 13, the JMA classified it as a weak tropical depression. Its development was impeded somewhat as it crossed Mindanao and Negros island, though the circulation consolidated while convective banding features increased. Later that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) classified the system as Tropical Depression Ambo, and early on April 14 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 02W about 300km (185mi north of the Zamboanga Peninsula). Also, PAGASA declared [...] "Ambo" [...] at 0300 UTC April 14 to be within Dumaguete City.|$|E
500|$|The {{remnants}} of Tropical Depression Five moved ashore on Louisiana on August12, {{by which time}} the circulation had become better defined. A small circular area of convection was observed on radar approaching New Orleans, supported by <b>diffluence</b> from an anticyclone over Georgia. The system moved slowly, turning northeastward and tracking inland along southern Mississippi on August13. By late on August14, the remnants reached central Alabama and began to move southward due to a ridge to its north. The next day it reached the Florida Panhandle, and before the low reached open waters, the NHC assessed a 50% chance for redevelopment due to favorable conditions. Early on August16, the low reached the Gulf of Mexico, and a Hurricane Hunters flight reported a weak circulation and convection that was disorganized and disassociated. Upper-level conditions remained only marginally favorable, although the NHC noted that [...] "only a small increase in organization {{would result in the}} formation of a tropical depression." [...] Early on August18, the {{remnants of}} the system dissipated over Southwestern Mississippi.|$|E
500|$|Mesoscale {{convective}} {{systems are}} thunderstorm regions {{which may be}} round or linear in shape, {{on the order of}} [...] or more across in one direction but smaller than extratropical cyclones, and include systems such as tropical cyclones, squall lines, and Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs), among others. [...] MCS is a more generalized term which includes systems that do not satisfy the stricter size, shape, or duration criteria of an MCC. [...] They tend to form near weather fronts and move into areas of 1000-500 mb thickness <b>diffluence,</b> which are areas where the low to mid level temperature gradient broadens, which generally steers the thunderstorm clusters into the warm sector of extratropical cyclones, or equatorward of warm fronts. [...] They can also form along any convergent zones within the tropics. [...] Their formation has been noted worldwide, from the Mei-Yu front in the far East to the deep tropics. Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall.|$|E
500|$|In late February2013, a monsoon trough {{combined}} with the Madden–Julian oscillation to produce an {{area of low pressure}} on 22February well to the northeast of the Kimberley region. Upon its formation, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) began monitoring the system as Tropical Low 10U. Low to moderate upper-level wind shear and favorable <b>diffluence</b> supported tropical cyclogenesis as the system moved slowly south along the edge of a subtropical ridge. By 23February, deep convective banding features were wrapping into a well-defined circulation. This prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300UTC and subsequently initiate advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 17S at 0000UTC on 24February. Surface pressures around the cyclone had significantly decreased by this time, with an automated weather station on Rowley Shoals, roughly 130km (80mi) southeast of the storm's centre, recording a 7mbar (hPa; 0.21inHg) drop to 993hPa (mbar; 29.33inHg) in 24hours. The BoM similarly classified the system as a tropical cyclone hours later as gale-force winds were observed on Bedout Island. They consequently assigned it the name Rusty, at which time the cyclone was situated roughly [...] north of Port Hedland, Western Australia.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after making}} landfall, {{convection}} {{associated with the}} storm deteriorated and the outflow became fragmented. A shortwave trough to the south caused the ridge steering Monica to weaken, leading to the cyclone moving slower. After moving over land, the storm began to weaken, with the Bureau of Meteorology downgrading the storm to weaken to Category 1 cyclone and the JTWC downgraded the cyclone to a tropical storm. The following day, Monica moved offshore, entering the Gulf of Carpentaria. Once back over water, favourable atmospheric conditions allowed the storm to quickly intensify. Within 24-hours of moving over water, Monica re-attained severe tropical cyclone status. Following a shift in steering currents, the storm slowed significantly and turned north-westward. Steady intensification continued through 22 April as the storm remained in a region of low wind shear and favourable <b>diffluence.</b> Early on 22 April the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Monica to a Category5 severe tropical cyclone, the third of the season. By this time, a [...] wide eye had developed within the central dense overcast of the cyclone. Later that day, the JTWC assessed Monica to have intensified into a Category 5 equivalent storm.|$|E
500|$|Cyclone Tessi {{originated}} in a northwest–southeast oriented trough of low pressure that {{developed in the}} Coral Sea {{at the end of}} March 2000. Similar conditions would lead to the genesis of Cyclone Vaughan in the same region just days later. Initially forming within the trade winds east of an upper-level trough over eastern Australia, the disturbance that ultimately spawned Tessi persisted in the area for nearly a week before becoming associated with an organised area of convection on 31 March, about [...] east of Cooktown, Queensland. At that point, the Bureau of Meteorology's (BoM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane operationally identified the system as a tropical low and began issuing gale warnings. At 00:00 UTC on 2 April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system 22S. <b>Diffluence</b> from an anticyclone to the east promoted favourable outflow in the upper levels of the atmosphere, and a closed centre of circulation rapidly formed. As the disturbance tracked southwestward around the periphery of a mid-level ridge to the south, its appearance on satellite imagery continued to improve, with distinct rainbands wrapping around the centre. At 18:00 UTC on 1 April, the system intensified into Tropical Cyclone Tessi while located under [...] northeast of Townsville, Queensland.|$|E
500|$|In late September 2010, a {{wide band}} of {{disturbed}} weather and low pressure, {{associated with the}} monsoon trough and remnant tropical moisture from Tropical Storm Matthew, meandered over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. With a broad upper ridge anchored along the Yucatán coast, <b>diffluence</b> aloft {{in the vicinity of}} the disturbance provided focus for the development of scattered convection. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted an environment supportive of tropical development, and by September27, a broad surface low formed amid the convection. The next day, surface pressures steadily dropped as sustained winds around the low proximated tropical storm force. Throughout the development process, moderate westerly wind shear over the region caused the disturbance to exhibit a rather asymmetric structure; it developed an elongated low-pressure center by September28, well to the northwest of its strongest wind field. Despite the asymmetry, the NHC initiated advisories on a tropical depression around 15:00 UTC that day, after surface and satellite observations revealed a sufficiently defined circulation center west of the deep convection. Post-season reassessments, however, indicated that a tropical storm had in fact formed three hours earlier, about 75miles (120km) south of Cuba's Isle of Youth, which operationally was not named Nicole until a day later.|$|E
60|$|With M M, the {{magnetic}} line, running {{from top to}} bottom, with f f its northern pole, or pole of attraction; and m m its south, or pole of repulsion, and E E, running from left to right, one of the lines that spring from each point of M M, with its east, or pole of contraction, and d its west, or pole of <b>diffluence</b> and expansion—we have presented to us the universal quadruplicity, or four elemental forms of power; in the endless proportions and modifications of which, the innumerable offspring of all-bearing Nature consist. Wisely docile to the suggestions of Nature herself, the ancients significantly expressed these forces under the names of earth, water, air, and fire; not meaning any tangible or visible substance so generalized, but the powers predominant, and, as it were, the living basis of each, which no chemical decomposition can ever present to the senses, were it only that their interpenetration and co-inherence first constitutes them sensible, and is the condition and meaning of a—thing. Already our more truly philosophical naturalists (Ritter, for instance) have begun to generalize the four great elements of chemical nomenclature, carbon, azote, oxygen, and hydrogen: the two former as {{the positive and negative}} pole of {{the magnetic}} axis, or as the power of fixity and mobility; and the two latter as the opposite poles, or plus and minus states of cosmical electricity, as the powers of contraction and dilatation, or of comburence and combustibility. These powers are to each other as longitude to latitude, and the poles of each relatively as north to south, and as east to west. For surely the reader will find no distrust in a system only because Nature, ever consistent with herself, presents us everywhere with harmonious and accordant symbols of her consistent doctrines. Nothing would be more easy than, by the ordinary principles of sound logic and common sense, to demonstrate the impossibility and expose the absurdity of the corpuscularian or mechanic system, or than to prove the intenable nature of any intermediate system. But we cannot force any man into an insight or intuitive possession of the true philosophy, because we cannot give him abstraction, intellectual intuition, or constructive imagination; because we cannot organize for him an eye that can see, an ear that can listen to, or a heart that can feel, the harmonies of Nature, or recognise in her endless forms, the thousand-fold realization of those simple and majestic laws, which yet in their absoluteness can be discovered only in the recesses of his own spirit,—not by that man, therefore, whose imaginative powers have been ossified by the continual reaction and assimilating influences of mere objects on his mind, and who is a prisoner to his own eye and its reflex, the passive fancy!—not by him in whom an unbroken familiarity with the organic world, as if it were mechanical, with the sensitive, but as if it were insensate, has engendered the coarse and hard spirit of a sorcerer. The former is unable, the latter unwilling, to master the absolute pre-requisites. There is neither hope nor occasion for him “to cudgel his brains about it, he has no feeling of the business.” If he do not see the necessity from without, if he have not learned the possibility from within, of interpenetration, of total intussusception, of the existence of all in each as the condition of Nature’s unity and substantiality, and of the latency under the predominance of some one power, wherein subsists her life and its endless variety, as he must be, by habitual slavery to the eye, or its reflex, the passive fancy, under the influences of the corpuscularian philosophy, he has so paralysed his imaginative powers as to be unable—or by that hardness and heart-hardening spirit of contempt, which is sure to result from a perpetual commune with the lifeless, he has so far debased his inward being—as to be unwilling to comprehend the pre-requisite, he must be content, while standing thus at the threshold of philosophy, to receive the results, though he cannot be admitted to the deliberation—in other words, to act upon rules which he is incapable of understanding as LAWS, and to reap the harvest with the sharpened iron for which others have delved for him in the mine.|$|E

5000|$|By {{early the}} next morning, August 13, Sepat had a banding eye visible on {{microwave}} satellite imagery and had remained in an environment conducive for strengthening, including weakening wind shear. An upper-level anticyclone also moved over the storm. By now, Sepat had moved into PAGASA's area of responsibility and attained the local name [...] "Egay". The JMA upgraded Sepat to a severe tropical storm shortly after. Sepat continued to slowly gain more organisation and intensify further, and started to move faster {{under the influence of}} a subtropical steering ridge. Sepat strengthened into a typhoon on the morning of August 14 under still-decreasing wind shear and favourable <b>diffluence.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November 19 about 800 km (500 mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November 22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November 26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and <b>diffluence</b> aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E
50|$|On November 9, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather developed {{southeast of}} the Andaman Islands, with a weak low-level circulation near the Nicobar Islands. Initially moderate upper-level wind shear inhibited organization, while strong <b>diffluence</b> aloft aided in developing convection. Vertical shear decreased greatly as the circulation became better defined, and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued on November 11 while located a short distance south of the Andaman Islands. Around the same time, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression BOB 09. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded it to Tropical Cyclone 06B after Dvorak estimates indicated winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). Later that day, it intensified into a deep depression as it moved slowly north-westward.|$|E
50|$|On February 5,an area of {{convection}} persisted about 555 km (900 mi) {{north of}} Réunion {{in the southwest}} Indian Ocean. The system maintained a broad low-level circulation with associated deep convection, and it slowly developed banding features. By early on February 7, the circulation had become better defined as it remained {{in an area of}} weak wind shear and strong <b>diffluence.</b> At 0600 UTC, Météo-France (MFR) classified it as Tropical Depression Eleven about 880 km (550 mi) north-northeast of Mauritius. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S. The depression tracked east-southeastward, under the influence of a mid-level ridge. A cutoff low to the south of the system enhanced upper-level conditions, and it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Ivan.|$|E
