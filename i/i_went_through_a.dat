She has said of recording the album, [...] "Overall, this music came from various corners of the world—from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta—places we were on tour. While recording, we’d experiment with different sounds. Once we became engulfed in the sound, we all had an emotional connection to the album. It has definitely transformed my way of thinking, the way that I approach the stage and overall, my life".|$|E

2500|$|Born in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1976, Hendler {{was raised}} in the {{neighborhood}} of Buceo, and also lived in Pocitos, and Cordón. He grew up in a family of Jewish heritage; his father was a merchant and his mother a keen theatergoer. During his youth, Hendler used to play basketball in Hebraica and soccer. He attended the primary Colegio Integral, Hendler said, [...] "I studied in a Jewish school and I feel <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> phase where I wanted to distance from that environment, to discern better what I was surrounded with, what I wanted to choose and what I didn't from that set of values."

60|$|I {{had been}} {{wandering}} over {{the centre of}} Exmoor, killing trout as <b>I</b> <b>went,</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> country which owes its civilization and tillage {{to the spirit of}} one man, who has found stag-preserving by no means incompatible with large agricultural improvements; among a population who still evince an unpleasant partiality for cutting and carrying farmers' crops by night, without leave or licence, and for housebreaking after the true classic method of Athens, by fairly digging holes through the house walls; a little nook of primeval savagery fast reorganizing itself under the influences of these better days. I had been on Dartmoor, too; but of that noble moorland range so much has been said and sung of late, that I really am afraid it is becoming somewhat cockney and trite. Far and wide I had wandered, rod in hand, becoming a boy again in the land of my boyhood, till, once more at Ilfracombe, opposite me sat Claude Mellot, just beginning to bloom again into cheerfulness.|$|E

He is what he always was--the best-humoured man living; and our meetings, now more rare than usual, are seasoned with a recollection of old frolics and old friends. I am entertained to see him just the same he has always been, never yielding up his own opinion in fact, and yet in words acquiescing in all that could be said against it. George was always like a willow--he never offered resistance to the breath of argument, but never moved from his rooted opinion, blow as it listed. Exaggeration might make these peculiarities highly dramatic: Conceive a man who {{always seems to be}} acquiescing in your sentiments, yet never changes his own, and this with a sort of bonhomie which shows there is not a particle of deceit intended. He is only desirous to spare you the trouble of contradiction.|$|E

6000|$|My dear Brothers--I am safe at Southampton--after having ridden {{three stages}} outside {{and the rest}} in for it began to be very cold. I {{did not know the}} Names of any of the Towns I passed through--all I {{can tell you is that}} {{sometimes}} I saw dusty Hedges--sometimes Ponds--then nothing--then a little Wood with trees look you like Launce's Sister [...] "as white as a Lily and as small as a Wand"--then came houses which died away into a few straggling Barns--then came hedge trees aforesaid again. As the Lamplight crept along the following things were discovered--"long heath broom furze"--Hurdles here and there half a Mile--Park palings when the Windows of a House were always discovered by reflection--One Nymph of Fountain--N.B. Stone--lopped Trees--Cow ruminating--ditto Donkey--Man and Woman going gingerly along--William seeing his Sisters over the Heath--John waiting with a Lanthorn for his Mistress--Barber's Pole--Doctor's Shop--However after having had my fill of these I popped my Head out just as it began to Dawn--N.B. this Tuesday Morn saw the Sun rise--of which I shall say nothing at present. I felt rather lonely this Morning at Breakfast so I went and unbox'd a Shakspeare--"There's my Comfort."[11] I went immediately after Breakfast to Southampton Water where I enquired for the Boat to the Isle of Wight as I intend seeing that place before I settle--it will go at 3, so shall I after having taken a Chop. I know nothing of this place but that it is long--tolerably broad--has bye streets--two or three Churches--a very respectable old Gate with two Lions to guard it. The Men and Women do not materially differ from those I have been in the Habit of seeing. I forgot to say that from dawn till half-past six <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> most delightful Country--some open Down but for the most part thickly wooded. What surprised me most was an immense quantity of blooming Furze on each side the road cutting a most rural dash. The Southampton water when I saw it just now was no better than a low Water Water which did no more than answer my expectations--it will have mended its Manners by 3. From the Wharf are seen the shores on each side stretching to the Isle of Wight. You, Haydon, Reynolds, etc. have been pushing each other out of my Brain by turns. I have conned over every Head in Haydon's Picture--you must warn them not to be afraid should my Ghost visit them on Wednesday--tell Haydon to Kiss his Hand at Betty over the Way for me yea and to spy at her for me. I hope one of you will be competent to take part in a Trio while I am away--you need only aggravate your voices a little and mind not to speak Cues and all--when you have said Rum-ti-ti--you must not be rum any more or else another will take up the ti-ti alone and then he might be taken God shield us for little better than a Titmouse. By the by talking of Titmouse Remember me particularly to all my Friends--give my Love to the Miss Reynoldses and to Fanny who I hope you will soon see. Write to me soon about them all--and you George particularly how you get on with Wilkinson's plan. What could I have done without my Plaid? I don't feel inclined to write any more at present for I feel rather muzzy--you must be content with this fac simile of the rough plan of Aunt Dinah's Counterpane.|$|E
6000|$|Well, I {{was kind}} of bored on the train, and I bought some newspapers--New Haven newspapers--and {{there was not much}} news in them, so I read the {{advertisement}}s. There was one advertisement of a bench-show. I had heard of bench-shows, and I often wondered what there was about them to interest people. I had seen bench-shows--lectured to bench-shows, in fact--but I didn't want to advertise them or to brag about them. Well, I read on a little, and learned that a bench-show was not a bench-show--but dogs, not benches at all--only dogs. I began to be interested, and as {{there was nothing else to}} do I read every bit of the advertisement, and learned that the biggest thing in this show was a St. Bernard dog that weighed one hundred and forty-five pounds. Before I got to New York I was so interested in the bench-shows that I made up my mind to go to one the first chance I got. Down on Sixth Avenue, near where that back door might be, I began to take things leisurely. I did not like to be in too much of a hurry. There was not anything in sight that looked like a back door. The nearest approach to it was a cigar store. So I went in and bought a cigar, not too expensive, but it cost enough to pay for any information I might get and leave the dealer a fair profit. Well, I did not like to be too abrupt, to make the man think me crazy, by asking him if that was the way to Daly's Theatre, so I started gradually to lead up to the subject, asking him first if that was the way to Castle Garden. When I got to the real question, and he said he would show me the way, I was astonished. He sent me through a long hallway, and I found myself in a back yard. Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> long passageway and into a little room, and there before my eyes was a big St. Bernard dog lying on a bench. There was another door beyond and I went there, and was met by a big, fierce man with a fur cap on and coat off, who remarked, [...] "Phwat do yez want?" [...] I told him I wanted to see Mr. Daly. [...] "Yez can't see Mr. Daly this time of night," [...] he responded. I urged that I had an appointment with Mr. Daly, and gave him my card, which did not seem to impress him much. [...] "Yez can't get in and yez can't shmoke here. Throw away that cigar. If yez want to see Mr. Daly, yez 'll have to be after going to the front door and buy a ticket, and then if yez have luck and he's around that way yez may see him." [...] I was getting discouraged, but I had one resource left that had been of good service in similar emergencies. Firmly but kindly I told him my name was Mark Twain, and I awaited results. There was none. He was not fazed a bit. [...] "Phwere's your order to see Mr. Daly?" [...] he asked. I handed him the note, and he examined it intently. [...] "My friend," [...] I remarked, [...] "you can read that better if you hold it the other side up." [...] But he took no notice of the suggestion, and finally asked: [...] "Where's Mr. Daly's name?" [...] "There it is," [...] I told him, [...] "on the top of the page." [...] "That's all right," [...] he said, [...] "that's where he always puts it; but I don't see the 'W' in his name," [...] and he eyed me distrustfully. Finally, he asked, [...] "Phwat do yez want to see Mr. Daly for?" [...] "Business." [...] "Business?" [...] "Yes." [...] It was my only hope. [...] "Phwat kind--theatres?" [...] that was too much. [...] "No." [...] "What kind of shows, then?" [...] "Bench-shows." [...] It was risky, but I was desperate. [...] "Bench--shows, is it--where?" [...] The big man's face changed, and he began to look interested. [...] "New Haven." [...] "New Haven, it is? Ah, that's going to be a fine show. I'm glad to see you. Did you see a big dog in the other room?" [...] "Yes." [...] "How much do you think that dog weighs?" [...] "One hundred and forty-five pounds." [...] "Look at that, now! He's a good judge of dogs, and no mistake. He weighs all of one hundred and thirty-eight. Sit down and shmoke--go on and shmoke your cigar, I'll tell Mr. Daly you are here." [...] In a few minutes I was on the stage shaking hands with Mr. Daly, and the big man standing around glowing with satisfaction. [...] "Come around in front," [...] said Mr. Daly, [...] "and see the performance. I will put you into my own box." [...] And as I moved away I heard my honest friend mutter, [...] "Well, he desarves it." ...|$|E
