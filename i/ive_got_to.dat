5000|$|Charles <b>Ives</b> <b>got</b> {{the idea}} <b>to</b> write a holiday symphony {{during the summer}} of 1905. He wanted to write each {{movement}} as if it were based on a grown man’s memory of his childhood holidays. “Here are melodies like icons, resonating with memory and history, with war, childhood, community, and nation.” Ives constructed these movements based on personal memories from his past, including his father, George Ives, and the town of Danbury. His father had a huge impact on Ives’s compositions, especially after he died in November 1894. Ives lived in Danbury throughout his childhood, a town which holds many of the life experiences that inspired him to compose a Holiday Symphony.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Quietus in March 2017, Leary talked about the group possibly making a new album, their first in 16 years: [...] "Weve all been busy with our own separate things, and Ive {{done a lot of}} producing in the past few years, and <b>Ive</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the point now where I feel like Ive done doing that for a while, so its time to make a new Butthole Surfers album.

5000|$|Martyn Williams {{remained}} {{in the dressing room}} for 90 minutes after the game, and when he emerged opted not to speak to the media. He later did give his reaction, expressing his opinion that the format {{was a bit of a}} lottery and observed [...] "somebody was going to miss - <b>Ive</b> just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> live with the fact that it was me." [...] He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him. Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick, as Williams miss meant that in the event Crane also missed, the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue. Tom James who had missed a kick earlier in the shoot-out which would have won the match for Cardiff said that [...] "gutted is the only word that properly describes how I am feeling".|$|R

So the song is about rising sexual tension; it has chords that keep going up like an C. Escher staircase and in the end theres this big release." [...] Glenn Gregory later recalled that he laughed [...] "when Martyn walked in and said he had this great idea for a song based on the Lord’s Prayer with a never-ending chord structure" [...] (the line [...] "lead us not into temptation" [...] is taken from the Lords Prayer).|$|E
5000|$|The Great Silence has {{influenced}} {{the works of}} Quentin Tarantino. Describing the film as his favorite [...] "snow Western", he has paid homage to it in Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight. Robert Richardson, the cinematographer for The Hateful Eight, noted that he and Tarantino studied The Great Silences photography to get {{an understanding of the}} intimacy Tarantino wanted to achieve in the film. Upon being asked what his favorite Western films where, he responded with [...] "I do love The Great Silence, because Quentin turned me on to it and I love the cinematic nature of that, in the snow.

So I had Elizabeth Taylor kissing Richard Burton, and a cop is holding the crowd back — and just {{for the fun of it}} I put Eddie Fisher being trampled by the crowd. What a cruel thing to do! And then, when you fold it in, shes moving on from Richard Burton and kissing the next guy in the crowd. Its so simplistic and silly and juvenile! And anyone could have done that! ...|$|E

[...] Great, hes a great guy. <b>Ive</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say something more. And so Im listening to an old Neil Diamond thing and hes going, [...] "And no one heard at all / Not even the chair."

If I were in that job, Id get down there and make a deal. Sure, Congress are lazy bastards, but so what? Youre the top guy. Youre the president of the company.

5000|$|Home Cookin’ is a horn-based soul {{band that}} {{played in the}} Las Vegas local scene from 1989 to 2000. Described by drummer and video game {{composer}} Frank Klepacki as [...] "just a good-time, funky dance band", the band {{has been compared to}} Tower of Power and featured a five-man horn section. Robins recalled, [...] "We were together {{for a couple of years}} and wanted to do some serious recording. I was working at a pizza place, making nothing. Pretty soon I realized, wheres the money going to come from? If Im going to do anything seriously musically, <b>Ive</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get some money first - and some knowledge." [...] The band became active again around 1995 [...] Around the mid 1990s, the band grew to include ten members, including a five-man horn section and drums played by video game music composer Frank Klepacki. The group released their debut album in 1997, named Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, and featuring fourteen tracks. Track nine, Soul Space Express, appeared on Road Rash: Jailbreak and the television series Cupid, while X-Rated Superstar was a number one hit and received regular airplay on Vegass KXTE-FM Xtreme Disorder format. Playboy playmate Corinna Harney volunteered to appear on the albums cover. The success of this song sparked a racy music video, which was given airplay on MTV for a brief period. Home Cookin songs were regularly included on Las Vegas scene compilation albums.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking of the {{upcoming}} album to Record Mirrors Ray Fox-Cumming, Harley said: [...] "Quite frankly, Ive always been much bigger as a live performer than I have on plastic. It will probably be my next album release. Basically {{it will be the}} whole of the one-and-a-half hour show I did on the last tour. We recorded the concerts at Glasgow, Birmingham, Newcastle, Hammersmith and The Rainbow, so there are plenty of versions of each song to choose from and make a good album. The results of what has been mixed so far have turned out excellently. I have cheated a little bit, though I think quite justifiably so. I altered the running order a bit, although I dont think that most people who went to the concerts will even notice. The reason for the change is that a running order which seems right for a show can be nonsense on plastic. Each side of each of the two records has to have a beginning and an end, which in all means eight ends-and-beginnings. In concert you dont have that problem. Ive also cheated a tiny amount by erasing the odd bum note. Out of five versions of a song that <b>Ive</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> choose from, there will always be one where the vocals in tune, the guitar solo sounds great and everything else is just about perfect, but even then theres always some little thing thats off and Im not going to spoil a good track by allowing an obvious bum note on it when that can be avoided." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétiens use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might the nomination. But youre {{not going to get the}} chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and <b>Ive</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> put people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident that he was going to win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|E
