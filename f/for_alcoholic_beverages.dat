5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they charge <b>for</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year.|$|E

25|$|Biblical {{literature}} uses several {{words in}} its original languages to refer to different types of alcoholic beverages. Some of these words have overlapping meaning, particularly {{the words in the}} Hebrew language compared to the words in Koine Greek, the language of both the Septuagint and the New Testament.

25|$|Post-operative gastric bypass {{patients}} {{develop a}} lowered tolerance <b>for</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> because their altered digestive tract absorbs alcohol {{at a faster}} rate than people who have not undergone the surgery. It also takes a post-operative patient longer to reach sober levels after consuming alcohol. In a study conducted on 36 post-operative patients and a control group of 36 subjects (who had not undergone surgery), each subject drank a 5 oz. glass of red wine and had the alcohol in their breath measured to evaluate alcohol metabolism. The gastric bypass group had an average peak alcohol breath level at 0.08%, whereas the control group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.05%. It took on average 108 minutes for the gastric bypass patients group to return to an alcohol breath of zero, while it took the control group an average of 72 minutes.|$|E
500|$|New Jersey's {{history of}} taverns and alcohol {{production}} dates to its early colonial period. Colonial winemakers received recognition by the Royal Society of Arts for producing high-quality wine, {{and a local}} distillery owner was asked by George Washington for his recipe for [...] "cyder spirits" [...] (applejack). Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the industry developed with the influx of European immigrants, specifically Germans and Italians, who presented a sizable market <b>for</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> and brought with them old world winemaking, brewing, and distilling techniques. With {{the rise of the}} temperance movement culminating in Prohibition (1919–1933), New Jersey's alcohol industry suffered; many breweries, wineries, and distilleries either closed or relocated to other states. The legacy of Prohibition restricted and prevented the industry's recovery until the state legislature began loosening restrictions and repealing Prohibition-era laws starting in 1981. New Jersey's alcohol industry is experiencing a renaissance, and recently enacted laws provide new opportunities for the state's wineries and breweries.|$|E

2500|$|Another unconducive {{policy is}} the legal {{restriction}} against alcohol, pushed forward by Islamist parties and organizations in the country.

Another unconducive policy is a rather strict policy on nightlife; local authority sometimes launched a raid on clubs, karaoke and discotheque in a pretext to curb down drugs and substance abuse in these places, which might be inconvenient for visitors. It was reported in April 2017 that the Indonesian government authorities arrested 32 foreign nationals for failing to show proper ID during a raid on an entertainment hub in Batam on 23 April 2017.
