Kanazawa studied the pullout resistance of welded depths 15 and 30  mm. The test result showed that pullout resistance of 30  mm was twice larger than that of 15  mm [5]. So the welded depth of 20 – 30  mm was frequently used in the other studies [7, 8]. But few researches focused on the regression relation between pullout resistance and welded depth.|$|R

40|$|The {{project was}} {{performed}} at Parker Hannifin Cylinder Division at Falköping, where a {{station in the}} most critical flow at the production has been studied, which is the <b>hand</b> <b>welding</b> station. Within this report, {{the purpose is to}} identify disturbances, in order to eliminate and reduce these by coming up with improvement proposals. Furthermore, the aim is to help improve the company's work with 5 S and TPM (Total Productive Maintenance). A combination of tools and concepts are being used in this project when generating improvement proposals to avoid the risk of falling back into old habits and facilitate the work. The combination of concepts, intends to be continued to work with, in order to facilitate for the company to reach even higher results. The methodology of TPM is the basis of the project, although it is not about a complete implementation of TPM, but is limited to chosen parts since it is a time consuming process that can go on for years. The main focus of TPM is about the first pillar, 5 S. Action plans for how to solve these problems and how to achieve the desired state has been established. Thereafter, the researchers in cooperation with the company´s staff have implemented a couple of small improvement proposals. Further improvement proposals have also been presented in this report, but due to the limited time no implementations was made. Moreover, this project is divided into a couple of phases. Situational analysis has been made through both interviews with staff and observation studies. Analysis has also been made by some numeric data taken out by researchers and partly through mapping the equipment. The intention of this is to create a status image of the current situation over the <b>hand</b> <b>welding</b> station. The current state has shown the appearance of problems and challenges that exist. Additional wastages and disturbances in the station can come up to the surface and can thus easily be identified. In turn, occurring wastages and disturbances can be eliminated and the amount of wasted time reduced with help of the action plans to reach a future state. Another method that occurs is spaghetti charts. It has been used for mapping up the existing procedures during the process of the orders in the station, and by that identified different types of disturbances. In addition, the creation of a Value Stream Mapping (VSM) has been made. The map is used as a measurement to identify how much time on a working day that is spent as value adding time and non-value adding time of work...|$|E

The base and weld metals of {{low alloy steel}} with clad or without clad were irradiated up to 1. 4 X 1024 n/m 2 (> 1 MeV) at 290 ℃, which approximately corresponds to the maximum neutron fluence of a 60 -year-operation plant’s vessel. The mechanical property tests, such as tensile, impact, side bend and hardness, were carried out after the repair-welding.

40|$|A new laser micro-spot welding {{procedure}} for copper {{has been developed}} in order to eliminate the shortcomings of existing techniques based on laser pulse shaping or in-situ temperature control. This procedure consists in dividing the welding process in four distinct temporal phases. Each phase is characterized by its set of control parameters and strategies: During the analysis phase the initial reflectivity of the work-piece surface is measured in order to estimate the absorptivity. During the heating/melting phase {{the temperature in the}} focal zone is increased at a programmed rate based on the reflectivity measurement in phase I. When the temperature reaches the melting point, the onset of melting is detected by measuring the drop of reflected laser power. The decrease in reflectivity is related {{to the size of the}} molten material. This allows to monitor the molten pool in real-time. The diameter and the depth of the molten pool grow steadily during the melt spreading/welding phase. Here, a fixed pulse shape is used for achieving and maintaining surface temperature stability. Finally, the cooling phase must guarantee a slow cooling rate during re-solidification in order to minimize the formation of defects like cracks. This novel technique allows producing highly reliable spot welds on copper. Only one active control based on the reflected laser power is needed during the most critical steps of the process. A simple passive control scheme based on a fixed laser power shape can be used for controlling the critical parameters throughout the remaining time of the welding cycle. The new technique is compared to other "state of the art" welding techniques: the weld quality can be largely improved with respect to simpler methods such as, e. g., pulse shaping. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>weld</b> qualities comparable to those obtained by a more complex method, the real-time temperature control, are achieved. However, the new procedure has a much higher potential for further miniaturizing the welding process...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the combined effects of weld metal undermatching and crack location on the fracture behavior of transversely loaded butt-welded joints in high-strength steel. Surface-cracked tensile panels were instrumented with stain gages and tested with notch locations at the heat-affected zone (HAZ), base and 30 % undermatched weld metals. It can be expected that for a given applied strain, the level of the strain concentration developed in undermatched weld region will be significantly lower in the high strain-hardening welds compared to the low work-hardening weld joint in high-strength steels. Therefore, in higher strength steel undermatched welds, substantial increase of the strain accumulation should be expected. Detailed strain measurements and tensile panel tests of this study reveal that if there is a defect in the undermatched weld, a combination of the low weld metal toughness and resulting strain accumulation in the weld metal lead to poor fracture performance. The HAZ notched tensile panel results indicate that weld metal undermatching causes an unsymmetrical strain distribution at the crack vicinity. Despite the occurrence of the high applied strain concentration at the weld metal side of HAZ notched panel, the gross section yielding (GSY) occurred similar to the base metal notched one. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>weld</b> metal notched panels showed net section yielding (NSY) with a considerably reduced ductility. An important difference in 30 % undermatched weld joint fracture performance, however, emerges when results are analyzed in terms of crack growth resistance curves. The J R-curves of the HAZ and weld metal notched panels have shown lower resistance behavior compared to the base metal panel. Therefore, it is concluded that the fracture performance of the undermatched welds cannot be fully understood if only strength or total strain capacity (applied side) of the entire panel is considered. The fracture toughness (material resistance side) of the undermatched weld joint should also be an integral part of the fracture performance assessment procedure. (orig.)

40|$|The {{challenging}} {{range of}} proposed landing {{sites for the}} Mars Science Laboratory Rover requires a rover thermal management system {{that is capable of}} keeping temperatures controlled across a wide variety of environmental conditions. On the Martian surface where temperatures can be as cold as - 123 degrees Centigrade and as warm as 38 degrees Centigrade, the Rover relies upon a Mechanically Pumped Fluid Loop (MPFL) and external radiators to maintain the temperature of sensitive electronics and science instruments within a - 40 degrees Centigrade to 50 degrees Centigrade range. The MPFL also manages significant waste heat generated from the Rover power source, known as the Multi Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG). The MMRTG produces 110 Watts of electrical power while generating waste heat equivalent to approximately 2000 Watts. Two similar Heat Exchanger (HX) assemblies were designed to both acquire the heat from the MMRTG and radiate waste heat from the onboard electronics to the surrounding Martian environment. Heat acquisition is accomplished on the interior surface of each HX while heat rejection is accomplished on the exterior surface of each HX. Since these two surfaces need to be at very different temperatures in order for the MPFL to perform efficiently, they need to be thermally isolated from one another. The HXs were therefore designed for high in-plane thermal conductivity and extremely low through-thickness thermal conductivity by using aerogel as an insulator inside composite honeycomb sandwich panels. A complex assembly of <b>hand</b> <b>welded</b> and uniquely bent aluminum tubes are bonded onto the HX panels and were specifically designed to be easily mated and demated {{to the rest of the}} Rover Heat Recovery and Rejection System (RHRS) in order to ease the integration effort. During the cruise phase to Mars, the HX assemblies serve the additional function of transferring heat from the Rover MPFL to the separate Cruise Stage MPFL so that heat generated deep inside the Rover can be dissipated via the Cruise Stage radiators. Significant fabrication challenges had to be overcome in order to make the HX design a reality. The cruise phase thermal performance of the Rover HXs was verified in the cruise phase system level thermal vacuum test that was performed at JPL in January of 2009.

40|$|Recent {{demand for}} very heavily {{serviced}} widespan office floors has led, {{as a natural}} development {{of the concept of}} haunched and tapered frames, to the use of composite flooring systems supported by tapered (varying web depth) beams. These systems are very attractive from an economic point of view, combining wide spans, rapid erection and easy access to services between the shallow parts of the beam and the ceiling below. One of the most pressing needs is for {{a better understanding of the}} local buckling behaviour of the relatively deep slender web at changes of slope in the lower flange, in particular at the slope change which occurs at the centre of a beam whose depth increases linearly from each support. In the past, with plate girders, this failure mechanism was less relevant than lateral torsional buckling. With the substantial top flange of a composite section, lateral buckling is less likely, and local buckling more likely to govern the design. The tapered beam sections are fabricated from plates by welding and are susceptible to imperfection effects and residual stresses. These phenomena may interact with the localized compressive stress field which is generated in the web at any slope change in the flange to cause local web buckling. The provision of local stiffening is technically feasible, but very expensive. The beam itself is produced fully automatically and the subsequent hand installation of stiffeners consumes man-hours out of all proportion to the weight of steel involved. The prime objective of the present study was to iucntify the relative importance of several parameters that influence the phenomenon, such as angle of taper, web thickness, flange area and others. For practical reasons, the experiments were executed at half-scale and the models simulated the concrete slab of the composite beam by a heavy steel top flange. Three tapered models have been tested with different web thicknesses i. e, 3, 5, and 7 millimetres. Three more specimens with different plastic neutral axis positions were also tested. An extensive parametric study has been made using a non-linear elastoplastic finite element program. This study covered practical ranges of the important parameters including the area of the tension flange and the position of the plastic neutral axis. Moment-rotation relations, peak moments and failure mechanisms have been predicted. Very good correlation was obtained between the results of the parametric study and the experiments.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, several {{metallic}} materials with ultrafine-grained structures and characterized by high {{strength and toughness}} have been developed. When these ultrafine-grained materials are practically used, welding and joining processes are required.

On the other <b>hand,</b> friction stir <b>welding</b> (FSW) is a solid-state joining process having lower heat-input than fusion welding processes, enabling formation of a fine grain structure in the stir zone.

40|$|Abstract. A linear {{correlation}} between the depth {{and the length of}} the weld pool is found in laser beam welding experiments with varied laser beam power and constant welding speed. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>weld</b> pool length changes only slightly with increased welding speed and constant laser beam power. The existing analytical and numerical models fail to explain these dependences. The observed effects are essentially conditioned by the fluid flow in the weld pool caused by the thermocapillary effect, by the friction forces of the metal vapour passing through the capillary and by the convexity of weld pool and fusion zone caused by thermal expansion of the weld pool and the joined workpieces. In order to predict the weld pool length more accurately the model developed by Sudnik et al in 1996 is enlarged by the heat transport produced by the recirculating flow in radial sections of the weld pool. Verification of the model for 16 MnCr 5 steel with sheet thicknesses of 2 and 6 mm shows that it is suitable for predicting the weld pool geometry and for analysing the thermodynamics of the process.

Oxy-acetylene welding was a very popular welding process in previous decades; however, the development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other <b>hand,</b> oxy-acetylene <b>welding</b> equipment is quite versatile - {{not only because the}} torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still very popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in nearly every metal fabrication shop. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene will decompose explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to carry on joining of {{thermoplastic}} components in order to extend its results, in the future, to semi-manufactured components obtained through injection moulding processes. Although this technology has remarkable advantage as productivity, automation and cheapness, doesn’t allow to produce hollow components all at once. For this reason {{it is necessary to}} add a successive joining process. The most common technologies now used to join plastic materials shows that the Hot Plate Welding process is characterized by advantages as mechanical strength, freedom in design, cheapness, etc. On the other <b>hand</b> Laser <b>Welding</b> shows remarkable advantage as process speed, aesthetic quality, mechanical strength, versatility, minimum and local transfer of energy and absence of contact. Through Hot Plate welding the author carried out samples welded in different configurations changing process parameters like temperature and time of interaction. The characterization of the joining has been done through tensile test, in comparison with an one-piece sample. Results confirm Hot Plate is a valid technology although further development are necessary to optimize the process. Concerning Laser Welding the author chose a Diode Laser because of his efficiency, cheapness, lightness, smallness and lower specific power than the other lasers. Preliminary tests, performed to analyze interaction laser-material, allowed to determine optimal process parameters. Samples have been welded with various configuration and mechanical properties has been determined for each one. Laser joining could be carried out changing fundamental parameters like pressure, speed, temperature, focalization of the beam and power. Results show how some parameters have a great influence on joining. In order to further develop this technology and to estimate the advantages of other processes, it is necessary to define quantitatively these parameters in order to outline a control process...|$|R
