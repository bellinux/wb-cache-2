50|$|As {{the output}} signal after the {{pre-processing}} of sensor signals with a laser scanner and light-section sensor, the so-called height {{profile of the}} measured <b>groove</b> <b>geometry</b> is achieved. It represents {{the surface of the}} workpiece along the section at the projected laser line.3 D measuring systems with active illumination are mainly using the light-section method in combination with the projection of several parallel laser lines. In doing so, each line generates a height profile. Through the arrangement of several lines along the weld groove, a further dimension is achieved which shows the change of the height profiles of the <b>groove</b> <b>geometry.</b> Through the number of the lines, the resolution in groove longitudinal direction is increasing, however, the data processing expenditure is also increasing. Similar to the projection of several parallel lines, the measurement via a projected circle or other geometrical figures on the workpiece surface is possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} of the workpiece is determined from the known dimensions of the sensor and the triangulation angle α.This type of one-dimensional optical distance measurement systems is widely used {{in the field of}} industrial automation technique and is therefore offered by many companies. In automated welding, they are often used for the detection of the part and/or groove position {{before the start of the}} welding process.There are different types of design of the two-dimensionally measuring sensor systems. From the 1D triangulation sensor, the two-dimensional laser scanner can be derived from the oscillation movement. Here, the <b>groove</b> <b>geometry</b> is detected via a scanning movement transverse to the groove (Figure 5). This is mainly carried out via a movable mirror unit which is integrated in the sensor head.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a stable}} {{equilibrium}} in point 1 of Figure 8 where the energy {{which has been}} input into the process is sufficient for the melting of the continuously fed wire electrode. In {{the case of a}} rapid change of distance, the arc compensates the length change, point 2. The lower resistance of the short arc brings about the increase of the current intensity which leads to the faster melting of the wire stick-out until again a stable working point is reached, point 3. This compensation process takes approximately between 100 and 200 ms. The arc sensor evaluates the remaining change in current intensity between point 1 and point 3 in order to achieve a distance-proportionate parameter. In principle, this evaluation concept is also applicable to pulsed arc welding.The concept which has been specified above is, in the case of most arc sensors, extended by the transversal scanning of the <b>groove</b> <b>geometry.</b> The deflection of the process to the fusion faces allows the comparative measurement of the torch distance. By calculating the difference of the distance values, the lateral positioning of the torch can be evaluated. The mean value of both distance values indicates the height of the torch above the groove. Different concepts are applied for the deflection (Figure 9).Mechanical oscillation is most widely spread and is frequently used, especially with robots. Basically, fast deflectory systems, e.g. with magnetic or rotatory deflection offer the improvement of the signal rate and the signal quality, a higher apparatus expenditure must, however, be calculated when these systems are used. In double-wire technique, both fusion faces are scanned at the same time with one wire each.|$|E

In order to study the formation of spiral grooves on the inner surface of tube, a FEM model operated on DEFORM is established. Two ploughing processes are simulated. At first, an initial groove is manufactured on the workpiece, and then a nearby groove, which will influence the initial <b>groove's</b> <b>geometry,</b> is manufactured with twelve feeds separately. The <b>groove's</b> <b>geometries,</b> including <b>groove</b> width, inclined angle and fin height, are detected. Geometry comparison between the two grooves show that different feed results in different groove shape.

40|$|Corneal {{epithelial}} wounds heal rapidly by the inwards {{growth of}} tissue with a contracting wound front. A synthetic polymer lens to correct refractive error (an implantable contact lens) could {{be incorporated into}} the cornea using this wound healing process. Topographical cues on the polymer surface may facilitate epithelial tissue migration over the anterior device surface. Here, silicone discs with a defined surface <b>geometry</b> of parallel <b>grooves</b> (groove and ridge widths of 1, 2, 5 and 10 microm; groove depths of 1 and 5 microm) were implanted into corneas and maintained in organ culture. The nature and rate of epithelial tissue migration over the test surfaces was monitored for 8 days and evaluated using microscopy and histology. Irrespective of the pitch, deep <b>groove</b> <b>geometries</b> directed tissue migration laterally along the grooves but this prevented contraction of the wound front and retarded migration rates. No guidance occurred on any of the shallow <b>groove</b> <b>geometries</b> but these allowed inwards radial migration with a contracting wound front and supported migration rates equivalent to a flat surface. None of the geometries tested promoted tissue migration above a flat polymer surface and data suggested that parallel grooves may not be optimal for this application...|$|R
50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing the wire, meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. The wire places itself into a prefabricated <b>groove</b> <b>geometry</b> of the coil body and the wire guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since the wire always loses in cross-sectional area due to the wire drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for the max. possible wire diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of the wire and the coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even the wire guiding nozzle itself within the wire feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of the wire during the winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of the wire is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of the wire onto the winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that the wire leaves the wire guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside the wire that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|E

40|$|Cavitation is a {{limiting}} {{phenomenon in}} many domains of fluid mechanics. Instabilities of a partial cavity developed on an hydrofoil, a converging-diverging step {{or in an}} inter-blade channel in turbomachinery, have already been investigated and described in many previous works. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate a passive control method of the sheet cavity. According to operating conditions, cavitation can be described by two different regimes: an unstable regime with a cloud cavitation shedding and a stable regime with only a pulsating sheet cavity. Avoiding cloud cavitation can limit structure damages since a pulsating sheet cavity is less agressive. The surface condition of a converging-diverging step, like a Venturi-type obstacle, is here studied as a solution for a passive control of the cavitation. This study discusses the effect of an organized roughness, in the shape of longitudinal grooves, on the developed sheet cavity. Analyzes conducted with Laser Doppler Velocimetry, visualisations and pressure measurements show that the <b>grooves</b> <b>geometry,</b> and especially the groove depth, acts on the sheet cavity dynamics.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{electron}} backscattered diffraction patterns {{to determine the}} misorientation of 201 adjacent pairs of grains in a magnesia polycrystal. The width and depth of the thermal grooves formed by these same grain boundaries were also measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). By simulating the errors associated with the AFM observations and comparing our observations to existing data for magnesia and alumina, we show that, under appropriate experimental conditions, surface dihedral angles, relative grain-boundary energies, and surface diffusivities determined from AFM measurements are consistent with data acquired by more laborious techniques. Correlation of the grain-boundary misorientation and thermal <b>groove</b> <b>geometry</b> leads to the observation that grain boundaries with small misorientations, regardless of the rotation axis, have shallow thermal grooves and relatively low grain-boundary energies. Furthermore, numerous boundaries with relatively large misorientations but shallow thermal grooves correspond to special boundaries near coincident-sitelattice (CSL) misorientations. Finally, the data set indicates that factors other than the boundary misorientation, such as anisotropy of the surface energy and the grain-boundary tangent plane, {{play a role in}} determining the <b>groove</b> <b>geometry.</b> I...|$|E
