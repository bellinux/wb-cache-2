40|$|International audienceFaecal {{incontinence}} (FI) requires careful {{assessment of}} its aetiology {{to determine the}} most effective treatment. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate MRI <b>defaecography</b> in FI and to compare it with clinical examination combined with rigid rectoscopy in assessing the pelvic floor in patients with FI. Consecutive patients with FI referred over a 3 -year period to our tertiary centre for MRI <b>defaecography</b> were retrospectively studied. MRI images of the pelvic floor were compared with clinical examination and anuscopy and rectoscopy. Seventy-four female patients [mean age 60. 5 (30. 0 - 81. 0) years] were recruited. MRI <b>defaecography</b> showed conditions which often overlapped, including internal intussusception in 19 (25. 7 %) and pelvic floor descent in 24 (32. 4 %). There was average agreement between MRI and clinical examination for a significant anterior rectocoele (κ =  0. 40) and poor agreement between MRI and anuscopy/rectoscopy for intra-rectal (κ =  0. 06) and intra-anal intussusception (κ =  0. 11). Other than for anterior rectocoele, there is poor correlation between MRI <b>defaecography</b> and clinical examination with rigid rectoscopy. MRI can detect a variety of abnormal static and dynamic pelvic disorders. This includes enterocoele, which could result in a modification of the surgical approach to intussusception and anterior rectocoele...|$|E
40|$|Objective {{methods for}} {{examination}} of pouch function are warranted {{for a better}} understanding of the functional result and treatment of dysfunction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of scintigraphic intestinal transit time and <b>defaecography</b> compared to the results of pouch function, mucosal condition and a questionnaire on quality of life (QoL). This cross-sectional study included 21 patients. Scintigraphic transit time and <b>defaecography</b> was determined with the use of Tc- 99 m. Pouch function was assessed by number of bowel movements, pouch volume, and continence. Pouch mucosal condition was evaluated by endoscopy and histology. Median transit time was 189 min (105 – 365). Median ejection fraction at <b>defaecography</b> (EF) was 49 % (3 – 77) and 62 % (17 – 98) after first and second defecation. Median pouch volume was 223 mL (100 – 360). A median daily stool frequency of nine (4 – 25) was reported and three (14 %) patients suffered from daytime incontinence. No patients had symptomatic or endoscopic pouchitis; however, the histology showed unspecific inflammation in 19 (90 %) patients. There was no correlation between transit time, evacuation fraction (EF) and pouch function in univariate analysis. However, we found a high body mass index (BMI) and a low bowel movement frequency to be associated with a longer transit time by multivariate analysis. Scintigraphic determination of transit time and <b>defaecography</b> are feasible methods in patients with ileal pouch anal anastomosis, but the clinical relevance is yet doubtful...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades {{developments}} in imaging have changed the assessment of patients with anorectal disease. The literature on imaging techniques for anorectal diseases was reviewed over the period 1980 - 1999. For the staging of primary rectal tumours, phased array magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be regarded as the most appropriate single technique. The combination of endosonography or endoluminal MRI with ultrasonography or spiral computed tomography yields similar results. All techniques have limitations both for local staging and in the assessment of distant metastases. MRI or positron emission tomography is preferable for tumour recurrence. For perianal fistula, high-resolution MRI (phased array or endoluminal) is the technique of choice. For constipation, <b>defaecography</b> is the preferred technique, nowadays with emphasis on functional information. The role of magnetic resonance <b>defaecography</b> is currently being evaluated. For faecal incontinence, endosonography and endoluminal MRI give similar results in detecting sphincter defects; endoluminal MRI has the advantage of detecting external sphincter atrophy. High-resolution MRI, endosonography and <b>defaecography</b> are currently the optimal imaging techniques for anorectal diseas...|$|E
40|$|Report study: <b>Defaecography</b> {{reports from}} 2816 {{patients}} were evaluated. Twenty-three per {{cent of the}} investigations were considered normal, 31 % showed rectal intussusception, 13 % rectal prolapse, 27 % rectocele, and 19 % enterocele. A standardised protocol is suggested to ensure a complete evaluation of <b>defaecography.</b> One hundred and ten reports were unclear and reviewed. The unclear reports usually concerned an unexplained widening of the rectova ginal space, and gave us an incitement to further studies. Technique study: Twelve patients with an unexplained widening of the rectovaginal space at <b>defaecography</b> were investigated using <b>defaecography</b> and peritoneography simul taneously, by us named "defaeco-peritoneography". All investigations were carried out with out complications. Defaeco-peritoneography proved the unexplained widening to be {{an extension of the}} pouch of Douglas, a peritoneocele. Unexplained widening study: Twenty-two patients with unexplained widening of the recto vaginal space noted at <b>defaecography</b> were studied using defaeco-peritoneography. The out line and movements of the peritoneum in the pelvic cavity could be visualised during the dynamic act of defaecation. The unexplained widening of the rectovaginal space was caused completely by a peritoneocele in 14 patients, partially in 6 patients and 2 remained unexplained. However, only 9 out of 22 widenings were peritoneoceles with an enterocele. Just 11 peritoneoceles only contained fluid. Three types of peritoneocele were demonstrated: vaginal, septal, and rectal, with or without enterocele. Combinations of these were also found. Rectal intussusception study: Fifty-seven patients with defaecation disorders were examined using defaeco-peritoneography. Twenty-three patients had rectal intussusception and 7 patients had a rectal prolapse. All these patients had a rectal peritoneocele in the serosal ring pocket of the rectal intussusception or in the rectal prolapse. Twenty-seven patients had neither rectal intussusception nor rectal prolapse and none of these patients had a rectal peritoneocele. Daily life study: Twenty-six female patients showing peritoneocele at start without a contrast-filled rectum at defaeco-peritoneography were investigated, and 13 of them had en teroceles. Spot radiographs before and after filling the rectum with contrast medium were compared. The peritoneocele disappeared completely in 19 of the patients and was reduced in size in the remaining 7 patients, and the enterocele disappeared completely when the rectum was distended. Defaeco-peritoneography should therefore include a radiograph be fore the rectum is filled, as it shows the habitual (daily life) anatomy and can disclose pathol ogy as peritoneocele and enterocele. Transformation study: Forty-six patients with peritoneocele at defaeco-peritoneography were studied at three different stages during rectal evacuation. At start with contrast-filled rectum, 14 patients had a peritoneocele, and 32 were regarded as normal. At maximum straining all patients had a peritoneocele and 20 of these were still present after rectal evacu ation. The peritoneoceles were largest at straining and rectal types were most common. No enterocele was seen at start. At maximum straining 21 patients developed an enterocele...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCoccygeal {{herniation}} after coccygectomy is rare. Little {{is known}} about the management of this complication. We present a case of a 44 year old women with a coccygeal herniation 7 years after coccygectomy. She was treated two times for an infected pilonidal sinus with incision and drainage. After the last incision and drainage she had complaints of a painful swelling in the sacral area and difficulty with evacuation of her stools. A <b>defaecography</b> showed a coccygeal herniation. An additional MRI of the pelvic region showed a defect with a diameter of approximately 38 mm. We performed a hernia repair with a biological mesh (Strattice™ surgical mesh, LifeCell Corporation USA) via a sacral approach. Her recovery was complicated by a small wound dehiscence without clinical signs of infection. The sacral wound healed per secundam. Her complaints had completely disappeared. A <b>defaecography</b> 2 months after surgery showed no residual herniation. To our knowledge, it is the first reported case of a coccygeal hernia repair with a biological Strattice™ surgical mesh...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} of evacuation proctography using a simple barium and air mixture is described. The study {{can be easily}} combined with a barium enema examination. A series of 35 patients with intractable constipation have been studied and compared with 7 controls. Most of the abnormalities seen using more elaborate methods of <b>defaecography</b> were identified. Variants of rectal intussusception were found in 16 patients. Other diagnoses included rectocele, mucosal and full rectal prolapse, accentuation of puborectalis impression and solitary rectal ulcer. The technique should prove useful {{in the management of}} patients with disorders of defaecation...|$|E
40|$|AIM: This study {{compared}} the diagnostic capabilities of dynamic magnetic resonance <b>defaecography</b> (D-MRI) with conventional <b>defaecography</b> (CD, reference standard) {{in patients with}} symptoms of prolapse of the posterior compartment of the pelvic floor. METHOD: Forty-five consecutive patients underwent CD and D-MRI. Outcome measures were {{the presence or absence}} of rectocele, enterocele, intussusception, rectal prolapse and the descent of the anorectal junction on straining, measured in millimetres. Cohen's Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and the positive and negative likelihood ratio of D-MRI were compared with CD. Cohen's Kappa and Pearson's correlation coefficient were calculated and regression analysis was performed to determine inter-observer agreement. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were available for analysis. D-MRI underreported rectocele formation with a difference in prevalence (CD 77. 8 % vs D-MRI 55. 6 %), mean protrusion (26. 4 vs 22. 7 mm, P = 0. 039) and 11 false negative results, giving a low sensitivity of 0. 62 and a NPV of 0. 31. For the diagnosis of enterocele, D-MRI was inferior to CD, with five false negative results, giving a low sensitivity of 0. 17 and high specificity (1. 0) and PPV (1. 0). Nine false positive intussusceptions were seen on D-MRI with only two missed. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of D-MRI for diagnosing rectocele and enterocele is less than that of CD. D-MRI, however, appears superior to CD in identifying intussusception. D-MRI and CD are complementary imaging techniques in the evaluation of patients with symptoms of prolapse of the posterior compartment...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of magnetic resonance <b>defaecography</b> (MRD) in pelvic floor disorders using an open tilting magnet with a 0. 25 T static field and to compare the results obtained from the same patient both in supine and orthostatic positions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2010 to November 2011, 49 symptomatic female subjects (mean age 43. 5 years) were enrolled. All the patients underwent MRD in the supine and orthostatic positions using three-dimensional (3 D) hybrid contrast-enhanced (HYCE) sequences and dynamic gradient echo (GE) T 1 -weighted sequences. All the patients underwent conventional <b>defaecography</b> (CD) to correlate both results. Two radiologists evaluated the examinations; inter and intra-observer concordance was measured. The results obtained in the two positions were compared between them and with CD. RESULTS: The comparison between CD and MRD found statistically {{significant differences in the}} evaluation of anterior and posterior rectocoele during defaecation in both positions and of rectal prolapse under the pubo-coccygeal line (PCL) during evacuation, only in the supine position (versus MRD orthostatic: rectal prolapse p < 0. 0001; anterior rectocoele p < 0. 001; posterior rectocoele p = 0. 008; versus CD: rectal prolapse p < 0. 0001; anterior rectocoele p < 0. 001; posterior rectocoele p = 0. 01). The value of intra-observer intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) ranged from good to excellent; the interobserver ICC from moderate to excellent. CONCLUSION: MRD is feasible with an open low-field tilting magnet, and it is more accurate in the orthostatic position than in the supine position to evaluate pelvic floor disorders...|$|E
40|$|Background—Anismus {{is thought}} to be a cause of chronic {{constipation}} by producing outlet obstruction. The underlying mechanism is paradoxical contraction of the anal sphincter or puborectalis muscle. However, paradoxical sphincter contraction (PSC) also occurs in healthy controls, so anismus may be diagnosed too often because it may be based on a non-specific finding related to untoward conditions during the anorectal examination.  Aims—To investigate the pathophysiological importance of PSC found at anorectal manometry in constipated patients and in patients with stool incontinence.  Methods—Digital rectal examination and anorectal manometry were performed in 102 chronically constipated patients, 102 patients with stool incontinence, and in 18 controls without anorectal disease. In 120 of the 222 subjects <b>defaecography</b> was also performed. Paradoxical sphincter contraction was defined as a sustained increase in sphincter pressure during straining. Anismus was assumed when PSC was present on anorectal manometry and digital rectal examination and the anorectal angle did not widen on <b>defaecography.</b>  Results—Manometric PSC occurred about twice as often in constipated patients as in incontinent patients (41. 2 % versus 25. 5 %, p< 0. 017) and its prevalence was similar in incontinent patients and controls (25. 5 % versus 22. 2 %). Oroanal or rectosigmoid transit times in constipated patients with and without PSC did not differ significantly (total 64. 6 (8. 9) hours versus 54. 2 (8. 1) hours; rectosigmoid 14. 9 (2. 4) hours versus 13. 8 (2. 5) hours).  Conclusions—Paradoxical sphincter contraction is a common finding in healthy controls as well as in patients with chronic constipation and stool incontinence. Hence, PSC is primarily a laboratory artefact and true anismus is rare. ...|$|E
40|$|Constipation and disordered {{defaecation}} are symptoms, not disease entities. Usually {{these symptoms}} are {{not caused by}} organic abnormalities, but by disordered motility of the colon and pelvic floor. Both decreased colonic motility (inertia coli) and increased frequency and amplitude of haustrating colonic contractions {{in the context of}} an irritable bowel syndrome may lead to constipation. A third important functional cause of constipation is by paradoxical straining of the pelvic floor muscles during (attempts to) defaecate: anismus. In the diagnosis of constipation the primary aim usually is the exclusion of organic disorders. A plain abdominal X-ray and measurement of colonic transit with radiopaque particles will provide information about the severity of the constipation. <b>Defaecography</b> is indicated primarily if disordered faecal expulsion exists. Anorectal manometry is relevant when Hirschsprung's disease is suspecte...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} {{disturbed}} anorectal physiology associated with constipation in multiple sclerosis. METHODS [...] Anorectal function in 10 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis and constipation {{has been compared}} with 10 normal persons and 11 patients with idiopathic constipation, without multiple sclerosis. RESULTS [...] All 10 constipated patients with multiple sclerosis had difficulty evacuating barium paste during <b>defaecography.</b> In four of these there was complete failure of puborectalis relaxation when straining to defaecate, and in another four there was incomplete puborectalis relaxation. There {{was no evidence of}} lower motor neuron involvement of pelvic floor muscles in the multiple sclerosis group. CONCLUSIONS [...] Paradoxical puborectalis contraction is common in patients with multiple sclerosis in whom constipation is a symptom. This may be a feature of the disturbed voluntary sphincter control mechanism, analogous to detrusor sphincter dyssnergia in the bladder...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 47 {{patients}} undergoing abdomino-perineal resection of the distal colon and anorectum {{and construction of}} a continent perineal colostomy using electrostimulated gracilis muscle is described. External and implanted pulse generators have both been used. An analysis of complications and oncological data are reported. There was no operative mortality. The incidence of complications, divided into three classes, mild (62 %), moderate (27 %) and severe (11 %), has not significantly altered the functional results, {{with the exception of}} early ischaemia of the colonic stump in two cases. During the first 22 cases, no preoperative oncological staging was performed. In the last 23 patients endorectal ultrasonography and CT scanning were carried out. Functional results were evaluated by electromanometry, electromyostimulation and dynamic <b>defaecography.</b> Clinical data assessed postoperatively showed good function in 65 % of cases, fair in 22. 5 % and poor in 12. 5 %.

40|$|Following the {{untimely}} death of Professor Ahmed Shafik, the authors decided to analyse his published {{work on the}} anatomy and physiology of the anorectal area, reconciling this body of data with current imaging and physiological techniques. All available papers as indexed by PubMed pertaining to the anorectal area were obtained and reviewed. The anatomical data was compared with historical representations and current new imaging modalities. The original ‘triple-loop’ theory of the anatomical disposition of the external anal sphincter has been confirmed by coronal and coronally reconstructed imaging modalities. There is variance between the Shafik and other descriptions of the anatomy of the longitudinal muscle and its importance {{in the definition of}} perianal spaces which are important in the spread of perirectal sepsis and in intersphincteric rectal dissection. Current dynamic <b>defaecography</b> would suggest a more complex levator plate function in squeeze and straining than that originally suggested by Shafik as a primary defaecatory role for the levator muscle. The body of work by Professor Shafik has reorganized our understanding of the external anal sphincter and the function of the levator during defaecation. Future studies should assess anatomical and physiological variances using new technology in health and in specific disease states...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Use {{of dynamic}} {{myoplasty}} {{to create a}} continent stoma has produced promising results, but long-term stoma continence has not been achieved. The aim {{of the study was}} to establish and test a new model. METHODS: Three types of dynamic rectus abdominis sphincteroplasty around a colostomy and two conditioning protocols were tested in ten domestic pigs. Continence was assessed by means of conventional <b>defaecography</b> and neosphincter manometry after 8 and 12 weeks. The neosphincter muscle was studied histologically to assess the transformation of muscle type. RESULTS: Use of a distal rectus muscle sling surrounding the stoma by 270 degrees with a low-frequency conditioning protocol achieved a continent colostomy for more than 12 h on each of 5 consecutive days. The neosphincter had a 40 -mm high-pressure segment with mean pressure of 74 (range 67 - 82) mmHg. The proportion of type I muscle fibres increased from 38 (range 32 - 42) to 74 (range 66 - 78) per cent after 12 weeks of conditioning. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a continent stoma in an animal model with a dynamic rectus neosphincter. Long-term results should be confirmed in a larger series before use in humans can be considered...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAIM: The study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} incontinence {{before and after}} laparoscopic rectopexy in patients suffering from rectal prolapse. METHOD: Eighty-five patients underwent laparoscopic rectopexy to treat rectal prolapse between 2003 and 2009. Symptomatic and functional data were collected prospectively before and after surgery by self-administered questionnaires including the Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCIS) and constipation, gastrointestinal {{quality of life and}} urinary incontinence questionnaires. Incontinence was considered to be present when the CCIS remained at ≥ 5 after surgery. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 36 months after surgery, 83 % of the patients reported good to excellent results. Continence was improved in 58 (68 %), with a significant decrease in the continence score (- 3. 4 ± 5. 8, P = 0. 001). However, 50 (58. 9 %) patients remained incontinent: 47 (55 %) reported urge incontinence and 27 (32 %) had passive leakage. Incontinence for liquid stool, incontinence for solid stool and the need for protection was seen in 43 (51 %), 35 (41 %) and 43 (51 %) patients. Manometry, <b>defaecography</b> and ultrasonography were not associated with any improvement. In contrast, the patients' average age (60. 2 ± 15. 8 vs 46. 9 ± 15. 5 years; P =  0. 003), symptom duration before surgery (58. 1 ± 70. 1 vs 29. 5 ± 33. 3 months; P = 0. 011), preoperative urinary incontinence score (10. 7 ± 10. 8 vs 4. 2 ± 5. 7; P = 0. 0131) and faecal incontinence score (12. 9 ± 4. 9 vs 7. 1 ± 6; P < 0. 0001) were significantly higher in patients suffering from postoperative incontinence. CONCLUSION: Despite some continence improvement in two-thirds of patients who underwent surgery for rectal prolapse, the level of improvement remained low in {{more than half of the}} patients...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies was to {{increase}} the knowledge about rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception, with special reference to bowel function and treatment with the Ripstein rectopexy. Results after the Ripstein rectopexy in 69 patients with rectal prolapse and in 43 patients with internal metal intussusception were evaluated. There was no operative mortality and early postoperative morbidity was 33 %. The majority of complications were minor. Severe early complications were one faecal impaction and one ureteral stricture. Recurrencies and late complications were studied in 63 of the patients with rectal prolapse. Median length follow-up was 7. 0 (range, 1. 7 - 16. 5) years. There was one recurrence. Forty-two of the patients with internal rectal intussusception were followed-up during median 5. 4 (range, 1. 1 - 16. 5) years. Severe complications were two rectovaginal fistulae and one faecaloma in the sigmoid colon with perforation and lethal peritonitis. Pre- and postoperative functional evaluation {{was carried out in}} 76 patients. Anal continence improved postoperatively and the number of bowel movements per week decreased. Emptying difficulties did not change significantly in patients operated for rectal prolapse but increased in those operated for internal rectal intussusception. Results of repeated <b>defaecography</b> studies in patients with internal rectal intussusception were analyzed. Among 38 patients with a second investigation after mean 5. 6 (range, 1. 1 - 19. 5) years one had developed a rectal prolapse. The remaining patients were further followed-up: one developed a rectal prolapse, 7 underwent surgery for internal metal intussusception, 29 did not develop a rectal prolapse during a mean follow-up of 5. 8 (range, LO- 14. 6) years. Anorectal manometry was carried out preoperatively and 7 days and 6 months postoperatively in 42 patients. Patients operated on for rectal prolapse had increased anal maximum resting pressure 6 months postoperatively but not after 7 days. Anal maximum squeeze pressure did not change significantly. No significant changes in anal maximum resting or squeeze pressures were seen in the patients with internal rectal intussusception. Anal continence improved. Preoperative electrophysiological assessment (conventional needle EMG, FD-assessment and pudendal nerve latency) was compared with pre- and postoperative functional evaluation regarding anal continence in 43 patients. Electrophysiological examination could not predict the outcome of Ripstein rectopexy with respect to anal continence. Whole gut transit studies were undertaken pre- and postoperatively in 30 patients. Retention of markers increased after the Ripstein rectopexy. The number of bowel movements per week decreased but constipation was mainly experienced as emptying difficulties. There was a correlation between preoperative retention of markers and postoperative emptying difficulties. Conclusion: Rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception can be treated by the Ripstein rectopexy with low mortality and low frequency of serious complication. Tle functional putcome. is difficult to predict. Anal continence is often improved. Emptying difficulties often increase in patients with internal rectal intussusception. The risk of developing a rectal prolapse is small in patients with internal rectal intussusception...|$|E
