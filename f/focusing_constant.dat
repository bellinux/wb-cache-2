40|$|We {{calculate}} coherent {{frequencies and}} stability properties of anisotropic or ''non-equipartitioned'' beams with different <b>focusing</b> <b>constants</b> and emittances {{in the two}} transverse directions. Based on the self-consistent Vlasov-Poisson equations the dispersion relations of transverse multipole oscillations with quadrupolar, sextupolar and octupolar symmetry are solved numerically. The eigenfrequencies give the coherent space charge tune shift for linear or nonlinear resonances in circular accelerators. We find that for sufficiently large energy anisotropy some of the eigenmodes become unstable in the space-charge-dominated regime. The properties of these anisotropy instabilities are used to show that ''non-equipartitioned'' beams can be tolerated in high-current linear accelerators. It is only in beams with strongly space-charge-depressed betatron tunes where harmful instabilities leading to emittance exchange should be expected. (orig.)

40|$|Several {{observations}} of atmospheric turbulence statistics {{have been reported}} which do not obey Kolmogorov's power spectral density model. These observations have prompted the study of optical propagation through turbulence described by non-classical power spectra. This paper presents an analysis of optical propagation through turbulence which causes fluctuations in the index of refraction. The index fluctuations are assumed to have spatial power spectra that obey arbitrary power laws. The spherical and plane wave structure functions are derived using Mellin transform techniques. The wave structure function is used to compute the Strehl ratio of a <b>focused,</b> <b>constant</b> amplitude beam propagating in non-Kolmogorov turbulence as the power law for the spectrum of the index of refraction fluctuations is varied from- 3 to- 4. The relative contributions of the log amplitude and phase structure functions to the wave structure function are computed. If inner and outer scale effects are neglected, no [...] ...|$|R
40|$|To achieve goal-orientated behaviour, {{selective}} {{attention is}} often needed {{to filter out}} irrelevant information. Past {{research has shown that}} working memory (WM) plays a critical role in selective attention, with high WM load leading to more distractor interference than low WM load. However, because WM load is usually manipulated by requiring participants to hold in memory either one or several digits that were presented simultaneously while performing a selective attention task, the extent of attentional focus was not controlled. The present study examined the effect of WM load on distractor inhibition while keeping attentional <b>focus</b> <b>constant</b> by presenting one digit (low load condition) or six digits (high load condition) sequentially. The participants in the high-load condition demonstrated greater distractor interference than the participants in the low-load condition, suggesting that WM load influences distractor inhibition even when the extent of attentional focus was controlled. This result provides converging evidence to Lavie's (1995, 2005) load theory of attention and cognitive control...|$|R

40|$|The two-photon photopolymerization of resins by focused {{laser light}} in {{principle}} enables the fabrication of structures with details below the diffraction limit. However, the method {{can be highly}} susceptible to aberrations, which hinders the fabrication of structures that are larger than, e. g., the working distance of the microscope objective. Here, two-photon polymerization is extended to the fabrication of macroscopic structures by making use of medium numerical-aperture microscope objectives.

Moreover, the <b>constant</b> <b>focusing</b> conditions enable us to quantify spherical aberrations by experimental mapping of the optical point-spread function, which manifests itself in the shape of singe photo-polymerized voxels.
