In addition to a low loss switch {{the present invention comprises}} essentially a transformer with a plurality of windings with at least one current sensing winding, one <b>driver</b> <b>winding</b> which provides driving signal for the synchronous rectifier, and windings for energy recovery. This synchronous rectifier is self-driven but operates independent of converter input voltage hence allow wide input voltage range. It also avoids effect of leakage inductance in converter transformer windings. With energy recovery means it can operate with high efficiency.

40|$|A report {{describes}} {{the use of}} advanced electromagnetic probes to measure the dimensions, the spatial distribution of electrical conductivity, and related other properties of friction stir welds (FSWs) between parts made of the same or different aluminum alloy(s). The probes are of the type described in in another Tech Brief. To recapitulate: A probe of this type is essentially an eddy-current probe that includes a primary (<b>driver)</b> <b>winding</b> that meanders and multiple secondary (sensing) windings that meander along the primary winding. Electrical conductivity is commonly used {{as a measure of}} heat treatment and tempering of aluminum alloys, but prior to the development of these probes, the inadequate sensitivity and limited accuracy of electrical-conductivity probes precluded such use on FSWs between different aluminum alloys, and the resolution of those probes was inadequate for measurement of FSW dimensions with positions and metallurgical properties. In contrast, the present probes afford adequate accuracy and spatial resolution for the purposes of measuring the dimensions of FSW welds and correlating spatially varying electrical conductivities with metallurgical properties, including surface defects...|$|E
40|$|A {{device was}} {{designed}} and constructed to simulate cross-ventilation through a building due to natural <b>wind.</b> The <b>wind</b> <b>driver</b> device was designed for use with a one tenth scale model of an open floor plan office building in Luton, England. The air flow patterns produced by the <b>wind</b> <b>driver</b> were observed, and the uniformity of the velocity of the flows into the model windows was measured for the three settings of the <b>wind</b> <b>driver</b> fans. The temperatures and velocities of flows on {{the interior of the}} building and at the exhaust windows were also examined. The <b>wind</b> <b>driver</b> device was capable of producing uniform velocities across the face of the model to within 20 to 27 %, depending on the fan setting. The consistency of certain features of the velocity distributions produced by the <b>wind</b> <b>driver</b> operating at different speeds suggest that improvements made to the design of the <b>wind</b> <b>driver</b> could lower this variation to about 15 %. The velocities measured on the interior of the model seem consistent with interior velocities in the Luton building, although further experimentation is needed to confirm this trend. Cross-ventilation was effective in reducing interior model temperatures by up to 10 ⁰C from the natural convection case. by Erin L. Hult. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of coastal upwelling to fisheries, coastal ecosystem services, and economic benefits to coastal communities, understanding and projecting the impacts of future climate change on upwelling areas is of significant interest. Coastal upwelling is driven by alongshore winds, which have been hypothesized to increase in eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS). However, upper ocean warming is also anticipated to enhance water column stratification, which could limit the efficacy (nutrient flux) of coastal upwelling. Although extensive {{work has been done}} on how winds and temperature are changing and projected to change, significant low-frequency climate variability and the poor representation of upwelling in earth system models has prevented a thorough assessment of climate change impacts on these systems. To circumvent these issues, here we synthesize results from a combination of regional and global observations, reanalysis products, and model projections that investigate how the regional <b>drivers</b> of upwelling-favorable <b>winds</b> (land and ocean pressure systems) and stratification (ocean temperature), among other <b>drivers</b> of <b>wind</b> variability, have changed and how they are expected to change in the future.

40|$|Using {{data from}} a number of summer surveys of the Chukchi Sea over the past decade, we {{investigate}} aspects in which the benthic fauna, sediment structure, and zooplankton there are related to circulation patterns and shelf hydrographic conditions. A flow speed map is constructed that reveals the major pathways on the shelf. Regions of enhanced flow speed are dictated by lateral constrictions—in particular, Bering Strait and Barrow and Herald Canyons—and by sloping topography near coastlines. For the most part, benthic epifaunal and macrofaunal suspension feeders are found in high flow regimes, while deposit feeders are located in regions of weaker flow. The major exceptions are in Bering Strait, where benthic sampling was underrepresented, and in Herald Canyon where the pattern is inexplicably reversed. Sediment grain size is also largely consistent with variations in flow speed on the shelf. Data from three biophysical surveys of the Chukchi Sea, carried out as part of the Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic program, reveal close relationships between the water masses and the zooplankton communities on the shelf. Variations in atmospheric forcing, particularly wind, during the three sampling periods caused significant changes in the lateral and vertical distributions of the summer and winter water masses. These water mass changes, in turn, were reflected in the amounts and species of zooplankton observed throughout the shelf in each survey.

40|$|The {{location}} of {{the outer edge of}} the plasmasphere (the plasmapause) as a function of geomagnetic storm time is identified and investigated statistically in regard to the solar <b>wind</b> <b>driver.</b> Imager for Magnetopause‐to‐Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) data are used to create an automated method that locates and extracts the plasmapause. The plasmapause extraction technique searches a set range of possible plasmasphere densities for a maximum gradient. The magnetic local time (MLT) ‐dependent plasmapause results are compared to manual extraction results. The plasmapause results from 39 intense storms are examined along a normalized epoch storm timeline to determine the average plasmapause L shell as a function of MLT and storm time. The average extracted plasmapause L shell follows the expected storm time plasmapause behavior. The results show that during the main phase, the plasmapause moves earthward and a plasmaspheric drainage plume forms near dusk and across the dayside during strong convection. During the recovery phase, the plume rejoins the corotationally driven plasma while the average plasmapause location moves farther from the Earth. The results are also examined in terms of the solar <b>wind</b> <b>driver.</b> We find evidence that shows that the different categories of solar <b>wind</b> <b>drivers</b> result in different plasmaspheric configurations. During magnetic cloud‐driven events the plasmaspheric drainage plume appears at the start of the main phase. During sheath‐driven events the plume forms later but typically extends further in MLT.

40|$|Many {{authors have}} studied the outer {{radiation}} belts response to different solar <b>wind</b> <b>drivers,</b> with the majority investigating electron flux variations. Using partial moments (electron number density, temperature and energy density) from GOES- 13 during 2011 allows {{for changes in the}} number of electrons and the temperature of the electrons to be distinguished, which is not possible with the outputs of individual instrument channels. This study aims to produce a coarse predictive capability of the partial moments from GOES- 13 by determining which solar wind conditions exhibit the strongest relationship with electron variations at GEO. Investigating how the electron distribution at GEO is affected by fluctuations in this primary driver, both instantaneous and time delayed, allows for this to be achieved. These predictive functions are then tested against data from 2012. It is found that using solely the solar wind velocity as a driver results in predicted values that accurately follow the general trend of the observed moments. This study is intended to make further progress in quantifying the relationship between the solar wind and electron number density, temperature and energy density at GEO.

I first examine the role of government renewable energy incentives and access to the electricity grid on investment in wind power plants across counties from 1998 - 2007. The results indicate that the federal production tax credit, state-level sales tax credit and production incentives {{play an important role in}} promoting wind power. In addition, higher wind power penetration levels can be achieved by bringing more parts of the electricity transmission grid under independent system operator regulation. I conclude that state and federal government policies play a significant role in wind power development both by providing financial support and by improving physical and procedural access to the electricity grid. Second, I examine the effect of renewable power plant location on electricity transmission congestion levels and system-wide emissions levels in a theoretical model and a simulation study. A new renewable plant takes the effect of congestion on its own output into account, but ignores the effect of its marginal contribution to congestion on output from existing plants, which results in curtailment of renewable power. Though pricing congestion removes the externality and reduces curtailment, I find that in the absence of a price on emissions, pricing congestion may in some cases actually increase system-wide emissions.
