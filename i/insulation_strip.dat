50|$|Insulation {{paper or}} {{insulation}} foil is usually {{attached to the}} slots of the stator package before the insulated end plates are installed. The insulation material, e.g. Nomex or Mylar or Kapton, is taken from the endless strip. It is pre-hemmed, separated analogously {{to the length of}} the stator and inserted into the latter. It {{is important to note that}} the <b>insulation</b> <b>strip</b> must always be slightly longer than the stator package in order to guarantee complete insulation of the winding space towards the wire in consideration of the length tolerances of the stator package and the insulation paper. When this construction is applied, it is beneficial, that the insulation does not take up much space in the slot area. At high dielectric strength, an insulation thickness of merely 0.1 mm may be reached. Even at a material strength of only a few hundredths of a millimeter, Kapton foil may be integrated into the package. This in turn has a positive effect on the fill factor since more room is available for winding.|$|E

50|$|The {{scheme was}} {{designed}} to export power from coal-fired power stations on Sardinia to the Italian mainland, and thus was only required to operate in one direction. Although the converter stations are inherently capable of operating in either direction of power transmission, advantage was taken of the unidirectional power-flow requirement to economise {{on the design of}} the sea electrodes. The sea return current enters the sea at the Sardinian end (Anode) and leaves the sea at the mainland end (Cathode). The mainland electrode consists of bare copper (a section of insulated copper cable with the <b>insulation</b> <b>stripped</b> off), which would corrode rapidly if used as an anode but suffers no degradation when used as a cathode. However, the anode electrode on Sardinia required a more sophisticated design using platinum-coated titanium pipe, subdivided into 30 sub-electrodes, in order to prevent corrosion.|$|R

All tested homes were either pre or post the introduction of energy efficient retrofit measures such as cavity wall insulation, loft <b>insulation,</b> draught <b>stripping</b> and energy efficient heating system. Results show that the average air infiltration rate of the post dwellings is only marginally lower by 4 % compared to the pre dwellings. Component infiltration rate based on model prediction indicates the combination of cavity wall insulation, loft <b>insulation</b> and draught <b>stripping</b> potentially reducing infiltration rate by 24 %.

40|$|In {{this paper}} some options of how {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) can assist {{to expand the}} capabilities of conventional forming and joining technologies are discussed. Three different areas where EMF {{has the potential for}} a significant expansion of capabilities of traditional technologies are reviewed: 1) restrike operation to fill sharp corners of automotive panels; 2) low energy method of springback calibration; 3) joining of closed frames with an openable coil. Each of these applications was demonstrated in laboratory conditions and the description of the tooling is provided in the paper. Suggested design of a flat concentrator collecting induced electric currents from a flat coil was demonstrated for a corner filling operation and a springback calibration. An efficient technique of fabricating the flat coil from a flat plate by using water jetting technology enables a cost effective coil design, which can be reinforced by a system of non-conductive bars. The insulation of the coil is produced from the flat sheet of insulation material. Suggested design allows the coil to be repaired if a shortcut or fracture of <b>insulation</b> <b>strips</b> happens. A technology of low-energy calibration of stamped parts provides an option of working with a wider variety of materials including aluminum alloys, mild steels, and advanced high-strength steels. This technology is demonstrated for calibration of U-channels...|$|R
2500|$|Because the {{accident}} {{occurred in the}} United States, it was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Though the fuselage was nearly destroyed by {{the intensity of the}} fire, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were still in good condition and produced vital data for the NTSB investigation. On the CVR, NTSB investigators heard eight sounds of electrical arcing—likely inaudible to the crew—beginning at 18:48 CDT. Three minutes later, at 18:51, the popping sounds that Cameron and Ouimet later identified as the left toilet circuit breaker tripping are audible on the CVR. [...] Cameron attempted to reset the circuits twice in the next 60 seconds, but the CVR records the breakers immediately popping again after each reset attempt. Cameron attempted once more to reset the breakers at 18:59. The CVR records arcing sounds followed by the popping sound of the breakers continuing to trip again after each reset over the next 60 seconds. At 19:02, the CVR records flight attendant Judi Davidson entering the cockpit to deliver the first report of a possible fire in the lavatory. Though a number of wires in the lavatory section were later found with <b>insulation</b> <b>stripped</b> away, NTSB investigators were unable to determine whether this insulation damage was the cause of the fire or was caused by the fire.|$|R

While first-class seats were kept for NASA passengers, its main cabin and <b>insulation</b> were <b>stripped,</b> mounting struts were added, and the fuselage was strengthened. Vertical stabilizers {{were added to}} the tail to aid stability when the Orbiter was being carried. The avionics and engines were also upgraded, and an escape tunnel system similar to that used on Boeing's first 747 test flights was added. The flight crew escape tunnel system was later removed following the completion of the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) due to concerns over possible engine ingestion of an escaping crew member.|$|R

40|$|Summary The paper {{describes}} a design tool for assessing condensation risk in dwellings {{and the effect}} of remedial measures thereon. The BREDEM energy model is augmented by a moisture model to determine mean internal relative humidity (MIRH). This measure of condensation risk is calculated for two zones in a dwelling from mean internal temperatures, moisture generation and ventilation rates. Primary input data relate to occupancy (fuel expenditure and moisture production) and dwelling characteristics (thermal and ventilation). MIRH results are presented as a function of space heating input in example dwellings with remedial measures applied (<b>insulation,</b> draught <b>stripping</b> and extract fans). The constraints imposed by household income and the implications for condensation risk are discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|Tinsel wire is {{commonly}} connected to equipment with crimped terminal lugs that pierce the insulation {{to make contact}} with the metal ribbons, rather than <b>stripping</b> <b>insulation.</b> Separated from the core, the individual ribbons are relatively fragile, and the core can be damaged by high temperatures.

40|$|The article {{covers the}} problem of {{applicability}} of finite-element and engineering methods {{to the development of}} a model of interaction between pipeline structures and the environment in the complex conditions with a view to the simulation and projection of exogenous geological processes, trustworthy assessment of their impacts on the pipeline, and the testing of varied calculation methodologies. Pipelining in the areas that have a severe continental climate and permafrost soils is accompanied by cryogenic and exogenous processes and developments. It may also involve the development of karst and/or thermokarst. The adverse effect of the natural environment is intensified by the anthropogenic impact produced onto the natural state of the area, causing destruction of forests and other vegetation, changing the ratio of soils in the course of the site planning, changing the conditions that impact the surface and underground waters, and causing the thawing of the bedding in the course of the energy carrier pumping, etc. The aforementioned consequences are not covered by effective regulatory documents. The latter constitute general and incomplete recommendations in this respect. The appropriate mathematical description of physical processes in complex heterogeneous environments is a separate task to be addressed. The failure to consider the above consequences has repeatedly caused both minor damages (denudation of the pipeline, <b>insulation</b> <b>stripping)</b> and substantial accidents; the rectification of their consequences was utterly expensive. Pipelining produces a thermal impact on the environment; it may alter the mechanical properties of soils and de-frost the clay. The stress of the pipeline is one of the principal factors that determines its strength and safety. The pipeline stress exposure caused by loads and impacts (self-weight, internal pressure, etc.) may be calculated in advance, and the accuracy of these calculations is sufficient for practical implementation. Stress and strain caused by other factors (groundwater supports, anchors, fixing elements) may only be identified on location. The impact of other factors (temperature, permafrost thawing, karst phenomena and landslides, etc.) may be identified as approximate values.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of AS-Interface installations utilize the AS-Interface flat cable, defined {{as part of the}} AS-Interface specifications. A relatively small number of industries (e.g. valve control in process automation) use a round cable, mostly because it is easier to pull through conduit. While the shape of the cable does not matter (any other cable can be used) the electrical characteristics of the selected cable matters greatly. To prevent problems due to improper cable, most professionals suggest the AS-Interface flat cable. This cable is designed to make use of a cable piercing technology. When an AS-Interface module is installed on the network, piercing needles penetrate the cable jacket and displace the internal copper strands without cutting them. This allows AS-Interface modules to be installed anywhere on the network without cutting and preparing (i.e. removing cable jacket, <b>stripping</b> <b>insulation</b> and possibly applying a ferule) the cable first. The result is a faster installation without the chance of inadvertent shorts between the leads.|$|R

The experimental programme as a whole includes accelerated laboratory ageing, long-term outdoor exposure, comparison and analysis of results.

Of the additives included in the mortar, two were prepared with acrylic resin and two with vinyl resin. Additionally, {{for each type of}} specimen, one included a typical finishing coat and another one an acrylic painting. For each series of ETICS specimens, a one set will be aged and the other remains as the (cladding system reference set).

40|$|The use of {{exterior}} insulation on {{a building}} is an accepted and effective means {{to increase the}} overall thermal resistance of the assembly that also has other advantages of improved water management and often increased air tightness of building assemblies.

40|$|Coaxial {{electric}} heaters {{have been}} conceived {{for use in}} highly sensitive instruments {{in which there are}} requirements for compact heaters but stray magnetic fields associated with heater electric currents would adversely affect operation. Such instruments include atomic clocks and magnetometers that utilize heated atomic-sample cells, wherein stray magnetic fields at picotesla levels could introduce systematic errors into instrument readings. A coaxial electric heater is essentially an axisymmetric coaxial cable, the outer conductor of which is deliberately made highly electrically resistive so that it can serve as a heating element. As in the cases of other axisymmetric coaxial cables, the equal magnitude electric currents flowing in opposite directions along the inner and outer conductors give rise to zero net magnetic field outside the outer conductor. Hence, a coaxial electric heater can be placed near an atomic-sample cell or other sensitive device. A coaxial electric heater can be fabricated from an insulated copper wire, the copper core of which serves as the inner conductor. For example, in one approach, the insulated wire is dipped in a colloidal graphite emulsion, then the emulsion-coated wire is dried to form a thin, uniform, highly electrically resistive film that serves as the outer conductor. Then the film is coated with a protective layer of high-temperature epoxy except at the end to be electrically connected to the power supply. Next, the <b>insulation</b> is <b>stripped</b> from the wire at that end. Finally, electrical leads from the heater power supply are attached to the exposed portions of the wire and the resistive film. The resistance of the graphite film can be tailored via its thickness. Alternatively, the film can be made from an electrically conductive paint, other than a colloidal graphite emulsion, chosen to impart the desired resistance. Yet another alternative is to tailor the resistance of a graphite film by exploiting the fact that its resistance can be changed permanently within about 10 percent by heating it to a temperature above 300 C. A coaxial heater, with electrical leads attached, that has been bent into an almost full circle for edge heating of a circular window is shown. (In the specific application, there is a requirement for a heated cell window, through which an optical beam enters the cell. ...|$|R
