A dramatic <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> of up to 4 ppmv is observed 3 h after the maximum obscuration of the Sun.

40|$|The primary {{effect of}} a {{volcanic}} eruption is to alter {{the composition of the}} stratosphere by the direct injection of ash and gases. On average, there is a stratospherically significant volcanic eruption about every 5. 5 years. The principal effect of such an eruption is the enhancement of stratospheric sulphuric acid aerosol through the oxidation and condensation of the oxidation product H 2 SO 4. Following the formation of the enhanced aerosol layer, observations have shown a reduction in the amount of direct radiation reaching the ground and a concomitant increase in diffuse radiation. This is associated with an increase in stratospheric temperature and a decrease in global mean surface temperature (although the spatial pattern of temperature changes is complex). In addition, the enhanced aerosol layer increases heterogeneous processing, and this reduces the levels of active nitrogen in the lower stratosphere. This in turn gives rise to either a decrease or an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> levels, depending on the level of chlorine loading...|$|E

Stratospheric NO(y) fields calculated using the GSFC 2 D interactive chemistry-radiation-dynamics model show significant sensitivity to the model CO 2. Modeled upper stratospheric NO(y) decreases by about 15 % in response to CO 2 doubling, mainly due to the temperature decrease calculated to result from increased cooling. The abundance of atomic nitrogen, N, increases because the rate of the strongly temperature dependent reaction N + O 2 yields NO + O decreases at lower temperatures. Increased N leads to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the loss of NO(y) which is controlled by the reaction N + NO yields N 2 + O. The NO(y) reduction is shown to be sensitive to the NO photolysis rate.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of large ionospheric disturbances associated with sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) has challenged the current understanding of mechanisms coupling the stratosphere and ionosphere. Non-linear interaction of planetary waves and tides has been invoked {{as a primary}} mechanism for such coupling. Here we show that planetary waves may play a more complex role than previously thought. Planetary wave forcing induces a global circulation {{that leads to the}} build-up of ozone density in the tropics at 30 – 50 km altitude, the primary region responsible for the generation of the migrating semidiurnal tide. The increase in the ozone density reaches 25 % and lasts for ∼ 35 days following the SSW, long {{after the collapse of the}} planetary waves. Ozone enhancements are not only associated with SSW but are also observed after other amplifications in planetary waves. In addition, the longitudinal distribution of the ozone becomes strongly asymmetric, potentially leading to the generation of non-migrating semidiurnal tides. We report a persistent increase in the variability of ionospheric total electron content that coincides with the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and we suggest that the ozone fluctuations affect the ionosphere through the modified tidal forcing.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} stratospheric ozone depletion {{since the late}} 1970 s due to ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). With {{the implementation of the}} Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments, stratospheric ozone is expected to recover towards its pre- 1980 level in the coming decades. In this study, we examine the implications of stratospheric ozone recovery for the tropospheric chemistry and ozone air quality with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). With a full recovery of the stratospheric ozone, the projected increases in ozone column range from 1 % over the low latitudes to more than 10 % over the polar regions. The sensitivity factor of troposphere ozone photolysis rate, defined as the percentage changes in surface ozone photolysis rate for 1 % <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> column, shows significant seasonal variation but is always negative with absolute value larger than one. The expected stratospheric ozone recovery is found to affect the tropospheric ozone destruction rates much more than the ozone production rates. Significant decreases in surface ozone photolysis rates due to stratospheric ozone recovery are simulated. The global average tropospheric OH decreases by 1. 7 %, and the global average lifetime of tropospheric ozone increases by 1. 5 %. The perturbations to tropospheric ozone and surface ozone show large seasonal and spatial variations. General increases in surface ozone are calculated for each season, with increases by up to 0. 8 ppbv in the remote areas. Increases in ozone lifetime by up to 13 % are found in the troposphere. The increased lifetimes of tropospheric ozone in response to stratospheric ozone recovery enhance the intercontinental transport of ozone and global pollution, in particular for the summertime.

A factorial field experiment encompassing two levels of UV-B supplementation (simulating ambient and a 30 % <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone)</b> and two levels of disturbance (disturbed and undisturbed) was established at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory, Derbyshire, UK, and maintained for 7 years prior to sampling. Enhanced UV-B increased microbial utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, polymers and aromatic compounds present in Biolog® GN plates when inoculated with soils taken from disturbed plots, but did not affect carbon utilization of soil microbial communities associated with undisturbed plots (UV-B×Disturbance interaction, P< 0. 05 for each substrate type). UV-B treatment did not affect numbers of bacteria or fungi. Direct microscopic counts showed fewer bacteria in soil originating from disturbed plots than from undisturbed plots (Disturbance, P< 0. 001), although {{a greater number of}} culturable bacteria and fungi were isolated from disturbed than from undisturbed soils (Disturbance, P< 0. 001). No UV-B- or disturbance-related differences in protein, starch or urea hydrolysis were exhibited by bacterial isolates. UV-B treatment did not affect total plant biomass within undisturbed plots or the biomass of individual groupings of grasses, forbs and mosses. Per cent root length colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was not affected by enhanced UV-B radiation in the undisturbed plots. Neither AMF nor plant biomass was measured in disturbed plots. The key findings of this study show that UV-B-mediated alterations in carbon utilization occurred in soil microbial communities subjected to disturbance, but such changes were not observed in communities sampled from undisturbed grassland. Differences in the catabolic potential of microbial communities from disturbed grassland subjected to enhanced UV-B are probably related to plant-mediated changes in resource availability or quality...|$|E

In the second half of the 21 st century, ozone is projected to continue increasing, level off, or even decrease depending on the latitude.

However, one of the known side effects of stratospheric injections of sulfate aerosols is a decrease <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Here we show results from two general circulation models and two coupled chemistry climate models that have simulated stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering as part of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). Changes in photolysis rates and upwelling of ozone-poor air in the tropics reduce <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> suppression of the NOx cycle increases <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> and an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> available surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry modulates reductions in ozone. On average, the models show a factor 20 - 40 increase of the sulfate aerosol surface area density (SAD) at 50 hPa in the tropics with respect to unperturbed background conditions and a factor 3 - 10 increase at mid-high latitudes. The net effect for a tropical injection rate of 5 Tg SO 2 per year is a decrease in globally averaged ozone by 1. 1 - 2. 1 DU in the years 2040 - 2050 for three models which include heterogeneous chemistry on the sulfate aerosol surfaces. GISS-E 2 -R, a fully coupled general circulation model, performed simulations with no heterogeneous chemistry and a smaller aerosol size; it showed a decrease in ozone by 9. 7 DU.

40|$|The {{prospective}} future {{adoption of}} hydrogen {{to power the}} road transportation sector could greatly improve tropospheric air quality but also raises the question whether the adoption would have adverse effects on stratospheric ozone. The possibility of these undesirable impacts must be fully evaluated to guide future policy decisions. Here we evaluate the possible impact of a future (2050) H 2 -based road transportation sector on stratospheric composition and chemistry, especially on stratospheric ozone, with the MOZART chemical transport model. Since future growth is highly uncertain we evaluate the impact for two world evolution scenarios, one based on a high emitting scenario (IPCC A 1 FI) {{and the other on}} a low emitting scenario (IPCC B 1), as well as two technological options: H 2 fuel cells and H 2 internal combustion engines. We assume a H 2 leakage rate of 2. 5 % and a complete market penetration of H 2 vehicles in 2050. The model simulations show that a H 2 -based road transportation sector would reduce stratospheric ozone concentrations as a result of perturbed catalytic ozone destruction cycles. The magnitude of the impact depends on which growth scenario the world evolves and which H 2 technology option is applied. For the same world evolution scenario, stratospheric ozone decreases more in the H 2 fuel cell scenarios than in the H 2 internal combustion engine scenarios because of the NO x emissions in the latter case. If the same technological option is applied, the impact is larger in the A 1 FI emission scenario. The largest impact, a 0. 54 % decrease in annual average global mean stratospheric column ozone, is found with a H 2 fuel cell type road transportation sector in the A 1 FI scenario; whereas the smallest impact, a 0. 04 % <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> is found with applications of H 2 internal combustion engine vehicles in the B 1 scenario.

In the stratosphere, layer ozone amounts correlate highly with proxies for the stratospheric circulation (100 hPa eddy heat flux averaged over 4570 °N), polar ozone depletion (the calculated volume of polar stratospheric clouds combined with the effective equivalent stratospheric chlorine) and tropopause height.

The experiments are designed to investigate the mechanisms by which GHGs and ODSs affect the evolution of ozone, including changes in the Brewer-Dobson circulation of the stratosphere and cooling of the upper stratosphere by CO 2 . Separating the effects of GHGs and ODSs on ozone, we find the decrease <b>in</b> upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> from ODSs up to the year 2000 is approximately 30 % larger than the actual decrease in ozone due to the offsetting effects of cooling by increased CO 2 . Over the 21 st century, as ODSs decrease, continued cooling from CO 2 is projected to {{account for more than}} 50 % of the projected <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Changes below 20 hPa show a redistribution of ozone from tropical to extra-tropical latitudes with an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the Brewer-Dobson circulation, while globally averaged the amount of ozone below 20 hPa decreases over the 21 st century. Further analysis by linear regression shows that changes associated with GHGs do not appreciably alter the recovery of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> from the effects of ODSs; over much of the stratosphere ozone recovery follows the decline of halogen concentrations within statistical uncertainty, though the lower polar stratosphere of the Southern Hemisphere is an exception with ozone concentrations recovering more slowly than indicated by the halogen concentrations.

The solar forcing is represented by changes in incident irradiance, with solar fluxes adjusted in the model's spectral intervals, according to the difference between observed solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Results so far, based upon a model run of 10 years, show that enhanced UV results <b>in</b> <b>increases</b> of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> associated with temperature increases and seasonally varying changes in the zonal wind structure. The simulated changes are in reasonable agreement with observed changes in the stratosphere between solar minimum and solar maximum conditions. Changes in the troposphere include an increase of the tropical easterlies in all months and a banded structure of zonal wind changes at higher latitudes. The latter have also been found in similar model experiments elswhere. Simulated temperature changes in the upper troposphere are mainly positive, but near the surface also large areas of cooling are found. This brings us to the general conclusion that regionally climate response to enhanced UV might be significant, but on a global scale, e. g. on global mean temperature, it is most probably small. It is very likely that dynamical processes are responsible for the response of the troposphere, but the precise nature of these remains as yet unclear...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuous}} tropospheric and <b>stratospheric</b> vertically resolved <b>ozone</b> time series, from 1850 to 2099, {{has been}} generated {{to be used}} as forcing in global climate models that do not include interactive chemistry. A multiple linear regression analysis of SAGE I+II satellite observations and polar ozonesonde measurements is used for the stratospheric zonal mean dataset during the well-observed period from 1979 to 2009. In addition to terms describing the mean annual cycle, the regression includes terms representing equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) and the 11 -yr solar cycle variability. The EESC regression fit coefficients, together with pre- 1979 EESC values, are used to extrapolate the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> time series backward to 1850. While a similar procedure could be used to extrapolate into the future, coupled chemistry climate model (CCM) simulations indicate that future <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> abundances are likely to be significantly affected by climate change, and capturing such effects through a regression model approach is not feasible. Therefore, the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> dataset is extended into the future (merged in 2009) with multi-model mean projections from 13 CCMs that performed a simulation until 2099 under the SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) A 1 B greenhouse gas scenario and the A 1 adjusted halogen scenario {{in the second round of}} the Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal- 2) Activity. The <b>stratospheric</b> zonal mean <b>ozone</b> time series is merged with a three-dimensional tropospheric data set extracted from simulations of the past by two CCMs (CAM 3. 5 and GISS-PUCCINI) and of the future by one CCM (CAM 3. 5). The future tropospheric ozone time series continues the historical CAM 3. 5 simulation until 2099 following the four different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Generally good agreement is found between the historical segment of the ozone database and satellite observations, although it should be noted that total column ozone is overestimated in the southern polar latitudes during spring and tropospheric column ozone is slightly underestimated. Vertical profiles of tropospheric ozone are broadly consistent with ozonesondes and in-situ measurements, with some deviations in regions of biomass burning. The tropospheric ozone radiative forcing (RF) from the 1850 s to the 2000 s is 0. 23 W m − 2, lower than previous results. The lower value is mainly due to (i) a smaller <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> biomass burning emissions; (ii) a larger influence of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion on upper tropospheric ozone at high southern latitudes; and possibly (iii) a larger influence of clouds (which act to reduce the net forcing) compared to previous radiative forcing calculations. Over the same period, decreases <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> mainly at high latitudes, produce a RF of − 0. 08 W m − 2, which is more negative than the central Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) value of − 0. 05 W m − 2, but which is within the stated range of − 0. 15 to + 0. 05 W m − 2. The more negative value is explained by the fact that the regression model simulates significant ozone depletion prior to 1979, in line with the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> EESC and as confirmed by CCMs, while the AR 4 assumed no change <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> RF prior to 1979. A negative RF of similar magnitude persists into the future, although its location shifts from high latitudes to the tropics. This shift is due to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> polar <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> but decreases <b>in</b> tropical lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> related to a strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation, particularly through the latter half of the 21 st century. Differences in trends in tropospheric ozone among the four RCPs are mainly driven by different methane concentrations, resulting in a range of tropospheric ozone RFs between 0. 4 and 0. 1 W m − 2 by 2100.

A large scale statistical analysis of cloud effects is given comparing ISCCP and TOMS based remote sensing methods with cloud effects derived from ground measurements. Both satellite derived methods correlate well (r 0. 93) with the ground based analysis. Correction for non-zero albedo, under clear sky conditions, adds maximal 8 % to the yearly effective UV-budget. Temporal and spatial differences in aerosol optical thickness and tropospheric ozone content, result in a decrease in effective UV of 3 % for every 0. 1 <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> aerosol optical thickness, and in a decrease in effective UV of 4 % for every 10 DU <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> tropospheric <b>ozone.</b> <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> trends of - 1 to - 4 % per decade observed over Europe correspond to a 0. 5 to 4 % <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> skin cancer weighted effective UV.

Particular attention {{has been focused on}} the Antarctic, and more recently the Arctic (Hofmann and Deschler, 1991), where the autocatalytic destruction of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> (‘the ozone hole’) leads to enhanced fluxes of UVB radiation (Hofmann, 1996; Smith and Baker, 1989) and a decrease in primary productivity (Smith et al., 1992). Recent data describing global decreases <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> levels show a highly variable trend in the loss of ozone over equatorial regions in the last decade. In addition, ozone depletion has resulted <b>in</b> an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> UVB radiation reaching temperate latitudes (30 – 50 °N) of the Northern Hemisphere (Blumthaler and Ambach, 1990; Kerr, 1992; Kerr and McElroy, 1993), with a negative trend of ozone depletion of as much as- 6. 6 to- 7. 6 % and as little as- 2. 6 to- 3. 0 % per decade (Stolarski et al., 1992; Madronich, 1992; Madronich, 1994). These temperate latitudes cover areas that include many productive coastal estuarine, intertidal and shallow subtidal systems such as those found in the Gulf of Maine, and current trends <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> loss suggest that irradiances of UVB radiation could <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the future.

40|$|International audienceWe {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> on the interannual variability and trends in tropospheric ozone from 30 - 90 ° N between 1990 and 2009 using ozone measurements and a global chemical transport model (the Community Atmospheric Model with chemistry) with input meteorology from the National Center for Environmental Prediction. The model simulation uses constant interannual emissions. Both the model and measurements indicate that on large spatial scales <b>stratospheric</b> interannual <b>ozone</b> variability drives significant tropospheric variability and contributes to long-term tropospheric ozone trends. To diagnose the measured variability we utilized measurements from ozonesondes and the Measurements of OZone and water vapour by in-service Airbus airCraft programme (MOZAIC) north of 30 ° N. We identify a regionally robust 150 hPa ozone signal from measurements over Canadian, Northern European and Central European regions and at 500 hPa over Canadian, Northern European and Eastern US regions. Averaged over these regions, the 150 hPa interannual ozone variability explains 69 % of the interannual variability at 500 hPa. The simulated stratospheric signal explains 81 % of the simulated variability over these same regions. Simulated and measured ozone are significantly correlated over these regions and the simulation suggests that the ozone record over these regions {{is representative of the}} overall hemispheric 500 hPa ozone record from 30 - 90 ° N. The measured 500 hPa trends averaged over these three regions between 1990 and 2000 and 1990 and 2009 are 0. 73 (± 0. 51) ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 27 (± 0. 19) ppbv yr− 1, respectively. The simulated trends in 1990 - 2000 and 1990 - 2009 are 0. 29 ± 0. 10 ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 13 ± 0. 05 ppbv yr− 1, respectively; however, these trends are substantially larger when the model is sampled for missing data exactly as the measurements are. Simulated <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> accounts for 79 % of the simulated 500 hPa trend between 1990 and 2000 and 100 % of the simulated trend between 1990 and 2009. Due to the importance of local meteorology and emissions at the surface it is difficult to isolate the stratospheric component of measured surface ozone variability. Overall when averaged between 30 - 90 ° N simulated surface interannual ozone trends are 0. 18 ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 07 ppbv yr− 1 between 1990 and 1999, and between 1990 and 2009, respectively. We have identified a number of surface sites where the measured interannual ozone variability is correlated with the 150 hPa ozone signal. Most notably these sites include the high mountain sites over Europe and Macehead, Ireland. Over Macehead the measured 150 hPa ozone signal explains 40 % of the interannual variability of the unfiltered measured ozone record. The simulated and measured ozone are highly correlated over Macehead. The Macehead measured and simulated unfiltered ozone trends between 1990 and 2000 are 0. 28 (± 0. 33) and 0. 17 (± 0. 13) ppbv yr− 1 respectively; between 1990 and 2009 the measured and simulated trends are 0. 18 (± 0. 11) and 0. 08 (± 0. 06) ppbv yr− 1, respectively. <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> the simulated <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> component accounts for 53 % and 75 % of the overall modeled trend for the two periods at Macehead...|$|R
40|$|Observations show a {{long term}} {{decrease}} <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> {{on a global scale}} during the last two decades. Over the southern polar region the reductions are large and clearly connected to man made emissions of CFCs. There are mounting evidences that also Northern Hemispheric ozone reductions observed since 1980 are connected to man made emissions of CFCs. Observations give global average reductions of the order 4 0 ver the last 10 – 15 years. The reductions have been particularly large at mid and high northern latitudes after 1991 and occur in the lower stratosphere, during winter and spring. Model studies give strong indications that a font size="- 4 "stantial fraction of the reduction is due to enhanced chemical loss through chemical reactions involving chlorine compounds (ClO and Cl). The enhanced ozone loss which has occurred since 1991 coincides with enhanced particle formation in the stratosphere from the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, and enhanced formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds. Observations also show that solar cycle variation affects <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> on a short time scale. Ozone has increased during the last two decades in the northern free troposphere, although there seem to have been a levelling off <b>in</b> the <b>increase</b> since the mid 80 s. Enhanced emissions of NOx, CO and hydrocarbons are the main cause for the ozone growth. Tropospheric ozone is also affected by the enhanced UV fluxes caused by reductions <b>in</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Models give reduced ozone and methane levels in the free troposphere due to increased UV fluxes.
