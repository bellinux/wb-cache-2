In November 2008, Moon released his report in which he recommended that Section 13 should be repealed so that online hate speech is a purely criminal matter. Moon wrote that [...] "The use of censorship by the government should be confined to a narrow category of extreme expression -- that which threatens, advocates or justifies violence against the members of an identifiable group." [...] Moon argued that [...] "it's not practical to deal with what one might generously describe as <b>group</b> <b>defamation</b> or stereotyping through censorship. It's just not a viable option. There's too much of it, and it's so pervasive within our public discourse that any kind of censorship is just overwhelming." ...|$|E

The author, drawing upon his experience as cocounsel to AIDA, submits that the law should provide a remedy for racial and ethnic <b>group</b> <b>defamation.</b> It is paradoxical for the law to only allow a remedy for individual defamation. The current civil damage lawsuit for defamation is inapplicable because courts consistently deny damages for <b>group</b> <b>defamation</b> by refusing to recognize the individual harm caused by <b>group</b> <b>defamation.</b> Likewise, criminal defamation statutes are now found in fewer than half the states and rarely used by prosecutors. This Article proposes enacting a declaratory judgment statute {{at the state level}} to remedy group racial and ethnic defamation.

Memorial's {{chairman}} Oleg Orlov said that Ramzan Kadyrov threatened Natalya and that Russian president Medvedev was content with Kadyrov being a murderer. Orlov {{said in a}} statement: [...] "I know, I am sure who is guilty of Natalya Estemirova's murder, we all know him. His name is Ramzan Kadyrov." [...] According to Orlov, shortly before the murder Kadyrov made an open threat to her by saying: [...] "Yes, my hands are up to the elbows in blood. And I am not ashamed of that. I killed and will kill bad people". Kadyrov denied any involvement and promised to investigate the killing personally. He condemned the killers, saying they [...] "must be punished as the cruelest of criminals". It was later reported that in response to Orlov's accusation, Kadyrov would be suing the rights <b>group</b> for <b>defamation,</b> and would target Orlov personally in the complaint. Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, Chechen human rights ombudsman, called Orlov's accusation [...] "groundless and ludicrous".|$|R
5000|$|Following {{its release}} in India, the film faced {{criticism}} from {{various members of}} the public alleging that the film fuels Western stereotypes about poverty in India and that it peddles [...] "poverty porn". [...] Tapeshwar Vishwakarma, a representative of a slum-dwellers' welfare <b>group,</b> filed a <b>defamation</b> lawsuit against the film's music composer A.R. Rahman and actor Anil Kapoor, alleging that grim depiction of slum dwellers violated their human rights. Vishwakarma's filing argued that the very title of the movie is derogatory, and he was particularly displeased that Indians associated with the film did not object to the use of word [...] "slumdog." [...] Nicholas Almeida, a social activist working in Mumbai, organized a protest against the film {{on the grounds that it}} intentionally exploited the poor for the purposes of profit, also arguing that the title Slumdog Millionaire is offensive, demeaning, and insulting to their dignity. The protesters were Mumbai slum dwellers who objected to the film's title and held up signs reading: [...] "I am not a dog." [...] Slum dwellers in Patna, the capital of the Indian state of Bihar, also protested against the movie, with the campaign reaching a climax on 26 January 2009, when [...] "protesters tore down posters and ransacked a movie theatre" [...] screening the film. The following day, the police in Bihar tightened security [...] "outside theatres in the state to thwart any further attacks." [...] Activists stated that slum dwellers would continue to protest until the film's director deleted the word [...] "dog" [...] from the title.|$|R

40|$|Community groups {{need to be}} {{protected}} from law suits designed to silence them, says Brian Walters THE Bannockburn Yellow Gum Action Group was a small community group formed to protect a woodland near Geelong. Barwon Water, a public authority responsible for the water supply and sewerage of the greater Geelong region, wanted to bulldoze the woodland for a sewerage farm. The chairman of Barwon Water was Frank De Stefano, a prominent former mayor of Geelong. As part of its campaign, the Bannockburn group produced a bumper sticker ‘Barwon Water - Frankly Foul’. It was a punning reference to Frank de Stefano, and the authority’s poor record on sewerage outfall. Mr De Stefano could have laughed off the joke. He could have replied to his critics in the press. He could have published his own bumper sticker. Instead, he sued for defamation. The writs were delivered on Christmas Eve. Although they named Mr De Stefano as the Plaintiff, the action was funded, at public expense, by Barwon Water. In the writ, Mr De Stefano pleaded that the joke carried the imputations that: • Frank De Stefano was a foul person. • Frank De Stefano was a person smeared with the sewage that the authority of which he was Chairman treated. • Frank De Stefano was a person who smelt like sewage. • Frank De Stefano was a person unfit to hold the position of Chairman of Barwon Water. It was no joke for the defendants. They could defend the case, at great cost, and run the risk of losing their houses if they lost - and losing {{a great deal of money}} in costs even if they won. They were opposed by a person who was using public money to run his case, and faced none of the same risks. The defendants were not familiar with defamation legislation, and fatigued from running a demanding campaign and trying to keep up professional and personal commitments. Defending the case was likely to take a large investment of time, week after week, for years. The case became enmeshed in complexity and cost. In the end, the group took legal advice, apologised and paid $ 10, 000. It was an enormous setback to the community campaign - few wanted to risk involvement if they were likely to be sued. The trees were felled. Those who paid out $ 10, 000 for this action will not see their money - or the trees - again. As a result of the writ - which never came to court - the fate of the Bannockburn woodland was decided without the community being able to make a full contribution to the issues. Cases like this are a growing phenomenon throughout Australia. When a developer sues a community <b>group</b> for <b>defamation,</b> the developer can claim the expense as a tax deduction - the community group has no such advantage. And the developer runs the case with a prospect of an award of damages at the end. The community group has no such prospect. The laws of defamation confuse even lawyers - it’s no wonder community groups are terrified when they receive legal threats. The community is not some vague ether in the air - it is the communication between its members. When we stifle public discourse, we stifle community. At the moment our defamation laws are out of step with the laws of other developed countries, and provide a major inhibition to free speech and hence to our democracy. Words matter. They can hurt and harm, as well as bring wisdom and healing. The same words that inspire one hearer will outrage another. To silence speech is to stifle the good with the bad. Australia has no comprehensive protection of community members when speaking about matters of public interest, or about the performance of holders of public office. Commentary on these things ought to be the function of citizens. In several north American jurisdictions, SLAPP suits - an acronym for Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation - have grown to the point where legislatures have enacted laws to protect public participation. These laws enable courts to punish plaintiffs who bring actions to silence members of the community, by making those plaintiffs pay damages themselves. With the growing phenomenon in Australia of SLAPP suits designed to have a chill effect on public involvement, it is high time similar laws were enacted here. Brian Walters is a Melbourne barrister.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the role of {{criminal}} law in dealing with defamatory expressions about religion or belief. Defamation of religion and belief is a form of indirect defamation ‘via identification’ which, as the discussion about the Dutch <b>group</b> <b>defamation</b> law shows, stretches up the notion of ‘group defamation’ — a crime which requires that (groups of) persons are insulted because they belong to a religious group. This contribution investigates whether European states can legitimately criminalise (certain forms of) defamation of religion and belief, in light of the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations framework (particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and legal theoretical considerations. The article shows how problematic it is for the criminal law — in light of the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of religion, as well as the ultima ratio principle — to combat such speech...|$|E
40|$|If {{protecting}} {{freedom of}} speech is one of mankind 2 ̆ 7 s noblest pursuits, then restricting {{it is the most}} difficult. Yet limit we must: even the purest civil libertarian will concede that false shouts of fire cannot be countenanced nor broadcasts of wartime troop movements; even those who object to obscenity laws recognize the need for enabling redress of libel; and even those who would protect the right to be insulting do not defend inflammatory words spit out nose-to-nose. Now a spate of 2 ̆ 2 speech codes 2 ̆ 2 on college campuses has once again brought the first amendment to the fore, part of a simmering debate {{on the extent to which}} we can constitutionally limit the language of hatred. The rule should be a simple one: expression of all ideas is protected, except for those in narrowly defined categories such as state secrets, obscenity, fighting words, and defamation. The last exception should include a civil action for group libel. While the rule may be simple, however, it is not simplistic [...] nor any more difficult to apply than the analysis required in the fact-finding process of a trial by judge or jury. This paper will briefly examine the various approaches to free speech both in America and elsewhere, suggest how they may be read in harmony with the rule stated above, and apply such reasoning to specific cases of <b>group</b> <b>defamation...</b>|$|E
40|$|On September 20 th 2007, the National Communication Commission (NCC) of Taiwan {{held its}} second hearing, {{to discuss the}} second draft of a new {{communication}} act. According to article 148 of the draft, it prohibits the contents and advertisements provided by broadcast corporations which abet conflicts between ethics groups. Taking article 148 {{as a point of}} departure and a targeted subject matter, the Article attempts to focus on the constitutionality of such regulation and possible justification for viable regulation on racial hate speech or discriminatory speech by taking a socio-legal perspective in reviewing and comparing legislative intents and court opinions from human right courts established under the European Union (hereafter E. U.) and its member states and the United States. Racial hate or discriminatory speech have persisted with contentious controversies since the early 20 th century, though, it have temporary lulled. The Internet has resurrected its proliferation and hibernation [...] And, the underlining difficulty still stands within material conflict between two fundamental rights: freedom of speech vs. racial equality. In these ancient and historical issues, foreign democracies in Europe and Canada have already promulgated regulations like “anti-hate law”, “holocaust denial law” and other relevant laws as to censor hate speech. Taiwan as a civil society has grown with diversification throughout the decades, but its culture is crippled in assembling a solid perspective in regards to racial or ethnic equality. Racial issues continue to be exploited in political propaganda by mass media, which substantially lacerate ethnic harmony in Taiwan. The ban on broadcastings that contain racial hate or discrimination speech proposed in Article 148 of Taiwan's new communication act significantly indicates that such hateful speech places an immediate harm to Taiwanese society. 	By examining precedence, regulations and historical accounts involving racial hate or discriminatory speech, the Article observed that the European courts primarily emphasize a supreme protection on infringements of human dignity. Germany's “Holocaust Denial Laws” in particular, exemplify general inclination of the German courts' decisions to strike down expressive denial on the Holocaust. On the other hand, the U. S. courts' favorable disposition on free speech holds its historical backgrounds and legislative foundation; however, the value of racial equality shall not be oppressed or undermined. It is quite apparent that the American and European apply distinct approaches in term of speech regulations which are embedded with each nation's historical significance when scrutinizing the clash between free speech and racial equality. In the views of these representative democracies, the Article advocate that speech censorship of racial or discriminatory speech shall be consider for policy-making as to promote a non-discriminatory attitude shared amongst different ethnic groups in Taiwan. 本研究以民國九十七年國家通訊委員會所擬之通訊傳播管理法草案中第八章第 148 條增例頻道事業所提供的節目或廣告嚴禁「煽動族群仇恨或性別歧視」為出發點，欲透過法社會學之觀點探討歐盟人權法院及其他歐系法院(本研究以德國法院為主軸) 對於種族仇恨性言論的管制與立法，並就我國對此種言論之管制提供立法方向。 種族仇恨性言論之問題在二十世紀初便已開始討論，但隨著歷史事件、學說發展的演變，至今卻也未有定論。追根究柢而論，其理論上的難題在於平衡自由與平等兩個價值的衝突。歐美國家早就陸續訂定「反仇恨法」、「劫難否認處罰法」等類似法律，以監督仇恨性的言論。台灣社會雖多元化的發展，但亦仍欠缺「族群平等」文化。長久以來，族群議題經常被利用在政治性的媒體炒作，而使族群和諧被撕裂。通訊傳播管理法草案中對於族群仇恨言論的禁止，指出了此種言論對於台灣社會現階段所造成的危機。 觀察歐盟人權法院及其他歐系法院對於種族仇恨性言論管制之相關判決及立法目的，本研究發現歐盟人權法院及歐盟國家之判決結果一致傾向保障人性尊嚴及種族平等的態度。本文認為這樣的立法精神源於大多歐系國家經歷二次世界大戰時納粹大屠殺的歷史背景，進而於其立法基礎中對於人性尊嚴產生高度保護。歐盟國家 (本文以德國為首要之研究國家) 對於反種族仇恨法之法令可謂十分嚴峻。以德國法院執行劫難否認處罰法為例，相較於憲法上的言論自由，德國法院認為保障人民之人格不被侵犯或歧視為首要。明顯地，歐系國家對於種族仇恨性之言論有其特殊之理史背景與意義。本研究主張：對於禁煽動族群仇恨或性別歧視宜採用概括性之規定。對於台灣本土有關族群仇恨或是針對外籍新娘之歧視，該於國內法規中納入反仇恨言論之規範。Detailed Table of Contents Chapter 1 Introduction	 1 1. 1 Research Background	 2 1. 2 Research Obejctives and Purposes	 3 1. 3 Research Scope and Methods	 5 1. 4 Research Framework	 5 1. 5 Literature Review and Terms	 5 A.
