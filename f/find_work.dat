5|$|After graduating Coffin {{was unable}} to <b>find</b> <b>work</b> with {{established}} architectural firms, due to widespread prejudice against a woman working in a male-dominated field. She set up her own practice in New York City in 1905, starting out by designing suburban gardens on Long Island. Her increasing fame led to larger commissions from wealthy and powerful East Coast families. By the 1920s {{she was one of}} the most sought-after landscape architects in the eastern United States. Coffin's clientele included some of the wealthiest and most famous families in the country, including the Fricks, the Vanderbilts, the Huttons, and the du Ponts.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Higginbotham {{initially}} sought employment {{with law}} firms in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, however, {{he was unable}} to <b>find</b> <b>work</b> at any of the major firms {{as a result of his}} race. He began his career as a law clerk for Judge Curtis Bok of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. In 1953 he was hired by Philadelphia District Attorney Richardson Dilworth as an assistant district attorney. Prior to Dilworth's arrival, no black lawyer had ever argued on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the Courts of Common Pleas.

5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of the region, Sale's economy during the early-19th century was weak, a state of affairs which persisted until the arrival of the railway in the middle of the century. Despite the {{dominance}} of agriculture, there was a growing service industry; Sale and Ashton upon Mersey experienced a growth in numbers employed in retail and domestic services in the first half of the 19th century. By 1901, less than 20% of Sale residents were employed in agriculture. Employment was available in workhouses for those who could not <b>find</b> <b>work</b> elsewhere. Sale was part of the Altrincham Union, which ran the nearest work house in Altrincham.|$|E

5|$|Barrymore {{began to}} contact his family's {{theatrical}} connections to <b>find</b> <b>work</b> and approached Charles Frohman, {{who had been}} the producer of Captain Jinks and had also been an employer of Barrymore's mother Georgie a decade earlier. Frohman thought that Barrymore had comedic potential but needed more experience before making a Broadway debut. Barrymore joined the company of McKee Rankin, Sidney Drew's father-in-law, on the Chicago leg of their tour, at the W. S. Cleveland Theatre in October 1903. He first played the minor role of Lt. Max von Wendlowski in Magda, and in November when the troupe produced Leah the Forsaken, he took the small part of Max, a village idiot with one spoken line.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{struggled}} to <b>find</b> <b>work</b> {{in the era}} of the Great Depression. He considered moving abroad to join the Colonial Police in the British Overseas Territories and briefly entertained training as a sailor in the Merchant Navy.

By 1937, tiring of life as an administrative clerk, Braham turned to the British armed forces for a more fulfilling career.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not <b>find</b> <b>work</b> in any other studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Erich Hartmann {{was born}} on 19 April 1922 in Weissach, Württemberg, to Doctor Alfred Erich Hartmann and his wife, Elisabeth Wilhelmine Machtholf. The {{economic}} depression that followed World War I in Germany prompted Doctor Hartmann to <b>find</b> <b>work</b> in Changsha, China, and Erich spent his early childhood there. The family was forced to return to Germany in 1928, when the Chinese Civil War broke out. During World War II, Hartmann's younger brother, Alfred, also joined the Luftwaffe, serving as a gunner on a Junkers Ju 87 in North Africa. He was captured by the British and spent four years as a prisoner of war.|$|E

5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population. The church was {{attractive}} to women because it offered professional opportunities when {{it was difficult for}} women to <b>find</b> <b>work</b> outside the home. As Christian Scientists they could become practitioners after just 12 lessons. Of the 14 practitioners listed in the first edition of the Christian Science Journal, 12 were women.|$|E

Most residents' places of work are in surrounding towns, with their location in the parish largely dictating {{where to look for}} work. The 2005 survey identified that residents in the south {{of the parish}} (Falcon Fields and Ravenswing/Pinelands) travel towards Tadley and Basingstoke whereas those further north in the parish tend to <b>find</b> <b>work</b> in Reading, Newbury and London.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, in 1902, Scott, {{a native}} commissioner, brought to Clarke's {{attention}} that many work-seekers were suffering great privation yet {{were unable to}} <b>find</b> <b>work</b> while some businesses were short of labour. Clarke took up the cause: 'This indicates the necessity of the organisation of an Association for bringing those wanting labour and those seeking employment into contact and prevent, what I have myself seen, gangs of destitute natives wandering about the country.' In 1903, a Rhodesian Native Labour Bureau was proposed.|$|E
