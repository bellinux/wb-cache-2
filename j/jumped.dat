5|$|Auburn University {{graduate}} and two-time Olympian Leevan Sands, the cousin of Shamar Sands, {{was the sole}} Bahamian participant in the men's triple jump event. During the qualification round on 17 August, Sands {{was placed in the}} second heat against competitors that included Li Yanxi of China, Onochie Achike of Great Britain, and Hector Fuentes of Cuba. Sands ranked second in his heat of twenty athletes, jumping a distance of 17.25meters. Li, the heat leader, beat Sands by 0.05meters, while Achike del behind Sands by 0.07meters. Overall, Sands ranked fifth out of the thirty-nine participating athletes. He progressed to the final round on 21 August. During that round, Sands <b>jumped</b> a distance of 17.59meters, medaling bronze behind silver medalist Phillips Idowu of Great Britain (who <b>jumped</b> 17.62meters) and gold medalist Nelson Évora of Portugal (who <b>jumped</b> 17.67meters).|$|E

5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen, slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most enemies, whom serve to deter Crash's progress. Enemies with deadly topsides cannot be <b>jumped</b> on, while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be <b>jumped</b> on or undergo a body slam. Enemies with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash slides into them.|$|E

40|$|Large {{stock price}} {{movements}} are modeled as <b>jumps</b> in the stochastic processes of stock prices. In the current literature, the <b>jump</b> intensity is typically specified in models {{as a function}} of the current diffusive volatility and past <b>jump</b> intensities, while the <b>jump</b> size is assumed to be independent of the <b>jump</b> intensity. We use a nonparametric <b>jump</b> detection test to identify <b>jumps</b> in several stock indexes and examine the determinants of the <b>jump</b> intensity and the <b>jump</b> size. We find little evidence that the <b>jump</b> intensity depends on the current diffusive volatility. Instead, the <b>jump</b> intensity and the <b>jump</b> size depend on the current stock price level relative to its historical average, beside past <b>jump</b> intensities. The results in this paper provide new perspectives for modeling <b>jumps</b> in the theory of options pricing and in the applications of risk management. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, Shueisha {{got into}} the {{business}} of making manga magazines, the first being Omoshiro Book. In 1951, Shueisha created a female version of that anthology entitled Shōjo Book. Shōjo Book led to the publication of the highly successful Shōjo manga magazine: Ribon. Omoshiro Book went out of print and Shueisha decided to make another male version of their successful Shōjo Book to even it out and made the magazine Shōnen Book. In the middle of Shōnen Books publication, Shōnen <b>Jump</b> began its run (at the time was a Semiweekly magazine and had no [...] "Weekly"). Shōnen Book ended when Shōnen <b>Jump</b> became a Weekly magazine correctly changing its name to Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump.</b> In 1969 a special issue called Bessatsu Shōnen <b>Jump</b> took Shōnen Books place. In addition to the success of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump,</b> Shueisha created a Seinen version of the magazine in 1979, called Young <b>Jump</b> (now Weekly Young <b>Jump).</b> Bessatsu Shōnen <b>Jump,</b> later got renamed Monthly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> and became a magazine of its own. The seasonal issues of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> are now called Akamaru <b>Jump.</b> In 1985, Shueisha started the publication of two business related manga magazines; a salaryman <b>Jump</b> magazine called Business <b>Jump</b> and an office lady manga magazine called Office You, also in 1988 started the publication of Super <b>Jump.</b> Many other Seinen related <b>Jump</b> magazines, started as spin-off issues of the Weekly Young <b>Jump</b> magazine. In 1993, Shueisha announced and released the video game/manga magazine V <b>Jump</b> alongside the <b>Jump</b> light novel line <b>Jump</b> j-Books. In 2003 Shogakukans Viz Media released an English version of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> called Shonen <b>Jump.</b> Monthly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> discontinued in 2007 and was replaced with the <b>Jump</b> SQ. magazine, four series from the magazine were moved. In addition to the <b>Jump</b> SQ. anthology, a spin-off issue was created, called <b>Jump</b> SQ.II (Second). Saikyō <b>Jump</b> was started on December 3, 2010, with close ties to Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> and V <b>Jump.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{utilize the}} {{realized}} <b>jump</b> components {{to explore a}} new <b>jump</b> (including nonsystematic <b>jump</b> and systematic <b>jump)</b> risk factor model. After estimating daily realized <b>jumps</b> from high-frequency transaction data of the Chinese A-share stocks, we calculate monthly <b>jump</b> size, monthly <b>jump</b> standard deviation, and monthly <b>jump</b> arrival rate and then use those monthly <b>jump</b> factors to explain {{the return of the}} following month. Our empirical results show that the <b>jump</b> tail risk can explain the equity return. For the large capital-size stocks, large cap stock portfolios, and index, one-month lagged <b>jump</b> risk factor significantly explains the asset return variation. Our results remain the same even when we add the size and value factors in the robustness tests...|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} is the stag <b>jump,</b> {{in which the}} forward leg is bent in front while the back leg kicks out as in the regular split <b>jump.</b> Both the Russian split and stag <b>jump</b> can be done from the same <b>jump</b> entries as the regular split <b>jumps.</b> Bending both legs in a stag <b>jump</b> is sometimes called a double stag <b>jump.</b>|$|R
50|$|Free <b>jumping</b> {{is often}} used to {{determine}} a young horse's <b>jumping</b> potential before it can be ridden over <b>jumps</b> or to see the natural <b>jump</b> without a rider. In both cases a good free <b>jump</b> will increase the value of a horse. <b>Jumping</b> horses is a popular event in competitive and recreational riding, and in many case an owner will put a horse up for sale with a video of free <b>jumping.</b> This shows the horse’s movement, temperament and <b>jumping</b> potential, whether or not the horse was used for <b>jumping.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Jumps</b> may be {{performed}} with either clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation. The {{vast majority of}} skaters rotate all their <b>jumps</b> and spins in the same direction; counter-clockwise <b>jumping</b> is more common than clockwise. All <b>jumps</b> are landed on a back outside edge (except stylized variations on some <b>jumps</b> like the half loop or one-foot Axel). The type and amount of steps before a <b>jump</b> do not affect the <b>jump's</b> definition, but certain <b>jumps</b> have common and recognizable set-ups that help the skater do the element correctly and that also help spectators in identifying the <b>jumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Free <b>jumping</b> or loose <b>jumping</b> is the {{practice}} of <b>jumping</b> a horse without a rider. It is often conducted in a chute and is used most often to evaluate the <b>jumping</b> ability of horses too young to <b>jump</b> under saddle. The correlations between free <b>jumping</b> and eventual success in show <b>jumping</b> competition {{have been the subject}} of several studies. Free <b>jumping</b> is used as a diagnostic tool by most warmblood breeding societies to evaluate <b>jumping</b> prowess in breeding stock. This practice is used to build a horse's confidence over <b>jumps</b> without a rider's interference, to evaluate a horses <b>jumping</b> ability, or to showcase a horse that is for sale. This training method is used in a variety of ways, both professionally and recreationally. Free <b>jumping</b> is also done competitively, primarily with younger horses that are not old enough for a rider or just beginning their <b>jumping</b> career.|$|R
25|$|A jumper may {{be either}} {{stationary}} or moving when initiating a <b>jump.</b> In a <b>jump</b> from stationary (i.e., a standing <b>jump),</b> {{all of the}} work required to accelerate the body through launch is done in a single movement. In a moving <b>jump</b> or running <b>jump,</b> the jumper introduces additional vertical velocity at launch while conserving as much horizontal momentum as possible. Unlike stationary <b>jumps,</b> in which the jumper's kinetic energy at launch is solely due to the <b>jump</b> movement, moving <b>jumps</b> have a higher energy that results from {{the inclusion of the}} horizontal velocity preceding the <b>jump.</b> Consequently, jumpers are able to <b>jump</b> greater distances when starting from a run.|$|R
