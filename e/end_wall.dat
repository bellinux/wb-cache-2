5|$|Dunkeswell Abbey, a Cistercian monastery and {{offshoot}} of Forde Abbey, {{was founded in}} 1201 by William Briwere. The abbey was closed in 1539 and granted to Lord Russell. It was mostly demolished promptly, though a section remained in domestic use until the 19th century. In 1842, a parish church was built {{on a part of}} the site. Some surviving fragments of monastery include the partial <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> of the cellarers range and parts of a gatehouse. Some carved fragments survive within the Victorian era church.|$|E
5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> of the clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little {{difference to the}} reflection of the rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E

25|$|Steps towards {{constructing}} a new church at Proserpine began in 1956 when architects Barnes and Oribin of Cairns were engaged. Designed by Oribin, the proposed church was highly unusual, with a parabolic roofed nave, glazed <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> {{with a central}} concrete cross, flat side roofs and separate brick tower.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{element of the}} church's design is the parabolic arched roof over the nave and sanctuary. Clad in metal roof sheeting, the parabolic form is created by a reinforced concrete arch at the front, regularly spaced laminated timber arches throughout the interior and a brick <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> at the rear. A raised strip of roofing along the apex is clad in opaque sheeting.|$|E
25|$|In the second, later, wheelpit, pictured here, {{the wheel}} itself {{was on the}} south side of the pit (on the right in this photograph). The short length of wall on the right is the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> of the wheelpit. The {{mechanism}} operating the flatrod system was on the north side, aligned with the short section of wall visible further away on the left: this probably formed part of the first support for the flatrods, which are believed to have travelled underground until they reached a V-shaped gulley, just visible towards the top of the photograph.|$|E
50|$|Tracheids <b>end</b> with <b>walls,</b> which {{impose a}} great deal of {{resistance}} on flow; vessel members have perforated <b>end</b> <b>walls,</b> and are arranged in series to operate as if they were one continuous vessel. The function of <b>end</b> <b>walls,</b> which were the default state in the Devonian, was probably to avoid embolisms. An embolism is where an air bubble is created in a tracheid. This may happen as a result of freezing, or by gases dissolving out of solution. Once an embolism is formed, it usually cannot be removed (but see later); the affected cell cannot pull water up, and is rendered useless.|$|R

40|$|Left {{ventricular}} mass, fractional shortening, and <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress (mechanical indices) {{measured by}} echocardiography {{and the response}} of fractional shortening and <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress to the infusion of isoproterenol (0. 02 microgram/kg/min for 5 min) (a non-mechanical index) were studied in 57 patients (mean (SD) age 49 (8)) with essential hypertension. Nineteen patients had subnormal <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress (group 1), 25 patients had normal <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress and slightly increased left ventricular mass (group 2 A), and 13 patients had normal <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress and considerably increased left ventricular mass (group 2 B). Plasma noradrenaline concentration was higher in group 2 B than in the other groups. When <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress was greater than 12 g/cm 2 this variable showed a significant inverse linear relation with fractional shortening before isoproterenol infusion. The inotropic response to isoproterenol was measured as the increase of fractional shortening corrected for the decrease of <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress (delta fractional shortening/ [...] delta <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress). The mean (SD) change in delta fractional shortening/ [...] delta <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress was significantly larger in group 1 (1. 40 (0. 60) cm 2 /g) than in group 2 A (0. 85 (0. 39) cm 2 /g), and was significantly larger in group 2 A than in group 2 B (0. 56 (0. 15) cm 2 /g). In patients with hypertensive hypertrophy with subnormal <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress (inappropriate hypertrophy) the beta adrenergic response is increased; in hypertensive hypertrophy with normal <b>end</b> systolic <b>wall</b> stress (appropriate hypertrophy), however, it is normal, or becomes reduced as plasma noradrenaline increases...|$|R

25|$|The three altars at the chancel-end of {{the church}} fit the Baroque style both in their {{decoration}} {{and in terms of}} the tile facings on the walls. The tiles covering the vaulted areas around each of the altars and the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> of the nave above the chancel date to 1719 and reflect the popular national blue-on-white style of the period. One panel in the chancel represents St. James on a caravel fighting the Moors in the naval Battle of Lepanto (1571) in which Dom John of Austria defeated the Turks. The panel reflects the military and religious power of Christianity over Islam, an implicit message for the descendants of the Muslims still resident in the area and who still maintained certain Muslim traditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{market area}} was {{submerged}} and had approximately 150 stalls {{with the majority}} selling food. It was split by a large road which connected to the inner ring road which was built from 1967 till 1971. There was direct access to New Street station and the market area could be easily accessed from Moor Street station. A multi-storey car park was also located within the complex with 500 spaces for cars. Access to roads by foot could be achieved through a network of subways. As part of the development, a nine-storey office block designed by James A. Roberts was built. This {{was attached to the}} multi-storey car park. The floors were of reinforced concrete, 12inches in thickness. A bold illuminated sign by D.R.U. was located on the <b>end</b> <b>wall,</b> facing the city centre.|$|E

40|$|Monodisperse and bidisperse {{granular}} flows are {{studied in}} rotating tumblers using DEM. In spherical tumblers, flowing particles’ trajectories {{do not follow}} straight lines but are curved. At the same time particles near the surface drift toward the pole, inducing two global recirculation cells. Combined with radial segregation, drift and curvature compete to impose the axial segregation pattern: Small-Large-Small (SLS) or Large-Small-Large (LSL). Fill level, rotation speed and wall roughness influence drift and curvature, and modify the resulting segregation pattern. In cylindrical tumblers, equivalent recirculation cells occur next to the <b>end</b> <b>walls.</b> A second pair of recirculation cells with a weak drift {{in the opposite direction}} appears at the center for long enough tumblers. Unlike the sphere case, curvature and drift in the primary cells combine to push large particles toward the <b>end</b> <b>walls,</b> explaining why large particle bands appear at the <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> for axial segregation in cylinder...|$|R
25|$|The {{church is}} {{rectangular}} in plan with an entrance foyer in the north-west corner, {{linked to a}} brick and concrete bell tower by a covered walkway. The main elevation {{of the church is}} asymmetrical, with the end walls of the wings flanking the central arch being constructed of different materials. The concrete parabolic arch is in-filled with a timber framed glazed wall, with a reinforced concrete cross forming the central spine and a raised brick garden bed running along the base. A series of horizontal ridges on {{the outer edge of the}} parabolic arch are remnants of the original roof cladding system. To the side of the arch is the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> of the eastern aisle, which features small, cross-shaped openings in the brickwork, in-filled with glass. A plaque commemorating the laying of the foundation stone is located here. The entrance foyer on the western side is fully glazed with timber framing and a low brick garden bed along the north side.|$|E
25|$|The Large Library, one of {{the three}} {{libraries}} in the house, is , it is located to the east of The State Music Room. This room was created in 1793 from the former East Gallery. The plaster ceiling dates from then, with its elaborate cornice supporting a deep coffered cove in each corner of which are clusters of grapes, the flat centre of the ceiling has elaborate decoration, including in the border of the central panel mermen holding and feeding a griffin. The main entrance is in the centre of the long north wall. There are chimneypieces in the centre of each <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> These are of white marble with flanking caryatids, the jambs are of black marble, one dates from 1792 which is a copy of the other probably dating from the 1760s. Above each chimneypiece is a mirror. The bookcases are of mahogany there are over five hundred shelves on the lower walls and they have their original doors with brass wire grilles. The walls are completely covered by the shelving, and even the walls between the seven windows of the south wall. The upper two hundred and forty shelves are accessed via a gallery running around the east, north and west walls. The over 20,000 volumes that were on these shelves, largely collected by the 1st Marquess of Buckingham were sold in January 1849, at Sotheby's, the sale lasted 24 days. There is a series of three marble busts in the windows that were sold from the house in 1921 but have been repurchased. These are: 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos by Raimondo Trentanova, Frederick III, German Emperor and Victoria, Princess Royal both carved by Tito Angelini. Also there are small busts above the bookcases on the window wall, Homer, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Horace, Demosthenes and another of Homer. These were sold in 1921 but donated to the House and returned to their original positions.|$|E
500|$|The Bill Struth Main Stand, {{formerly}} known as the Main Stand, faces onto Edmiston Drive (A8 road). The red-brick facade, designed by Archibald Leitch, is a Category B listed building. Simon Inglis, writing in 1996, described it as an [...] "imposing red-brick facade, with its mock neo-classical arched, square and pedimented windows, exudes prestige and power." [...] On each <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> the club crest is depicted in a blue and gold mosaic. Stairtowers leading to the Club Deck (third tier) stand {{at each end of the}} Main Stand.

2500|$|Aldrich's bill met much {{opposition}} from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased {{due to his}} close ties to wealthy bankers such as J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Aldrich's son-in-law. Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan, but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the [...] "eastern establishment". In contrast, progressive Democrats favored a reserve system {{owned and operated by}} the government; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would <b>end</b> <b>Wall</b> Street's control of the American currency supply. Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned, yet decentralized, reserve system, which would still be free of Wall Street's control.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{construction}} stage {{corresponds to}} the additions undertaken in [...] that installed a chapel centred on the southern side of the crossing and a vestry on its northern side. The walls of these additions are constructed of concrete block: rendered quoins and infill panels of textured blocks.

2500|$|The {{iconographic}} {{scheme was}} a pair of cycles, facing each other {{on the sides of the}} chapel, of the Life of Christ and the Life of Moses, together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy. [...] Botticelli's contribution included three of the original fourteen large scenes: the Temptations of Christ, Youth of Moses and Punishment of the Sons of Corah (or various other titles), as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of unknown subjects in the lunettes above, where Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling now is. [...] He may have also done a fourth scene on the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> opposite the altar, now destroyed. [...] Each painter bought a team of assistants from his workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work was done in a few months.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} is a large hall, 22.6 meter long by 7.22 wide, and is oriented in North-South direction, which is quite uncommon among the Byzantine churches in Constantinople. Its masonry consists of alternate courses of bricks and stones. The original building had a triple-nave plan, but the only remains of the side aisles belong to the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> of the western one. To the north side there is an arch and a semicircular apse made of bricks, which outside has a polygonal shape. The walls of the apse are indented by two niches. The main aisle has walls which are lighted by two ranges of windows, which are irregularly spaced. The southern wall is also lighted by two ranges of windows. The lower windows are {{much larger than the}} higher. The entrance is situated {{in the middle of the}} western wall. Under the western side there is a cistern, whose roof rests on three columns.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 November 1953 {{a larger}} chapel was blessed and opened by Archbishop Liston. This was built {{mainly on the}} {{initiative}} of the Chaplain of the School, Father Reginald Delargey. Funds were raised by the Old Boys, Men's and Ladies' Committees and the pupils. The chapel cost £3,300. £3,000 was raised by an appeal (£1,400 from parents, friends and Old Boys, and £750 from the pupils including £200 {{as a result of}} [...] "self-denial" [...] days). [...] "The opening of the chapel was all the more satisfying because of the involvement of the pupils." [...] This chapel was located between the Brothers' House and the main school building (now called the [...] "Br O'Driscoll Building"). The chapel was rectangular. It had two aisles between which there were approximately ten pews which could accommodate a class or two for Mass or Benediction. On the other side of each aisle were the Brothers' chairs and prie-dieus at which they recited their office each day, heard Mass and kept their own devotional books. The chapel was dominated by a crucifix and a large altar fixed against the south <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> in those pre-Vatican II days. A free-standing altar later replaced this so that Mass could be said facing the congregation. On the left was also a shrine to Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, a devotion much encouraged by the Christian Brothers. On the South side of this icon was the door to a small sacristy which also served as a confessional for the school, where the school chaplain was available regularly. This sacristy issued onto a small cloister which connected the Brother's House with the school building. On the North side of the icon a door led from the chapel to the Brother's Common room and library in the Brothers' House. This also served as the general staff room for the college which was most useful to the lay teachers. There were folding doors along the northern or entrance end of the chapel. These doors could be opened so that extra congregants could be accommodated outside. From time to time Masses were celebrated al fresco there. Other events were also held there such as school prizegivings. At the 1955 prizegiving, Archbishop Liston [...] "presided on a decorated balcony" [...] in front of the chapel. [...] "The chapel became a focal point and the good habit of a visit to the Blessed Sacrament before and after school [...] maintained over 60 years". This chapel was demolished to free up access to the Brother L. H. Wilkes Technology Block which was opened in 2001.|$|E
50|$|The Stone Schoolhouse {{stands on}} the east side of Bay Point Road, in the {{southern}} part of Georgetown near the junction with Moffatt Lane.
