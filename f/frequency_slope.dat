Five quantitative parameters [apparent integrated backscatter (AIB), <b>frequency</b> <b>slope</b> of apparent backscatter (FSAB), time slope of apparent backscatter (TSAB), integrated reflection coefficient (IRC), and <b>frequency</b> <b>slope</b> of integrated reflection (FSIR) ] were calculated using the echoes from cortical and trabecular bone in the femurs of 14 Wistar rats. Signal acquisition was performed three times in each rat, with the ultrasound signal acquired along the femur's central region from three positions 1 mm apart from each other. The parameters estimated for the three positions were averaged to represent the femur diaphysis. The results showed that AIB, FSAB, TSAB, and IRC values were statistically similar, but the FSIR values from Experiments 1 and 3 were different. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation coefficient showed, in general, strong correlations among the parameters. The proposed protocol and calculated parameters demonstrated the potential to characterize the femur diaphysis of rats in vivo.

40|$|Turbulent {{combustion}} {{processes are}} inherently unsteady and, thus, {{a source of}} acoustic radiation, which occurs due to the unsteady expansion of reacting gases. While prior studies have extensively characterized the total sound power radiated by turbulent flames, their spectral characteristics are not well understood. The objective of this research work is to measure the flow and acoustic properties of an open turbulent premixed jet flame and explain the spectral trends of combustion noise. The flame dynamics were characterized using high speed chemiluminescence images of the flame. A model based on {{the solution of the}} wave equation with unsteady heat release as the source was developed and was used to relate the measured chemiluminescence fluctuations to its acoustic emission. Acoustic measurements were performed in an anechoic environment for several burner diameters, flow velocities, turbulence intensities, fuels, and equivalence ratios. The acoustic emissions are shown to be characterized by four parameters: peak frequency (Fpeak), low <b>frequency</b> <b>slope</b> (beta), high <b>frequency</b> <b>slope</b> (alpha) and Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL). The peak frequency (Fpeak) is characterized by a Strouhal number based on the mean velocity and a flame length. The transfer function between the acoustic spectrum and the spectrum of heat release fluctuations has an f^ 2 dependence at low frequencies, while it converged to a constant value at high frequencies. Furthermore, the OASPL was found to be characterized by (Fpeak mfH) ^ 2, which resembles the source term in the wave equation. Ph. D.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that UV/optical light curves of quasars can be {{described}} with the prevalent damped random walk (DRW, also known as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) model. A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low frequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low <b>frequency</b> PSD <b>slope</b> is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves available. Meanwhile, quasars show too large scatter in their DRW parameters to {{be attributed to the}} uncertainties in the measurements and the dependence of variation to known physical factors. In this work we present simulations showing that, if the low frequency PSD deviates from DRW, the red noise leakage can naturally produce large scatter in variation parameters measured from simulated light curves. The steeper the low <b>frequency</b> PSD <b>slope</b> is, the larger scatter we expect. Based on the observations of SDSS Stripe 82 quasars, we find the low <b>frequency</b> PSD <b>slope</b> should be no steeper than - 1. 3. The actual slope could be flatter, which consequently requires that quasar variabilities should be influenced by other unknown factors.

40|$|Abbreviated] We {{search for}} scaling {{relations}} between the fundamental AGN parameters and rest-frame UV/optical variability properties for a sample of ∼ 90 X-ray selected AGNs covering a wide redshift range from the XMM-COSMOS survey, with optical light curves in four bands provided by the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS 1) Medium Deep Field 04 survey. To estimate the variability amplitude we utilize the normalized excess variance (σ_rms^ 2) and probe variability on rest-frame timescales of several months and years by calculating σ_rms^ 2 {{from different parts of}} our light curves. In addition, we derive the rest-frame optical PSD for our sources using continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) models. We observe that the excess variance and the PSD amplitude are strongly anti-correlated with wavelength, bolometric luminosity and Eddington ratio. There is no evidence for a dependency of the variability amplitude on black hole mass and redshift. These results suggest that the accretion rate is the fundamental physical quantity determining the rest-frame UV/optical variability amplitude of quasars on timescales of months and years. The optical PSD of all of our sources is consistent with a broken power law showing a characteristic bend at rest-frame timescales ranging between ∼ 100 and ∼ 300 days. The break timescale exhibits no significant correlation with any of the fundamental AGN parameters. The low <b>frequency</b> <b>slope</b> of the PSD is consistent with a value of - 1 for most of our objects, whereas the high <b>frequency</b> <b>slope</b> is characterized by a broad distribution of values between ∼- 2 and ∼- 4. These findings unveil significant deviations from the simple "damped random walk" model, frequently used in previous optical variability studies.
