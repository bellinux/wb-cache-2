30|$|The most {{challenging}} application of NPPV {{may be in}} patients with ARDS. Studies of NPPV {{for the treatment of}} ARDS in adult population have reported failure rates of 50 - 80 % [40]. A meta-analysis of the topic in adult population concluded that NPPV was unlikely to have any significant benefit [41]. In children, the use of NPPV for the treatment of ARDS was associated with a failure rate of 78 %, and 22 % of them <b>died</b> (<b>Table</b> 1) [27]. Therefore, NPPV use in such a patient group is rarely justified. However, if a trial of NPPV is initiated, patients should be closely monitored and promptly intubated if their conditions deteriorate, so that inordinate delays in needed interventions are avoided.|$|R

Subsequent cases at eight hospitals have been associated with exposures at hospital A. Previously, all reported cases had been associated with persons recently returning to Taiwan from SARS-affected regions. This report summarizes epidemiologic findings of the outbreak in Taiwan and describes the impact of healthcare–associated transmission of SARS. As of May 22, a total of 483 probable cases had been reported (Figure 1). All probable SARS patients were hospitalized; 84 (17 %) had been discharged, and 60 (12 %) had <b>died</b> (<b>Table).</b> The median age of probable SARS patients was 43 years (range: 9 months– 91 years); 341 (71 %) cases were from Taipei City and Taipei County, the largest metropolitan region of the island. The first patient reported had onset of illness on February 25; the majority of cases occurred after April 21 and were associated with transmission in health-care settings. Initial Cases (March 14 –April 21) Taiwan (2002 population: 23 million) has extensive business ties with Hong Kong and mainland China where SARS cases have been reported. The first case in Taiwan was identified on March 14 in a traveler from Guangdong Province in China. During March 14 –April 21, Taiwan reported 28 probable SARS cases; of these, four resulted from secondary transmission (one HCW and three family contacts). During this period, SARS was characterized by sporadic cases among business travelers who were cared for primarily at large academic hospitals; secondary spread was limited to identified contacts. Initial actions by DOH included the formation of a SARS advisory committee, infection-control training, contact tracing and quarantine, and airport and border surveillance. Because of Taiwan’s success with SARS control, in early April, the World Health Organization changed Taiwan’s designation from an “affected area ” to an “area with limited local transmission. ...|$|R
