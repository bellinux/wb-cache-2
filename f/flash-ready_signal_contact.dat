40|$|During development, cells undergo {{dramatic}} changes in their morphology. By affecting contact geometry, these morphological changes could influence cellular communication. However, it has remained unclear whether and how <b>signaling</b> depends on <b>contact</b> geometry. This question is particularly relevant for Notch signaling, which coordinates neighboring cell fates through direct cell-cell signaling. Using micropatterning with a receptor trans-endocytosis assay, we show that signaling between pairs of cells correlates with their contact area. This relationship extends across contact diameters ranging from micrometers to tens of micrometers. Mathematical modeling predicts that dependence of <b>signaling</b> on <b>contact</b> area can bias cellular differentiation in Notch-mediated lateral inhibition processes, such that smaller cells {{are more likely to}} differentiate into signal-producing cells. Consistent with this prediction, analysis of developing chick inner ear revealed that ligand-producing hair cell precursors have smaller apical footprints than non-hair cells. Together, these results highlight the influence of cell morphology on fate determination processes...|$|R

40|$|International audience-Fretting {{corrosion}} {{phenomenon is}} known as the main cause of contact resistance increasing in <b>signal</b> <b>contact.</b> But for power connectors this undesirable phenomenon in embarked systems is more complex because high current induces high voltages and subsequent Joule overheating can be expected during vibration. Our study deals with contact similar of power connectors ones submitted to vibration am-plitudes up to 25 micrometres at frequencies of a few 10 Hz under a current ramp from 0. 1 to 40 A under 14 VDC. The main measured parameters are the contact voltage during vibration up to a hundred thousand cycles. The aver-age voltage by micro-voltmeter and its fluctuation during one cycle are acquired permanently by oscilloscope. Thermal aspects are also investigated by the use of min-iature thermocouples logged {{as close as possible to}} the con-tact zone. It was found that a limiting voltage is reached sim-ilar to the fritting voltage in a tarnished metal film reported by Holm. So contact resistances and the power brought by Joule effect are reduced and the temperature rise is limited. The main factors playing a role are current, contact materi-als and its susceptibility to wear and debris oxidation at the interface. This behaviour is confirmed by the SEM-EDX analysis of fretting zone at different steps of fretting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{heterogenous}} subcellular {{distribution of}} {{a wide array of}} channels, pumps and exchangers allows extracellular stimuli to induce increases in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]c) with highly defined spatial and temporal patterns, that in turn induce specific cellular responses (e. g. contraction, secretion, proliferation or cell death). In this extreme complexity, the role of mitochondria was considered marginal, till the direct measurement with targeted indicators allowed to appreciate that rapid and large increases of the [Ca 2 +] in the mitochondrial matrix ([Ca 2 +]m) invariably follow the cytosolic rises. Given the low affinity of the mitochondrial Ca 2 + transporters, the close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2 +-releasing channels was shown to be responsible for the prompt responsiveness of mitochondria. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of: i) the mitochondrial and ER Ca 2 + channels mediating the ion transfer, ii) the structural and molecular foundations of the <b>signaling</b> <b>contacts</b> between the two organelles, iii) the functional consequences of the [Ca 2 +]m increases, and iv) the effects of oncogene-mediated signals on mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis.
