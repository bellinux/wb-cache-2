40|$|This OD {{project was}} {{introduced}} in one large HSE Regional Orthodontic Unit. It was a process change project {{to improve the quality}} of delivery of care for children very prominent front teeth, with Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN 5 a) Many growing IOTN 5 a patients have a ‘window of opportunity’ when treatment with a functional appliance(twin-block) will be most efficient and most effective. Orthodontic treatment for non-growing IOTN 5 a patients is often less ideal for the patient, the clinician and may involve surgery which is more expensive for the service. Allocating patients to treatment from the sequential waiting list for IOTN 5 a is unbalanced due to the wide variation in patient age and clinical urgency on the IOTN 5 a waiting list. Quality management can reduce variation in systems and improve processes. The aims and objectives of this OD project were to develop a standardised clinical protocol using NCEC Guidance for clinicians to apply at assessment of IOTN 5 a patients. This was based on the best clinical evidence for the timing of treatment and the evidence for cost-minimisation and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Using the HSE Change Model, the new process was implemented, using the protocol to record an <b>indicative</b> <b>date</b> for treatment to start. A key performance indicator was developed to measure compliance with protocol and to measure the new quality standard. A balanced score card evaluation outlines the benefits of the change from the different stakeholders’perspective. The process change was successful in improving IOTN 5 a patient’s access to functional appliance treatment. Further mainstreaming and evaluation of outcome measures and is required. This quality improvement is patient-centred but benefits all the stakeholders. There is s cost-benefit to the service by providing treatment at the most efficient and effect time...|$|E
40|$|The article aims {{to re-examine}} the two {{versions}} (respectively {{for two and}} three choirs) of Luca Marenzio’s motet Jubilate Deo…cantate, considering sources that were previously unknown, or in any case not taken into account {{for the purpose of}} publishing the complete works of the composer. With regards the version for three choirs, which also comprises the alto and bass part-books of the second choir conserved in the municipal library of Waldheim (once mistakenly believed {{to be part of the}} 2 -choir version), of particular interest is a manuscript kept in the Sächsische Landesbibliothek in Dresden, consisting of a part-book, clearly intended for the use of an organist to accompany the vocal performance, whose title page bears the <b>indicative</b> <b>date</b> of 1623. Although not significant for the purposes of establishing the date of composition of this motet, the document is nevertheless interesting for the history of the reception of the composition and because it is the only source which contains a basso continuo part and, in addition, has markings informing the organist of the alternation between the three choirs. As far as the version for two choirs is concerned, another two manuscripts in separate parts prove to be of interest: the first kept in the library of the Milan Conservatory, but originally from Mantua, dating from between the end of the 16 th century and the first three decades of the 17 th century; the second, dating from 1631 - 1633, is conserved in Berlin, although originating from Breslau, and belonged to a cantor working in the church of St Christopher in Breslau. Both versions of this motet are linked to the composer’s Polish period (the 3 -choir version appears in the printed anthology Melodiae Sacrae, compiled by Vincentius Lilius and published in Cracow in 1604, while both are included in the tablature manuscript kept in Pelplin and dating from 1620 - 40), which shows that this work was, if not composed, almost certainly performed (and perhaps also rescored) during his stay in Poland (1595 - 1597 / 98). Regarding the question of the order in which the two works were written, the results of a comparison have led to opposite conclusions to what was previously believed, suggesting that the 2 -choir version is a later adaptation of the work for three choirs...|$|E
2500|$|Parchment from {{a number}} of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been carbon dated. The initial test {{performed}} in 1950 was on a piece of linen from one of the caves. This test gave an <b>indicative</b> <b>dating</b> of 33CE plus or minus 200 years, eliminating early hypotheses relating the scrolls to the medieval period. Since then two large series of tests have been performed on the scrolls themselves. The results were summarized by VanderKam and Flint, who said the tests give [...] "strong reason for thinking that most of the Qumran manuscripts belong to the last two centuries BCE and the first century CE." ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of a geomorphologic and stratigraphic study of the NW portion of the Upper Tiber Basin (Central Italy), and focuses on the terraced {{alluvial}} deposits which are grouped into late Middle-Upper Pleistocene (MUP) and Holocene (HOL) units. The drainage development in the basin was deeply influenced by an active tectonic setting characterized by orthogonal fault systems, which forced river deviations and attracted alluvial deposition in the subsiding portions of the basin. The occupation of this intermountain territory by ancient human communities is recorded by late Prehistoric-Protohistoric archaeological findings collected within or on the surfaces delimiting these units. This archaeological dataset allowed an <b>indicative</b> <b>dating</b> of the major stages of the fluvial evolution between the end of the middle Pleistocene and the late Holocene. The chronological constraint indicates that the morphostratigraphic events recorded in the MUP and HOL units, have reasonably occurred within the two last glacial-interglacial cycles. Rapid climate changes, affecting the surface hydrology and the sediment supply to the river systems, and the active tectonic setting, thus, may account for the gaps in the local archaeological record, including most of the late Paleolithic, the Mesolithic and the early Neolithic. Late Pleistocene and the early Holocene stages of relevant alluvial deposition in a subsiding basin may hav...|$|R
50|$|The {{last two}} centuries of {{occupation}} at Pacbitun, the Tzib phase of the Classic period, saw a sharp spike in population levels, possibly to 5000-6500 inhabitants within a 9 km2 area, with signs of a parallel intensification of agriculture in the surrounding countryside. Numerous hillsides around Pacbitun have relic traces of lengthy, stone wall constructions, mostly of Tzib phase <b>date,</b> <b>indicative</b> of agricultural terracing. This suggests that the leadership and residents of Pacbitun were attempting to cope with increased population pressure at the site. Interestingly, these final decades also show heightened ritual activity, {{in the form of}} abundant ceremonial caches, largely pottery offerings, though these late caches contain fewer exotic materials (shell, jade, obsidian, slate) than in earlier phases of the Classic period. The last pottery cache from Pacbitun generated a radiocarbon date of 860 CE (+/- 40).|$|R
500|$|A key {{concept in}} {{interpreting}} radiocarbon dates is archaeological association: {{what is the}} true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site? [...] It frequently happens that a sample for radiocarbon dating can be taken directly from the object of interest, {{but there are also}} many cases where this is not possible. [...] Metal grave goods, for example, cannot be radiocarbon dated, but they may be found in a grave with a coffin, charcoal, or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at the same time. [...] In these cases a date for the coffin or charcoal is <b>indicative</b> of the <b>date</b> of deposition of the grave goods, because of the direct functional relationship between the two. [...] There are also cases where there is no functional relationship, but the association is reasonably strong: for example, a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to the rubbish pit.|$|R
500|$|The tower house {{measures}} [...] by [...] on a skewed rectangular plan. The lower two storeys {{comprise the}} oldest {{part of the}} castle, which can be dated to around 1200, while the upper parts are of the 15th century. The date for the original building is based on several pieces of evidence. The cubical blocks of masonry, the flat buttress at the north-east, and the splaying, or widening, of {{the base of the}} walls, are all <b>indicative</b> of this <b>date.</b> The collapsed part of the south wall also formerly contained an early 13th-century style double-lancet window. The original structure, of a type known as a hall house, was probably of two or three storeys, comprising a first-floor hall over an unvaulted basement, and may have been surrounded by a defensive timber stockade or enclosure. The 15th-century rebuilding added two upper floors, and rearranged the interior. Vaulted basements, including a kitchen, and a spiral stair were inserted, and the heightened wall was topped by a parapet with machicolations; spaces through which objects could be dropped on attackers {{at the base of the}} wall. The tower suffered major collapses in 1844 and 1919, and today just the basement survives, with only a small section of the south-east wall standing to its full height.|$|R
40|$|Leprosy {{was rare}} in Europe during the Roman period, yet its {{prevalence}} increased dramatically in medieval times. We examined human remains, with paleopathological lesions <b>indicative</b> of leprosy, <b>dated</b> to the 6 th- 11 th century AD, from Central and Eastern Europe and Byzantine Anatolia. Analysis of ancient DNA and {{bacterial cell wall}} lipid biomarkers revealed Mycobacterium leprae in skeletal remains from 6 th- 8 th century Northern Italy, 7 th- 11 th century Hungary, 8 th- 9 th century Austria, the Slavic Greater Moravian Empire of the 9 th- 10 th century and 8 th- 10 th century Byzantine samples from Northern Anatolia. These data were analyzed alongside findings published by others. M. leprae is an obligate human pathogen that has undergone an evolutionary bottleneck followed by clonal expansion. Therefore M. leprae genotypes and sub-genotypes give information about the human populations they have infected and their migration. Although data are limited, genotyping demonstrates that historical M. leprae from Byzantine Anatolia, Eastern and Central Europe resembles modern strains in Asia Minor rather than the recently characterized historical strains from North West Europe. The westward migration of peoples from Central Asia in the first millennium may have introduced different M. leprae strains into medieval Europe and certainly would have facilitated the spread of any existing leprosy. The subsequent decline of M. leprae in Europe {{may be due to}} increased host resistance. However, molecular evidence of historical leprosy and tuberculosis co-infections suggests that death from tuberculosis in leprosy patients was also a factor...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} {{concerning}} {{the effects of}} wildfires on tree radial growth and their climatic response under contrasting regimes of fog water inputs on oceanic islands. On Tenerife, Canary Islands, windward slopes are humid with high-fog frequency due to influence of wet trade winds, while climate on leeward slopes is more arid. We used tree-ring records of Pinus canariensis Sweet ex Spreng. to quantify {{the effects of a}} fire of known date on radial growth and determine the main limiting climatic factors for growth. Radial growth patterns and their responsiveness to fire severity and climatic variation differed between windward and leeward slopes. Surface fire did not significantly impact growth, while crown fire caused short-term growth reduction, and even cessation, more pronounced on the windward slope. Growth rates, tree-ring common signal, and climate sensitivity were smaller on the windward slope, with cold winters, and summer water stress limiting growth. On the leeward slope, climate explained a greater amount of growth variation mainly due to negative effects of high October-December sea-level pressures causing dry winter conditions. Contrasting growth dynamics on both slopes may result from diverging physiological effects of water inputs and reduced radiation caused by fog drip. Our findings suggest that dating growth suppressions and absent rings are useful to date past high-severity crown fires in P. canariensis forests, in addition to ordinary fire scars <b>dating</b> <b>indicative</b> of low-severity surface fires. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|The sacred grove at Igbo Olokun, {{located in}} Ile-Ife, Southwestern Nigeria, {{has long been}} known for the massive {{quantities}} of glass beads present on the surface and in subsurface deposits. Overshadowed by the bravura terracotta and copper alloy sculptures of human heads that characterize the so-called Classic period (12 th- 15 th century A. D.) of Ife’s history, the glass materials at Igbo Olokun have received relatively cursory attention. Few of these materials have been described in any detail and their subsurface contexts are largely undocumented. Between 2010 and 2012, the archaeological excavations I conducted at Igbo-Olokun recovered over 12, 000 glass beads as well as hundreds of glass-encrusted crucible fragments, other glass production debris, and pottery. This dissertation describes the deposits and the recovered materials in significant detail, establishing a basic framework for future comparative and analytic research at the site. Using chemical and physical analyses of the glass beads and glass production debris, the competing hypotheses of local primary glass production or re-melting of imported glass to create beads are explored in detail. Optical microscopic examination of the glass-encrusted crucibles in cross-section provides evidence for use in primary glass production rather then secondary re-melting of glass. Studies of other production debris including glass droplets, wasters, and cullet suggest the different stages in glass bead production from initial drawing of glass canes to heat treatment of snapped bead ends. The techniques used were highly sophisticated; producing mainly seed beads less than four millimeters in diameter. The thread or wire used to string the beads must have been exceptionally fine, but {{there is no evidence of}} the material used. The large quantity of material recovered from a relatively small area suggests glass production on an industrial scale. Compositional analysis of samples of the glass beads, crucibles, and other production materials using LA-ICP-MS, SEM/EDS, and SEM confirms the prevalence of glass that is very high in alumina content. High Lime High Alumina (HLHA) glass has previously been identified at Igbo-Olokun on samples of uncertain provenience. The recently excavated beads confirm that HLHA glass is very common, but Low Lime High Alumina (LLHA) glass is also present. These results expand on the work of James Lankton, Akin Ige, and Thilo Rehren who first proposed in 2006 that high alumina glass represents a glassmaking tradition unique to West Africa, and possibly unique to southern Nigeria. The compositional analysis provides additional evidence for local sourcing of the raw materials for this glass. The dissertation contextualizes this tradition with reference to the history and geography of early glass production in the Old World. The chronology of glass production at Igbo Olokun is not incontrovertibly established, since much of the material may have been redeposited and may therefor represent materials from different time periods. However, analysis of the pottery recovered from the excavations shows characteristics consistent with Classic period pottery from nearby sites in Ile-Ife that have been radiocarbon dated to the twelfth to fifteenth centuries CE. Several radiocarbon dates from the 2010 - 2012 excavations also fall within this time range, but there are also two much later <b>dates,</b> <b>indicative</b> of mixed deposits. Results of thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of crucible samples, undertaken to clarify the chronology of glass production, have instead confused it further. The dates cluster in the early second millennium and the first millennium BCE, with some weaker evidence for the second millennium CE. The dissertation evaluates the various factors that might be at play, and identifies the additional data that will be necessary to support one or more possible scenarios for the dates of glass production at Igbo Olokun. The results of the bead classification and compositional studies have expanded the limited comparative database for distribution studies of various glass recipes and bead types in West Africa. The presence of HLHA beads in other West African archaeological sites after the ninth century CE suggests interaction between Ile-Ife and sites such as Igbo-Ukwu in southern Nigeria, Gao and Essouk in Mali, and Kissi in Burkina Faso. The dissertation concludes that Igbo-Olokun was a regional primary glass production center that specialized in large-scale production of glass beads, which then enjoyed widespread distribution in West Africa, particularly in the first half of the second millennium CE...|$|R
