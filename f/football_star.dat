5|$|The Cocking affair {{occurred}} in 1941 and 1942 when Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge exerted direct {{control over the}} state's educational system, particularly through the firing of University of Georgia professor Walter Cocking, who had been hired to raise the relatively low academic standards at UGA's College of Education.
