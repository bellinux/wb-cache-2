5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E
5|$|As Africa's most {{populated}} country, Nigeria has repositioned {{its military}} as a peacekeeping <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> continent. Since 1995, the Nigerian military, through ECOMOG mandates, {{have been deployed}} as peacekeepers in Liberia (1997), Ivory Coast (1997–1999), and Sierra Leone (1997–1999). Under an African Union mandate, it has stationed forces in Sudan's Darfur region to try to establish peace.|$|E
5|$|By early afternoon, the strong-point {{guarding}} the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy. But without enough <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground {{to mop up}} the remaining defenders, the exit could not be opened. Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall, and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion spent the night near Vierville.|$|E

5|$|The Embraer jet, despite {{serious damage}} to the left {{horizontal}} stabilizer and left winglet, was able to continue flying, though its autopilot disengaged and it required an unusual amount of <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> yoke to keep the wings level.|$|E
5|$|The control {{surfaces}} operated {{in much the}} same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic pull-out system. Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes. The pilot could override the system by exerting significant <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> control column and taking manual control.|$|E

5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised {{that he would make}} the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he would establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E
5|$|By 20 August 1831 Warsaw {{was almost}} entirely encircled by the Russians. Count Paskevich had at his {{disposal}} a formidable force. His main <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left bank of the Vistula consisted of between 54,000 and 55,000 soldiers, supported by 324 guns of various calibres. A further 7000 soldiers and 20 guns guarded the river crossings. The II Corps under General Cyprian von Kreutz (21,000 soldiers, 90 guns) was heading towards the city from Osiek while von Rüdiger's corps was tied down around Radom, fighting a large Polish corps under General Samuel Różycki.|$|E

5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E
5|$|How much {{braking force}} {{to apply to}} each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rider and bike times the coefficient of friction µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a rear wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
