40|$|Identifying {{explosive}} bubbles {{that are}} characterized by periodically collapsing behavior over time {{has been a major}} concern in the literature and is of great importance for practitioners. The complexity of the nonlinear structure in multiple bubble phenomena diminishes the discriminatory power of existing tests, as evidenced in early simulations conducted by Evans (1991). Multiple collapsing bubble episodes within the same sample period make bubble diagnosis particularly di¢ cult and complicate attempts at econometric dating. The present paper systematically investigates these issues and develops new procedures for practical implementation and surveillance strategies by central banks. We show how the testing procedure and dating algorithm of Phillips, Wu and Yu (2011, PWY) is affected by multiple bubbles and may fail to be consistent. To assist performance in such contexts, the present paper proposes a generalized version of the sup ADF test of PWY that addresses the difficulty. The asymptotic distribution of the generalized test is provided and the test is shown to signficantly improve discriminatory power in simulations. The paper advances a new <b>date-stamping</b> strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles that is based on this generalized test and consistency of the <b>date-stamping</b> algorithm is established. The new strategy leads to distinct power gains over the <b>date-stamping</b> strategy of PWY when multiple bubbles occur. Empirical applications are conducted with both tests along with their respective <b>date-stamping</b> technology to S&P 500 stock market data from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach identies many key historical episodes of exuberance and collapse over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY locates only two such episodes in the same sample range. <b>Date-stamping</b> strategy, Generalized sup ADF test, Multiple bubbles, Rational bubble, Periodically collapsing bubbles, Sup ADF test...|$|R

50|$|The {{modern era}} of postal service in Iran started in 1851 with a postal reform {{that had no}} {{immediate}} effects. The success of the Anglo-Indian postal operations combined with the positive reports about postal reforms in Europe and throughout the British Empire generated a renewed interest about postal communications and telegraphy in Naser al-Din, the Shah who reigned from 1848 to 1896. In 1865 he sent a delegation to Paris to liaise with the French Ministry of Posts & Telecommunications. The news of the Iranian mission got around and a private businessman {{by the name of}} A.M. Riester submitted essays for Iranian stamps featuring a lion and a rising sun behind it, set in an oval inner frame, part of an ornamentally rich frame. Months went by and Riester decided to contact Teheran, but he was chided for taking the liberty of using national symbols for unsolicited stamps. Meanwhile, the Iranian mission had opted for essays featuring a similar design prepared by Albert Barre. These essays caught the attention of top bureaucrats and eventually that of the Shah; as a result, in 1868 imperforate stamps with basically the same design of the Barre essays were printed in Teheran in quantities varying from 3,000 to 8,000 and issued for postal use in four denominations: 1 shahi violet; 2 shais green. 4 shais blue; and 8 shais red. They have been nicknamed the Bagheri stamps, possibly in reference to the person who printed or designed them. There was no hand-stamp or <b>date-stamp</b> in use to cancel these stamps and their circulation and use was relatively modest. In fact, not many letters are recorded, and {{because of the lack of}} any cancelling device, it is rather problematic to determine their genuine postal use simply because it is easy to exponentially increase the value of an un-cancelled letter by just adding an adhesive or two on to it.|$|E

The first technique used is the Generalized sup ADF (GSADF) test procedure developed by Phillips, Shi, and Yu (Testing for Multiple Bubbles: Historical Episodes of Exuberance and Collapse in the S&P 500, 2013), which allows the recursive identification of multiple periods of price explosivity. The second approach makes use of Robinson's (Efficient Test of Nonstationary Hypotheses, 1994) test statistic, comparing the null of a unit root process against the alternative of speced orders of fractional integration. The analysis date-stamps several periods of US house price explosivity, allowing us to contextualize its historic relevance...|$|E

Corn, soybeans, and wheat traded at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and wheat traded at the Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT) are examined over January 2004 -June 2013. A recursive bubble-testing procedure {{is used to}} detect and <b>date-stamp</b> bubble periods in the four grain futures markets. Findings indicate that all four markets experienced multiple bubbles during the sample period, but bubbles represent only a limited portion of the price behavior, and their magnitude is relatively small. Granger causality tests are used to investigate the lead-lag dynamics between index trader positions and weekly returns (price changes). We find no evidence that index investments lead returns {{in any of the}} four markets in either bubble or non-bubble periods. In addition, there is evidence that index investment may have a small price-dampening effect during negative bubble periods in the soybean market. Overall, the findings provide little support for the dual claim that: i) grain futures prices experienced large and long-lasting bubbles during recent years; and ii) index investment was a primary driver of the large bubbles...|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{explosive}} bubbles {{that are}} characterized by periodically collapsing phenomenon over time {{has been a major}} concern among researchers in finance and marketing. The paper advances a new <b>date-stamping</b> strategy for identifying the existence, as well as the origination and termination points of multiple bubbles, by using the generalized version of the sup ADF test (GSADF, hereafter) backwardly, which was originally introduced by Phillips, Shi and Yu (PSY, hereafter, 2012). This new method is more effective in identifying the existence of bubbles than the <b>date-stamping</b> strategy (SADF) when multiple bubbles occur. The backward GSADF test is as a rolling window of the ADF test with a double-sup window selection criterion that significantly improves its discriminatory power in simulations. This paper, thus, employs the backward GSADF test to identify housing bubbles in China by using the quarterly data of the real estate price index of 35 large and medium cities from 1998 Q 1 to 2013 Q 4. After running the test, we find statistical evidence of real estate bubbles that exist in the price indexes of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Yinchuan, Shenzhen, Urumqi, and Shenyang. These bubbles are either short-term bubbles or extremely short-term bubbles. We also discover that the ratio of city with housing bubbles is higher in the eastern region than in other regions in China...|$|R
