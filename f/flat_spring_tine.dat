40|$|Different {{implements}} {{for spring}} tillage and different cultivation intensities of autumn-ploughed fields were studied in eleven field experiments in potatoes in northern Sweden in 1965 - 69. The implements used were a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow, a cultivator-harrow with fairly rigid <b>spring</b> <b>tines</b> and a disc harrow. These implements {{were used in}} two, four and six runs. In addition, there was one treatment with spring ploughing and <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrowing (two runs) and one treatment with rotary cultivation (one run). The experiments were carried out on light soils, rich in fine sand and silt. In one of the experiments, however, the soil had a clay content as high as 23 per cent. Among the harrows, the disc harrow gave the best mean yield result. Four runs gave the highest yield. The differenees were, however small. Ploughing in the spring did not increase the crop yield. The rotary cultivation gave a yield result {{as high as the}} best of the harrowed treatments...|$|R

50|$|In {{one type}} of microswitch, {{internally}} there are two conductive <b>springs.</b> A long <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is hinged {{at one end of}} the switch (the left, in the photograph) and has electrical contacts on the other. A small curved spring, preloaded (i.e., compressed during assembly) so it attempts to extend itself (at the top, just right of center in the photo), is connected between the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> near the contacts and a fulcrum near the midpoint of the <b>flat</b> <b>spring.</b> An actuator nub presses on the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> near its hinge point.|$|R
5000|$|As the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves {{downward}} {{the upward}} {{force of the}} curved spring reduces causing the motion to accelerate {{even in the absence}} of further motion of the actuator until the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> impacts the normally-open contact.

It was contrived during this period to initially hold livestock within its quarters of the paddock, whereby the word pad was derived and applied to form the current word.|$|R
5000|$|Because the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is {{anchored}} and strong in tension the curved spring cannot {{move it to}} the right. The curved spring presses, or pulls, the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> upward, that is away, from the anchor point. Owing to the geometry, the upward force {{is proportional to the}} displacement which decreases as the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves downward. (Actually, the force is proportional to the sine of the angle, which is approximately proportional to the angle for small angles.) ...|$|R
50|$|As the {{actuator}} depresses it flexes the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> {{while the}} curved spring keeps the electrical contacts touching. When the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is flexed enough {{it will provide}} sufficient force to compress the curved spring and the contacts will begin to move.|$|R
50|$|In the {{actuated}} position the curved spring provides some upward force. If the actuator is released this will move the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> upward. As the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves, the force from the curved spring increases. This results in acceleration until the normally-closed contacts are hit. Just {{as in the}} downward direction, the switch is designed so that the curved spring {{is strong enough to}} move the contacts, even if the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> must flex, because the actuator does not move during the changeover.|$|R

Six weed control techniques (<b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow, inter row hoe with duckfoot sweeps, separately used or in combinations, inter row hoe with additional tools: finger weeder, torsion weeder, ridging wings) were evaluated concerning the effects on weed ground cover and on plant losses. Soy bean plant stands have been established in various rows spacing using different types of seeders (12. 5 cm with seed drill for harrowing variant and 50 cm with single seed drill for hoeing variants).

40|$|Production of cereals in a {{dryland farming}} system forms an {{important}} part of agricultural production in Morocco. Yield levels on the Saïs Plateau between Meknès and Fez in the semi-arid zone, however, remain low possibly because of sub-optimum water use due to inefficient tillage systems. A study was carried out to investigate the effect of soil tillage operations on water infiltration. Two systems of seedbed preparation on a silty clay soil were compared: traditional disc harrow (‘cover crop’) versus reduced tillage using a <b>spring</b> <b>tined</b> cultivator (‘vibrocultor’). Infiltration processes were studied using a rainfall simulator applying rainfall typical for aggressive events in the region. The effect of tillage and rainfall on the structure of the soil was assessed by both quantitative and descriptive methods. It was found that the disc harrow caused excessive pulverisation and seal formation under rainfall. Water infiltration, on the other hand, was not hindered by plough sole formation or subsoil compaction. It is suggested that reduced tillage by the <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator is less costly and results in lower losses of water by runoff, thus leaving more water available for the crop...|$|R

In the four environments with high weed pressure, the weed ground cover was already higher at pod filling in the harrowing variant. This resulted in higher yields in the hoeing variants in these environments and was caused by a longer period of weed control with hoeing.

40|$|Within organic farming, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} is prohibited and is generally being replaced by different tillage practices. At {{the same time the}} supply of sufficient amounts of nitrogen is often a problem within organic fanning. In cereal crops, harrowing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important mechanical weeding techniques. The loosening and aerating of the soil produced by harrowing should potentially enhance nitrogen mineralization. Furthermore, harrowing could enhance the soil structure and water content, since tillage is generally known to positively affect these soil factors through mechanisms such as crust breaking and enhanced tillering in cereals. This study investigated the effects of mechanical weed control in the spring on weeds, nitrogen mineralization and yield of winter wheat. Weed control was carried out when the crop had 2 - 3 leaves. Three different implements were tested on two soils differing in clay content for three consecutive years: A Väderstad Crosskill roller, an s-tine harrow and a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow, and compared with untreated controls. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers and total nitrogen content of the crop were determined on several occasions for calculations of net nitrogen mineralization in the soi 1. The numbers and weight of weeds were recorded one month after harrowing and at the time of harvesting. Grain yield was measured at harvest. The amount of dicotyledonous weeds was reduced by harrowing. On the soils with the lower clay content, weed numbers were reduced to between 50 and 82 % of those in the control, while on the soil with the higher clay content they were reduced to between 42 and 82 % of those in the control. On average, the best effect on the lighter clay soils was achieved by use of the s-tine harrow, while on the heavier clay soils the Väderstad Crosskill roller and the spring-tine harrow had the best weed control effect. In the harrowed treatments, the average mineral N content in the 0 - 30 cm layer was enhanced by only 0. 4 kg ha⁻¹. At the same time the N uptake in the crop was reduced by approximately the same amount due to the crop suffering mechanical damage, and calculations of net nitrogen mineralization showed no increase in N mineralization after harrowing. Despite annual variations, harrowing in general had a positive effect on grain yield. Comparing the different implements, the best yields on the lighter clay soil were achieved by use of the <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow, which increased the yield compared with the control by an average of 5 % in two years out of three (2002 - 2005). The best results on the heavier clay soils were achieved by use of Väderstad Crosskill roller, which gave a 5 % yield increase compared with the control, while the use of <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow and s-tine harrow caused a yield reduction of about the same magnitude. On both soil types, the use of an s-tine harrow had a negative effect on wheat yield, probably due to a high degree of mechanical damage to the crop...|$|R
