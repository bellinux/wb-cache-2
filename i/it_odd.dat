5|$|Though the {{original}} release of God of War III {{was met with}} critical acclaim, God of War III Remastered only garnered generally favorable reviews, receiving aggregate scores of 80.37% and 81 out of 100 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Reviewers found <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that Sony decided to remaster God of War III for PlayStation 4, as its story picks up immediately from the ending of God of War II, which may confuse newcomers who have never played the previous games. Praise {{was given to the}} smoother textures and improved frame rate, though because {{the original}} already had impressive graphics, the changes were not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.|$|E
25|$|In the Lois Duncan novel Locked in Time {{the main}} protagonist Nora finds <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that her 13 year old stepsister Josie commented {{how she was}} almost trampled to death at the Ringling Circus Fire, even though the event had {{occurred}} many years before Josie was born.|$|E
25|$|During Brenda's wake, George and Mahalik {{wreak havoc}} in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to revive her, only {{to blow up}} her body and get {{kicked out of the}} house. Cindy watches the tape, finding <b>it</b> <b>odd.</b> A phone caller tells her she will die in a week. She calls George, CJ and Mahalik for help. CJ says his Aunt Shaneequa might be able to help. Shaneequa, the Matrix Oracle, and her husband Orpheus agree to watch the tape. Shaneequa discovers the hidden image of a lighthouse and gets fights with Tabitha's mother. Shaneequa tells Cindy to find the lighthouse to break the curse. When Cindy returns home, she finds Cody watched the tape.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eggs--potatoes and bacon--buttermilk, and potheen [21]. <b>It's</b> <b>odd</b> if I can't {{get plenty}} of them in Mayo, if I've nothing better." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It's</b> <b>odd</b> {{to think}} of, but perhaps I thus became as inexplicable {{to the old}} man as he had been to me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It's</b> <b>odd</b> that I {{heard this}} at the time with unutterable contempt, and now that I recall it--well, I ask myself, what have I got better? ...|$|R
25|$|Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur {{investigated}} {{the case in}} conjunction with police. Hecht's first clue was a police photograph of the two weapons used in the shooting. Both were virtually identical Colt M1911's. Hecht thought <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> {{that a man who}} appeared to be a penniless vagrant—he had less than $5 on his person when found—would carry such an expensive weapon which was not widely available to the public at the time, instead of selling it. He also found {{it hard to believe that}} a mere drifter would risk a conflict with a veteran who was widely known to carry a gun. MacArthur came to a similar conclusion and came to find that the stranger's weapon had been sold to Wanderer's cousin Fred several years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Falcone {{received}} an effusive congratulatory {{phone call from}} Giulio Andreotti after the narrow escape. Falcone privately thought <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that Andreotti, who he had never spoken to, would suddenly contact him, and he mused {{about the significance of}} the incident to a friend. Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free. Later investigations into the murders of two police officers, Antonino Agostino and Emanuele Piazza, who worked for the secret service, revealed that they had secretly defused the bombs that had been placed by a Mafia commando aided by other secret service men. Agostino and his wife were killed on 5 August 1989 outside their home, and Piazza on 15 March 1990.|$|E
500|$|After {{the pair}} had {{recorded}} a few songs, Murphy {{found that she}} enjoyed working with Herbert, and her label let her work freely without any deadline. When she presented them the album, they found <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> and did not hear any songs that would make successful singles. The A division suggested that Murphy make some changes {{to make it more}} radio-friendly. Murphy refused, stating that she [...] "wanted it to be as pure as possible". The label later came to support her. The songs on Ruby Blue were gradually released on 12" [...] vinyl EPs titled Sequins 1, Sequins 2, and Sequins 3, in January, February, and May 2005 respectively.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>it's</b> <b>odd,</b> isn't <b>it?</b> I wish it {{had been}} somewhere else. I don't like this gloomy old place with its {{atmosphere}} of death. Come outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang the old gentleman!" [...] said Malcolm, heartily. [...] "Upon my soul, I’m half {{afraid to}} go to bed. <b>It’s</b> <b>odd</b> they should both think they saw something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother--I see Mother, now, {{and bright}} beings around {{her in the}} lake. Why isn't father there? <b>It's</b> <b>odd</b> that I can see Mother, when I can't see you! Farewell, Judith." ...|$|R
500|$|Also {{writing for}} the Daily Mirror, Simon called Oliver and Penny a [...] "medical tag-team". She found <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> they did not get along professionally because she thought [...] "a brother-sister {{relationship}} {{would be one of}} the least troublesome at Holby." [...] A Liverpool Daily Post review said that Oliver made Penny feel about [...] "two inches tall" [...] when he was promoted to F2, and supported her question [...] "Who needs enemies when I've got a brother like you?" [...] Bree Treacy of RTÉ Ten found both of the Valentines annoying. In June2010 she preferred Penny, [...] "with Oliver definitely getting the award for the most annoying sibling in the hospital"; the following month she called them irritating and recommended they [...] "get [...] acts together". On the day Oliver admitted to stealing Penny's exam paper, Daily Mail critic Jim Shelley featured him in his negative [...] "Down" [...] column and branded him a [...] "weasel".|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] on The MDNA Tour in 2012. The {{performance of}} the song closed the show's first segment known as Transgression, and found Madonna playing the guitar while Minaj appeared on the backdrops sitting on a throne singing her verse. Saeed Saeed of The National praised Madonna for [...] "re-emerging once again triumphant in rock star mode," [...] during the performance Kat Keogh of Birmingham Mail described that [...] "The crowd was awash with a sea of camera phones as Madge grabbed a guitar for Nicki Minaj duet 'I Don’t Give A'." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times was mixed in his review, writing that Madonna [...] "still looks silly when, as she did in 'I Don’t Give A', she slings an electric guitar and makes rocker-chick faces" [...] and found <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that [...] "someone so physically disciplined can’t fake better guitar moves." [...] The performance was included on Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Bill Panzer {{said that}} Tessa became {{popular with the}} program's audience. Rob Lineberger called Tessa [...] "...beautiful and spirited," [...] and said that [...] "...she is the perfect mortal foil for MacLeod's heavy concerns. She lightens and {{strengthens}} him." [...] Reviewer Abbie Bernstein of the Audio Video Revolution website wrote that Tessa was [...] "...depicted not as a screechy, in-the-dark Lois Lane {{but rather as a}} woman who handles her lover’s supernatural aspects with remarkable pragmatism." [...] Berstein added that Tessa was [...] "estimable" [...] and [...] "...an unusually gutsy love interest (not to mention a refreshing sexually active heroine, as opposed to the coy 'sexual tension'-generating females who usually populate the genre)." [...] Other reviewers had a more negative opinion. Reviewer Gord Lacey of TVShowsOnDVD.com [...] "...found <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that everyone liked Tessa because [...] found her rather annoying." [...] Reviewer Doug Anderson of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Tessa was [...] "...too arty and sympathetic to serve any purpose other than an emotional spur for the hero's vengeance." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Unfortunately, Chequered Past {{turned out}} to be another group that sounded more {{interesting}} on paper than they did in the grooves. <b>It's</b> <b>odd</b> to hear a bunch of ex-punks behaving like presentable mainstream rock entertainers." [...] (Rarebird's Detective Reviews) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing particular," [...] pursued Zack, undauntedly, [...] "except that <b>it's</b> <b>odd</b> {{you never}} brought them out before; and odder still {{that you should}} tell Blyth, and never say a word here to me, about getting them for a woman--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain put {{his hands}} on his knees and stared at the floor. [...] "No," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "I can’t call to mind any craft; but <b>it’s</b> <b>odd</b> that you should have got on this subject with me." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{working at}} Wanamaker's Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a {{colleague}} {{who had seen}} him dance, of {{a role in the}} upcoming production Every Sailor. A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled Every Woman. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew it perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while waiting to go on. He did not find <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: [...] "For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles." ...|$|E
500|$|ANN {{noted that}} the second anime season tends to overdramatize, {{especially}} {{in the last three}} episodes. ANN also describes the second season as [...] "more embarrassing and shoujo-ai oriented" [...] than the first season, but that the solid characterization is still a strength of the series. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime appreciated the focus on characters other than Yumi and Sachiko for the second season, regarding Shimako's loss of Sei and befriending Noriko as being [...] "one of the more moving" [...] arcs of Printemps. ANN regarded the OVA season as the best of the first three seasons, citing the improved production standards and the less melodramatic storylines. ANN notes that the fourth season is [...] "a return to dramatic form" [...] after the relaxation of the OVA series, but it is not as melodramatic as the second season, due to the increased maturity of the cast. [...] Chris Beveridge, writing for Mania.com, found <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that Yumi and Sachiko did not spend so much time together in the fourth season, and felt that the series needed an epilogue, but enjoyed seeing Yumi taking on some [...] "adult responsibilities." ...|$|E
500|$|An unusual rhetorical device, hendiadys, {{appears in}} several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia's speech {{at the end of}} the nunnery scene: [...] "Thexpectancy and rose of the fair state" [...] and [...] "And I, of ladies most deject and wretched". Many {{scholars}} have found <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that Hamlet was written later in Shakespeare's life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play's sense of duality and dislocation. Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in Hamlet because he [...] "showed how a character's language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings". She gives the example of Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, [...] "get thee to a nunnery", which is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet's confused feelings about female sexuality.|$|E
6000|$|Ah, well, I suppose 'twas a dollar, [...] And doubtless {{the change}} is correct, [...] Though <b>it's</b> <b>odd</b> that <b>it</b> seems so much smaller [...] Than what I'd a right to expect. [...] But you pay when you dine, I reflect.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was going}} to reply that <b>it</b> wasn't <b>odd</b> if you knew Mr. Porterfield, but I {{reflected}} that that perhaps only made <b>it</b> <b>odder.</b> I told my companion briefly who he was--that I had met him in the old Paris days, when I believed for a fleeting hour that I could learn to paint, when I lived with the jeunesse des ecoles; and her comment on this was simply: [...] "Well, he had better have come out for her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{noticed her}} eyes perhaps. She is the {{stepdaughter}} of that man Chaffery--a queer character, but indisputably mediumistic. <b>It's</b> <b>odd</b> the thing should have struck you. Curiously enough I myself have fancied {{she might be}} something of a psychic--judging from her face." ...|$|R
500|$|Biographer Robert Tate {{went further}} in his examination. During his {{research}} he contacted Professor Rafael Scheck, Head of History at Colby College. Scheck published Hitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers in 1940 {{and is an}} acknowledged expert on racial theory and in Nazi Germany. Without being familiar with Marseille, Scheck identified his friendship with Matthias was in direct contradiction to the Nazi mandate. Sheck doubted Marseille's [...] "acquisition" [...] of Matthais and his role as Marseille's [...] "batman", was done out of disrespect. Sheck said, [...] "I know of the camp commandant of the concentration camp of Mathausen, who held a black man as his personal servant. This was done out of disrespect, however. I {{do not think that}} aspect was relevant for Marseille." [...] When questioned on Marseille's behaviour, Sheck said, [...] "I do not find <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> because I am accustomed to seeing many nuances among the Germans of the Third Reich. But his behaviour would probably be startling for many other researchers." [...] Tate also noted Marseille's penchant for Cuban rumba by Ernesto Lecuona, jazz and swing which he believes was another way of resisting Nazi ideals.|$|E
500|$|Byard {{pointed out}} that the use of humor did not mean that his music was not serious: [...] "I might do it with humor, but it's still serious because I mean what I'm doing". He stated that his choice to play in a variety of styles was not imitatory or superficial: [...] "I can't play one way all night; I wouldn't want to and I wouldn't want the public to hear me that way". One {{obituary}} writer noted that, [...] "Nobody thinks <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> if a pianist underpins melody with stride patterns or a boogie bass. When Byard did that 30 years ago, distinctions were drawn more tightly". Music writer Dan Lander also stated that Byard's playing was ahead of its time, and added that it has influenced 21st-century pianists: Byard's grasp and integration of historical forms, his ability to embrace tradition and risk taking, was visionary, impacting on a new generation of jazz musicians who understood the history of jazz as a material to build on and work with, at the service of creating something new, rather than as an unmovable weight, fixing them to the past.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Sacramento Bee, Allen Pierleoni {{recommended}} {{the book as}} a gift for Father's Day, and called the work [...] "entertaining and informational, full of anecdotes, history, recipes and explanations of what pork belly has brought to the popular culture". Rita Zekas of the Toronto Star also {{recommended the}} book as a Father's Day gift. Kerry J. Byrne noted that the book covers [...] "everything from bacon-curing methods to bacon blogs" [...] and includes [...] "easy recipes". Publishers Weekly reviewed called the book a [...] "voluminous look at all things bacon"; the review concluded, [...] "Readers who, like Lauer, possess a borderline-obsessive love for bacon are likely to embrace this as their new Bible, but anyone else will quickly get their fill." [...] Rachel Forrest of The Portsmouth Herald recommended the book in her [...] "Annual Summer Reading List for Foodies". [...] "Another of my favorites this year is 'Bacon: A Love Story: A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat' by Heather Lauer. A book all about bacon... she profiles chefs that use <b>it,</b> <b>odd</b> finds across the nation and plenty of recipes," [...] commented Forrest. The Arizona Republic highlighted the book among its selection of [...] "Books to help turn pages of summer".|$|E
5000|$|Upon its release, Redemption {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. Tara Joshi of Quietus stated [...] "It’s orchestral, <b>it’s</b> <b>odd,</b> <b>it’s</b> experimental, it’s ornate, {{it makes}} you want to dance, {{it makes you}} want to swoon - at its heart Redemption is reflective of so many touchstones of black music from the past 30 years or so. <b>It</b> feels <b>odd</b> to say what Richard is doing is still perhaps too niche to get her a place in the R&B ‘Hot 100’, given her sound is so broad and all-encompassing, but its true. Richard has carved out an ambitiously futuristic place for herself that the mainstream hasn’t quite caught up with yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And it's {{warning you}} want yourself, Captain, dear," [...] said Pat to himself; [...] "how clever you think yourself, with your Mr. Keegan and your spies, and your fine lady Miss, there; {{but if you}} a'nt quiet enough before Christmas, <b>it's</b> <b>odd,</b> that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. No; I'm {{going to}} stick to the rules.... <b>It's</b> <b>odd,</b> but nothing but cliche seems to meet this case. You've placed me in a very {{exceptional}} position, Miss Stanley." [...] The note of his own voice exasperated him. [...] "Oh, damn!" [...] he said.|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, Dag Herbjørnsrud {{wrote in}} an {{editorial}} that [...] "Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik wasn't sending soldiers into war — he was merely supplying manpower to a [...] "peacekeeping mission". Is <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that the media was surprised by Norwegian soldiers using Viking helmets and battle cries of Vikings?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Underwood {{had noticed}} {{a couple of}} gaps in the {{coverage}} of the murders. She thought <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that no one had interviewed Clark's parents. Underwood managed to locate them and they gave her an exclusive interview and photographs. [...] Underwood's interview with Clark's parents appeared in the paper under the headline [...] "Mrs. Clark Says Son is Innocent", earning her a double column by-line.|$|E
2500|$|Hendiadys is one rhetorical type {{found in}} several places in the play, as in Ophelia's speech after the nunnery scene ("Th'expectancy and rose of the fair state" [...] and [...] "I, of all ladies, most deject and wretched" [...] are two examples). Many {{scholars}} have found <b>it</b> <b>odd</b> that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. Hamlet was written later in his life, when he was better at matching rhetorical figures with the characters and the plot than early in his career. Wright, however, has proposed that hendiadys is used to heighten the sense of duality in the play.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{always felt}} that Martha was very ill-used. If there were no Marthas there would never be {{anything}} fit to eat. But <b>it's</b> <b>odd</b> how sure a wife is to be scolded. If I did nothing at all, that wouldn't please a busy, hard-working man like you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's funny {{you should}} have been talking about Ogden getting kidnapped. This story of aunt Nesta's is all about an angel-child--I suppose it's meant to be Ogden--being stolen and hidden and all that. <b>It's</b> <b>odd</b> that she should write stories like this. You wouldn't expect it of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was going}} to reply that <b>it</b> was not <b>odd</b> if you knew Mr. Porterfield, but I {{reflected}} that that perhaps only made <b>it</b> <b>odder.</b> I told my companion briefly who he was--that I had met him {{in the old days}} in Paris, when I believed for a fleeting hour that I could learn to paint, when I lived with the jeunesse des écoles, and her comment on this was simply--'Well, he had better have come out for her!' ...|$|R
