2500|$|Some {{days later}} Vosill {{receives}} {{a note from}} Adlain, asking her to meet him and two other Dukes elsewhere in the castle. [...] She leaves alone, but Oelph opts to follow her in secret; after catching a glimpse of someone fleeing, he arrives in time to be arrested by the guard, who proceed to discover Vosill standing over {{the body of a}} murdered Duke, stabbed with one of her scalpels. [...] Vosill and Oelph are almost immediately delivered to Ralinge, who binds the two separately and then strips, intending to rape, Vosill. The woman issues what sounds to Oelph like commands, albeit in a language he does not recognize even partially. [...] Oelph's eyes are closed at this point, and in his narrative he is unable to adequately describe what he hears next, other than an impression of wind and metal. [...] When <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> he finds Ralinge and his assistants dead, dispatched bloodily, and Vosill free and in the process of removing her bindings, no indication of how she was freed. [...] Later, she claims that Oelph fell unconscious and the three men fought over who would rape her first, though she indicates to him that this is what he [...] "should" [...] remember.|$|E
2500|$|JR is {{eventually}} informed of Babe's one-night stand with Josh {{by her father}} (David Hayward). Not believing it, even when Josh confirms the encounter, viewers saw JR try {{to move on with}} his life and be happy with Babe. Once his suspicion gets the better of him, however, he confronts Babe about the matter. Babe tells the truth, and, in a dramatic fashion, JR later throws himself out a two-story window while drunk. While recovering, he insists that he no longer loves Babe. To add further conflict, Babe is written as thoroughly determined to win JR back; she undermines his wishes not to live with her. [...] "Babe is at the Chandler mansion. JR is home from the hospital and Babe isn't letting up," [...] said Havins. [...] "She's very dedicated to getting through to him. She's not saying, 'Let's get back together and forget anything ever happened.' It's more like, 'Let's try to move forward.' They aren't having an 'I love you' moment or anything like that, but she breaks the ice a little bit." [...] In addition, Babe's refusal to let JR go is happening during a serial killer arc, where Babe's life is in danger and one of her good friends (Erin Lavery) has just been murdered by the killer. In a moment where Babe confides to JR about this, viewers again witnessed the couple's star-crossed theme. [...] "He's sleeping and she is crying at his bedside and says, 'I need you so much.' Not only is she going through this, but she doesn't have her rock and best friend to lean on," [...] stated Havins. [...] "It's a lonely place to be. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and almost makes the move to connect â€” but then he doesn't." ...|$|E

The end has come. Suddenly he rallies slightly.|$|E

"He is in a torpor, at present," [...] she said; [...] "and may so lie for two {{or three}} days; but so long as there is no fever he will, I hope, know you when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> There is nought to do but to keep wet cloths round his head, and to put on a fresh {{poultice}} over the wound, every hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{friend is}} a man of {{somewhat}} peculiar temperament," [...] he said quietly. [...] "If he finds himself at home in a comfortable room when he comes to his senses, I am quite sure that he will {{have a better chance of}} recovery. He cannot possibly be made comfortable here, and he will feel the shock of what has happened all the more if he finds himself still in the neighbourhood when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> If there is any change in his condition, we can easily stop somewhere on the way." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{is thought}} better that his old {{housekeeper}} should give him Lady Dedlock's letter, {{the contents of}} which no one knows or can surmise. She opens it for him and puts it out for his perusal. Having read it twice by a great effort, he turns it down so that it shall not be seen and lies moaning. He passes {{into a kind of}} relapse or into a swoon, and it is an hour before <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> reclining on his faithful and attached old servant's arm. The doctors know that he is best with her, and when not actively engaged about him, stand aloof.|$|E
6000|$|When the {{sun shines}} hot in August, he finds you lying under the alders, with the lake breeze in your face, and <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> very wide and says: [...] "Tsic a dee-e-e?

[...] And when the rain pours down, and the woods are drenched, and camp life seems beastly altogether, he appears {{suddenly}} with greeting cheery as the sunshine. [...] "Tsic a de-e-e-e? Don't you remember yesterday? It rains, to be sure, but the insects are plenty, and to-morrow the sun will shine." [...] His cheerfulness is contagious. Your thoughts are better than before he came.|$|E

I am only a poor man, and must go to Sambir to greet Lakamba when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> I must bow before Abdulla who has strength--even more strength than you. Now if you remain here, you shall easily behold the man who boasted to Abdulla {{that he had been}} your friend, even while he prepared to fight those who called you protector. Yes, he plotted with Abdulla for that cursed flag. Lakamba was blind then, and I was deceived. But you, Tuan! Remember, he deceived you more. Of that he boasted before all men." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Had Sir Walter {{been strong}} and well," [...] he said, [...] "such a clip as {{this would not}} have knocked him from his feet, {{but he would have}} {{answered}} it with a blow such as I have often seen him give in battle; but he was but barely recovering and was as weak as a girl. He is unconscious from loss of blood and weakness. I warrant me that when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and hears that the lady Edith has risen from her bed and came to send me to his rescue, joy will soon bring the blood into his cheeks again. Do one of you run to the hut and see if they have any cordial waters; since the plague has been raging there are few houses but have laid in a provision in case the disease should seize them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] {{the surgeon}} repeated. [...] "Can't you see he is breathing, {{and did you}} not hear him groan when I {{examined}} his side? He {{is a long way}} from being a dead man yet. Some of his ribs are broken, and he has had a very nasty blow; but I do not think there is any cause for anxiety about him. Pour a little wine down his throat, and sprinkle his face with water. Raise his head and put a coat under it, and when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and begins to recover, don't let him move. Then you can cut up the side of his jacket and down the sleeve, so as to get it off that side altogether. Cut his shirt open, and bathe the wound with some water and bit of rag of any sort; it is not likely to bleed much. When it has stopped bleeding put a pad of linen upon it, and keep it wet. When we can spare time we will bandage it properly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the man {{lets go of}} the dog. He shuts his eyes, {{and opens}} his mouth, and lies very still. And the dog begins once more to breathe.

And the man begins to become alive. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and {{he looks at me}} like a {{mountain}} lion. And his mouth makes a noise like a mountain lion. And I am afraid of him like I am afraid of the dog. What am I to do? I have forgotten the axe. I tell you what I do. I kick the man once again under the ear. Then I take my belt, and my bandana handkerchief, and I tie him. I tie his hands. I tie his legs, too. And all the time I am saying 'No,' to the dog, and that he must leave the man alone. And the dog looks. He knows I am his friend and am tying the man. And he does not bite me, though I am very much afraid. The dog is a terrible dog. Do I not know? Have I not seen him take a strong man out of the saddle?--a man that is like a mountain lion? ...|$|E

60|$|It may {{be worth}} while to examine how {{darkness}} can operate {{in such a manner}} as to cause pain. It is observable, that still as we recede from the light, nature has so contrived it, that the pupil is enlarged by the retiring of the iris, in proportion to our recess. Now, instead of declining from it but a little, suppose that we withdraw entirely from the light; it is reasonable to think that the contraction of the radial fibres of the iris is proportionally greater; and that this part may by great darkness come to be so contracted, as to strain the nerves that compose it beyond their natural tone; and by this means to produce a painful sensation. Such a tension it seems there certainly is, whilst we are involved in darkness; for in such a state, whilst the eye remains open, there is a continual nisus to receive light; this is manifest from the flashes and luminous appearances which often seem in these circumstances to play before it; and which can be nothing but the effect of spasms, produced by its own efforts in pursuit of its object: several other strong impulses will produce the idea of light in the eye, besides the substance of light itself, as we experience on many occasions. Some, who allow darkness to be a cause of the sublime, would infer, from the dilatation of the pupil, that a relaxation may be productive of the sublime as well as a convulsion: but they do not, I believe, consider, that although the circular ring of the iris be in some sense a sphincter, which may possibly be dilated by a simple relaxation, yet in one respect it differs from most of the other sphincters of the body, that it is furnished with antagonist muscles, which are the radial fibres of the iris: no sooner does the circular muscle begin to relax, than these fibres, wanting their counterpoise, are forcibly drawn back, and open the pupil to a considerable wideness. But though we were not apprised of this, I believe any one will find, if <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and makes an effort to see in a dark place, that a very perceivable pain ensues. And I have heard some ladies remark, that after having worked a long time upon a ground of black, their eyes were so pained and weakened, they could hardly see. It may perhaps be objected to this theory of the mechanical effect of darkness, that the ill effects of darkness or blackness seem rather mental than corporeal: and I own it is true that they do so; and so do all those that depend on the affections of the finer parts of our system. The ill effects of bad weather appear often no otherwise than in a melancholy and dejection of spirits; though without doubt, in this case, the bodily organs suffer first, and the mind through these organs.|$|E
