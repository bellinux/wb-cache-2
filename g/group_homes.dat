5|$|St. John's Orphanage, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Goulburn Boys Orphanage, is a decommissioned orphanage located on Mundy Street in Goulburn, a town located in New South Wales, Australia. The architect of the building is EC Manfred. The foundation stone was laid and blessed on 17 March 1912 by Bishop John Gallagher of Goulburn, who also blessed the building during its opening ceremony in late 1913. It is two storeys high, and several extensions were added to the building throughout its early history. The orphanage amalgamated with St. Joseph's Orphanage for girls in 1976, and the remaining orphans were placed into <b>group</b> <b>homes.</b> As a result, the orphanage was closed in 1978 and rented out to the Youth With A Mission Base until they left in 1994. Since then, the orphanage has remained abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Living in a <b>group</b> <b>home</b> is {{not time}} limited; however, the main {{objective}} of the residents is to leave to begin an independent life. I explore a <b>group</b> <b>home</b> as a temporary structure between an institution and a community through individuals', communal and social components. The theoretical part provides {{a detailed description of}} a <b>group</b> <b>home,</b> its functioning and the circumstances in which it was established. It connects the functioning of the <b>group</b> <b>home</b> and its services with a wider social context. The empirical part of the thesis involves a case study examining the way of life in the <b>group</b> <b>home,</b> how one of the residents perceives the transition aspect of the <b>group</b> <b>home,</b> and the factors that have contributed {{to the creation of the}} <b>group</b> <b>home</b> as a temporary residence structure...|$|R

5000|$|Allegations of {{physical}} and sexual abuse brought against members by clients of I'SOT's <b>Group</b> Home/Foster <b>Home</b> during the late 1980s prompted an investigation by State of California Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Division.

25|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Loren Mosher, most deinstitutionalisation in the USA {{took place}} after 1972, {{as a result}} of the availability of SSI and Social Security Disability, long after the antipsychotic drugs were used universally in state hospitals. This period marked the growth in community support funds and community development, including early <b>group</b> <b>homes,</b> the first community mental health apartment programs, drop-in and transitional employment, and sheltered workshops in the community which predated community forms of supportive housing and supported living.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as <b>group</b> <b>homes)</b> with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence {{of this type of}} support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the Texas State Schools. The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.|$|E

Shamrock lived in cars as a result before being placed in a foster home. He bounced around between several <b>group</b> <b>homes</b> before being placed in Bob Shamrock's Boys' Home at age 14, in Susanville, California where he turned his life around.

25|$|The {{plan was}} simple teach each patient {{how to cope}} with life outside and slowly reintegrate them back into society placing small groups of friends (2 to 6) {{together}} in houses in their former home area. Practical skills such as cooking, clothes washing, and shopping had to be learnt or re-learnt and life skills such as relationships and resolving conflict within the group taught. Some required skills in crossing roads or using buses, others had health problems that they needed to learn to manage. Small trial <b>group</b> <b>homes</b> were created within the hospital to allow each group of friends to learn to manage and nurses assisted patients to go shopping for food or clothes or to the cinema building confidence and skills.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{there were}} 408,425 {{children}} in foster care in the United States. 48% were in nonrelative foster homes, 26% were in relative foster homes, 9% in institutions, 6% in <b>group</b> <b>homes,</b> 5% on trial home visits (where the child returns home while under state supervision), 4% in preadoptive homes, 2% had run away, and 1% in supervised independent living. Of 254,114 who exited foster care in 2010, 51% were reunited with parents or caretakers, 21% were adopted, 11% were emancipated (as minors or by aging out), 8% went to live with another relative, 6% went to live with a guardian, and 3% had other outcomes. Of these children, the median length of time spent in foster care was 13.5 months. 13% were in care for less than 1 month, 33% for 1 to 11 months, 24% for 12 to 23 months, 12% for 24 to 35 months, 10% for 3 to 4 years, and 7% for 5 years or more.|$|E
25|$|Scabies {{is caused}} by {{infection}} with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites. Often, only between 10 and 15 mites are involved in an infection. Scabies is most often spread during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes) such as that which may occur during sex. Spread of disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet. Crowded living conditions, such as those found in child-care facilities, <b>group</b> <b>homes,</b> and prisons, {{increase the risk of}} spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher rates of disease. Crusted scabies is a more severe form of the disease. It typically only occurs in those with a poor immune system and people may have millions of mites, making them much more contagious. In these cases, spread of infection may occur during brief contact or by contaminated objects. The mite is very small and usually not directly visible. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Dianne M. Austin {{was born}} in Etobicoke, Toronto and later moved to Norland to raise a family. She is a veteran {{community}} organizer. In the 1980s, she led in a public campaign against school closures. The campaign was initially targeted against the Victoria County Board of Education's decision to close five village schools in favour of larger, consolidated units. Later, she joined with other groups across the province to form {{a group called the}} Save Our Schools coalition. She herself was elected as a school trustee to the Victoria County board in the 1988 municipal election and sought to reduce the power of unelected directors of education. She was re-elected in 1991 and 1994. In 1995, Austin became executive director of Big Brothers and Big Sisters in Victoria-Haliburton. She was elected as reeve of Somerville Township in the 1997 municipal election; by virtue of this position, she also served as a regional councillor for Victoria County. She opposed her community's amalgamation into Kawartha Lakes in 2000. Austin moved to Peterborough shortly before her term ended and was appointed as {{chief executive officer of the}} Peterborough and District Association for Community Living, a group that assists people with developmental disabilities. In 2001, she led a campaign to ensure low-income disabled people would receive subsidized bus passes. She also oversaw the building of new <b>group</b> <b>homes</b> to provide greater privacy and independence. She later moved to Brantford, where she served as executive director of the Brant United Way from 2007 to 2009 and subsequently became a regional manager for the ALS Society of Ontario. She was fifty-four years old during the 2010 election and focused on targeting unemployment. Her campaign included both Liberal and Conservative organizers, although she stressed that she was not representing any party ideology.|$|E

After 66 years in operation, the {{building}} closed in 1978. The remaining orphans were put into <b>group</b> <b>homes.</b> The Sisters of Mercy continued to care for these orphans until those homes closed in 1981. From 1979 to 1994, the building was leased to the Youth With A Mission Base, where people travelled from overseas to pursue discipleship training courses. The building has since been abandoned and left to deteriorate.
