Udanti Sitanadi Tiger Reserve efforts for pure breed buffaloes. Presently there is a female buffalo, a female child and 9 male buffaloes. To increase their number the rescue center has been created in approximately 25.00 hectares. Where <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> <b>buffalo</b> to increase its numbers but now there are more male buffaloes and there is urgent need of female buffalo to save their dynasty. Therefore a clone female buffalo is being prepared at Karnal, institute in Haryana. Which will be brought as soon as in Udanti Sitanadi Tiger Reserve to increase female buffaloes dynasty.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the estrus response, conception rate and plasma profile of progesterone, protein and cholesterol following use of different hormonal protocols in anestrus and repeat <b>breeding</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 20 true anestrus, 20 repeat breeders, and 10 normal cyclic buffaloes. Ten anestrus buffaloes each were treated with standard controlled internal drug releasing (CIDR) i/vg device and Ovsynch (GPG) protocols with fix timed artificial insemination (FTAI), and blood samples were obtained on day 0, 7, 9 / 10 (AI) of treatment and day 21 post-AI. Ten repeat <b>breeding</b> <b>buffaloes</b> with mature mid-cycle palpable corpus luteum (CL) were treated with i/m injection of 25 mg prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) with FTAI twice at 72 and 96 h later, whereas other ten repeat <b>breeding</b> <b>buffaloes</b> in standing estrus were inseminated with simultaneous i/m injection of buserelin acetate-gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) 20 μg. 10 buffaloes exhibiting first estrus within 90 days postpartum and inseminated without any treatment served as normal cyclic control. Blood samples were obtained on day of PG injection, day of AI and day 21 post-AI for estimation of plasma progesterone, protein, and cholesterol.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the breeding phenology and breeding output {{in relation to}} <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> status in the polygamous Rock Sparrow (Petronia petronia). The proportion of polygamous males was around 0. 38 though it varied over the study periods. We selected 169 clutches of which the pair’s breeding status was known. Within these clutches, we compared the <b>breeding</b> biology of <b>females</b> that mate monogamously, <b>females</b> that started <b>breeding</b> early with a polygamous male (pri-mary <b>females)</b> and late <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> that chose an already mated male (sec-ondary females). Secondary females produced significantly fewer fledglings than monogamous females and <b>females</b> who started <b>breeding</b> early in a polygamous system. Our results showed that primary females and females mated with a monogamous male were heavier than secondary females. No age effect was detected.

40|$|Grooming is {{the most}} common form of affiliative {{behavior}} in primates that apart from hygienic and hedonistic benefits offers important social benefits for the performing individuals. This study examined grooming behavior in a cooperatively breeding primate species, characterized by single <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> per group, polyandrous matings, dizygotic twinning, delayed offspring dispersal, and intensive helping behavior. In this system, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> profit from the presence of helpers but also helpers profit from staying in a group and assisting in infant care due to the accumulation of direct and indirect fitness benefits. We examined grooming relationships of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with three classes of partners (breeding males, potentially breeding males, (sub) adult non-breeding offspring) during three reproductive phases (post-partum ovarian inactivity, ovarian activity, pregnancy) in two groups of wild moustached tamarins (Saguinus mystax). We investigated whether grooming can be used to regulate group size by either ‘‘pay-for-help’’ or ‘‘pay-to-stay’’ mechanisms. Grooming of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males and nonbreeding offspring was more intense and more balanced than with potentially breeding males, and most grooming occurred during the breeding females’ pregnancies. Grooming was skewed toward more investment by the <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males during the phases of ovarian activity, and with potentially breeding males during pregnancies. Our results suggest that grooming might be a mechanism used by female moustached tamarins to induce mate association with the breeding male, and to induce certain individuals to stay in the group and help with infant care...|$|R
40|$|Repeat <b>breeding</b> in <b>buffaloes</b> was {{evaluated}} {{in terms of}} incidence, risk factors and diagnosis. The incidence of repeat breeding is low in buffaloes however in different studies the incidence varied from 0. 70 % to 30 %. Because of seasonal suppression of fertility repeat <b>breeding</b> in <b>buffaloes</b> {{should be limited to}} the breeding season. Spring and winter calving, first parity, peri-parturient disease and lactation are significant risk factors for repeat <b>breeding</b> in <b>buffaloes.</b> The etiologies of repeat <b>breeding</b> in <b>buffaloes</b> can be failure of fertilization and early embryonic deaths. Only a few of causes of failure of fertilization have been identified in buffaloes. Ovulatory disturbances and ovarian cysts are uncommon in buffaloes and cysts have poor clinical manifestation. Endometritis is the common female cause of fertilization failures in buffaloes whereas poor semen quality and improper insemination are the bull side factors for fertilization failures. Early embryonic deaths are common in buffaloes mated/inseminated during the end of the breeding season due to a low luteal progesterone however embryonic deaths occur late (< 25 days) in buffaloes. Diagnostic approaches for repeat breeding include vaginoscopic and transrectal examination and uterine cytology for genital health. More precise evaluations of the ovarian and uterine function can be obtained by ultrasonographic and hysteroscopic examinations performed sequentially however, precise diagnosis of the cause of repeat breeding seems difficult...|$|R

40|$|Comparison {{was made}} {{between the number of}} placental scars and the number of young born, in 96 females which {{previously}} had pro-duced one, two or three litters. Placental scars were counted at autopsy on uteri in fresh state as well as after fixation and bleaching. Bleach-ing of uteri does not improve the legibility of scars. Scars remain visible on uterus for at least 9 months. In <b>females</b> <b>breeding</b> once or twice the number of scars exceeds the actual number of young born; in <b>females</b> <b>breeding</b> three times the cumulative number of young exeeds scars count thus resulting secondarily in approximation of the mean number of scars and young born. Up to the 10 th day of pregnancy it is possible to determine if the female bred previously. Value of the correlation coefficient between the number of scars and young born decreases as the number of young born increases. In general counting the placental scars provides a reliable method of estimating the number of young born...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{polygyny}} incurs {{costs of}} having to share <b>breeding</b> resources for <b>female</b> breeders. When <b>breeding</b> with a relative, however, such costs may be lessened by indirect fitness benefits through kin selection, while benefits from mutualistic behaviour, such as communal defence, may increase. If so, females should be less resistant to sharing a territory with a related female than with a non-related one. We investigated whether kin selection may lower the threshold of breeding polygynously, predicting a closer relatedness between polygynous <b>females</b> <b>breeding</b> on the same territory than between <b>females</b> <b>breeding</b> on different territories. Northern lapwings, Vanellus vanellus, are suitable for testing this hypothesis as they are commonly polygynous, both sexes take part in nest defence, and the efficiency of nest defence increases {{with the number of}} defenders. Using an index of relatedness derived from DNA fingerprinting, we found that female lapwings that shared polygynous dyads were on average twice as closely related as were random females. Furthermore, relatedness did not correlate with distance between breeders, indicating that our findings cannot be explained by natal philopatry alone. Our results suggest that the polygyny threshold in lapwings may be lowered by inclusive fitness advantages of kin selection...|$|R

50|$|Very few {{hornbills}} {{are held}} in captivity, and few of them breed well. Females at the nests are extremely easy to capture, and birds caught in the wild are mostly <b>female.</b> <b>Breeding</b> them in captivity has been notoriously difficult, with {{fewer than a dozen}} successful attempts.

40|$|Populations {{with small}} {{effective}} sizes {{are at risk}} for inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential. Variance in reproductive success is one of several factors reducing effective population size (Ne) below the actual population size (N). Here, we investigate the effects of polygynous (skewed) mating and variation in <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> success on the effective size of a small population of the Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus), a ground nesting bird with a lek mating system. During a two-year field study, we recorded attendance of marked birds at leks, male mating success, the reproductive success of radio-tagged females, and annual survival. We developed simulations to estimate the distribution of male reproductive success. Using these data, we estimated population size (N^) and effective population size Ne for the study population. We also simulated the effects of population size, skewed vs. random mating, and <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> failure on Ne. In our study population, the standardized variance in seasonal reproductive success was almost as high in females as in males, primarily due to a high rate of nest failure (73 %). Estimated Ne (42) was 19 % of N^ in our population, below the level at which inbreeding depression is observed in captive breeding studies. A high hatching failure rate (28 %) was also consistent with ongoing inbreeding depression. In the simulations, Ne was reduced by skewed male mating success, especially at larger population sizes, and by <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> failure. Extrapolation of our results suggests that six of the seven extant populations of this species may have effective sizes low enough to induce inbreeding depression and hence that translocations may be needed to supplement genetic diversity...|$|R
