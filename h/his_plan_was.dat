5|$|Goebbels, however, wanted more, {{and he saw}} in Wessel's {{shooting}} {{the possibility of a}} propaganda bonanza. The beginning of <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, but he could not get the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested Hindenburg to relent.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots from the rear. <b>His</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able {{to attack the}} Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February, having fought three {{successful}} {{actions in}} three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert, Montmirail and Château-Thierry, Napoleon was pursuing the defeated enemy. After his consecutive defeats, Field-marshal Blücher decided to disengage from Napoleon and move a significant force against the isolated French Army Corps of Marshal Marmont, at Étoges. Blücher knew that Marmont's Corps was weak and <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon's main force.|$|E

5|$|At 08:30 on {{the morning}} of 18 December, a small boat sailed from Anse la Barque with a message {{offering}} the British a temporary truce. Simultaneously the British ship of the line HMS Sceptre arrived from Fort Royal on Martinique under the command of Captain Samuel James Ballard, who immediately assumed command of the diverse squadron assembled {{at the entrance to the}} bay. Ballard dismissed the French negotiators and ordered an immediate attack on the anchored frigates. <b>His</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> simple: Blonde and Thetis would enter the harbour and engage the flûtes directly, while Sceptre and Freija would engage the gun batteries to prevent them targeting the small brigs bringing up the rear. The brigs would be towing boats full of sailors and Royal Marines, who would storm the French ships and gun positions as they were engaged with the larger warships.|$|E
5|$|At his new forward {{command post}} at Ben Cat, General Dũng {{prepared}} {{plans for the}} final battle. He encircled Saigon with four North Vietnamese corps and the hastily assembled 232nd Tactical Force, a total of 19 divisions plus supporting artillery and armored units, approximately 130,000 men. <b>His</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to avoid intensive street fighting within the city itself by first tying down outlying South Vietnamese forces in their defensive positions and then launching five spearheads through them into the city, each of which had a specific target: the Independence Palace, the Joint General Staff headquarters, the national Police headquarters, Tan Son Nhut Air Base, and the Special Capital Zone headquarters. The attacks on the periphery began on 26 April and the main attack on the city center began the following day.|$|E
5|$|Morgan did {{not stay}} long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache, {{a small island}} he used as a {{rendezvous}} point. <b>His</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, Oxford, which {{had been sent to}} Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who made it his flagship. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. A spark in the ship's powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew. Morgan and the captains seated {{on one side of the}} table were blown into the water and survived; the four captains on the other side of the table were all killed.|$|E

While <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> often too expensive to be completed, they {{formed the basis of}} more practical plans, and the affordable parts of <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> <b>were</b> followed for several decades, although in Curitiba the so-called Agache <b>Plan</b> <b>was</b> retired and then superseded by later urban planning efforts beginning in the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|On {{the desert}} flank, ASquadron 2RTR's patrol toward Sidi Azeiz was being {{monitored}} by Panzer Regiment5, but the Germans misidentified the light cruiser tanks as heavily armoured Matilda infantry tanks, {{and reported that}} an attack was not possible. Herff—believing the British had two divisions operating in the area—had grown uneasy. ASquadron's patrol was interpreted {{as an attempt to}} concentrate south of Sidi Azeiz, in preparation for a thrust north the next day; such a move threatened to sweep aside Herff's force and completely unhinge the German front in the Sollum–Bardia area. In response, Herff broke contact with the British; <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to join up with Cramer's Panzer Regiment8 to mount a concentrated counter-attack the following morning.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine government's alarm {{continued}} under de Oca's successor, Estanislao Zeballos. In June 1908, Zeballos {{presented a}} plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: {{if they did not}} comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing large sums of money to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.|$|E
5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east bank that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. <b>His</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to stake a pre-emption claim at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E

5|$|An army {{commanded}} by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The allies decided to divide their forces into two armies: a multinational force {{that included a}} single Brazilian division, and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. Against the wishes of Honório Hermeto, Caxias chose Manuel Marques de Sousa (later Count of Porto Alegre) to lead the former force. Caxias met and befriended Marques de Sousa, who had served under his command in the War of the Ragamuffins, during his trip to Rio Grande do Sul in 1839. The Brazilian division, led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, the allies defeated an army led by Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom, thus ending the war. Caxias spent 17 January aboard the frigate Dom Afonso alongside John Pascoe Grenfell, taking stock of the port area of Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, selecting {{the best place to}} launch an amphibious attack. <b>His</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> aborted once the news of the victory at Caseros arrived. As a reward {{for his role in the}} victory, Caxias was promoted to lieutenant general on 3 March, and raised to marquis on 26 June.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's first Minister of Economy was the progressivist José Luis Machinea, who was {{proposed}} by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem {{had left a}} deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes, and a reduction of the highest retirement pensions. The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk, and made Argentina's access to international credit more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as {{the new president of}} the Central Bank of Argentina. However, Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later. The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister of Economy. During the election camapain, De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry, but with the ongoing crisis {{he did not want to}} risk problems caused by a temporary lack of minister. López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan, with reduction to the health and education budgets. <b>His</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso, so De la Rúa declined it. Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days.|$|E
5|$|Simpson was {{determined}} {{to make an impact}} in the Tour de France; in his eighth year as a professional cyclist, he hoped for larger appearance fees in post-Tour criteriums to help secure his financial future after retirement. <b>His</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to finish in the top three, or to wear the yellow jersey {{at some point in the}} race. He targeted three key stages, one of which was the thirteenth, over Mont Ventoux, and planned to ride conservatively until the race reached the mountains. In the prologue, Simpson finished thirteenth. After the first week he was in sixth place overall, leading the favourites. As the race crossed the Alps, Simpson fell ill, across the Col du Galibier, with diarrhoea and stomach pains. Unable to eat, he finished stage ten in 16th place and dropped to seventh overall as his rivals passed him. Teammate Vin Denson advised Simpson to limit his losses and accept what he had. He placed in 39th position on stage 11 and 7th on 12. In Marseille, on the evening before stage thirteen, Simpson's manager, Daniel Dousset, pressured him for good results. Plaud begged Simpson to quit the race.|$|E
