Two days later, he took part in another mission during which his squadron mates claimed four victories, bringing VMF-214's tally of confirmed aerial victories to 76.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, {{and asked if he}} could protect such a large <b>force</b> <b>of</b> men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm more than a few deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial <b>force</b> <b>of</b> a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Lechaeum (391 BC) was an Athenian {{victory in}} the Corinthian War. In the battle, the Athenian general Iphicrates took {{advantage}} of the fact that a Spartan hoplite regiment operating near Corinth was moving in the open without the protection of any missile throwing troops. He decided to ambush it with his <b>force</b> <b>of</b> javelin throwers, or peltasts. By launching repeated hit-and-run attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half. This marked one of the first occasions in Greek military history on which a <b>force</b> <b>of</b> peltasts had defeated a <b>force</b> <b>of</b> hoplites (heavy infantry).|$|E

5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The <b>force</b> <b>of</b> ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E

5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the drop. The <b>force</b> <b>of</b> ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E
