5|$|Pelat {{had been}} a friend of François Mitterrand, then President of France, and at the centre of a scandal {{involving}} French Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy. As an investigative judge, Jean-Pierre could not dismiss any information brought to his attention pertaining to the case, especially if it might {{have led to a}} scandal similar to the one implicating an illegal Masonic lodge named Propaganda Due in the 1982 Banco Ambrosiano bank failure in Italy, Jean-Pierre ordered a search of Plantard's home. The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted under oath that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion. Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time. Nothing more was <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> until he died in Paris on 3 February 2000.|$|E
25|$|His {{success with}} {{assistant}} manager Tom Chadney {{by his side}} {{attracted the attention of}} much larger clubs, and Eriksson was appointed manager of IFK Göteborg on 1 January 1979. The move was such a surprise that many of the players had never even <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|A highly {{positive}} {{review was}} purportedly {{written by a}} critic named David Manning, who was credited to The Ridgefield Press, a small Connecticut weekly news publication. During an investigation into Manning's quotes, Newsweek reporter John Horn discovered that the newspaper had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The story emerged at {{around the same time}} as an announcement that Sony had used employees posing as moviegoers in television commercials to praise the film. These occurrences, in tandem, raised questions and controversy about ethics in movie marketing practices.|$|E

25|$|UKIP {{has several}} {{high-profile}} backers. In March 2009, the Conservative Party's biggest-ever donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated £100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron's stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon. He was then {{expelled from the}} Conservatives and in 2011 appointed treasurer of UKIP. In October 2014, Arron Banks, who previously gave £25,000 to the Conservatives, increased his UKIP donation from £100,000 to £1 million after Hague {{said he had never}} <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The multi-millionaire Paul Sykes has helped finance the party, donating over £1 million to their 2014 campaign at the European Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people who}} <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{traveled}} to San Giovanni Rotondo {{in the south}} of Italy to meet him and confess to him, ask for help, or have their curiosity satisfied. Padre Pio's mother died at the village around the convent in 1928. Later, in 1938, Padre Pio had his old father Grazio living with him in the village of San Giovanni Rotondo. His brother Michele also moved into the village with their father. Padre Pio's father lived in a little house outside the convent, until his death in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Following these interviews, {{radio host}} Alex Jones interviewed Ventura on January 8 {{regarding}} what happened. During the interview, Ventura denied the rumors, saying he never met Kyle nor had he <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> before. Ventura argued {{that had the}} confrontation occurred, Kyle would be admitting to assault and that the incident would have become known across the Navy SEAL community, as Ventura {{had been a member}} of the UDT/SEALs community. Ventura also stated that the bar, known as McP's, was owned by a former Navy SEAL who was his cadre instructor when in the military, and that he would not misbehave at the bar.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know nothing}} of him,' she sobbed, feeling for her pocket handkerchief. 'He left me when Maryann was a baby, went mining to America, and after about six months never wrote a line nor sent me a penny bit. I can't say whether he's alive or dead, the villain. All I've <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him's</b> to the bad--and I've heard nothing for years an' all, now.' She sobbed violently.|$|R

25|$|Stoddart's {{concern is}} for Sheila Grant, {{whom he met}} at a hunt ball in the country. Sheila was at the party, is still at the flat having just woken up and is feeling terrible after the high of the drugs. She {{is one of four}} daughters of a retired general and there is every sign that Sheila and her sisters are going wild, getting into a bad set where the cocaine flows freely. Stoddart lectures her about the cocaine and Poirot {{introduces}} himself. It is obvious that Sheila has <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and is nervous of him. Poirot compares drug-peddling to feeding on human flesh (in his mind, like the horses of Diomedes, who were fed on human flesh).|$|E
25|$|At {{the opening}} of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking {{directly}} to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart, and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet Mozart in person, during a salon at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart himself lacks the grace and charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.|$|E
25|$|In {{the chaos}} of the Fourth Crusade and the {{eventual}} fall of Constantinople in 1204, a number of individuals took advantage of the situation to proclaim themselves independent or lay claim to the vacant imperial throne. Mangaphas may have returned to Philadelphia before or {{after the fall of the}} city, and quickly re-established his dominant position there, founding an independent state in the area. After securing Philadelphia, he decided to take on Henry of Flanders, one of the Crusader chieftains and future Latin Emperor (r. 1206–1216), who was encamped at Adramyttium and who was attempting to crush the remaining Byzantine resistance in Anatolia. Although he managed to take Henry by surprise, his forces were no match for the Latin heavy cavalry and were crushed at the Battle of Adramyttium on 19 March 1205. Retreating back to Philadelphia, he remained there until his remaining territories were overrun by Theodore Laskaris of Nicaea in 1205. Nothing more is <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and it is presumed that he died in captivity in the Nicaean court.|$|E

25|$|During Griffin's junior season, the Oklahoma Christian {{basketball}} team was moved down to Class 2A from Class 3A. As {{he began his}} third season with the Saints, he was quickly developing as a player, as he led them to a third straight state championship. He scored 22 points, grabbed 9 rebounds, and recorded 6 blocks in the finals as Oklahoma Christian defeated Washington High School, 57–40. He was named the state tournament MVP, and the Saints finished the season 27–1, with Griffin averaging 21.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 4.9 assists. For his efforts, he was named The Oklahoman Player of the Year and to the Tulsa World Boys All-State First Team. His play {{attracted the attention of}} the new basketball head coach for Oklahoma, Jeff Capel, who first <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> through his brother, Taylor. That spring, Capel saw him play {{for the first time and}} was quickly impressed. Capel liked the fact that Griffin had not yet become a household name among recruiters and felt he was exactly the player he needed to rebuild the Oklahoma men's basketball program with. Griffin had been considering Duke, Kansas, North Carolina and Texas, but his brother eventually sold him on joining Oklahoma when he raved about the direction of the Sooners and the chance to play together again for his home state.|$|E
500|$|While {{academics}} {{have both}} praised and criticized Tyler, the general American public has little awareness {{of him at}} all. Several writers have portrayed Tyler as among the nation's most obscure presidents. As Seager remarked: [...] "His countrymen generally remember him, if they have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> at all, as the rhyming end of a catchy campaign slogan." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1973, Maryland All-American guard Paul Vellano, then playing under Claiborne, said of {{the past}} coaches' difficulties: [...] "A lot of the kids said that Ward was a good coach {{but that he had}} a lot of bad apples. Lester was a high school coach and nobody had ever <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> I can't {{understand}} it. We had nine freshman who were All-Americans my first year here under Lester. Maybe if they had let him stay he could have done the job.|$|E

60|$|I took Peggotty to {{the coach}} office and saw her off. She cried at parting, and confided her brother to my {{friendship}} as Ham had done. We had <b>heard</b> nothing <b>of</b> <b>him</b> since he went away, that sunny afternoon.|$|R
500|$|... "Biko" [...] had an {{enormous}} political impact. It has been credited with creating a [...] "political awakening" [...] {{both in terms of}} awareness of the brutalities of apartheid, and of Steve Biko as a person. It greatly raised Biko's profile, making his name known to millions of people who had not previously <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and came to symbolise Biko in the popular imagination. Byerly writes that it was an example of the [...] "right song written at the right time by the right person"; it was released in circumstances of social tension that contributed to its popularity and influence. It triggered a rise in enthusiasm for fighting against apartheid internationally, and has been described as [...] "arguably the most significant non-South African anti-apartheid protest song".|$|E
500|$|The {{stress and}} {{uncertainty}} of captivity took {{their toll on}} Anastasia {{as well as her}} family. [...] "Goodby [...] ", she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. [...] "Don't forget us." [...] At Tobolsk, she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor, filled with spelling mistakes, about [...] "Evelyn Hope", a poem by Robert Browning about a young girl: [...] "When she died she was only sixteen years old ... Ther(e) was a man who loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. And she <b>he(a)rd</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> also. He never could tell her that he loved her, and now she was dead.

500|$|A myth {{has arisen}} that Bryan was an unknown prior to 1896. This {{was not the}} case; Bryan was well known as an orator on the tariff and silver questions. Albert Shaw, editor of The Review of Reviews, stated that after Bryan's nomination, many easterners professed not to have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> but: [...] "If, indeed, they had not heard of Mr. Bryan before, they had failed to follow closely the course of American {{politics}} {{in the past eight}} years. As a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee through two Congresses, Mr. Bryan was by all odds the ablest and strongest orator on the Democratic side of the House. His subsequent canvass [...] for the United States senatorship in Nebraska was noteworthy and conspicuous on many accounts." ...|$|E

500|$|Ibn Ali {{remained}} an obscure figure until his only released recording, The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan, which was recorded on December 4 and 7, 1964, and released six months later. The trio contained Roach and bassist Art Davis, and the album consisted of seven tracks, all written by Ibn Ali. The recording opportunity was initiated by Roach, who used his influence {{with the owner}} of Atlantic Records to secure the session for Ibn Ali. Alan Sukoenig, in his liner notes to the album, wrote [...] "For a while it appeared that it was Hasaan Ibn Ali's destiny to be known – {{to those who had}} <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> at all – as the extraordinary jazz pianist from Philadelphia who had never made a record." [...] After the album, Ibn Ali returned to obscurity.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{originally}} {{drew up a}} list of ten British celebrities {{they wanted}} to appear in the episode. The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams (a fan of the show) was included in a draft of the script acting as a tour guide and showing some of his relatives around London. Williams had to reject the part due to other engagements. The script also included a role for a musician; the staff had hoped to get David Bowie or Morrissey for the part but nothing came together. David and Victoria Beckham were also originally sought to guest star in the episode, and would be seen bickering on the street. The idea was dropped after Blair agreed to guest star, and it was deemed that they were not famous enough in the United States and so were not approached. Jean commented [...] "We thought about it, we didn't ask. I've <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> because my daughter plays soccer." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Antigua, Ambrose practised intensely, regained {{his place in the}} Leeward Islands team and, in the absence of leading bowlers Winston Benjamin and Eldine Baptiste with the West Indies team, became the main attacking bowler in the side. He was no-balled for {{throwing}} in the first match, which Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later attributed to confusion caused by his attribute of flicking his wrist prior to releasing the ball to impart extra pace, and there were no subsequent doubts about the legality of his bowling action. Retaining his place when the international bowlers returned, he took 35 wickets—including 12 in a match against Guyana, of which nine were bowled—in five matches in the competition. Wisden's report on the West Indian season said his performance was [...] "dominant", although few had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> previously. Identifying his yorker as his most effective delivery, it noted that he [...] "never lost his pace, his accuracy, or his thirst for wickets".|$|E
60|$|Journeying {{on without}} further adventure, {{they came to}} Nancy, and were there kindly {{received}} by the duke, who was not at that time upon good terms with Philip of France, and was therefore well disposed toward the English.
