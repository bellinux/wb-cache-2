40|$|Focus group {{research}} conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health suggested that the desire of teenagers to gain {{control over their lives}} would make them responsive to a counteradvertising strategy aimed at exposing the predatory marketing techniques of the tobacco industry. On the basis of this strategy, the office developed <b>draft</b> <b>print</b> advertisements and a rough TV commercial featuring such theme lines as "You get an image. They get an addict. " In those ads, "they" referred to cigarette companies. Subsequent testing of the campaign materials, however, indicated that the subtle, sophisticated execution of this concept of manipulation by the industry did not communicate clearly and effectively to an audience of young teens. In fact, 38 percent of those who viewed the rough TV spot believed that the main message promoted smoking. These negative test findings underscore the critical need for ongoing audience research throughout the creative process to ensure that campaign planners stay "in tune" with their consumers...|$|E

The campus was expanded with training buildings to house livestock, and another for a laundry. Later a building was added for teaching auto mechanics and repair. A central steam plant was added, as were additional dormitories. From 1916-1918, Inman E. Page was president.|$|R

50|$|The {{blueline}} print {{process was}} largely abandoned within the architectural/engineering community around the early 2000s.

The cost of blueline production materials and equipment, the fact that the prints themselves faded in sunlight, and the need to use the pungent chemical ammonia as a developer speeded up its replacement.|$|R

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} <b>draft</b> <b>printed</b> on January 28, 2007. Not for circulation. Abstract. Party activists wish to (i) advocate {{the best policy}} and yet (ii) unify be-hind a common party line. An activist’s understanding of his environment {{is based on the}} speeches of party leaders. A leader’s influence, measured by the weight placed on her speech, increases with her judgement on policy (her sense of direc-tion) and her ability to convey her ideas (her clarity of communication). A leader with perfect clarity of communication enjoys greater influence than one with a per-fect sense of direction. Activists can choose how much attention to pay to leaders. A necessary condition for a leader to monopolize the agenda is that she is the most coherent communicator. Sometimes leaders attract more attention by obfuscating their messages. A concern for party unity mitigates this incentive; when activists emphasize following the party line, they learn more about their environment. Political scientists and commentators agree that good leadership is important, indeed fundamental, to the successful performance of organizations. But what is leadership? When is leadership good? When is it successful? Which qualities contribute to good an...|$|R

50|$|The Ortelius oval {{projection}} is a {{map projection}} used for world maps {{largely in the}} late 16th and early 17th century. It is neither conformal nor equal-area but instead offers a compromise presentation. It is similar in structure to a pseudocylindrical projection but does not qualify as one because the meridians are not equally spaced along the parallels. The projection's first known use was by Battista Agnese (flourished 1535-1564) around 1540, although whether the construction method was truly identical to Ortelius's or not is unclear because of crude <b>drafting</b> and <b>printing.</b> The front hemisphere is identical to Petrus Apianus's 1524 globular projection.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is that of {{contributing}} to improve {{the knowledge of the}} cultural history of Sardinia, with a particular focus on book circulation during a time of great intellectual, political and social change, such {{as the end of the}} XV and VI Century. Through the analysis of notary deeds, and particularly post mortem inventories, the first part of the study has reconstructed the structure and content of sixty-two private libraries, ten belonging to Church representatives, seven to lawyers, four to doctors or other categories related to public health, ten to women, seven to aricstocratic families and seven to other categories. The total number of volumes in this census exceeds 5000 units, while the different authors come up to almost 1260. In a number of cases the analysis conducted has allowed the investigator to outline brief biographical profiles, reconstructing family and professional relations as well as to bring to light the cultural context whereby Sardinian society evolved in those years. The second part of the dissertation has been devoted to the editorial production of the city of Cagliari between 1566 and 1600, with an emphasis on technical aspects of the typographic processes as well as on the circulation of the editions produced. Starting from 190 items and from archival sources, 86 editions have been described, 68 of which of secure identification and 18 for which ownership is probable or possible, two loose papers, which still today represents the only prove of <b>draft</b> <b>printing...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Pater {{was much}} admired for his prose style, which he strove to make worthy of his {{aesthetic}} ideals, taking great pains and fastidiously correcting his work. He kept {{on his desk}} little squares of paper, each with its ideas, and shuffled them about attempting to form a sequence and pattern. [...] "I have known writers of every degree, but never one to whom the act of composition was such a travail and an agony {{as it was to}} Pater," [...] wrote Edmund Gosse, who also described Pater's method of composition: [...] "So conscious was he of the modifications and additions which would supervene that he always wrote on ruled paper, leaving each alternate line blank." [...] He would then make a fair copy and repeat the process, sometimes paying to have <b>drafts</b> <b>printed,</b> to judge their effect. [...] "Unlike those who were caught by Flaubert's theory of the unique word and the only epithet," [...] wrote Osbert Burdett, [...] "Pater sought the sentence, and the sentence in relation to the paragraph, and the paragraph as a movement in the chapter. The numerous parentheses deliberately exchanged a quick flow of rhythm for pauses, for charming little eddies by the way." [...] At the height of his powers as a writer, Pater discussed his principles of composition in the 1888 essay 'Style'. A. C. Benson called Pater's style [...] "absolutely distinctive and entirely new", adding, however, that [...] "it appeals, perhaps, more to the craftsman than to the ordinary reader." [...] To G. K. Chesterton, Pater's prose, serene and contemplative in tone, suggested a [...] "vast attempt at impartiality." [...] Indeed, in its richness, depth, and acuity, in its sensuous rhythms, Pater's style was perfectly attuned to his philosophy of life.|$|R
