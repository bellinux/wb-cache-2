The effects of used starting <b>iridium</b> <b>compound</b> (Ir(AcAc) 3, Ir(CO) 12, H 2 IrCl 6 and (NH 4) IrCl 6), iridium dispersion and presence of sulfur were evaluated. The activities of prepared catalysts containing Ir {{were compared with}} activities of Mo and NiMo catalysts. The prepared catalysts were tested in model reactions of parallel hydrodesulfurization of thiophene and hydrodenitrogenation of pyridine. The reactions were carried out in gas phase at temperature 320 C and pressure 2 Mpa. The catalysts were tested either in sulfided or reduced form in a flow reactor with fixed bed. The products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography. Activity of catalysts was evaluated at least at three various W/F ratios. The obtained data were described by first-order kinetic equations. One equation described HDS of thiophene and two equations were used for HDN of pyridine. The rate constants were calculated by optimization of obtained primary data. These rate constants were used as indexes of activity and were also used for definition of HDN selectivity (SN) and HDN/HDS selectivity. The prepared catalysts were characterized by using of several techniques: mainly temperature- programmed raduction (TPR), BET surface area, hydrogen sorption (Ir dispersion) and chemical analyses. Selected samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. It was found, that the Ir/alumina catalyst prepared from Ir 4 (CO) 122 exhibited the highest activity from all monometallic catalysts. The Ir/alumina catalysts were much more active than conventional Mo and NiMo catalysts. Dispersion of Ir influenced more the C-N bond hydrogenolysis (second step in HDN) than hydrogenation of pyridine (initial step in HDN). The HDN activity of Ir catalysts decreased by sulfidation of reduced catalysts or by thiophene addition in the feed. The effect of Ir content, preparation method and possible presence of promotional effect between Ir and Mo were monitored when studying the mixed IrMo cytalysts. It was observed that Ir addition increased activity of Mo catalysts in both HDS and HDN. However, the synergistic effect was proved only in HDN while not in HDS. This effect was observed {{in the range of}} iridium content 0, 34 - 0, 53 %. The results of hydrogen sorption on reduced catalysts and TPR of sulfided catalysts confirmed an interaction between Ir and Mo. The higher activity of modified catalysts is obviously connected with their increased reducibility.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis is directed toward the efficient, enantioselective synthesis of chiral products that have useful functionality. This goal was pursued through catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation, a reaction class that selectively introduces one or two stereocenters into a molecule in an atom-efficient step. This reaction uses a small amount (often < 1 mol%) of a chiral catalyst to impart stereoselectivity to the product formed. Though catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation {{is not a new}} reaction type, there remain many substrate classes for which it is ineffective. The present thesis describes efforts to extend the reaction to some of these substrates classes. Some of the products synthesized in these studies may eventually find use as building blocks for the production of chiral pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, or flavouring or colouring agents. However, the primary and immediate aim of this thesis was to develop and demonstrate new catalysts that are rapid and effective in the asymmetric hydrogenation of a broad range of compounds. Paper I describes the design and construction of two new, related chiral <b>iridium</b> <b>compounds</b> that are catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation. They each contain an N,P-donating phosphinooxazoline ligand that is held together by a rigid bicyclic unit. One of these <b>iridium</b> <b>compounds</b> catalyzed the asymmetric hydrogenation of acyclic aryl imines, often with very good enantioselectivities. This is particularly notable because acyclic imines are difficult to reduce with useful enantioselectivity. The second catalyst was useful for the asymmetric hydrogenation of two aryl olefins. In Paper II, the class of catalysts introduced into Paper I is expanded to include many more related compounds, and these are also applied to the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral imines and olefins. By studying a range of related catalysts that differ in a single attribute, we were able to probe how different parts of the catalyst affect the yield and selectivity of the hydrogenation reactions. Whereas iridium catalysts had been applied to the asymmetric hydrogenation of imines and largely unfunctionalized olefins prior to this work (with varied degrees of success), they had not been used to reduce fluoroolefins. Their hydrogenation, which is discussed in Paper III, was complicated by concomitant defluorination to yield non-halogenated alkanes. To combat this problem, several iridium-based hydrogenation catalysts were applied to the reaction. Two catalysts stood out for their ability to produce chiral fluoroalkanes in good enantioselectivity while minimizing the defluorination reaction, and one of these bore a phosphinooxazoline ligand of the type described in Papers I and II. Enol phosphinates are another class of olefins that had not previously been subjected to iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. They do, however, constitute an attractive substrate class, because the product chiral alkyl phosphinates can be transformed into chiral alcohols or chiral phosphines with no erosion of enantiopurity. Iridium complexes of the phosphinooxazoline ligands described in Papers I and II were extremely effective catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of enol phosphinates. They produced alkyl phosphinates from di- and trisubstituted enol phosphinate, β-ketoester-derived enol phosphinates, and even purely alkyl-substituted enol phopshinates, in very high yields and enantioselectivities...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{reversal}} of regioselectivity was observed during the RhCb-nHbO catalyzed hydroboration/oxidation of 1 -octene. While 4 -octanol and 3 -octanol were the major products, {{small amounts of}} octane and octanones were also obtained. Our experiments with isomeric alkenes revealed that {{the ratio of the}} isomeric alcohols was independent of the starting isomeric alkene. Under identical experimental conditions a similar {{reversal of}} regioselectivity was also observed with allylbenzene, but not with styrene and 3, 3 -dimethyl- 1 -butene. A highly efficient isomerization catalyst (Morrill 2 ̆ 7 s catalyst) generated in situ by the addition of catalytic amounts of a hydroborating reagent into a solution of RhCl 3 -nH 20 in a suitable solvent like THF, {{has been found to be}} responsible for these novel results. Deuterium labeling experiments reveal very fast, reversible, addition-elimination steps, involving a rhodium-hydride species. It was found that ruthenium and <b>iridium</b> <b>compounds</b> also bring about a similar reversal of regioselectivity. Monitoring the isomerization of 1 -heptene reveals the stepwise movement of the double bond towards the interior of the alkyl chain, accompanied by cis-trans transformations. A rhodium dihydride species has been implicated for the formation of alkanes; while the formation of ketones is a consequence of alkene insertion into the Rh-B bond, followed by p-hydride elimination. Two very valuable methodologies emerge from this research work. The first being the capability of converting a terminal alkene into internal organoboranes, while the second involves a very economical and highly efficient method for the isomerization of compounds containing double bonds...|$|R
40|$|Both {{acquired}} and intrinsic {{drug resistance}} are established clinical problems {{in many areas}} of medicine. This is particularly evident with the growing resistance to platinum chemotherapy agents in cancer treatment programmes. New, alternative treatments for platinum-resistance patients are needed, with comparable potency, no platinum cross- resistance, better safety profiles and which target non-repairable areas of the cell, reducing acquired resistance. This thesis focuses on osmium- and iridium-based organometallic anticancer agents to fill this clinical need. Previous work has validated their potency, safety and activity in platinum-resistant cancers, however, their mechanism of action (MOA) was yet to be identified. Knowing the MOA of new compounds is essential for personalising and stratifying cancer treatment, allowing for better patient selection and prediction of treatment outcomes. Often identifying the biological target of a new therapeutic is not essential. Instead, quantifying the cellular response to that treatment, and identifying cell types which hold beneficial biological properties to optimise compound effects, is more effective. This thesis has applied the principles of systems biology to study the whole cell effect of osmium and <b>iridium</b> <b>compounds</b> in epithelial ovarian cancer. Cells were studied at the transcriptional, translational and structural level to investigate compound response, integrating a selection of these findings using novel statistical modelling. Results propose that these compounds induce oxidative stress in cancer cells, and subsequently damage DNA to exert antiproliferative effects at submicromolar concentrations. This is the first example of studying organometallic compounds using this combination of techniques, and is a promising work flow for future efforts in this area. ...|$|R
40|$|The structural, electronic, {{and optical}} {{properties}} {{of a series}} of organic pi-conjugated polymer, oligomer, or molecular materials of interest for applications in organic electronics are described. For this purpose, quantum-chemical techniques ranging from Density Functional Theory to Hartree-Fock ab initio and semiempirical methods are used to evaluate the charge-transport, charge-transfer, and electroluminescence properties of pi-conjugated organic materials. First, the effect of electronic polarization on the charge-transport parameters of organic semiconductors is discussed. A generalized methodology based on a basis set orthogonalization procedure is developed to determine reliable charge-transport characteristics. The charge-transport parameters of a number of organic semiconductors such as oligoacenes and derivatives are studied with this methodology. Then, triplet emitters, in particular iridium complexes, that achieve high efficiency electroluminescence in organic light-emitting diodes are discussed. The effects of ligand substitution and orientation on the luminescent properties of <b>iridium</b> <b>compounds</b> are investigated in order to develop structure-properties relationships. The emission properties of these complexes are found to be governed by an interplay between metal-to-ligand charge transfer excitations and ligand-centered and/or interligand excitations. The extent of mixing of these various excitations turns out to be highly dependent {{on the nature of the}} substituents. Design strategies to shift the emission color towards deep blue are proposed. Finally, several classes of materials acting as hosts for phosphorescent emitters are studied. It is shown that restricting the conjugation length leads to high energy gap host materials suitable for blue phosphorescent emitters. Ph. D.

40|$|Abstract: A robust cyclometalated iridium {{catalyst}} {{has been}} devel-oped for highly effective hydrogenation of imines. With very low catalyst loading (down to 0. 005 %), good to excellent yields {{have been achieved}} {{for a range of}} substrates in a short reaction time under mild conditions, providing an easy, efficient protocol for making amines. Key words: cyclometalated complexes, hydrogenation, imines, iridium, iridicycles Amines are important building blocks for the synthesis of numerous pharmaceutical and agrochemical substances. 1 Among the various methods of synthesising amines, in-cluding stoichiometric boron hydride and organocatalytic reduction of C=N double bonds, transition-metal-cata-lysed hydrogenation of imines {{is one of the most}} conve-nient and efficient. 2, 3 Although significant progress has been achieved in this area, highly efficient reduction of C=N double bonds is still challenging. Recently, our group 4 and other groups 5, 6 have explored a series of cyclo-metalated <b>iridium</b> <b>compounds,</b> some of which have been successfully applied to transfer hydrogenation of imines and reductive amination of ketones. More recently, we have found that these iridicycles allow for efficient hydro-genation of imines 4 f as well as N-heterocycles. 4 g Herein, we report a tailor-made, more robust iridicycle, which catalyses the hydrogenation of imines with hydrogen gas under low catalyst loading. We started with preparation of the cyclometalated iridium complexes. Using procedures reported previously, 4 – 6 two new cyclometalated iridium complexes were synthesised readily from tetralone and its derivative in two steps (Scheme 1). With the imino carbon being embedded in a ring, the resulting iridicycles C 1 and C 2 were expected to be more robust in comparison with those reported before. ...|$|R
