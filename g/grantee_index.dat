50|$|A grantor-grantee {{index is}} a general term for two lists of real {{property}} transfers maintained in alphabetical order of the last name of the parties transferring the property. One list is the grantor index, an alphabetic list of sellers (grantors). The other list is the <b>grantee</b> <b>index,</b> an alphabetic list of purchasers (grantees).|$|E

50|$|In {{municipalities}} with a {{large population}} and states that do not support tract indices, the Grantor/Grantee method can be time consuming and difficult altogether due to common names within the index. In these municipalities, a geographic index is often created to aid in title searching. In this system, each document is posted in both a Grantor and <b>Grantee</b> <b>index</b> {{in addition to being}} posted to indexes describing attributes of the property's location such as a lot number, subdivision name or Parcel Identification Number (PIN). With a functioning geographic index, a search can be done with a combination of a Grantor/Grantee, Legal Description or PIN search.|$|E
5000|$|A Grantor/Grantee {{title search}} {{attempts}} to locate records by searching the parties listed on a recorded instrument. One approach to conducting a full Grantor/Grantee title search starts by searching the grantor index in the County records and determining {{the name of}} the first recorded owner of title. This is usually the sovereign, which is the Federal Government or the Crown of the nation which owned a former colony now located within the United States. The search finds the grant from the sovereign to the first grantee. This is usually {{in the form of a}} patent. Then, the grantee's name is searched in the grantor index to find the deed by which it has subsequently conveyed the title, and so forth until no more grants are found. Liens or encumbrances granted by any of the parties shown on recorded instruments are also found in the search. Though theoretically accurate, this approach has practical difficulties due to there often being numerous grants from the sovereign. Therefore, an alternative method is to reverse the process, i.e. to search backward in the <b>grantee</b> <b>index.</b> This is done by beginning with {{the name of the}} person or entity who is thought to own the land to find the grantor to it. Then the <b>grantee</b> <b>index</b> is searched again to find the source of that grantor's title, and so on until you reach the grant from the sovereign. These linkages from grantor to grantee are called the [...] "chain of title." [...] The last grantee found is the [...] "record title holder." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} {{county in the}} United States, the index is kept by an {{official}} known as the County Recorder (or the Recorder of Deeds). Transfers are not necessarily listed in strict alphabetical order, but are often placed chronologically in a letter index corresponding to the first letter of the party's last name. In the grantor index, the alphabetic order of entries is by the grantors' last names. In each entry, {{the name of the}} grantee (purchaser) is then given, along with the location of the affected parcel and the volume and page number where the full text of the deed or other recorded instrument describing the transfer may be found. In the <b>grantee</b> <b>index,</b> the order of entries is by the grantees' last names, and each entry provides the same identifying information for the recorded instrument.|$|E
