5|$|According to {{the scholar}} István Boná, Thurisind's {{rise to power}} is a typical example of the {{conflicts}} among the leading families for the kingship that plagued Gepidia in the 6th century and {{made it difficult to}} maintain the succession within the king's family. To contain these obstacles Thurisind made Turismod, <b>his</b> <b>oldest</b> son, commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium, an important position that made Turismod the king's heir apparent (in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in line of succession). After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.|$|E

5|$|Béla's {{relationship}} with <b>his</b> <b>oldest</b> son and heir, Stephen, became tense {{in the early}} 1260s, because the elderly king favored his daughter Anna and his youngest child, Béla, Duke of Slavonia.
