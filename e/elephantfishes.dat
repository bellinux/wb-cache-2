5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (<b>elephantfishes</b> and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E
500|$|The {{size and}} {{structure}} of the prickly shark's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey. This species feeds on a variety of benthic and pelagic bony fishes, including hake, flounders, rockfishes, lingcod, topsmelt, mackerel, and herring, and on cartilaginous fishes, including <b>elephantfishes</b> (Callorhinchus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), young bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus), and ghost catshark (Apristurus) egg cases. Octopuses and squid, including the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) are also consumed. Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the bluntnose sixgill shark, while adults likely face few threats. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, with the unborn young sustained by yolk. There is only one known record of a pregnant female, which was gestating 114 embryos; this ranks among the largest known litters from any shark. The young are probably under [...] long at birth. The length at sexual maturity has not been precisely determined but is thought to be around [...] for males and [...] for females.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} aquatic life, the Congo River Basin {{has a very}} high species richness, and among the highest known {{concentrations}} of endemics. Until now, almost 700 fish species have been recorded from the Congo River Basin, and large sections remain virtually unstudied. This {{is by far the}} highest diversity of any African river system (in comparison, the next richest are the Niger, Volta and Nile with about 210, 140 and 130 fish species, respectively). Due to this and the great ecological differences between the regions in the Congo basin, it is often divided into multiple ecoregions (instead of treating it as a single ecoregion). Among these ecoregions, the Lower Congo Rapids alone has more than 300 fish species, including approximately 80 endemics while the southwestern part (Kasai Basin) alone has more than 200 fish species, of which about a quarter are endemic. The dominant fish families – at least in parts of the river – are Cyprinidae (carp/cyprinids, such as Labeo simpsoni), Mormyridae (<b>elephantfishes),</b> Alestidae (African tetras), Mochokidae (squeaker catfishes), and Cichlidae (cichlids). Among the natives in the river is the huge, highly carnivorous giant tigerfish. Three of the more unusual endemics are the whitish (non-pigmented) and blind Lamprologus lethops, which is believed to live as deep as [...] below the surface, Heterochromis multidens, which appears to be more closely related to cichlids of the Americas than other African cichlids, and Caecobarbus geertsii, the only known cavefish in Central Africa. There are also numerous endemic frogs and snails. Several hydroelectric dams are planned on the river, and these may lead to the extinction of many of the endemics.|$|E

50|$|Until recently, electroreception {{was known}} only in vertebrates. Recent {{research}} has shown that bees can detect the presence and pattern of a static charge on flowers. Electroreception is found in lampreys, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, chimaeras), lungfishes, bichirs, coelacanths, sturgeons, paddlefishes, catfishes, gymnotiformes, <b>elephantfishes,</b> monotremes, and at least one species of cetacean. The electroreceptor organs in all these groups are derived embryologically from a mechanoreceptor system. In fishes they are developed from the lateral lines. In most groups electroreception is passive, where it is used predominantly in predation. Two groups of teleost fishes are weakly electric and engage in active electroreception; the Neotropical knifefishes (Gymnotiformes) and the African <b>elephantfishes</b> (Notopteroidei). A rare terrestrial exception is the Western long-beaked echidna which has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill, compared to 40,000 for its semi-aquatic monotreme relative, the duck-billed platypus.|$|E

50|$|G. niloticus is nocturnal {{and has a}} poor vision.

50|$|The <b>elephantfishes</b> are {{a diverse}} family, {{with a wide}} range of {{different}} sizes and shapes. The smallest are just 5 cm in adult length, while the largest reach up to 1.5 m. They do, however, have a number of unique features in common. Firstly, the cerebellum (part of the brain) is greatly enlarged, giving them a brain to body size ratio similar to that of humans (though other sources give the brain/body proportion as 'similar to that of birds and marsupials'; Helfman, Collette & Facey 1997, p. 191). This is likely to be related to the interpretation of bio-electrical signals. Secondly, the semicircular canals in the inner ear have an unusual structure and are associated with a gas-filled bladder entirely separate from the main swim bladder.|$|E

40|$|Teleost {{freshwater}} fishes of {{the orders}} Mormyriformes (the <b>elephantfishes</b> plus Gymnarchus from Africa) and Gymnotiformes (the knifefishes from South America) are both electrogenic and electroreceptive. These fishes' electric system has a motor part, the electric organ, and a sensory part, the cutaneous electroreceptors that project to large, specialized brain areas. The electric systems {{of both groups}} of fishes, although evolved independently, are adapted to the same two functions, nocturnal electrolocation and communication. Weakly electric fishes discharge their electric organs in a pulselike or in a wavelike fashion ("buzzers" and "hummers," respectively). Whether a species is a hummer or a buzzer {{does not appear to}} be correlated with ecology but is strongly linked to phylogeny. There are representatives of both discharge types on both continents where these fishes are found. The <b>elephantfishes</b> (Mormyridae, about 200 species) are, apparently, all pulse fishes, whereas the related, monospecific Gymnarchus (Gymnarchidae) is the only known African wave fish. There are five families of South American knifefishes, with the majority of the 70 or so species being hummers, usually discharging at extremely constant frequencies (about 50 - 1800 Hz). The sensory mechanisms of social communication, as studied by behavioral means, are reviewed in this chapter with the question of mechanisms of reproductive isolation in mind. The chapter focuses on the electric organ discharge as the basic communication unit, and on the frequency, repetition rate, or temporal patterns of discharges. In both wave and pulse fishes the frequencies or repetition rates of discharges are not usually species-specific but are species-characteristic, because of more or less broad overlap between two or more species (depending on the local community of species). Electrosensory discrimination thresholds for frequency and intensity are unusually low in a wave fish, lower by far than those for other acoustico-lateral senses of aquatic lower vertebrates, rivaling the discrimination thresholds for audition in the most sensitive mammals (e. g., the human). A similar conclusion applies for the pulse rate sensitivity of a mormyrid. Species specificity becomes apparent when more information about the discharge activity is considered. In the case of pulse fishes, especially mormyrids, this comprises temporal patterns of discharges, which also vary greatly according to behavioral context (like aggression, escape, courtship, feeding, etc.); these fishes have an interdischarge interval code of communication. In the case of wave fishes, various types of frequency modulations and brief, repetitive discharge stops occur. Also, wave fishes may engage in "phase coupling" and "jamming avoidance," maneuvers that involve precise interaction with another fish's discharges. The degree ' of species specificity of a fish's discharge activity is usually enhanced by features of the waveform of a single discharge; this is true in both pulse and wave fishes. Usually there is considerable intraspecific variability of discharge waveforms, and there are also examples of sexual dimorphism. At least a few species can discriminate the individually variable pulse or wave discharge waveforms of their species. In a wave fish, a sensory mechanism based on the temporal analysis of beat patterns can explain the observed results. This new sensory capacity detects the phase modulation within a beat, which always occurs when the wave discharges of two fish mix in the water. In pulse fishes, several hypothetical sensory mechanisms for the discrimination of intraspecific pulse waveforms have been proposed but it is not yet clear which is generally involved. In any case, the sensitivity of weakly electric fishes to the fine detail of their discharges shows that the electrosensory world is much more colorful than could be imagined until recently. ...|$|E
