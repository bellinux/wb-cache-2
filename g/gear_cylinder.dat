5000|$|On 12 February 2009 a British Aerospace Jetstream 31 {{registered}} SX-SKY {{experienced a}} right main gear collapse after landing inbound from Rhodes. None of the 15 passengers and 3 crew were injured, but the aircraft sustained considerable damage to its right landing gear, wing and propeller that was deemed beyond economical repair, {{resulting in the}} aircraft being written-off. The cause of the accident was that the aircraft had previously suffered two heavy landings in the previous 27 which were not reported. One of the heavy landings caused a fracture in a landing <b>gear</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which propagated until the cylinder failed, causing the landing gear to collapse. SX-SKY was noted being scrapped at Heraklion airport in late February 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The 815 was {{designed}} and developed by ex-Alfa Romeo engineers Alberto Massimino and Vittorio Bellentani and by Enrico Nardi. The designation [...] "815" [...] {{was based on the}} car's eight-cylinder, 1.5 L engine. This engine was largely based on the four-cylinder, 1.1 L engine of the 508 C Balilla 1100. In concept, it was two 508C engines placed end to end, but it used a specially designed aluminium block built by Fonderia Calzoni in Bologna for integrity and light weight and a five-bearing crankshaft and a camshaft designed and built by AAC to get the traditional straight-8 timing and balance. The engine used Fiat valve <b>gear,</b> <b>cylinder</b> heads (two 508C heads per engine), and connecting rods. The engine was high-tech for the time, with a single overhead camshaft, two valves per cylinder, and a semi-dry sump lubrication system. Four Weber 30DR2 carburettors were specified for a total output of [...] at 5500 rpm.|$|E

50|$|In September 1909, Robert Vandercook founded Vandercook & Sons in Chicago, Illinois. The first {{press was}} a “rocker” proof press, {{made with a}} <b>geared</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Before the {{development}} of this press, all proofs were either made on a roller press, which depended on gravity for impression or on a Washington Hand Press.|$|R
50|$|Examples {{of shell}} molded items include <b>gear</b> housings, <b>cylinder</b> heads and {{connecting}} rods. It {{is also used}} to make high-precision molding cores.|$|R

50|$|With the {{exception}} of models 0, 01, 03 and 099, which were gravity type presses, all of the Vandercooks had <b>geared</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The last models designed were the SP series (which stands for Simple Precision) and the Universal series. They are similar in design but the Universal presses were originally designed as Test presses for ink companies and paper mills. Most of them were made with automatic controls and adjustable beds (AB). The SP series were mostly hand presses. The SP15 {{was the most popular}} of them all.|$|R

50|$|The last Class 15A locomotive, Maffei-built no. 2100, {{was fitted}} with Lentz Rotary Cam Poppet valve gear as an experiment, {{but this was}} later {{replaced}} with Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> and piston-valve <b>cylinders,</b> thereby turning no. 2100 into a standard Class 15A.|$|R
50|$|They {{were built}} with a {{saturated}} boiler, inside slide valves and Stephenson valve <b>gear,</b> two outside <b>cylinders</b> connected to 6 ft diameter driving wheels. No. 196 had 19 x 26 in cylinders, while No. 195 has 19+1/2 x 26 in cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear, {{controlled by}} steam reversing <b>gear.</b> The <b>cylinders</b> and steam chests were formed in three separate castings. The high-pressure cylinders were arranged with piston valves, while the low-pressure cylinders were arranged with Richardson balanced type slide valves, arranged above the cylinders. The steam chest covers of the low-pressure cylinders were designed with inclined joint faces {{to facilitate the}} handling of the valve and refacing of the ports during servicing.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a superheated, four-cylinder, {{compound engine}} and a bar frame, {{like most other}} Bavarian four-cylinder compounds, which simplified access to the inside driving <b>gear.</b> All four <b>cylinders</b> drove the second coupled axle. The leading axle was of the Adams type.|$|R
5000|$|Several [...] "last" [...] steam {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for Indonesia. E1060, a 1966-built rack steam locomotive (Esslingen 5316) is operable in Ambarawa railway museum. BB84, the last Mallet locomotive built for a non-tourist railway (according to Durrant) {{was built by}} Nippon Sharyo Keizo Kaisha in 1962 (works number 2007). This locomotive was plinthed in Banda Aceh and survived the December 2004 tsunami. The locomotive is in rather poor condition with its valve <b>gear</b> and <b>cylinder</b> pistons missing (as of March 2006).|$|R
50|$|The Class 19D, nicknamed Dolly, {{was very}} similar to its {{predecessor}} Class 19C, but Day specified piston valves and Walschaerts valve gear instead of rotary cam poppet valve <b>gear.</b> The <b>cylinders</b> were redesigned with straighter steam ports while the valve gear itself was revamped with a longer steam lap and greater valve travel. In all other respects they were identical to the Class 19C. The last five locomotives of the first batch from Krupp, numbers 2521 to 2525, were fitted with exhaust steam injectors.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of these engines was {{their use of}} external valve <b>gear.</b> Using external <b>cylinders,</b> valve <b>gear</b> and Walschaerts valve gear rather than Stephenson link were all features of the same post-war trends that also appeared in the BR Standard classes, but they were largely alien to traditional industrial saddle tanks.|$|R
50|$|The 48-valve V12 engine first {{appeared}} in the RA273 at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix, driven by Richie Ginther. In spite of weighing 740 kg (dry), it was capable of spinning the rear tyres at 100 mph in third <b>gear.</b> With <b>cylinder</b> dimensions of 78.0 x 52.2 mm and a displacement of 2,993.17 cc, a target of 400-440 bhp at 12,000 rpm was quoted. The engine used by Surtees at Monza in 1967 was quoted by Motoring News as developing only 396 bhp, but with improved torque and response. The vehicle weight excess over the 500 kg minimum had been approximately halved.|$|R
50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder {{steam engine}} (also {{known as a}} wobbler in the US) is a simple steam-engine design that requires no valve <b>gear.</b> Instead the <b>cylinder</b> rocks, or oscillates, as the crank-shaft moves the piston, pivoting in the mounting trunnion so that ports in the cylinder line up with ports in a fixed port face alternately to direct steam into {{or out of the}} cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad's class E2, E3, E7 steam {{locomotives}} {{were of the}} 4-4-2 [...] "Atlantic" [...] passenger type, frequently called “light Atlantics” {{after the}} introduction of the heavier E6 Atlantics. All were similar in size and boiler capacity but differed in firebox type, valves and valve <b>gear,</b> and <b>cylinder</b> diameter. Classes E2 and E3 were built simultaneously. Starting in 1916 a rebuilding program converted ninety class E2a,b,c to class E7s by replacing slide valves with piston valves and increasing cylinder diameter from 20.5 to 22.5 in. Fourteen class E2 were similarly converted to class E7sa. Ninety class E2a,d, E3a,d were converted to class E3sd. These improvements allowed many of the engines to remain in active service into the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|The Class B I was {{developed}} in parallel with the Class A II, but had a coupled axle instead of a second carrying axle. As a result, it developed a higher tractive effort. It also had a Stephenson Long Boiler, forked frame and an outside Stephenson valve <b>gear</b> with outside <b>cylinders.</b> The coupling rods were based on an American prototype. Later many of the engines were fitted with a Crampton boiler.|$|R
5000|$|Importation of airsoft guns (from {{outside of}} EU), all {{critical}} parts/components of airsoft guns and aiming devices (optics, RDS, [...].) are permitted {{only with a}} weapon importation license. For airsoft parts, most monitored on customs are barrels, optics, magazines, receivers and accessories like grenades. Springs, <b>gears,</b> hop-ups, pistons, <b>cylinders,</b> switches, triggers are usually let through. External and non-critical parts like rails, holders, bipods, etc. can be legally imported without the license.|$|R
40|$|A fiber {{wrap and}} {{a method of}} {{rotating}} the fiber wrap without twisting a data cable are disclosed. The fiber wrap includes a sun <b>gear,</b> a sun <b>cylinder</b> coupled to the sun gear, a planetary gear {{in contact with the}} sun <b>gear,</b> a planetary <b>cylinder</b> coupled to the planetary gear, an outer housing in contact with the planetary gear, and a data cable coupled to the sun cylinder, the planetary cylinder, and the outer housing. The maximum bend radius of the data cable is determined by the equation: 2 πΔDGD*(c/λ) wherein λ is optical wavelength and ΔDGD = [0. 5 Cs (r/R 2) 2 ΔL]/c - [0. 5 Cs (r/R 1) 2 ΔL]/c wherein Cs is the stress-optics coefficient, c is the speed of light R 1 is the bend radius {{at the end of the}} wrap motion, R 2 is the bend radius at the start of the wrap motion, r is the radii of the sun cylinder and the planetary cylinder, and ΔL = (10 / 360) 2 πR 2...|$|R
50|$|In {{outline the}} machine resembled a {{conventional}} 2-6-2T steam locomotive, {{but it had}} four pairs of horizontally opposed cylinders mounted longitudinally above the frame and driving a crankshaft placed between them, with the further drivetrain by <b>gears.</b> The <b>cylinders</b> were made double-ended, with one end of each cylinder for steam and the other fitted with a diesel injector. (Some drawings, published in contemporary magazines, show only two pairs of cylinders {{and it seems that}} {{this was one of the}} design features that was changed during development.) The boiler, with a diameter of only fifty-one inches (130 cm) and a small internal firebox, was mounted above. The driving position was in the usual place behind the boiler and tanks for fuel and water were mounted on the frame at the rear.|$|R
50|$|Pompeo sent a Crosley {{engine to}} Bandini {{for him to}} study and use. Lightweight and compact, this American engine was very versatile, having been used with boats, aircraft, and even in fire pumps. It had {{aluminium}} block with five main bearings, monoblock with to two valves per <b>cylinder,</b> <b>gear</b> driven single overhead cam, and more. Bandini immediately began making modifications for racing, including longer Stroke steel crankshaft (raising the displacement to 747 cc), new pistons, camshafts, and oil pump.|$|R
5000|$|The Swiss {{engineer}} Ernest Henry adapted his incredibly successful Peugeot four-cylinder automobile racing engine (1912) for {{a racing}} motorcycle. The 500M used a parallel twin-cylinder engine, with dual overhead camshafts {{driven by a}} cascade of <b>gears</b> between the <b>cylinders,</b> with four-valve cylinder heads. The 500M was the most technically advanced motorcycle in the world when introduced. However, the design was ahead of the metallurgy available at the time, and suffered from cracking between the valve seats.|$|R
50|$|All of the {{compounding}} machinery {{was contained}} in the valve chest, which in American locomotives (in the days before one piece cast frames) was integral with the smokebox saddle. The whole unit therefore could be unbolted and replaced with conventional single expansion cylinders. That was the typical fate of Vauclain compounds: {{when the time came}} for a major overhaul, the compound machinery and Stephenson valve gear were removed, and the engine was rebuilt with superheating, Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> and conventional <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
