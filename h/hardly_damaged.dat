40|$|Magnetically {{insulated}} {{transmission lines}} (MITLs), which could transfer power density up to TW/cm^{ 2 }, {{are one of}} the most important technologies in pulsed power. In pulsed power systems for the Z-pinch fusion or radiography, a long MITL acts as a transmission line as well as a spatial isolation between load and driver. The length of MITLs in such systems will be up to a few, even tens of meters. However, the anode and cathode (A-K) gap is only a few centimeters to make the centering of the MITL’s electrodes be one of the most challenging issues. Cathodes of long coaxial MITLs, such as that of Hermes-III and RITS, are fixed at the low voltage end while keeping the other end free of support. However, such a method will be very difficult for longer MITLs due to gravity and engineering reasons. An interesting question for such MITL design is to find a way to position the electrodes to the ideal position while <b>hardly</b> <b>damaging</b> the power flow. It is also a very practical concern in the construction of large pulsed-power facilities. In this paper, a high inductive helical supported MITL in a 10 -stage linear transformer driver system is investigated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Authors {{overlook}} the recent {{findings in the}} field of the complex interrelationship among nutrition, immune status and parasitic infestation. After summarizing the general characteristics of the active immune system, they describe the first period of the systemic immune response, the acute phase reaction. The cause of drastical decrease in serum zinc concentration is redistribution into the liver and lymphocyte metallothioneins. Immune defi-ciency correlates only indirectly with the nutrition. Ingestion of feed mycotoxins (e. g. T- 2 toxin) and peroxides causes lymphocytes depletion in the lymphoid organs. Events of immunological stress are a special form of homeorrhetic control. Lack of energy and protein <b>hardly</b> <b>damages</b> the humoral immunity. Undernutrition fundamentally affects the cell-mediated immune response and the complement production. In animals, the lack of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, iodine and selenium has been associated with signs of immunodeficiency. The concentrations of trace elements required for healthy animals are often below what is required for animals experiencing an immunological challenge. Zinc has both specific and aspecific role in the immune defence mechanism. Zinc regulates the maturation and function of immune cells, among others by protecting developing lymphocytes from apoptosis. As part of the zinc-finger proteins, may influence DNA transcription. The thymus synthesizes a 9 -amino acid peptide hormone, the thymulin, which is activated after having bound zinc. Selenium has a vitamin E-independent immunostimulant effect in the marginally supplied animals. Active form of vitamin D 3 regulates transcription at cell level, acts as a...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} whether in a two-choice set-up the parasitoid Cotesia rubecula (Marshall) (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) distinguishes between volatiles emitted by Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Brassicaceae) infested with its host, Pieris rapae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) and Arabidopsis infested with non-host herbivores. Four non-host herbivore species were tested: the caterpillars Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) and Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), both chewing insects, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae), which punctures parenchymal cells, and the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea), which is a phloem-feeder. Compared with undamaged plants, C. rubecula females were more attracted to Arabidopsis plants infested by P. rapae, P. xylostella, S. exigua, or T. urticae, but not to plants infested by M. persicae. The parasitoids preferred host-infested plants to spider mite- or aphid-infested plants, but not to plants infested with non-host caterpillars (P. xylostella or S. exigua). The data show that when Arabidopsis plants are infested with a leaf tissue-damaging herbivore they emit a volatile blend that attracts C. rubecula females and the wasps only discriminate between a host and non-host herbivore when the type of damage is different (chewing vs. piercing). When Arabidopsis is infested with a herbivore that <b>hardly</b> <b>damages</b> leaf tissue, C. rubecula females are not attracted.

40|$|The plasma scald {{damage is}} the most typical laser damage {{morphology}} presented on the laser conditioned HfO 2 /SiO 2 mirrors. In order to provide guidance for defining the acceptance quantitative specification for the plasma scald on these laser conditioned mirrors, the simulations about the downstream beam modulations of the plasma scald are investigated based on its damage characteristics and the diffraction theory. The single plasma scald with the typical size, induced by the laser conditioning, can <b>hardly</b> cause <b>damage</b> to the downstream optics and its influence on the beam contrast can be reduced easily with the increment of the propagation distance. Those with small size and large depth, or those with big size and shallow depth can also <b>hardly</b> induce downstream <b>damage,</b> but the beam contrasts become worse with the increment {{of the size of}} the concave part as well as its depth. For a maximum plasma scald observed on the laser conditioned mirror, the intensity modulation peak is close to 1. 3 and the beam contrast reaches to 25 % even at 2 m downstream from the mirror. For multi plasma scalds, more diffraction rings show up in the downstream beam and further decrease the overall uniformity of the beam. The uniformity of the beam gets worse as the number of the plasma scald is increased. When the density of the plasma scald with the typical size in these 1 omega HfO 2 /SiO 2 mirrors reaches 20 per 1 cm(2), the beam contrast is less than 6 %. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{show that}} the key to {{understand}} why the same salt can cause damage in some conditions and not in others is the kinetics of crystallization. We present experiments assessing the impact of the recrystallization dynamics of sodium sulfate on damage observed in sandstone after repeated cycles of rewetting/drying and humidification/drying. Macroscopic and microscopic scale experiments using magnetic resonance imaging and phase contrast microscopy demonstrate that sodium sulfate that has both hydrated and anhydrous phases can lead to severe damage in sandstone during rewetting/drying cycles, but not during humidity cycling. During rewetting (a rapid process) in regions (pores) that are highly concentrated in salt, anhydrous microcrystals dissolve only partially, giving rise to a heterogeneous salt solution that is supersaturated with respect to the hydrated phase. The remaining anhydrous crystals then act as seeds for the formation of large amounts of hydrated crystals, creating grape-like structures that expand rapidly. These clusters can generate stresses larger than the tensile strength of the stone, leading to damage. On the other hand, with humidification (a slow process) and after complete deliquescence of salt crystals, the homogeneous sodium sulfate solution can reach high concentrations during evaporation without any nucleation, favoring the formation of isolated anhydrous crystals (thenardite). The crystallization of the anhydrous salt generates only very small stresses compared to the hydrated clusters and therefore causes <b>hardly</b> any <b>damage</b> to the stone. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R
