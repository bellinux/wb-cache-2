Indirect participation occurs when an institutional investor exchanges a stock on behalf of an individual or household. Indirect investment occurs in the form of pooled <b>investment</b> <b>accounts,</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts,</b> and other managed financial accounts.|$|R

40|$|The {{likelihood}} of owning homes, <b>investment</b> <b>accounts,</b> and <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts</b> by Black and White families was analyzed {{using data from}} the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances.

40|$|Financial {{literacy}} {{is the level}} of understanding an individual has for different financial topics, including but not limited to, <b>investment</b> vehicles, <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts,</b> saving, budgeting, credit and taxes, and the use of such knowledge to change one’s financial behavior to create a more positive financial position for the future. Past research has shown that college students consistently have low levels of financial literacy. They also lack knowledgeable influences on their financial education. Because many college students will soon enter the workforce after graduation and will be responsible for managing their own salary, <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts</b> and <b>investment</b> options, they can be considered the ideal recipients of financial education. After demonstrating the apparent need, I explore the current situation regarding college students and financial literacy through a survey. Focus will be given to college students’ attitudes towards their finances, their financial behavior, financial influences and their preparedness for future financial situations. Through the development of three financial scores, demographic factors were tested to determine if they {{had a significant impact on}} college students’ financial scores. It was found that gender had a specific impact on college students’ financial attitude score. Specifically, males had a higher score, indicating a greater interest in their personal financial knowledge. Students who had previously taken an “Introduction to Financial Management” or “Personal Financial Management” course had significantly higher financial attitude, behavior and financial future scores. This study creates the potential for a collegiate level curriculum that could have a meaningful impact on college students, as it would be a relevant education experience that would cover topics students directly expressed an interested in learning about...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} well-being of future retirees in the baby-boom cohort—those born between 1946 and 1964 —is {{of particular concern}} to policymakers. Social insurance {{in the form of}} Social Security benefits plays a major role of income support for the elderly in the United States. To a much lesser degree, a supplementary welfare program in the form of Supplementary Security Income also plays a role. This analysis assesses the relative contribution of those pro-grams to the expected income of current retirees (those born in 1926 to 1935), near-term retirees (those born in 1936 to 1945), early baby-boomer retirees (those born in 1946 to 1955), and late baby-boomer retirees (those born in 1956 to 1965). Their contribution is contrasted with other pillars of income, including income from nonhousing assets, imputed rent, earnings, nonspouse co-resident family members, defined benefit pen-sions, and other <b>retirement</b> <b>investment</b> <b>accounts.</b> This analysis uses projections of the major sources of income at age 67 fro...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a joint analysis of household stockholding participation, stock location among stockholding modes, and participation spillovers, {{using data from}} the US Survey of Consumer Finances. Our multivariate choice model matches observed participation rates, conditional and unconditional, and asset location patterns. Financial education and sophistication strongly affect direct stockholding and mutual fund participation, while social interactions affect stockholding through <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts</b> only. Household characteristics influence stockholding through <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts</b> conditional on owning <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts,</b> unlike what happens with stockholding through mutual funds. Although stockholding is more common among <b>retirement</b> <b>account</b> owners, this fact is mainly due to their characteristics that led them to buy <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts</b> in the first place rather than of any informational advantages gained through <b>retirement</b> <b>account</b> ownership itself. Finally, our results suggest that, taking stockholding as given, stock location is not arbitrary but crucially depends on investor characteristics.

40|$|Many tax-codes {{around the}} world allow for special taxable {{treatment}} of savings in <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts.</b> In particular, profits in <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts</b> are usually tax exempt which allow investors to increase an asset?s return by holding {{it in such a}} <b>retirement</b> <b>account.</b> While the existing literature on asset location shows that risk-free bonds are usually the preferred asset to hold in a <b>retirement</b> <b>account,</b> we explain how the tax exemption of profits in <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts</b> affects private investors? asset allocation. We show that total final wealth can be decomposed into what the investor would have earned in a taxable account and what is due to the tax exemption of profits in the <b>retirement</b> <b>account.</b> The tax exemption of profits can thus be considered a tax-gift which is similar to an implicit bond holding. As this tax-gift?s impact on total final wealth decreases over time, so does the investor?s equity exposure...|$|R
