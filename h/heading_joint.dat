40|$|Masonry {{construction}} {{is the most}} ancient construction practice that is still in use in the modern era. Some of the existing masonry structures have survived for several hundreds of years. Most of the existing masonry structures were built using available knowledge or as per the available codes of practice. With passage of time these masonry structures {{are in need of}} restoration and str engthening as many of the structures have become part of cultural heritage with a high social value. The compressive behaviour of brick masonry made of soft bricks is investigated. Uniaxial compression tests are performed on masonry specimens made using mo rtars of different strengths. The influence of <b>head</b> <b>joints</b> is evaluated using specimens with three different aspect ratios. The failure in the masonry is studied in relation to the relative arrangement of the <b>head</b> <b>joints.</b> The ultimate strength in masonry w ith <b>head</b> <b>joints</b> is lower than the strength obtained from masonry tested in stack bonded configuration. Damage is associated with cracking in the mortar due to lateral tension produced by the confined expansion of brick. Failure is produced by vertical spli tting and the number of cracks depend upon the tensile strength of the mortar relative to the brick and the number of <b>head</b> <b>joints.</b> <b>Head</b> <b>joints</b> act as stress risers, leading to high tensile stress. An experimental program on the compressive load response of wrapped masonry specimens with glass FRP and basalt FRP have been conducted. The effect of wrapping on the masonry specimens and the failure modes are investigated. The confinement provided by FRP increased the load carrying capacity by confining the fail ure of masonry inside FRP. Final failure of masonry specimens is due to the failure of FRP at peak load capacity of the specimen...|$|R

25|$|The head-joint tube is tapered {{slightly}} {{towards the}} closed end. Boehm described {{the shape of}} the taper as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but the taper is more complex than a truncated cone. The <b>head</b> <b>joint</b> is the most difficult part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. <b>Head</b> <b>joint</b> geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. <b>Head</b> <b>joint</b> upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} compressive failure in masonry made of soft clay bricks is presented. The research attempts {{to address the}} concern of strong/stiff mortars available in the market today in combination with poor quality burnt clay bricks available in India. Masonry assemblages are tested to evaluate {{the influence of the}} relative strength of mortar on the observed damage evolution and compressive failure. Damage evolution associated with the formation and propagation of vertical splitting cracks during the compressive load response of masonry assemblages in the stack bonded arrangement are studied using a full-field optical technique based on digital image correlation. The stress state in the composite material produces tension in the mortar and confined compression in brick. Using image correlation clear evidence of the crack forming in the mortar and propagating into the brick is established. Failure is produced by vertical splitting and the number of cracks depend upon the tensile strength of the mortar relative to the brick and the number of <b>head</b> <b>joints.</b> <b>Head</b> <b>joints</b> act as stress risers, leading to high tensile stress...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{in-plane}} shear performance of full-scale walls made from compressed earth blocks. Compressed earth blocks are {{a type of}} masonry where the blocks are composed of compressed soil and typically dry-stacked without mortar. Prior {{research has demonstrated that}} the in-plane shear strength of these blocks falls far short of capacities predicted by conventional masonry building codes, requiring new testing to develop effective and safe designs for seismic conditions. This thesis specifically studies the effects of block type and the use of grouted shear keys at the block <b>head</b> <b>joints.</b> Three full-scale walls were constructed and tested under in-plane, cyclic loading. To compare the effect of block type on shear strength, one wall was constructed from Rhino blocks as used by the Center for Vocational Building Technology, while another used V-Lock blocks designed by the Vermeer Corporation. Apart from differences in size and interlock mechanism, the standard Rhino blocks have shear keys at the <b>head</b> <b>joints</b> which are not present on the V-Lock blocks. To examine the effect of these shear keys, a third wall was built from Rhino blocks with the shear keys removed. The two standard block types displayed no major difference in strength that could not be attributed to grouted area or the presence/absence of the <b>head</b> <b>joint</b> shear keys. The Rhino block wall with shear keys reached a higher peak load relative to the grouted area but experienced a brittle drop in capacity after peaking, while the other two walls exhibited an extended loading plateau after the initial peak. All walls failed with cracking and block sliding along the main diagonals, a failure mode similar to conventional masonry. Proposals are made for modifying the equations for shear capacity from the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) 2013 code for use in designing compressed earth block shear walls...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} Z(f), the input {{impedance}} of the Boehm flute, measured from 200 Hz to 12. 5 kHz shows the expected set of strong resonances {{in the frequency}} range that corresponds to fundamental frequencies of the playing regime. These frequencies are below the expected cut-off frequency (due to an array of open tone holes) for propagation along the bore of the flute. Above this frequency, in a range that affects the harmonics rather than the fundamental of played notes, the inertive reactance of the tone holes increases with frequency until the standing wave propagates along the tone hole lattice with little attenuation. Harmonic resonances are again evident, but now correspond to resonances of the whole length of the instrument. However the resonances associated with the bore are strongly attenuated over an intermediate frequency range. This {{appears to be a}} consequence of a Helmholtz resonator formed by the air in the embouchure hole and the sealed end of the <b>head</b> <b>joint.</b> Experiments with different <b>head</b> <b>joints</b> confirm this mechanism.
