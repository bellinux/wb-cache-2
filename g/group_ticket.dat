50|$|<b>Group</b> voting <b>tickets</b> were {{introduced}} for {{elections for the}} Australian Senate by the Hawke Labor Government {{to reduce the number}} of invalid votes by simplifying the voting system. Under the new system a voter cast a valid vote if they placed a single mark above the line instead of the scores on a typical Senate ballot paper. It was first used at the 1984 federal election. For the Australian Senate, the rate of informal voting was reduced from around 9% before 1984, to around 3% under <b>group</b> voting <b>tickets.</b>|$|R

2500|$|To {{facilitate}} a complete ballot, some PR-STV systems provide the voter with {{the option of}} using <b>group</b> voting <b>tickets</b> {{rather than having to}} identify manually a complete list of individual preferences. For example, in elections to the Australian Senate from 1984 until 2013 a voter could either rank the candidates individually [...] "below the line" [...] or place the number 1 in a box [...] "above the line" [...] to vote for a predetermined ordering of candidates drawn up by one of the political parties. This system diminished the emphasis on individual candidates and increases the power of party leaders that submit the predetermined rankings; in practice it may even lead to a system resembling, but not being identical to party-list proportional representation. [...] However it was still possible for independent candidates to be elected as has been shown in the 2007 Federal Senate elections where Nick Xenophon was 3rd elected before preferences. In 2016 <b>group</b> <b>tickets</b> were abolished to avoid undue influence of preference deals and [...] a form of optional preferential voting was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept is}} {{explained}} in the National Fares Manuals (NFMs) issued approximately three times per year by the British Railways Board (and, since privatisation, by the Association of Train Operating Companies) to stations, Rail Appointed Travel Agents and other ticket issuing authorities: [...] "Fares for certain ... cities and towns are shown to and from a notional common station. All fares are quoted and all tickets should be issued to and from notional group stations except for local journeys between two stations in the same <b>group.</b> <b>Tickets</b> issued to and from these group stations are valid to or from any of their associated stations, subject to normal route availability." ...|$|R
