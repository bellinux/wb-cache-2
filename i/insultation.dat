5000|$|In December 2013, Elizabethtown entered year {{three of}} Environmental Challenge. To date, over 300 volunteers have donated over 3,700 hours to remove 140 tons of trash, provide energy {{efficient}} doors, windows and <b>insultation</b> for {{elderly and disabled}} neighbors, build a children's library and commence work on a children's park. In 2012 Elizabethtown won an Environmental Challenge Award and in 2013 won a KaBoom grant for a children's playground.|$|E
50|$|This {{structure}} {{and thus a}} capacitor of this type is present in every MIS field-effect transistor, such as MOSFETs. For the steady reduction {{of the size of}} structures in microelectronics, the following facts are clear. From the formula above it follows that capacitance increases with ever thinner layers of insulation. For all MIS devices the insulation thickness cannot fall below a minimum of around 10 nm. Using thinner <b>insultation</b> than this leads to the occurrence of tunneling through the insulating material (dielectric). Due to this, the use of so-called high-k materials as the insulator material is being investigated (as of 2009).|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paperThis paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} computational thermal manikins (CTMs) {{to be used in}} a coupled simulation envrionment to simulate the human thermoregulary response in buildings. 3 D graphic design and engineering tools have been used to create CTMs with different postures and clothing <b>insultation</b> levels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a nude CTM in a space with displacement ventilation has shown good agreement with experimental data of measured convective and radiative heat transfer coefficients. Investigations of a clothed CTM in a space with natural ventilation has also been conducted and compared with published experimental data...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} realise a horticultural sector that {{operates}} without the combustion of fossil fuel, {{the first step}} is to reduce the demand for heating by improving the <b>insultation</b> of greenhouses. This holds especially for crops that are grown at high temperatures, like sweet pepper. The Venlow Energy greenhouse with its double glass cladding and energy screen is a good example of such a highly insulated greenhouse. This report presents the results of a one year cultivation and serves as a bench mark for the state of the art in energy conserving production of Sweet Pepper in the Netherlands. It shows the greenhouse climate conditions required, and the possibilities to meet these requirements with a low energy consumption and options to realise this from sustainable sources. The application of sustainable energy sources was not tested in practice, but since the exact resources (heat and CO 2) required from hour to hour were measured, it is easy to do the math on the amounts and capacities needed. The application of pure CO 2 or CO 2 from another sustainable source is essential when aiming at a fossil energy free horticulture. Without external CO 2 the production will drop substantially, especially because an energy conserving greenhouse has typically a strongly reduced air exchange. But, for the same reason, the amount of CO 2 needed to increase the CO 2 concentration is quite limited, 25 kg/m² per year in this experiment. With a production of 32. 5 kg class I of red Sweet Pepper per m², the experiment has shown that halving the energy consumption compared to the general practice did’nt reduced the production...|$|E
