2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{accounts}} of the Spix in captivity was given by Rev. F.G. Dutton, president of the Avicultural Society U.K. in 1900: [...] "I have not yet seen a good-tempered Spix... My Spix, which is really more a Conure than a Macaw, will not look at sop of any sort, except sponge cake given from one's fingers, only drinks plain water, and lives mainly on sunflower seed. It has hemp, millet, and canary, and peanuts, but I {{do not think it}} eats much of any of them. It barks the branches of the tree in which it is loose, and may eat the bark. It would very likely be all the better if it would eat bread and milk, as it might then produce some flight feathers, which it never yet has had. But I expect it would not eat any sop, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> it nothing else." ...|$|E
