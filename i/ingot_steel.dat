Republic consolidated its operations by closing or revamping its smaller plants of which Bourne-Fuller was one, although with Upson’s open hearths in downtown Cleveland and a capacity of 240,000 tons a year of <b>ingot</b> <b>steel</b> production, it gave Republic a bolt and nut manufacturing business. In 1984, Republic Steel was merged with Jones Laughlin Steel Company to form LTV Steel and ultimately, the Upson Nut Plant was shut down.|$|E

50|$|With {{the shift}} of the Yellow River to a new bed right {{to the north of}} Jinan (in 1852) and the {{establishment}} of a railroad hub, the city became a major market for agricultural products from the productive farming regions to the north.Following the trade in agricultural goods, the city developed a textile and clothing industry, flour mills, oil presses, as well as factories producing paper, cement, and matches. In the 1950s, large iron and steel works as well as chemical factories were established around Jinan. The large metal works produce pig iron, <b>ingot</b> <b>steel,</b> as well as finished steel. In 2008, steel manufacturing was restructured with the formation of the Shandong Iron and Steel Group.In the 1970s, factories for the production of trucks and construction vehicles (Sinotruk) were added.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s BSC {{planning}} considered the 5 million <b>ingot</b> <b>steel</b> tons pa Anchor site as a core asset, and the 1.1 million tons pa former Lysaght's Normanby works as marginal. The economic downturn following the 1973 oil crisis (see Steel crisis) contributed to large scale {{reduction in the}} BSC workforce overall, to under {{a third of the}} 180,000 employed in the UK industry as a whole in 1975; this in combination with loss of certain privileges and management requests for flexible working, reduction in manning, and wage cuts or wage freezes led to large scale conflict in the industry as a whole over several years. A national strike (led by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation) took place from January to March 1980. In the wider business steel production ended at Shotton (1978), Consett (1980), Corby (1981) and Clydeside (1982).|$|E
5000|$|Production {{of crude}} steel at Burnpur rose sharply from 353,427 tonnes in 1953-54 to 914,159 tonnes in 1960-61. Production of <b>ingot</b> <b>steel</b> was 93.5% of the rated {{capacity}} in 1961-62. The next year, 1962-63, IISCO surpassed the million-tonne mark {{for the first}} time and the tempo of production continued in 1963-64 with a production of 1,026,786 tonnes. For the next two years the production hovered around 94.9% and 97.0%. In 1966-67, it dropped to 89.69%. During the period the production of spun pipes and foundry products at Kulti also reached new heights. It became the first Indian blue chip company to have its shares traded at the London Stock Exchange.IISCO owed its success in both production and profitability to the efficient top management team, who steered the company most effectively. And then it was the beginning of the period of labour unrest.|$|E

SCOB established steel making facilities at Napuria, {{adjacent to the}} Hirapur Works of IISCO. The new steel plant had an annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes of <b>ingot</b> <b>steel,</b> another 100,000 tonnes were added later. The steel works consisted of three 225-tonne tilting open hearth furnaces, soaking pits, a 40” blooming mill of one million tonne capacity, a 34” heavy structural mill and a 18” light structural mill. A sheet mill was added in 1940. The first heat of steel was tapped on 10 November 1939 and rolled subsequently. A duplex plant initially with two Bessemer converters (and subsequently another) was added. The first blow of the Bessemer converter was made on 6 February 1946. Martin and Burn companies formally merged in 1946 to form Martin Burn Limited.|$|E
50|$|Nationalisation of UK steel {{operations}} led to {{the formation}} of the British Steel Corporation (BSC) in 1967. Scunthorpe was chosen by the corporation as one of the five main production centres, formally within the Midland regional division of BSC, and designated as a general steel producers. Placing the three steel producers in the town under shared ownership gave opportunities for rationalisation and greater efficiency - excess liquid steel and sinter were transferred between the works by rail. Within the whole of BSC the 7 ft plate mill at Appleby-Frodingham (and at West Hartlepool) was closed and production transferred to Lackenby, North Yorkshire in around 1970. Under the rationalisation scheme known as the 'Heritage Programme' closures corresponding to 1.59 and 0.81 million tons of <b>ingot</b> <b>steel</b> were announced for Appleby-Frodingham and Redbourn works to take effect in 1973/4 and 1972/3 respectively.

40|$|Melt {{convection}} and macrosegregation in casting {{of a large}} <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> are numerically simulated. The simulation {{is based}} on a previously developed model for multicomponent steel solidification with melt convection and involves the solution of fully coupled conservation equations for the transport phenomena in the liquid, mush, and solid. Heat transfer in the mold and insulation materials, as well as the formation of a shrinkage cavity at the top, is taken into account. The numerical results show the evolution of the temperature, melt velocity, and species concentration fields during solidification. The predicted variation of the macrosegregation of carbon and sulfur along the vertical centerline is compared with measurements from an industrial <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> that was sectioned and analyzed.
