5|$|Red deer have a stronghold on the moor {{and can be}} seen on quiet hillsides {{in remote}} areas, {{particularly}} in the early morning. The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (Cervus elaphus), was Britain's largest known wild land animal, until it was killed in October 2010. The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> and ring ouzel. Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor, probably {{as a result of a}} reduction in habitat management, and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} bird species {{found in the}} Mendips, the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), which has gradually recolonised the area since the 1980s, is particularly significant. It breeds on sea and inland cliffs and {{on the faces of}} active and disused quarries. The upland heaths of the west Mendips have recently increased in ornithological importance due to colonisation by the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia undata), which can be found at Black Down and Crook Peak. In Britain, this species is usually associated with lowland heath. The woodlands at Stock Hill are a breeding site for nightjars (Caprimulgus europaeus) and long-eared owls (Asio otus). The Waldegrave Pool, part of Priddy Mineries, is an important site for dragonflies, including downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) and four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata). Waldegrave Pool is the only Mendip breeding site for downy emerald dragonflies. In 2007 the first confirmed sighting of a red kite (Milvus milvus) on the Mendips was made at Charterhouse.|$|E
25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath—primarily the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, but locally dominant are the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia undata). Other local heathland species at Ferndown Common include the silver-studded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus), European nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) and European stonechat. In the south-east of the site there are several small ponds, which support at least 14 species of dragonflies, most of which are heathland species. Also resident in the ponds are large populations of the widespread, although in decline, common frog (Rana temporaria) and palmate newt (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath; the northern and western parts are primarily of the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, while the low-lying parts of the south-east are mostly the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia undata). Parley Common has an abundance of spider fauna—at least 147 species—which includes the very rare Ero aphana, Xysticus robustus—otherwise found in only a few places in the New Forest—and Gnaphosa lugubris. The site holds claim to a number of firsts: the smooth snake was first recorded in Britain in Parley Common in 1853; the Mazarine blue (Cyaniris semiargus)—now extinct in Britain—was first discovered here in the late nineteenth century; the moth Pachythelia villosella and the ringed carpet moth (Cleora cinctaria) were also first discovered here.|$|E
500|$|The area's geology {{has little}} variety, {{comprising}} {{almost entirely of}} Eocene clays which, prior to urbanisation, supported a heathland environment. Patches of the original heath still remain, notably Turbary Common, a [...] site, much of which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. This heathland habitat is home to all six species of native reptile, the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> and some important flora such as sundew and bog asphodel. Small populations of Exmoor pony and Shetland cattle help to maintain the area.|$|E
500|$|To {{the north}} of Christchurch is St Catherine's Hill, the highest part of the borough at [...] above sea level. This hill is the most southerly of a chain of three hills, some [...] long with [...] area of {{heathland}} and coniferous forest. The New Forest, Christchurch Priory, Hengistbury Head, Avon Valley, Christchurch Bay, The Solent and The Needles of the Isle of Wight {{can be seen from}} viewpoints {{on the east side of}} the Hill. Stour Valley way, Poole Bay and the Isle of Purbeck can be viewed from the south west side of the Hill. Due to its commanding views, St. Catherine's Hill has been in use since prehistoric times as a look-out area and beacon and in more recent years served as a military training ground. The hill is home to protected and rare wildlife species including the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> nightjar, and the sand lizard.|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler.</b> Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

60|$|Of many curious {{experiences}} I {{have met}} in my quest {{of the rare}} little bird, or of information concerning it, I have related two or three: I have one more to give--assuredly the strangest of all. I was out for a day's ramble {{with the members of}} a Natural History Society, at a place the name of which must not be told, and was walking in advance of the others with a Mr A., the leading ornithologist of the county, one whose name is honourably known to all naturalists in the kingdom. The <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> he said in the course of conversation, had unhappily long been extinct in the county. Now it happened that among those just behind us there was another local naturalist, also well known outside his own county--Mr B., let us call him. When I separated from my companion this gentleman came to my side, and said that he had overheard some of our talk, and he wished me to know that Mr A. was in error in saying that the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> was extinct in the county. There was one small colony of three or four pairs to be found at a spot ten to eleven miles from where we then were; and he would be glad {{to take me to the}} place and show me the birds. The existence of this small remnant had been known for several years to half a dozen persons, who had jealously kept the secret;--to their great regret they had had to keep it from their best friend and chief supporter of their Society, Mr A., simply because it would not be safe with him. He was enthusiastic about the native bird life, the number of species the county could boast, etc., and sooner or later he would incautiously speak about the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> and the wealthy local collectors would hear of it, with the result that the birds would quickly be gathered into their cabinets.|$|E

6000|$|This, then, {{being my}} feeling about stuffed birds, {{set up in}} their [...] "natural surroundings," [...] I very {{naturally}} avoid the places where they are exhibited. At Brighton, for instance, on many occasions when I have visited and stayed in that town, there was no inclination to see the Booth Collection, {{which is supposed to}} be an ideal collection of British birds; and we know it was the life-work of a zealous ornithologist who was also a wealthy man, and who spared no pains to make it perfect of its kind. About eighteen months ago I passed a night in the house of a friend close to the Dyke Road, and next morning, having a couple of hours to get rid of, I strolled into the museum. It was painfully disappointing, for though no actual pleasure had been expected, the distress experienced was more than I had bargained for. It happened that a short time before, I had been watching the living <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> {{at a time when the}} sight of this small elusive creature is loveliest, for not only was the bird in his brightest feathers, but his surroundings were then most perfect-- ...|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} my own taste and feelings, since in the present chapter I {{must be allowed to}} write on Man (myself to wit) and Birds, the other {{chapters}} being occupied with the subject of Birds and Man. It has always, or since I can remember, been my ambition and principal delight to see and hear every bird at its best. This is here a comparative term, and simply means an unusually attractive aspect of the bird, or a very much better than the ordinary one. This may result from a fortunate conjunction of circumstances, or may be due to a peculiar harmony between the creature and its surroundings; or in some instances, as in that given above of the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> to a rare effect of the sun. In still other cases, motions and antics, rarely seen, singularly graceful, or even grotesque, may give the best impression. After one such impression has been received, another equally excellent may follow at a later date: in that case the second impression does not obliterate, or is not superimposed upon the former one; both remain as permanent possessions of the mind, and we may thus have several mental pictures of the same species.|$|E

50|$|Birds inhabiting {{the reserve}} include the avocet, grey phalarope, osprey, <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler,</b> yellow-browed warbler, serin, black-throated diver, hobby, {{peregrine}} falcon, wryneck, hoopoe and nightjar.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> - as a Mediterranean bird, it can {{be found}} in the heather and gorse as these offer {{relatively}} warm microclimates for them.|$|E
50|$|The type {{locality}} of the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> is Provence in France. This species probably forms a superspecies with Tristram's warbler {{and this}} in turn seems close to Marmora's warbler and the Balearic warbler. Altogether, this group of typical warblers bears a resemblance to the wrentit, the only species of Sylviidae from the Americas. However the wrentit is less {{closely related to the}} genus Sylvia than to the parrotbills. Its visual similarity to the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> group is an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
50|$|The hoarse, {{a little}} bit nasal call sounds like wed-wed or woid-woid. The warning cry is long-pulled, rough tschehr which resembles that of the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
50|$|These are small, long tailed, large-headed birds, overall {{very similar}} to their close {{relatives}} in the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> group. Marmora's warblers are grey above and below, lacking the brick-red underparts of the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler.</b> Adult males have darker patches on the forehead and between the eye and the pointed bill. The legs and iris are red. The song is a fast rattle. Immature birds can be confused with young Dartford warblers, which are also grey below, but Marmora's have a paler throat. Their iris is dark.|$|E

50|$|Balearic warbler (Sylvia balearica) is {{a typical}} warbler, genus Sylvia. It is endemic to the Balearic Islands. It groups with the Marmora's warbler, Tristram's warbler and the <b>Dartford</b> <b>warbler</b> (Helbig 2001, Jønsson & Fjeldså 2006).|$|E
