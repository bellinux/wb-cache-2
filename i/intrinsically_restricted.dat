40|$|The main {{argument}} {{in this article}} is that instead of attempting to establish the existence or the nonexistence of the European public sphere or public spheres, we could think of Europe as consisting of a multiplicity of networks, each having a public sphere or spheres of their own. The idea of seeing the public sphere {{from the point of view}} of networks is critical to the traditional Habermasian idea of conceiving the public sphere as something <b>intrinsically</b> <b>restricted</b> to national boundaries. The social and cultural networks operate in all areas of life. They have developed, transformed, and vastly expanded in time. It is difficult to make clear distinctions between different networks today as they can operate locally, nationally, trans-nationally, regionally, trans-regionally as well as globally. However, from the point of view of democratic theory it is still important to make a separation between these different spatial embodiments of the networks ! as they all indicate different modalities for democratic polities. Democracy needs to be thought differently on a local or national scale than on the trans-national or global scale. The idea of seeing the public sphere from the point of view of networks is critical to the traditional idea of conceiving the public sphere as something <b>intrinsically</b> <b>restricted</b> to national boundaries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: DNA repair in {{eukaryotic}} cells {{takes place}} in the context of chromatin, where DNA, including damaged DNA, is tightly packed into nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures. Chromatin <b>intrinsically</b> <b>restricts</b> accessibility of DNA repair proteins to the damaged DNA and impacts upon the overall rate of DNA repair. Chromatin is highly responsive to DNA damage and undergoes specific remodeling to facilitate DNA repair. How damaged DNA is accessed, repaired and restored to the original chromatin state, and how chromatin remodeling coordinates these processes in vivo, remains largely unknown. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (ACRs) are the master regulators of chromatin structure and dynamics. Conserved from yeast to humans, ACRs utilize the energy of ATP to reorganize packing of chromatin and control DNA accessibility by sliding, ejecting or restructuring nucleosomes. Several studies have demonstrated that ATP-dependent remodeling activity of ACRs plays important roles in coordination of spatio-temporal steps of different DNA repair pathways in chromatin. This review focuses on the role of ACRs in regulation of various aspects of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in the context of chromatin.

40|$|Biosensing {{based on}} nanophotonic {{structures}} {{has shown a}} great potential for cost-efficient, high-speed and compact personal medical diagnostics. While plasmonic nanosensors offer high sensitivity, their <b>intrinsically</b> <b>restricted</b> resonance quality factors and strong heating due to metal absorption impose severe limitations on real life applications. Here, we demonstrate an all-dielectric sensing platform based on silicon nanodisks with strong optically-induced magnetic resonances, which are able to detect a concentration of streptavidin of as low as 10 (- 10) M (mol L- 1) or 5 ng mL(- 1), thus pushing the current detection limit by at least two orders of magnitudes.

40|$|We review {{some recent}} {{results on the}} theory of {{scattering}} and more precisely on the local Cauchy problem at infinity in time for some long range nonlinear systems including some form of the Schr"odinger equation. We consider in particular the Wave-Schr"odinger system in space dimension 3, the Maxwell-Schr"odinger system in space dimension 3, the Klein-Gordon-Schr"odinger system in space dimension 2 and the Zakharov system in space dimensions 2 and 3. By {{the use of a}} direct method which is <b>intrinsically</b> <b>restricted</b> to the case of small Schr"odinger data and to the borderline long range case, one can prove the existence of solutions defined for large times and with prescribed asymptotic behaviour in time, without any size restriction on the Wave, Maxwell or Klein-Gordon data. Furthermore one obtains convergence rates of the solutions to their asymptotic forms as negative powers of t in suitable norms. Comment: latex 54 pages. Review articl...|$|E

Noncooperative self-assembly, also known as “temperature 1 ”, is where all tiles bind to each other if they match on at least one side. On the other hand, cooperative self-assembly requires that some tiles bind on at least two sides. Our result shows that the change from non-cooperative to cooperative binding qualitatively improves the range of dynamics and behaviors found in these models of nanoscale self-assembly. The result holds in both two and three dimensions; the latter being quite surprising given that three-dimensional noncooperative tile assembly systems simulate Turing machines. This shows that Turing universal behavior in self-assembly does not imply the ability to simulate all algorithmic self-assembly processes. In addition to the negative result, we exhibit a three-dimensional noncooperative self-assembly tile set capable of simulating any two-dimensional noncooperative self-assembly system. This tile set implies that, in a restricted sense, non-cooperative self-assembly is intrinsically universal for itself...|$|R
40|$|Replacing {{precious}} and nondurable Pt catalysts with cheap materials {{is a key}} issue for commercialization of fuel cells. Intriguing transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have attracted great attentions as promising economic alternatives to Pt catalysts due to their noble metal-like properties. However, most of as-synthesized TMNs are nanoparticles until now. Clearly, the practical catalytic activities of such materials have hitherto been <b>intrinsically</b> <b>restricted</b> by the relatively small surface area and poor crystallinity of nanoparticles. Here, highly porous and 2 ̆ 2 single-crystal-like 2 ̆ 2 Mo 2 N nanobelts with high density of nanopores have been synthesized on gram-scale. These novel Mo 2 N nanobelts exhibited high electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte even better than that of other non-Pt materials and appear to be promising Pt-free cathodic electrocatalysts in alkaline fuel cells. This discovery reveals {{a new type of}} metal nitride ORR catalyst and appear to be promising Pt-free cathodic electrocatalysts in alkaline fuel cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We relate derived {{categories}} of modules over rational DGA’s to {{categories of}} comodules over associated Hopf algebras, and we explain how this implies the equivalence of definitions of mixed Tate motives proposed by Bloch and Deligne. We also describe {{an approach to}} integral mixed Tate motives {{in terms of the}} derived categories of modules over certain E∞ algebras. We first explain some new differential homological algebra — alias rational homotopy theory — over a field of characteristic zero and then use it to show the equivalence of two proposed definitions of mixed Tate motives [8, 9, 5] in algebraic geometry. One of these has been proven to admit Hodge and étale realizations, but is <b>intrinsically</b> <b>restricted</b> to the rational world. The other can be linked up to a speculative definition of integral or modular mixed Tate motives, and we end by explaining some new differential homological algebra over arbitrary commutative rings that is necessary to make sense of this approach to mixed Tate motives. Let A be a commutative differential graded and “Adams graded ” k-algebra, abbreviated DGA, where k is a field of characteristic zero. Thus A is bigraded via k-modules A q (r), where q ∈ Z and r ≥ 0. We assume that A q (r) = 0 unless 2 r ≥ q. The differential and product behave as follows with respect to the gradings...|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli σE {{envelope}} {{stress response}} monitors and repairs the outer membrane, a function {{central to the}} life of Gram-negative bacteria. The σE stress response was characterized as a single-tier activation network comprised of ∼ 100 genes, including the MicA and RybB noncoding sRNAs. These highly expressed sRNAs were thought to carry out the specialized function of halting de novo synthesis of several abundant porins when envelope homeostasis was perturbed. Using a systematic target profiling and validation approach we discovered that MicA and RybB are each global mRNA repressors of both distinct and shared targets, and that the two sRNAs constitute a posttranscriptional repression arm whose regulatory scope rivals that of the protein-based σE activation arm. Intriguingly, porin mRNAs constitute only ∼ 1 / 3 of all targets and new nonporin targets predict roles for MicA and RybB in crosstalk with other regulatory responses. This work also provides an example of evolutionarily unrelated sRNAs that are coinduced and bind the same targets, but at different sites. Our finding that expression of either MicA or RybB sRNA protects the cell from the loss of viability experienced when σE activity is inadequate illustrates the importance of the posttranscriptional repression arm of the response. σE is a paradigm of a single-tier stress response with a clear division of labor in which highly expressed noncoding RNAs (MicA, RybB) endow a transcriptional factor <b>intrinsically</b> <b>restricted</b> to gene activation (σE) with the opposite repressor function...|$|E
