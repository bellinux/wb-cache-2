25|$|There {{are still}} 164 state-run grammar schools in existence. Only a few areas keep a formal grammar school system {{along the lines}} of the Tripartite System. In these areas, the eleven plus exam is used solely to {{identify}} a subset of children (around 25%) considered suitable for grammar education. When a grammar school <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> qualified applicants, other criteria are used to allocate places, such as siblings, distance or faith. Such systems still exist in Buckinghamshire, Rugby and Stratford districts of Warwickshire, the Salisbury district of Wiltshire and most of Lincolnshire, Kent, Reading and Medway.|$|E
25|$|Penalties {{are awarded}} {{if a player}} is caught offside, is {{involved}} in foul play, offends at the tackle, ruck or maul, or is involved in dangerous play at scrums and line-outs. Foul play includes intentionally or repeatedly offending, throwing the ball into touch, obstructing the opposition, or misconduct. Examples of misconduct are striking, stamping, kicking or tripping players, illegal tackles and contact with players after they have kicked the ball. Dangerous play at line-outs is pushing, charging, obstructing or levering on an opponent. Dangerous play at scrums is charging at opponents not correctly binding to opponents, the hooker swinging (using both feet to strike the ball), twisting, dipping or lifting an opponent collapsing. Other offences that result in penalties are if a team <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> players, wearing illegal clothing, throwing the ball deliberately into touch, intentionally knocking the ball on, not releasing the ball if taking into touch, incorrect numbers in a scrum, handing in the scrum and the scrumhalf kicking {{the ball in the}} scrum.|$|E
25|$|The clerk, {{standing}} in {{the centre of the}} portrait and uniting the two-halves, holds the music he is singing from, possibly entitled 'Farewell my Judy'. Jeremy Barlow speculates that this might be a sentimental love song. The two servants frame the picture, the black servant playing a pipe and tabor. The combination of these musical instruments had a popular accompaniment to dancing for several centuries, but was in decline in England by the eighteenth century. Barlow considers Hogarth's representation of the tabor pipe a poor one, arguing that it is too short and <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> holes to be the usual three-holed tabor pipe, the boy holds it too far up its length and does not cover all the holes. Barlow points out that Hogarth may have intended the instrument to be a flabiol instead. He also notes that the lively music the instruments would have produced would be unlikely to complement a sentimental ballad that the clerk appears to be singing, and instead suggests the painting combines and conflates a number of typical activities in the cabin into one scene.|$|E

Muhney was very pleased to be a series regular, comparing his status to becoming a family member in the show rather than [...] "someone who comes over for dinner occasionally." [...] Piz (Chris Lowell) was named after the director of the show's pilot episode, Mark Piznarski. He was created in order to give Veronica a male friend who was not upper class.

500|$|On 7 November 1943, Morshead became acting {{commander}} of New Guinea Force and Second Army on Mackay's departure {{to become the}} Australian High Commissioner to India. This became permanent on 20 January 1944. Major General Frank Berryman became {{commander of}} II Corps. Because of some sensitivities concerning the relative seniority of Berryman and Major General George Alan Vasey, Blamey placed Vasey's 7th Division directly under Morshead's command. Vasey soon chafed under Morshead's command, feeling that [...] "he <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> favourites both individually and collectively", with men who had served at El Alamein receiving preferential treatment. Morshead was in overall charge of the forces in New Guinea in the battles of Sattelberg, Jivevaneng, Sio and Shaggy Ridge. His perseverance was rewarded with the capture of Madang in April 1944.|$|E

Restrained Marko will be given subdermal silicon transplants giving him a hardened untraceable silicon armor. Dr. Octavius says that the experiment <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> flaws but Osborn commands him {{to go with it}} anyway. The experiment malfunctions and the silicon violently mutates him. His body evaporates into sand and Octavius, terrified, thinks he has just killed him. Suddenly, Marko reshapes himself, still made of sand, and viciously thrashes against the walls for them to let him out. Hammerhead and Osborn take him outside in their limousine, where Marko is able to reform himself in his old appearance. When they tell him he will work for [...] "the Big Man," [...] but he decides to go alone and leaves. Hammerhead is fine with that as it means they will now have a distraction for Spider-Man.|$|E
500|$|Surgery may be necessary, e.g. {{to relieve}} excess {{pressure}} on the cord, to stabilize the spine, or to put vertebrae back in their proper place. [...] In cases involving instability or compression, failing to operate can lead to worsening of the condition. Surgery is also necessary when something is pressing on the cord, such as bone fragments, blood, material from ligaments or intervertebral discs, or a lodged object from a penetrating injury. Although the ideal timing of surgery is still debated, {{studies have found that}} earlier surgical intervention (within 24 hours of injury) is associated with better outcomes. [...] Sometimes a patient <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early. Surgery is controversial because it has potential complications (such as infection), so in cases where it is not clearly needed (e.g. the cord is being compressed), doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of the patient's condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{scene in}} the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech seems {{to have come from}} two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur Ivan Boesky (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, [...] "Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|In principle, sprang may be {{regarded}} as a practical application of the fiber manipulation techniques used in the children's game known as cat's cradle. [...] Sprang is made by preparing a set of warp threads either on a rectangular frame or between a pair of beams. [...] The craftsperson then generates a fabric by interlinking the warp threads. [...] Unlike most textile production techniques that add new rows at the end of completed rows, sprang works upon the center of a group of fibers and the material grows inward from both ends with symmetrical top and bottom halves. [...] The craftsperson must maintain control of the center area or the structure unravels: most sprang worked upon <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> fibers to keep in hand, so rods or sticks maintain the appropriate fiber positions. [...] The fiber manipulation itself is done by the craftsperson's fingers. [...] Decorative patterns may be generated by regular variations in the fiber crossings. [...] As crossings accumulate the craftsperson beats the material flat with a stick. [...] Work continues with the material growing from both edges toward the middle until the center band becomes too tight to continue work. [...] The completed fabric is either separated into two identical items or permanently secured at the middle to stabilize the contrary twists. [...] In traditions where two halves of sprang are not severed by cutting, this center seam is a telltale sign of sprang manufacture.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} schools {{to move on}} to the state championship, they must achieve a winning {{percentage}} of [...]500 or greater by a pre-set date (the [...] "cut–off" [...] date).

Winning percentage alone, however, is not sufficient to qualify for the playoffs.
