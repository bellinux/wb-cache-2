They are equipped with sensors that measure ocean temperature and currents.|$|E

50|$|The Certification {{procedure}} is not compulsory - it is {{a service that}} is offered to manufacturers, who can use a Certificate of Suitability (CEP) in an application for a new market authorisation (MAA) or for a variation of an existing MAA. The Certification procedure centralises the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> {{for the benefit of}} regulatory authorities and industry alike, thus saving time and resources. For example, on average it takes three days for a regulatory authority to assess an Active Substance Master File (ASMF), which is the document submitted by a manufacturer of a medicine as part of its application for MAA (the ASMF contains complete information on an API or finished drug dosage form). If the CEP included in the ASMF is used in 10 countries, this assessment only needs to be done once, thus saving 27 days and the corresponding resources.|$|E

50|$|The Alaska North Slope {{region was}} {{identified}} by the USGS as an important hydrate-bearing region in the United States. Current USGS estimates indicate ~ (Tcf) of technically recoverable gas resources from hydrate accumulations in this region. Drilling within the greater Prudhoe Bay region has enabled the delineation and evaluation of two trends in particular {{that have been the}} focus of recent studies, the Eileen and Tarn trends. The Eileen trend was first indicated by dedicated gas hydrate evaluation conducted in the Northwest Eileen State #2 exploration well in 1972 by Arco and Exxon. <b>Evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from hundreds of industry well logs enabled Collett to identify a number of extensive gas hydrate-bearing sand horizons that occurred largely below the base of permafrost. Subsequently, drilling problems with the 1991 Cirque-1 well confirmed the occurrence of extensive gas hydrates commingled with the permafrost (the Tarn trend) in an area just west to the Eileen accumulations. These natural gas hydrate trends coincide with portions of established oil reservoirs within the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field (Prudhoe Bay Unit - PBU), Kuparuk River Unit (KRU), and Milne Point Unit (MPU) and are situated within and beneath a thick layer of permafrost at a depth of up to 600 meters below the surface. This area is located along the northernmost boundary of the Colville Basin, which initially formed during a Jurassic-Cretaceous rifting event that resulted in the separation of the North American margin to the south and the Arctic Composite Terrane to the north. Due to a slow but constant subsidence rate and a relatively steady flux of clastic sediments into the Colville Basin, the basin has grown and evolved during the last 120 million years and is now bounded by the Brooks Range mountain front to the south and east and by the Barrow Arch to the north, which roughly follows the Alaskan-Beaufort coastline.|$|E
