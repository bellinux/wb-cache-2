40|$|For over eighty years, the League of Women Voters {{has been}} a voice for women and men of all backgrounds, rising above {{partisan}} disputes to help citizens fully and intelligently exercise their rights [...] and their responsibilities [...] as participants in the American experiment. The League has earned a reputation for integrity and fairness, and generations have relied upon League resources to help them {{make the kind of}} informed decisions that keep policymakers responsive and truly give weight and meaning to the hallowed phrase "consent of the governed. " The League has cultivated expertise on electoral behavior and public policy at national, state, and local levels, and {{has been a}} leader in identifying and researching political trends. In recent years, one of the most distressing trends has been the ongoing decline of civic participation, in the voting booth and beyond. If one measure of the health of democracy is the rate at which citizens participate in elections, the fitness of the American body politic has been spiraling downward ever since voter turnout peaked in 1960. Recognizing the need for new insights and strategies to attack this problem, the Chicago chapter of the League convened a Task Force of recognized experts and leaders from the community to spearhead an examination of the factors at play. Concerned organizations of many stripes have studied the situation over the years, but there has been no authoritative summary of what we know and what we yet need to learn that can be turned into real steps toward a solution. Why are people dropping out of the political process [...] {{and what can be done}} to draw them back? What creative strategies hold the most promise for capturing Americans' attention, raising their awareness, and inspiring them to participate? The Task Force's findings are often disturbing, yet they also give cause for optimism. Americans may be keeping to themselves in growing numbers, but they do not do so solely from apathy or indifference; and want only to be invited to share their views, to be assured that government will pay attention, to be shown how and why they can make a difference. Young people especially have felt shut out of the process, despite knowing as well as anyone what matters to them and their communities. It's time they were invited back in. In this deeply polarized political moment, it is vitally important that we remind all Americans that civic engagement isn't merely about the often arcane and alienating world of politics [...] it's a way to share in something bigger than ourselves, to express our devotion to our country and our community, to assure that (in Abraham Lincoln's timeless phrase) "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. " <b>Here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> that was home to the author of those words, in the city where he was nominated for the presidency, we can take the first steps toward reinvigorating the vision he expressed.

40|$|Former U. S. Sen. Chambliss {{kicks off}} {{semester}} of political, legal insights as Sanders Scholar at Georgia Law Thursday, August 27, 2015 Writer: Heidi M. Murphy, 706 - 583 - 5487, hmurphy@uga. edu Contact: Peter B. “Bo” Rutledge, 706 - 542 - 7140, borut@uga. edu Former U. S. Sen. Chambliss kicks off semester of political, legal insights as Sanders Scholar at the UGA law school Georgia Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Camila Knowles to co-teach Athens, Ga. – Students taking the course Political Leadership and the Law at the University of Georgia School of Law this semester are receiving firsthand insights into public service from former U. S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. He is co-teaching the class {{for the fall}} 2015 semester with his former chief of staff, Camila Knowles, who is now serving as commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. The first class was held today, Aug. 24, 2015. Georgia Law Dean Peter B. “Bo” Rutledge said having Chambliss and Knowles teach a class addressing {{the intersection of the}} law and political leadership is a tremendous honor for Georgia Law. “In this class, our students will not only interact and learn directly from two accomplished public servants but they {{will have the opportunity to}} meet and have meaningful dialogue with other political leaders—such as Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal—who will be invited classroom guests,” he said. “There is no question that this class will be one of the highlights of a student’s academic career at Georgia Law—especially for those who are interested in pursuing a career in public service. ” Ashley M. Walker, a Georgia Law second-year student, said she is excited to be enrolled in the Political Leadership and the Law course. “Former Sen. Chambliss has been an influential figure in state and national politics, and I cannot wait to learn from his experiences,” she said. Chambliss is serving as the law school’s Sanders Political Leadership Scholar, which is part of the university’s three-part Senator Saxby Chambliss Leadership Forum announced earlier this month. While on campus, he will have an office in the Dean Rusk International Law Center. Chambliss said he is honored to be returning to UGA as the law school’s Sanders Political Leadership Scholar. “I am looking forward to sharing my experience of 20 years in public service with tomorrow’s leaders,” he said. “The University of Georgia School of Law is one of the top law schools in America, and to have the opportunity to be a part of the faculty is veryhumbling. ” Knowles said she is excited and honored to join Chambliss in the classroom. “I look forward to a rewarding and robust dialogue with the bright law students who have an interest in public service law,” she said. “I hope this class may spark a desire for these future leading lawyers to seek a career in service of our state and our nation. ” Rutledge said having proven leaders, who have distinguished themselves in the public sector, teach law students with real examples of how the law and government truly work together is what the late Gov. Carl E. Sanders envisioned with the Sanders Political Leadership Scholar position. “Gov. Sanders truly cared about today’s law students getting an excellent, affordable legal education right <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of Georgia as well as having the opportunity to learn the true meaning of service,” he said. Established in 2002, the Sanders Political Leadership Scholar position is named for Georgia’s 74 th governor and 1948 Georgia Law alumnus, Carl E. Sanders. Previous Sanders Political Leadership Scholars who have taught a course at the law school include former U. S. Sen. J. Maxwell “Max” Cleland, former U. S. Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr., former Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, former U. S. Ambassador to the Republic of Poland Lee A. Feinstein, former U. S. Department of Commerce Deputy Secretary Theodore “Ted” W. Kassinger, and former Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox, among others. Chambliss served two terms in the U. S. Senate and four terms in the U. S. House of Representatives. He was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee; the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; and the Senate Rules Committee. He also served as vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Chambliss earned his bachelor’s degree from UGA and his law degree from the University of Tennessee. Knowles was appointed as commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs by Deal in 2015. Knowles first joined Chambliss’ team in 2003. Previously, she served as a legislative assistant and chief counsel for him in Washington, D. C., before moving to his Atlanta office as state director. She was named his chief of staff in 2013. Knowles earned her bachelor’s degree cum laude from Harvard University and her law degree from Georgetown University. UGA School of Law Consistently regarded as one of the nation’s top public law schools, Georgia Law was established in 1859. Its accomplished faculty includes authors of some of the country’s leading legal scholarship. The school offers three degrees – the Juris Doctor, the Master of Laws and the Master in the Study of Law – and is home to the Dean Rusk International Law Center. Georgia Law is proud of its long tradition of providing first-rate legal training for future leaders who will serve state and nation in both the public and private sectors.
