50|$|The Great Divide is {{the major}} <b>hydrological</b> <b>divide</b> of North America. Along the GDT, the Great Divide {{separates}} water flowing into the Pacific Ocean to the west (via the Columbia River) from Hudson Bay (via the North Saskatchewan River) and the Arctic Ocean (via the Athabasca River) to the east.|$|E
50|$|The Spanish Peaks, avg el. 8441 ft, is a {{mountain}} range between Bozeman, Montana and Ennis, Montana in Gallatin and Madison County, Montana. It is a sub-range {{of the much}} larger Madison Range, itself a sub-range of the Rocky Mountains. The <b>hydrological</b> <b>divide</b> of the range serves as the border between Gallatin and Madison County, Montana. The Spanish Peaks {{are made up of}} 1.6 billion year-old gneiss, making them the oldest peaks in the Madison Range, predating the rest of the range by 50-60 million years. Gallatin Peak, el. 11,015 ft., is the highest peak in the group.|$|E
50|$|The Continental Divide of the Americas (also {{known as}} the Great Divide, the Continental Gulf of Division, or merely the Continental Divide) is the principal, and largely mountainous, <b>hydrological</b> <b>divide</b> of the Americas. The Continental Divide extends from the Bering Strait to the Strait of Magellan, and {{separates}} the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean from those river systems that drain into the Atlantic Ocean (including those that drain into the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea) and, along the northernmost reaches of the Divide, those river systems that drain into the Arctic Ocean.|$|E

5000|$|Grdelica Gorge (Grdelička klisura) - one of {{the most}} famous gorges in Serbia, a valley narrow which is 33 {{kilometers}} long (48 by the river course) and up to 550 meters deep. Gorge is carved between the mountains of Kukavica on the west and Čemernik on the east. The highest point above the gorge is orographic (geomorphological) water divide of the Pannonian and Aegean basins, which doesn't correspond with <b>hydrological</b> <b>divide</b> of the South Morava watershed (which spread south of it, too). Due to the deforestation, Grdelica gorge is an area of excessive erosion, which is the main reason for the elevation of the river bed of the Great Morava downstream and flooding in the Great Morava Valley. In the gorge area, erosion as a result has floods, torrents, inundations, trenching, etc. Largest settlement, Vladičin Han is at the entrance, while Grdelica, after which the gorge is named, at the exit. Other settlements in the gorge include Džep and Predejane.|$|E

50|$|Though {{there are}} many other <b>hydrological</b> <b>divides</b> in the Americas, the primary Continental Divide (Great Divide) {{is by far the most}} {{prominent}} of these because it tends to follow a line of high peaks along the main ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Andes, at a generally much higher elevation than the other hydrological divisions.|$|R

In this paper, the Mallat algorithm and Daubechies wavelet are used to conduct wavelet transform on hydrological sequences. Through k-level wavelet transform, the <b>hydrological</b> sequences are <b>divided</b> into approximate part A and detailed part B with different time scales. The sequence length at the k-th level is 1 / 2 k times {{of the length of}} the original sequence. Thus the efficiency of the algorithm is improved.

40|$|Land use/cover is an {{important}} watershed surface characteristic that affects surface runoff and erosion. Many of the available <b>hydrological</b> models <b>divide</b> the watershed into Hydrological Response Units (HRU), which are spatial units with expected similar hydrological behaviours. The division into HRU's requires good-quality spatial data on land use/cover. This paper presents different approaches to attain an optimal land use/cover map based on remote sensing imagery for a Himalayan watershed in northern India. First digital classifications using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and a decision tree classifier were applied. The results obtained from the decision tree were better and even improved after post classification sorting. But the obtained land use/cover map was not sufficient for the delineation of HRUs, since the agricultural land use/cover class did not discriminate between the two major crops in the area i. e. paddy and maize. Therefore we adopted a visual classification approach using optical data alone and also fused with ENVISAT ASAR data. This second step with detailed classification system resulted into better classification accuracy within the 'agricultural land' class which will be further combined with topography and soil type to derive HRU's for physically-based hydrological modelling...|$|R

40|$|The river hydrologic {{regime is}} {{a driving force}} of the river ecosystem. Operation of dams and sluices has {{significant}} impacts on rivers’ hydrological situation. Taking {{the example of the}} Shaying River, the Jieshou hydrologic section was selected to study the influence of the sluice and all its upstream dams on the hydrologic regime. Using 55 years of measured daily flows at Jieshou hydrologic station, the <b>hydrological</b> date were <b>divided</b> into two series as pre- and post-impact periods. Based on the IHA, the range of variability in 33 flow parameters was calculated, and the hydrologic alteration associated with dams and sluices operation was quantified. Using the RVA method, hydrologic alteration at the stream gauge site was assessed to demonstrate the influence of dams on the hydrological condition. The results showed that dams have a strong influence on the regime; the river eco-hydrological targets calculated in this study can afford some support for water resources and ecosystem management of Shaying River...|$|R
40|$|Current, {{temperature}} and salinity data, {{collected during the}} ASCOP experiment that {{was carried out in}} the eastern part of the North Adriatic in summer 1989, have been analyzed together with related meteorological and <b>hydrological</b> data. After <b>dividing</b> the current series into three nearly equal subintervals, residual currents have been calculated for each of them. The major feature this exercise revealed was variability at a time scale of about ten days. A similar phenomenon has been observed by Italian researchers in the northeastern part of the Adriatic during several summers. It has been shown in the paper that the wind episodes registered during the experiment, although inducing remarkable changes in {{temperature and}} salinity records, did not directly generate the observed current variability. The changes in the Po River outflow have also been ruled out as the cause of the observed current reorientation. Temperature data collected in the area have pointed to stratification as the factor controlling the observed current variations. The stratification itself was influenced by buoyancy fluxes and wind forcing. However, further theoretical and empirical work is needed to establish conclusive evidence and elaborate dynamics of the observed phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Rain is not {{uniform in}} time and space in {{semiarid}} areas and its distribution is very important for the runoff process. <b>Hydrological</b> studies usually <b>divide</b> rainfall into events. However, defining rain events is complicated, and rain characteristics vary depending on how the events are delimited. Choosing a minimum inter-event time (MIT) is a commonly used criterion. Our hypothesis {{is that there will be}} an optimal MIT that explains the maximum part of the variance of the runoff, with time to runoff used as a surrogate. The objective is to establish a procedure in order to decide upon this optimal MIT. We developed regressions between time to runoff (T 0) and three descriptive variables of rain. Our results show that the optimum MIT is 1 hour, which seems to be the minimum period of time required for water in larger macropores to drain and sufficiently modify the effect of antecedent soil moisture on the runoff generation process. Rain events are classified into three significantly different groups: (1) large and intense rains, (2) light rains on wet soil, and (3) light rains on dry soil. Intense rains produce most of the runoff, but there were significant differences between small events in the runoff generated. Of rain events, 63. 75 % are single-tip events, and many could be dew...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to give more intense rainfall events, while urbanisation leads to more impervious surfaces. This combined with growing cities, increase the stress on the existing storm water infrastructure, and may result in more frequent flooding in urban areas. The land use in urban catchments affects the stormwater runoff patterns. More impervious surfaces lead to runoff hydrographs reaching the flood peaks faster, and having higher peaks. Having green spaces and water retention on the other hand, results in hydrographs with a shape more similar to natural conditions: smaller peaks reaching maxima later. To do urban hydrology assessments, e. g. for understanding the effects of land use changes, modelling of the hydrological processes in an urban area might be beneficial. Hydrological models can simulate the runoff patters from a catchment based on input parameters such as soil properties and rainfall patterns. Spatially distributed hydrological models are <b>hydrological</b> models that <b>divides</b> a catchment into smaller cells, {{each with its own}} properties and input parameters. Spatially distributed hydrological models used in Norway today do not consider the mechanisms of infiltration and are therefore not applicable for urban hydrology assessments. This thesis therefore suggests including infiltration by implementing an infiltration routine in a hydrological model. The infiltration model Green-Ampt with redistribution Tablot and Ogden (GARTO) was chosen to create the base of the routine. Further, the widely used hydrological model Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model was chosen for implementation of the infiltration routine. The HBV model already exists in open source database gihub, under Statkraft Hydrological Forecasting Tools (SHyFT). The routine was coded separately in C++ and the results were compared to results from Lai et al. (2015). The routine was also tested against infiltration and soil moisture data of a green roof in Trondheim. The code was then implemented in SHyFT. The comparison to the results from Lai et al. (2015) gave satisfactory results. The routine also managed to match parts of the results from a green roof. A sensitivity analysis on the soil properties shows that saturated conductivity is the most sensitive soil moisture constant. Further the routine match good with expected infiltration responses...|$|R
