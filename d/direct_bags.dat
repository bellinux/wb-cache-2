BUSHEY {{is a new}} post town; having {{previously}} {{been part of the}} WD2 district of WATFORD. This was due to postcode exhaustion of WD1 and WD2 Another reason for the postcode revision was the old WD2 area included Bushey with North Watford. Bushey was to all intents a section of Watford sorting office up until 2000, all mail for WD2 was cut and tipped at Watford office. To change this new codes were created to enable <b>direct</b> <b>bags</b> to be opened at Bushey delivery office. Local union reps claim (archaic) that the reason Bushey Delivery Office was included with Watford was so Watford postal workers would attract outer London weighting as Bushey was in the London Metropolitan Police area at the time.|$|E
50|$|One {{way to make}} a {{parachute}} open very quickly is to use a static line or <b>direct</b> <b>bag.</b> These devices form an attachment between the parachute and the jump platform, which stretches out the parachute and suspension lines as the jumper falls, before separating and allowing the parachute to inflate. This method enables the very lowest jumps — below 60 m — to be made, although most BASE jumpers are more motivated to make higher jumps involving free fall. This method is similar to the paratrooper's deployment system, also called a PCA (Pilot Chute Assist).|$|R
50|$|Protestors {{worked to}} block {{access to the}} actual {{swearing}} in ceremony. Tickets were given out only by state senators and representatives, and a few RNC officials. Ticketholders, who were {{from all over the}} country, were advised not to bring backpacks or bags, and were told such items wouldn't be allowed through security. Protestors obtained tickets, and then brought large bags to the event, clogging security checkpoints. Rather than <b>directing</b> all <b>bag</b> holders to one security screening line, security officials allowed the lines to be clogged, preventing many people from entering the secured area to view/hear President Bush and Vice-President Cheney. Protesters standing in line cheered the success of their actions, and were quite pleased that they denied people the opportunity to see the ceremony.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBcl- 2 {{associated}} athanogene 3 (BAG 3) has a {{modular structure}} {{that contains a}} BAG domain, a WW domain, a proline-rich (PxxP) domain to mediate potential interactions with chaperons and other proteins that participate {{in more than one}} signal transduction. In search for novel interacting partners, the current study identified that 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP 78) was a novel partner interacting with BAG 3. Interaction between GRP 78 and BAG 3 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown. We also identified that the ATPase domain of GRP 78 and BAG domain of BAG 3 mediated their interaction. Counterintuitive for a prosurvival protein, BAG 3 was found to promote the cytotoxicity of breast cancer MCF 7, thyroid cancer FRO and glioma U 87 cells subjected to genotoxic stress. In addition, the current study demonstrated that BAG 3 interfered with the formation of the antiapoptotic GRP 78 -procaspase- 7 complex, which resulted in an increased genotoxic stress-induced cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of GRP 78 significantly blocked the enhancing effects of BAG 3 on activation of caspase- 7 and induction of apoptosis by genotoxic stress. Overall, these results suggested that through <b>direct</b> interaction <b>BAG</b> 3 could prevent the antiapoptotic effect of GRP 78 upon genotoxic stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of ambient temperature on exhaust emissions for an instrumented Euro 1 SI car was determined. A real world test cycle was used, {{based on an}} urban drive cycle that {{was similar to the}} ECE urban drive cycle. It was based on four laps of a street circuit and an emissions sample bag was taken for each lap. The bag for the first lap was for the cold start emissions. An in-vehicle <b>direct</b> exhaust dual <b>bag</b> sampling technique was used to simultaneously collect exhaust samples upstream and downstream of the three-way catalyst (TWC). The cold start tests were conducted over a year, with ambient temperatures ranging from – 2 °C to 32 °C. The exhaust system was instrumented with thermocouples so that the catalyst light off temperature could be determined. The results showed that CO emissions for the cold start were reduced by a factor of 8 downstream of catalyst when ambient temperature rose from - 2 °C to 32 °C, the corresponding hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by a factor of 4. There was no clear relationship between NOx emissions and ambient temperature. For subsequent laps of the test circuit the reduction of CO and HC emissions as a function of ambient temperature was lower. The time for catalyst light off increased by 50...|$|R

40|$|Many age-related {{neurodegenerative}} {{disorders such as}} Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and polyglutamine disorders, including Huntington’s disease, {{are associated with the}} aberrant formation of protein aggregates. These protein aggregates and/or their precursors are believed to be causally linked to the pathogenesis of such protein conformation disorders, also referred to as proteinopathies. The accumulation of protein aggregates, frequently under conditions of an age-related increase in oxidative stress, implies the failure of protein quality control and the resulting proteome instability as an upstream event of proteinopathies. As aging is a main risk factor of many proteinopathies, potential alterations of protein quality control pathways that accompany the biological aging process could be a crucial factor for the onset of these disorders. rnrnThe focus of this dissertation lies on age-related alterations of protein quality control mechanisms that are regulated by the co-chaperones of the BAG (Bcl- 2 -associated athanogene) family. BAG proteins are thought to promote nucleotide exchange on Hsc/Hsp 70 and to couple the release of chaperone-bound substrates to distinct down-stream cellular processes. The present study demonstrates that BAG 1 and BAG 3 are reciprocally regulated during aging leading to an increased BAG 3 to BAG 1 ratio in cellular models of replicative senescence as well as in neurons of the aging rodent brain. Furthermore, BAG 1 and BAG 3 were identified as key regulators of protein degradation pathways. BAG 1 was found to be essential for effective degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins by the ubiquitin/proteasome system, possibly by promoting Hsc/Hsp 70 substrate transfer to the 26 S proteasome. In contrast, BAG 3 was identified to stimulate the turnover of polyubiquitinated proteins by macroautophagy, a catabolic process mediated by lysosomal hydrolases. BAG 3 -regulated protein degradation was found to depend on the function of the ubiquitin-receptor protein SQSTM 1 which is known to sequester polyubiquitinated proteins for macroautophagic degradation. It could be further demonstrated that SQSTM 1 expression is tightly coupled to BAG 3 expression and that BAG 3 can physically interact with SQSTM 1. Moreover, immunofluorescence-based microscopic analyses revealed that BAG 3 co-localizes with SQSTM 1 in protein sequestration structures suggesting a <b>direct</b> role of <b>BAG</b> 3 in substrate delivery to SQSTM 1 for macroautophagic degradation. Consistent with these findings, the age-related switch from BAG 1 to BAG 3 was found to determine that aged cells use the macroautophagic system more intensely for the turnover of polyubiquitinated proteins, in particular of insoluble, aggregated quality control substrates. Finally, in vivo expression analysis of macroautophagy markers in young and old mice as well as analysis of the lysosomal enzymatic activity strongly indicated that the macroautophagy pathway is also recruited in the nervous system during the organismal aging process. rnrnTogether these findings suggest that protein turnover by macroautophagy is gaining importance during the aging process as insoluble quality control substrates are increasingly produced that cannot be degraded by the proteasomal system. For this reason, a switch from the proteasome regulator BAG 1 to the macroautophagy stimulator BAG 3 occurs during cell aging. Hence, it can be concluded that the BAG 3 -mediated recruitment of the macroauto-phagy pathway is an important adaptation of the protein quality control system to maintain protein homeostasis in the presence of an enhanced pro-oxidant and aggregation-prone milieu characteristic of aging. Future studies will explore whether an impairment of this adaptation process may contribute to age-related proteinopathies...|$|R
