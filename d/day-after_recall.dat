The <b>day-after</b> <b>recall</b> study, taken in October-November 2012, shows that approximately 300.000 Moldovans every evening watch ProTV Chișinău's news at 20.00.|$|E
50|$|The {{predominant}} {{copy testing}} {{measure of the}} 1950s and 1960s, Burke's <b>Day-After</b> <b>Recall</b> (DAR) was interpreted to measure an ad’s ability to “break through” {{into the mind of}} the consumer and register a message from the brand in long-term memory (Honomichl). Once this measure was adopted by Procter and Gamble, it became a research staple (Honomichl).|$|E
50|$|The aim of {{post-testing}} is {{to provide}} indicators of how well a given campaign is achieving the desired communications objectives, so that corrective action and fine-tuning can occur during the campaign {{as well as to}} evaluate the effectiveness of advertising expenditure in order to provide benchmarks for future advertising programs. Techniques used in post-testing depend on the media employed, and may include such tests as Starch scores, <b>day-after</b> <b>recall</b> tests (DAR), campaign tracking, advertising ROI and other measures.|$|E

This extra length provides space for additional claims and repetition of brand associations, which should increase overall advertising effectiveness. We find that one exposure to a transformational interactive TV ad {{is more effective than}} one exposure to a 30 -second ad, and just as effective as three exposures in terms of attitude towards the ad, attitude towards the brand, and purchase intention. We also found that the interactive ad generated more cognitive elaboration than either one or three exposures to a 30 -second ad. For <b>day-after</b> <b>recall,</b> the interactive ad was more effective than one exposure to a 30 -second ad. However, in comparison with three exposures, the evidence was not conclusive. When a high frequency is required (as it is for transformational ads), but repeat exposure is difficult to generate (as audiences get more fragmented), interactive TV ads offer media planners a solution, and may rewrite the rules of media planning...|$|E
