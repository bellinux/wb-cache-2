40|$|The {{increase}} in direct personal investment in capital market assets by Australians {{over the past}} two decades represents an unprecedented engagement with that sector of Australian economic life. This dissertation critically investigates claims that this engagement heralds a shareholder democracy. Increased economic participation based on private direct ownership of corporate securities could be interpreted as a weak form of democratisation. Using a class-theoretical framework, the dissertation conceptualises the private shareholder phenomenon as a process of embourgeoisement and argues that the development of a macro-level mass consumer financial products market is the result of capitalist class development and expansion. A thesis of strong democratisation proffers the notion that the private shareholder, as an ascendant class of <b>financial</b> <b>actor,</b> engages with real democratic processes in addition to simply owning securities. To test this thesis the dissertation measures the extent to which small shareholders control the objective conditions under which they accumulate greater wealth by seeking evidence of potential or actual engagement with macro-market and meso-corporate level social processes. The dissertation assesses macro-level practice by drawing on the work of Bourdieu and on notions of the social field. It considers the entry of the new class of <b>financial</b> <b>actor</b> to the <b>financial</b> field and analyses their capacity to accumulate and deploy informational capital, and compares their ability to influence a state-sponsored economic reform process (CLERP) with that of other actors. The dissertation analyses longitudinal ownership and shareholder voting data from a set of over 30 major Australian companies. It finds that the new class of economic actor is most prevalent in privatised state-owned enterprises and mutuals. In the context of an ideal Habermasian public sphere, the study considers the potential for small shareholders to participate in meso-level, corporate agenda-setting and deliberation. Using the ideal political space of Arendt, it searches for methods of achieving democratic outcomes. The dissertation finds that while the personal ownership of tradable financial assets may constitute a weak form of economic democratisation, small shareholders&# 146; inability to influence real outcomes, even in companies in which they constitute the majority, places substantial restrictions on the overall strength of the share ownership-as-democracy thesis...|$|R
40|$|I am very {{grateful}} to Libby Assassi, Marc Flandreau, and the various anonymous referees and editors of the Review of International Political Economy for their valuable comments and suggestions. Conventional theories of international hegemony all agree {{on the fact that}} the stabilizing functions of hegemons (i. e., nations which use their power to maintain orderly relations in a given issue-area) are positively correlated with their power. The public goods logic upon which this vision is founded posits that as any potential leader becomes more powerful in a given issue area, it will increasingly see its own welfare as synonymous with order in the entire constellation of relations within the issue area itself, and consequently have an incentive to provide the necessary public goods (i. e., the components of stability) to bring such order about. Monetary relations under the classical gold standard (1880 - 1914), however, demonstrated an entirely different set of circumstances.

The CMU is envisaged to include all 28 EU Members and to be fully build by 2019. Its construction will:#:: (A) Improve access to financing for all businesses across Europe and investment projects, in particular start-ups, SMEs and long-term projects.#:: (B) Increase and diversify the sources of funding from investors in the EU and all over the world, so that companies (including SMEs) in addition to the already available bank credit lending also can tap capital markets through alternative funding sources that better suits them.#:: (C) Make the capital markets work more effectively by connecting investors and those who need funding more efficiently, both within Member States and cross-border.#:: (D) Make the capital markets more shock resilient by pooling cross-border private risk-sharing through a deepening integration of bond and equity markets, herby also protecting it better against the risk for systemic shocks in the national financial sector.#: The establishment of the CMU, is envisaged {{at the same time to}} require a strengthening of the available tools to manage systemic risks of financial players prudently (macro-prudential toolkit), and a strengthening of the supervisory framework for <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> to ensure their solidity and that they have sufficient risk management structures in place (ultimately leading to the launch of a new single European capital markets supervisor). A harmonized taxation scheme for capital market activities, could also play an important role in terms of providing a neutral treatment for different but comparable activities and investments across jurisdictions.

40|$|Sparked by the {{conjunction}} of food, fuel, and financial crises, {{there has been}} an increasing awareness in recent years of the scarce and finite character of natural resources. Productive resources such as agricultural land have been touted by financial actors—such as merchant banks, pension funds, and investment companies—as providing the basis for a range of new “alternative” financial asset classes and products. While the drivers, motives, and rationales behind the increasing interest of turning farmland into a financial asset class have been traced by a number of scholars, the interpretations of, and interactions with, <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> at the community level have received less attention. Based on qualitative research in rural Australia, this paper reveals the grounds on which finance-backed investments have been accepted and accommodated by communities in rural Australia and delineates the reasons that have led to feelings of unease or refusal. The paper thereby demonstrates that the financialization of farmland is neither abstract nor one-sided but rather a multidimensional process that not only includes <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> but also the impacted rural populations in various ways. Positioning the activities of <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> in Australia within the emerging research on the financialization of farmland, the paper endorses context-sensitive analyses to better interpret these recent transformations of the agri-food system...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the recent}} period, many {{emerging}} market economies and commodity-exporting nations are experiencing unprecented growth and accumulating unprecedented amounts {{of foreign exchange}} reserves. The management of these foreign reserves {{has led to the}} emergence of an important <b>financial</b> <b>actor,</b> namely the sovereign wealth fund (SWF). While SWFs have existed {{in one form or another}} since the 1950 s, it is only recently that they have risen in prominence and been exposed to public scrutiny and debate. In this paper, we outline their possible impact on international financial stability. We conclude that SWFs are long-term investors who can play a stabilizing role in financial markets by supplying liquidity and reducing market volatility. SWFs are also contributing to the gradual unwinding of global imbalances as they gradually diversify their portfolios. While the potential for destabilization by one or more SWFs does exist if other investors mimic the same investment strategies, there is little evidence of this occurring during the recent period. Similarly, the rise of financial protectionism as host countries adopt rules to protect sensitive industries might unduly restrict global capital flows, but is not likely to destabilize the international financial system...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis brought into sharp relief fundamental {{questions about the}} social function and purpose of the financial system, including its relation to the “real” economy. This Article argues that, to answer these questions, we must recapture a distinctively American view of the proper relations among state, financial market, and development. This programmatic vision – captured in {{what we call a}} “developmental finance state” – is based on three key propositions: (1) that economic and social development is not an “end-state” but a continuing national policy priority; (2) that the modalities of finance are the most potent means of fueling continuous development; and (3) that the state, as the most potent <b>financial</b> <b>actor,</b> both must and often does pursue its developmental goals by acting endogenously – i. e., as a direct participant in private financial markets. In addition to articulating and elaborating the concept of the developmental finance state, this Article identifies and analyzes the principal modalities through which the modern American developmental finance state operates today. Finally, the Article proposes three broad strategic extensions of the existing modalities, with a view to enabling the emergence of a more ambitiously proactive and effective developmental finance state – and thus rediscovering a truly public-minded finance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the link between}} financialisation and emerging market government policy autonomy. It analyses the government bond markets of three case study countries: Brazil, Lebanon and Turkey. Using extensive interview data in the three countries, and interviews with <b>financial</b> market <b>actors</b> in London and New York, the study explores the investment behaviour {{of a range of}} investors: commercial banks; individual investors; mutual funds; pension funds and hedge funds. The thesis uses the framework of financialisation – measured by the ability to trade risk – to analyse both international and domestic investors. The study shows that increased financialisation, of both <b>financial</b> market <b>actors</b> and the structure of government bond markets, generally serves to reduce loyalty and therefore reduces government policy autonomy. However, it is demonstrated that initial financialisation – the development of pension and mutual funds – serves to increase autonomy. This is captured by the construction of an ‘autonomy curve’. The conclusions suggest an updating the use of Hirschman’s concept of voice, exit and loyalty in the analysis of financial markets, to give a greater emphasis on loyalty and to include the use of ‘disloyalty’, the ability to short securities. It is also argued that financialisation is the appropriate framework to analyse processes of change in financial markets. The thesis also makes observations as to the true extent of government policy autonomy in emerging market countries, and policy recommendations regarding those governments’ attitude to financialisation.
