But Wałęsa wouldn’t accept it. So there have been no meetings, except amongst themselves.|$|E

500|$|Robyn's debut studio album Robyn Is Here {{was issued}} in Sweden in 1995, {{followed}} by a North American release two years later. The record sold 1.5 million copies worldwide, per sales reports provided by BMG Sweden, and spawned the releases of the top-ten singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love". Robyn Is Here also achieved a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million units. In 1998, Robyn returned to Sweden after spending nearly 12 months on tour in North America. She told Billboard, [...] "I returned [...] from my year in the U.S. [...] I was so extremely tired of everything, <b>including</b> <b>myself</b> and my music."

500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, <b>including</b> <b>myself,</b> have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E

40|$|In 2014, I {{conducted}} a dissertation research study on doctoral students who became mothers {{for the first}} time during their program of study. I was such a student, although I did not <b>include</b> <b>myself</b> in that initial study. I studied these new “DocMama’s” to try to help them and to help others as I had found myself struggling through personal and structural challenges within the university. While I tried to keep our interviews “professional” where I was the one asking questions and they were answering, I found that the participants wanted to know about my experiences and wanted to hear suggestions, ideas, and challenges that I was experiences. I also found that what they were sharing was useful for my own life, such as considering new ways to consider the challenge of mothering in academia to specific steps they took to get support. From these interviews, it became clear that having a support system is particularly helpful when becoming (and being) a new mother in academia. The study led to a creation of an online support group that currently has a membership of over 100 women from around the globe, all who are confronting, or who have, been a “dissertating mama. ” In 2015, I followed up with the initial study and sought to bring more mothers in academia together, to highlight our presence. I found that I was drawn towards the creation of something for them, for us, together and while not a study, having another space to demonstrate our existence in academia has been embraced. Then in 2016, I checked back in with the original set of DocMama’s I interviewed to see how they were doing as they transitioned from their doctoral programs to their next careers. This time, I <b>included</b> <b>myself,</b> and as such found that I was now openly caring about them, and myself. These research studies and outcomes appear to be an outcome of when qualitative researchers care. I see it is the individual personal aspect that relates to this research which has allowed for useful outcomes. In so many ways I had been taught to not <b>include</b> <b>myself</b> in the research, or at the extreme to explain my positionality, but then try to bracket it so I could see the participants’ experience in more detail. Instead, I see the potential of caring as technique for qualitative research. Perhaps as an emergent method, just as arts-based research was once new in our discipline and even today has to be argued for its rigor, caring may be the next step of incorporation in qualitative research methodologies...|$|R

[...] Plagenhoef also cited it as the album's key song, alongside [...] "Written on the Forehead."

40|$|Teachers of {{morality}} – moral teachers Aristotelianism has exerted a powerful influence on moral education {{during the last}} quarter of a century. So pervasive has this influence been, that two of the most popular trends succeeding Kohlberg’s developmentalism are avowedly Aristotelian in origin: character education, based broadly on the tenets of virtue ethics, and social and emotional learning, derived from the concept of emotional intelligence. Devout Aristotelians, and I <b>include</b> <b>myself</b> among them, may grumble that those trends have rushed off too quickly in their own homemade directions. Character educationists seem at times to be overly concerned with the inculcation of a body of set traits but concerned too little with the development of critical moral wisdom (phronesis), and EQ theorists typically fail to heed Aristotle’s warning that emotional competence without moral depth is the mere calculated cleverness of a knave. Nevertheless those two approaches have unleashed an unprecedented interest in practical methods of moral education that clearly deserve to be labelled ‘Aristotelian’: moral habituation, sentimental education, service learning and the emulation of moral exemplars (see Kristjánsson, 2007) ...|$|R
