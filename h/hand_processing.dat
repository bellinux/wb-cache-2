He emphasised the idea that the design and production of an item should not be divorced from one another, and that where possible those creating items should be designer-craftsmen, thereby both designing and manufacturing their goods. In the field of textile design, Morris revived a number of dead techniques, and insisted on the use of good quality raw materials, almost all natural dyes, and <b>hand</b> <b>processing.</b> He also observed the natural world first hand to gain a basis for his designs, and insisted on learning the techniques of production prior to producing a design.|$|E

25|$|Pseudohyperkalemia {{occurs when}} the {{measured}} potassium levels is falsely elevated. This condition is usually suspected when patient is clinically well without any ECG changes. Mechanical trauma during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysed blood sample. Since exercise can cause elevated potassium levels, repeated fist clenching can cause transient rise in potassium levels. Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may only become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>processing</b> of heparinised, unclot blood does not cause falsely elevated potassium. In addition to that, high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases red blood cells fragility, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because formation of clot protect the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia may also be present, and is characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.|$|E

Background: It is important to detect cognitive decline at an early stage, especially before onset of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Processing speed and working memory are aspects of cognitive function that are associated with cognitive decline. Hand strength is an inexpensive, easily measurable indicator of cognitive decline. However, associations between <b>hand</b> strength, <b>processing</b> speed, and working memory have not been studied. In addition, the genetic and environmental structure of the association between hand strength and cognitive decline is unclear. We investigated phenotypic associations between <b>hand</b> strength, <b>processing</b> speed, and working memory and examined the genetic and environmental structure of the associations between phenotypes. Methods: <b>Hand</b> strength, <b>processing</b> speed (digit symbol performance), and working memory (digit span performance) were examined in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify phenotypic associations, and structural equation modeling was used to investigate the genetic and environmental structure of the association.

It {{has been considered}} important for the user interface of future computer aided conceptual design systems and what is hoped is that integration of, for instance, voice control, <b>hand</b> gesture/motion <b>processing,</b> and physical object scanning can increase both the semantic level and {{the efficiency of the}} interaction. In the area of computer mediated shape conceptualization, especially human hand motion detection and processing can play an important role. The authors' research focuses on the study of the opportunities offered by <b>hand</b> motion <b>processing</b> in shape conceptualization. As a first step they have studied {{the state of the art}} and analyzed the technologies applicable to <b>hand</b> motion <b>processing.</b> This paper reports on the findings. The various technologies have been sorted in four categories: direct incomplete, direct complete, indirect incomplete and indirect complete detection. First, the principles supporting this categorization are explained in Section 2. The next four sections of the paper investigate the hand motion detection and processing technologies. Section 7 discusses the characteristics and operational parameters from the aspect of using hand motion for shape input in conceptual design. Our conclusion is that the currently known technologies do not absolutely support processing of a language of hand motions that is under development for creative shape conceptualization. Therefore, the hand motion language needs to be redesigned and adapted to the best technology...|$|R

40|$|The {{hands are}} {{closely tied to}} {{language}} through their role in gestures, sign language, and the mirror neuron system for grasping. Studies within embodied cognition have found that motor resonance occurs when people observe graspable objects represented as pictures or words. This has led to questions {{about the influence of}} the hands on reading. This experiment investigated the effects of the <b>hands</b> on semantic <b>processing.</b> Participants completed a semantic categorization task and a visual task in two different postures: a proximal posture in which their hands were near the text, and a distal posture in which their hands were in their lap and out of view. It was hypothesized, in line with previous research, that semantic processing would be reduced when the hands were in the proximal posture because of a trade-off between semantic and spatial processing. To the contrary, results showed no effect from the <b>hands</b> on semantic <b>processing.</b> Response times were slower in the proximal posture condition than in the distal posture condition of the visual task. The semantic processing of tool words was faster for the proximal posture condition, but this was not significant. Results suggest that the effects of the <b>hands</b> on semantic <b>processing</b> are not robust, and that further research is necessary to clarify any influences of the hands on reading. Future experiments on a possible facilitation effect from the <b>hands</b> when semantically <b>processing</b> graspable objects would be beneficial in shedding light on the relationship between the hands and higher levels of cognition...|$|R

In the "anatomic" situation, each hand was in its homonymous hemispace; in the "crossed" one, each hand was held across the corporeal midline, in its heteronymous hemispace. Under both single and the double stimulation conditions, RBD patients detected stimuli delivered to the contralesional hand with lower accuracy in the anatomic than in the crossed position. This result suggests that somaesthetic deficits can be due not only to sensory but also to attentional factors, depending on the spatial position of the <b>hands.</b> <b>Processing</b> of sensory information in primary areas should not {{be influenced by the}} hemispatial position of the stimulated body part. These results suggest that somaesthetic deficits may stem not only from damage of primary sensory areas, as classically held, but also from damage of higher-order areas where information about stimuli, body parts, and extrapersonal space is integrated. Finally, the results show that sensory and attentional components of the deficit can be dissociated by using a very simple clinical test...|$|R
