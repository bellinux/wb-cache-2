5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
25|$|Whether Norie-Miller {{simply did}} not take to {{political}} life, or found it clashed too greatly with his business responsibilities or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> felt {{he was too old}} at 76 to give Parliament its proper attention, he decided not to contest the 1935 general election in November that year. There had clearly been some confusion about his candidacy and its joint support by local Liberal and Conservative Associations. Shortly before the election, a Captain Harry Houldsworth, looked set to contest the seat as a National Conservative but suddenly withdrew claiming he had misunderstood the local position and in the belief that Norie-Miller wished to continue. There was division in the Conservative ranks about whether to renew support for Norie-Miller. On 26 October, Norie-Miller did withdraw from the electoral race, citing medical reasons and the confusion of the position but the Unionists did not re-select Captain Houldsworth as their man, turning instead to Thomas Hunter, who was described in The Times newspaper as the Lord Provost of Perth and who could also rely on Liberal support. So no Liberal candidate of any stripe contested the 1935 general election in Perth which was won by the Unionists in a straight fight with Labour.|$|E
500|$|Andy {{decides he}} needs {{to make a move}} on Erin (Ellie Kemper) before the day is out, as he may {{otherwise}} never see her again due to the possible impending closure of Dunder Mifflin. While in character, he asks Erin out for a weekend date, but becomes unsure if he really asked her out, or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> simply asked out her murder mystery character, [...] "Naughty Nelly." [...] He is worried that Erin only agreed because Naughty Nelly is a promiscuous character.|$|E

500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season I was wondering whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach — there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are ahead of me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I imagine he will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E
500|$|His final race of 2016 was the Winter Challenge Stakes at Los Alamitos, {{the only}} time the horse had ever run at the track that had been his home {{training}} base. [...] In a race of a mile and a sixteenth against light competition, where he was as much as 6 horses wide, he won easily by 12 lengths and set a track record. The final race of his career was the Pegasus World Cup on January 28, 2017, where he drew the far outside post and ran a surprisingly poor race, was eased in the stretch, and finished ninth, well behind the winner, Arrogate. Arrogate's jockey, Mike Smith, commented, [...] "Chrome just didn't fire his race today at all." [...] Sherman commented [...] "This was the first bad race he has run for me." [...] The horse had fluid on his right knee after the race, and although the injury did not appear serious, Sherman theorized about the cause: [...] "It looks like he scrambled away from there and couldn't get his footing." [...] Arrogate's trainer, Bob Baffert, was also disappointed: [...] "I kept waiting for the matchup with Chrome, but he just didn't bring his race today. It's too bad." [...] X-rays taken after the race showed no bone injury, but California Chrome was a bit [...] "off" [...] in his gait. [...] Frank Taylor explained that no one knew what exactly happened, [...] "We don't know <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wrenched it or strained it, but it had a little filling, fluid and heat in it." [...] An equine chiropractor got a small [...] "pop" [...] when he stretched out the horse's leg. Clinical signs of injury went down, and he was shipped to Taylor Made Farm the next day, Sunday. By Monday he was allowed to go out and exercise in a paddock.|$|E
2500|$|Laughlin lectured on Jungian {{psychology}} at {{universities and colleges}} throughout the United States since the 1970s, including Yale University and Stanford University In 1995, because of his background in football and psychology, he {{was brought in to}} counsel University of Nebraska football player Lawrence Phillips after Phillips' suspension from the team. He said of Phillips at the time, [...] "He should not be rewarded by being allowed to play unless there is real substantive change. I don't mean surface change. But if he does change, then he's not only going to not batter this girl, he's not going to batter the girl he marries at 30 and 35. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> pretends to change, of course he {{should not be allowed to}} play, but Lawrence has already been sanctioned in ways other batterers on this campus are not".|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked whether}} the man's {{experiences}} had been a dream all along, Lynne responded: [...] "This is what I'd like to know, because it's baffled me since I wrote it, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has actually gone the future, or <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> thinking about it. ... It could be real, {{or it could be}} a dream... I'm not sure. I'd rather not say, because I don't know either. I'm supposed to, but I don't." ...|$|R

2500|$|Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari {{as well as}} tafsir {{have given}} an oral {{depiction}} of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when {{he is supposed to}} have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that [...] "Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion". Others say his face was flushed as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> had a bath ("a reddish man with many freckles on his face {{as if he had just}} come from a bath"). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as [...] "a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary". However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet [...] "did not say that Jesus was of red complexion", rather he was [...] "a man of brown complexion and lank hair". In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of [...] "moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair." ...|$|E

Hooty's great eyes grew brighter and fiercer. Without a sound he floated through the moonlight until he was just over Danny Meadow Mouse.|$|E
60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say that young Andy showed us all jolly quick that he hadn't come home just to be an {{ornament}} about the place. There was exactly one boss in the restaurant, and it was him. It come a little hard at first {{to have to be}} respectful to a kid whose head you had spent many a happy hour clumping for his own good in the past; but he pretty soon showed me I could do it if I tried, and I done it. As for Jules and the two young fellers that had been taken on to help me owing to increase of business, they would jump through hoops and roll over <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> looked at them. He was a boy who liked his own way, was Andy, and, believe me, at MacFarland's Restaurant he got it.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas {{admits that}} his songs have [...] "a radio sensibility". [...] He write songs he hopes people will like and doesn't strive to follow or set trends.

6000|$|Away I went, my head buzzing {{with the}} {{complicated}} order, and yet I {{had a very}} tolerable notion {{of what was to}} be done. The unreeving might have been achieved by any one, and I got through with that without difficulty; and, the mate himself helping me and directing me from the deck, the new rope was rove with distinguished success. This was the first duty I ever did in a ship, and I was prouder of it than of any that was subsequently performed by the same individual. The whole time I was thus occupied, Rupert stood lounging against the foot of the main-stay, smoking his segar like a burgomaster. His turn came next, however, the captain sending for him to the cabin, where he set him at work to copy some papers. Rupert wrote a beautiful hand, and he wrote rapidly. That evening I heard the chief-mate tell the dickey that the parson's son was likely to turn out a regular [...] "barber's clerk" [...] to the captain. [...] "The old man," [...] he added, [...] "makes so many traverses himself on a bit of paper, that he hardly knows at which end to begin to read it; and I shouldn't wonder <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> stationed this chap, with a quill behind his ear, for the v'y'ge." ...|$|E
