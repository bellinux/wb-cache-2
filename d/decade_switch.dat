50|$|The LINC {{control panel}} {{was used for}} {{single-stepping}} through programs and for program debugging. Execution could be stopped when the program counter matched a set of switches. Another function allowed execution to be stopped when a particular address was accessed. The single-step and the resume functions could be automatically repeated. The repetition rate could be varied over four orders of magnitude {{by means of an}} analog knob and a four-position <b>decade</b> <b>switch,</b> from about one step per second to about half of the full speed. Running a program at one step per second and gradually accelerating it to full speed provided an extremely dramatic way to experience and appreciate the speed of the computer.|$|E

They would then start the bedstead tape motor and lamp and, when the tape was up to speed, operate the master start switch.|$|R
40|$|This work investigates energy {{filtering}} in nanowires, where {{pass and}} stopbands are obtained by including superlattices in the wire. When {{a pair of}} such superlattices is placed in series, each being controlled by a gate, it {{can act as a}} transistor where the (mis-) alignment of its minibands turns the device on (off). It is shown that, in the ballistic current-regime, the transition between the on and off state occurs in a narrow gate-bias range, giving rise to sub- 60 mV per <b>decade</b> <b>switching</b> behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} inductor-based {{buck converter}} {{has been the}} default design for switched-mode voltage regulators for <b>decades.</b> <b>Switched</b> capacitor (SC) dc-dc converters, on the other hand, have traditionally been used in low power (80 % over a load range of 5 mA to 1 A) than surveyed competitive buck converters, while requiring less board area and less costly passive components. The topology and controller enable a wide input range of 7. 5 V to 13. 5 V. Controls based on feedback and feedforward provide tight regulation under worst case line and load step conditions. This work shows that the SC converter can outperform the buck converter, and thus the scope of SC converter application {{can and should be}} expanded...|$|R

5000|$|Channel 26's {{tenure as}} a CBS {{affiliate}} {{was far from}} successful. The station operated on a shoestring budget. It mostly served as a [...] "pass-through" [...] for automated CBS programming, and produced almost no local content. The fact that WNCT and WBTW provided at least Grade B coverage to {{some parts of the}} market did not help matters either. Further complicating matters, Raleigh's WRAL-TV, which had been available on cable in Wilmington for <b>decades,</b> <b>switched</b> from ABC to CBS a year after WJKA's sign-on. This move forced the fledgling station to compete against three of the strongest CBS affiliates in the Southeastern United States. Under those circumstances, WJKA barely registered as a blip in the local Nielsen ratings against rivals WECT and WWAY.|$|R
30|$|Switched {{systems are}} an {{important}} class of hybrid systems. Generally speaking, a switched system is composed {{of a family of}} subsystems described by differential or difference equations and a switching rule orchestrating the switching between the subsystems that have attracted much attention in control theory and practice during recent <b>decades.</b> <b>Switched</b> systems can be efficiently used to model many practical systems which are inherently multi-model in the sense that several dynamical systems are required to describe their behavior. For example, many physical processes exhibit switched and hybrid nature. Switched systems have strong engineering background in various areas and are often used as a unified modeling tool for a great number of real-world systems, such as power electronics, chemical processes, mechanical systems, automotive industry, aircraft and air traffic control and many other fields [1 – 6].|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Arguably, {{computer-aided}} design {{has emerged as}} the most significant change agent in manufacturing during the past <b>decade.</b> The <b>switch</b> from constructive solid geometry based solid modeling systems to parametric solid modeling has positively impacted manufacturing industries worldwide. Solid modeling technology has now advanced to a stage where it has become the precursor to a wide array of engineering analyses including finite element analysis. These recent developments suggest that we can make a case for a mandatory course in solid modeling enabled manufacturing analysis for all manufacturing engineering and technology majors. Until recently, the manufacturing engineering technology degree program at Northern Illinois University did not require students to take a course in solid modeling or kinematic analysis. This paper describes the efforts made by the authors to fill this void that existed in the curriculum. We pose a rationale for establishing a new course and describe the planning and specific implementation details of the resulting three-credit course in solid modeling and manufacturing analysis...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses research {{problems related}} to the switched system {{as well as its}} application to large-scale asynchronous dynamical systems. For <b>decades,</b> this <b>switched</b> system has been widely studied in depth, owing to the broad applica-bility of the switched system framework. For example, the switched system can be adopted for modeling the dynamics of numerous systems including power systems, manufacturing systems, aerospace systems, networked control systems, etc. Despite considerable research works that have been developed during last several decades, there are still remaining yet important and unsolved problems for the switched sys-tems. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, new methods are developed for uncertainty propagation of stochastic switched systems in the presence of the state uncertainty, represented by probability density functions (PDFs). The main difficulty of this problem is that the number of PDF components in the state increases exponentially under the stochastic switching, incurring the curse of dimensionality. This disser-tation provides a novel method that circumvents the issue regarding the curse o...|$|R
