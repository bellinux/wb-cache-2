25|$|On April 2, 2016, the Lightning {{announced}} that Stamkos {{was diagnosed with}} thoracic outlet syndrome, {{which is the same}} injury that sidelined teammate Andrei Vasilevskiy {{at the start of the}} season. It is a condition that is rare among hockey players. Stamkos said that he first felt some discomfort in his arm after the game against the Montreal Canadiens. He is scheduled for surgery on Monday with Dr. Karl Illig, who performed Vasilevskiy's surgery. Lightning General Manager, Steve Yzerman, stated that there will be no long-term impact on Stamkos' health or his career. In addition, Yzerman indicated that Stamkos recovery time would be between one and three months, but they would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>idea</b> in a couple of weeks where he falls within that time frame. Yzerman also stated that the team's desire is for Stamkos to remain with the organization, which came after a question of whether Stamkos had played his last game in a Lightning uniform. On April 4, 2016, Stamkos had successful surgery at Tampa General Hospital. Stamkos' surgeon stated that they plan on evaluating him in approximately two weeks and that should clear up his prognosis. On May 26, 2016, Stamkos dressed for game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins despite still being on blood thinners following surgery. He registered five shot attempts during the game, but the Lightning ultimately lost 2-1 and were eliminated from the playoffs.|$|E

60|$|The proper {{punishment}} for the Hohenzollerns, and the Hapsburgs, and the Mecklenburgs, and the Muckendorfs, and all such puppets and princelings, is {{that they should be}} made to work; and not made to work in the glittering and glorious sense, as generals and chiefs of staff, and legislators, and land-barons, but in the plain and humble part of laborers looking for a job; that they should carry a hod and wield a trowel and swing a pick and, at the day's end, be glad of a humble supper and a night's rest; that they should work, in short, as millions of poor emigrants out of Germany have worked for generations past; that there should be about them none of the prestige of fallen grandeur; that, if it were possible, by some trick of magic, or change of circumstance, the world should know them only as laboring men, with the dignity and divinity of kingship departed out of them; that, as such, they should stand or fall, live or starve, as best they might by the work of their own hands and brains.

Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.|$|R

Unlike the attacks on the left bank, the reinforced 28th Brigade quickly captured the outposts of the Ottoman positions. Following up on this initial success, the 92nd Punjabis broke through the main line of the Ottoman defenses, followed by 1st Leicestershire Regiment and 51st Sikhs.|$|R
