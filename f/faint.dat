5|$|The {{galaxies in}} the {{constellation}} are <b>faint.</b> IC 4633 is a very <b>faint</b> spiral galaxy surrounded by {{a vast amount of}} Milky Way line-of-sight integrated flux nebulae—large <b>faint</b> clouds thought to be lit by large numbers of stars.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 a dwarf galaxy, {{also named}} Coma Berenices, was {{discovered}} in the constellation. The galaxy is a <b>faint</b> satellite of the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe <b>faint</b> individual stars in the Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a <b>faint</b> image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2009, July 3, 2009, and August 8, 2009, {{use of the}} NIFS {{integral}} field spectrograph with ALTAIR {{allowed the}} astronomers {{to collect data on}} the spectrum of the <b>faint</b> object and its star. Analysis of the spectra and the objects' astrometry (how the star and the <b>faint</b> object change position in the sky) led to the confirmation of the companion HIP 78530 b.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Uranus's rings are opaque {{and only a}} few kilometers wide. The ring system contains little dust overall; it consists mostly of large bodies 0.2–20m in diameter. However, some rings are optically thin: the broad and <b>faint</b> 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν rings are made of small dust particles, while the narrow and <b>faint</b> λ ring also contains larger bodies. The relative lack of dust in the ring system may be due to aerodynamic drag from the extended Uranian exosphere.|$|E
5000|$|While the SAO catalog {{is more or}} less {{complete}} to V=9, with 4,503 stars <b>fainter</b> than V=10, the PPM catalog {{is fairly}} complete to V=9.5, with 102,672 stars <b>fainter</b> than V=10 and 22,395 stars <b>fainter</b> than V=11. Released after the original PPM, the PPM supplemental list was intended to render the PPM complete to magnitude V=7.5.

50|$|Mass <b>fainting</b> in Tanzania is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} of mass hysteria that is experienced by junior school girls in Tanzania. In September 2008, 20 girls at a school in Tabora started <b>fainting</b> while taking their final year exams. The mass <b>fainting</b> {{has been linked to}} neurosis related to the local practice of witchcraft.|$|R
5|$|Three small moons orbit between Mimas and Enceladus: Methone, Anthe, and Pallene. Named {{after the}} Alkyonides of Greek mythology, they {{are some of}} the {{smallest}} moons in the Saturn system. Anthe and Methone have very <b>faint</b> ring arcs along their orbits, whereas Pallene has a <b>faint</b> complete ring. Of these three moons, only Methone has been photographed at close range, showing it to be egg-shaped with very few or no craters.|$|E

5|$|A later {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} during the moment Dr. Brooks took the picture of Hurley and Dave, another patient was staring at Hurley from across the room, Libby (Cynthia Watros), which explains why Hurley has had this <b>faint</b> recognition of Libby while on the island.|$|E

50|$|Heat syncope is <b>fainting</b> or {{dizziness}} as {{a result}} of overheating (syncope is the medical term for <b>fainting).</b> It is a type of heat illness. The basic symptom of heat syncope is <b>fainting,</b> with or without mental confusion. Heat syncope is caused by peripheral vessel dilation, resulting in diminished blood flow to the heart and dehydration.|$|R
5|$|Actual {{proof of}} the Milky Way {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} <b>faint</b> stars.|$|E
5|$|All Russulaceae, {{including}} the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic basidiospores with a <b>faint</b> to very distinct (e.g. warty, spiny, or crested) ornamentation that stains bluish-black with Melzer's reagent (an amyloid stain reaction). Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species {{do not have}} clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its <b>faint</b> inner-surface plication (C.striatus has a more pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
5000|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology theory {{that explains the}} association to vasovagal syncope is that some forms of <b>fainting</b> are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter-group aggression during the paleolithic. A non-combatant who has <b>fainted</b> signals {{that they are not}} a threat. [...] This might explain the association between <b>fainting</b> and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries.|$|R

5|$|Evidence {{that the}} rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar {{occultation}} in 1984 when the rings obscured {{a star on}} immersion but not on emersion. Images from Voyager 2 in 1989 settled the issue by showing several <b>faint</b> rings.|$|E
5|$|Further out, a large <b>faint</b> halo {{extends to}} large {{distances}} from the star. The halo again predates {{the formation of}} the main nebula. The mass of the halo is estimated as 0.26–0.92 solar masses.|$|E

5|$|However, as the Earth {{gravity assist}} approached, astronomers {{were unable to}} locate Comet Boethin, which may have broken up into pieces too <b>faint</b> to be observed. Consequently, its orbit could not be {{calculated}} with sufficient precision to permit a flyby.|$|E
5|$|Hydrus {{contains}} only <b>faint</b> deep-sky objects. IC 1717 was a deep-sky object {{discovered by the}} Danish astronomer John Louis Emil Dreyer in the late 19th century. The object at the coordinate Dreyer observed is no longer there, {{and is now a}} mystery. It was very likely to have been a <b>faint</b> comet. PGC 6240, known as the White Rose Galaxy, is a giant spiral galaxy surrounded by shells resembling rose petals, located around 345 million light years from the Solar System. Unusually, it has cohorts of globular clusters of three distinct ages suggesting bouts of post-starburst formation following a merger with another galaxy. The constellation also contains a spiral galaxy, NGC 1511, which lies edge on to observers on Earth and is readily viewed in amateur telescopes.|$|E

The head is a sooty black, {{sometimes}} with a <b>faint</b> greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; {{the back and}} side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black. The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} <b>fainter</b> stars around Cygnus OB2 #12, thought to {{comprise}} a small cluster. Two stars are only resolved by speckle interferometry. One {{is thought to}} be a main sequence B star in a 100-200 year orbit. It is 2.3 magnitudes <b>fainter</b> than the primary star and 0.063" [...] away. The other is 4.8 magnitudes <b>fainter</b> and about an arc-second distant.|$|R
