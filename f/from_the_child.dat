They consider that Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) disappeared {{around the same time}} that Fauxlivia returned, and wonder what else Walternate is hiding from them.|$|E
5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E

By April 21, enhanced surveillance was established to search for additional cases in both California and Texas and the CDC determined that the virus strain was genetically similar to the previously known A(H1N1) swine flu circulating among pigs in the United States since about 1999.|$|E
25|$|On April 9, 2015, Penn State {{trustees}} {{voted to}} approve a settlement with “one or more” victims <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky.

As of November 27, 2015, the total amount that Penn State owed victims of the Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal was close to $93 million. An audit of the university’s financial statements for the 2015 year (ending June 30) revealed that Penn State had made new payments totaling $33.2 million that were all related to the actions of Jerry Sandusky. The audit also indicated that Penn State has already paid or agreed to pay 32 claims relevant to this matter.|$|E
25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to be}} significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{producers}} {{decided to}} have Shortland Street undergo a cot death storyline and {{the decision was made}} for the character of Ellen Crozier (Robyn Malcolm) to undergo it. Needing a suitable father character, writers paired Ellen with the relatively new character of David. Ellen and David had been dating for several months but the arrival of his ex-wife Isobel Kearney (Jennifer Ward-Lealand) lead to Ellen thinking the two had reconciled, causing her to flee to Fiji. In a specially shot episode in the country, David tracked her down and the two reconciled, only for Ellen to announce she was pregnant. The couple decided to get married to support the child and lured their friends to the ceremony under the pretense that it was Grace Kwan's (Lyentte Forday) birthday. Producers encountered a problem when developing the storyline, when they realized they had accidentally over run Ellen's pregnancy. A quick fill in story was devised where Ellen was nervous that the baby was so late. In the casting of Ellen and David's child, the daughter of the show's medical adviser was chosen. Having set the storyline up to unfold in 1998, crew members began to get cold feet due to the uneasiness of shooting the scene using one of their co workers own children and the fact that two of the storyliners had fallen pregnant. On screen, Ellen had an unscheduled birth, giving birth to Rose Crozier-Kearney (Georgia Bishop) in her bathroom, but help arrived in the form of Caroline Buxton (Tandi Wright) just in time. Due to the tenderness of the storyline, it was continuously pushed back until the stage where it was nearing the point of improbability. The plot was ultimately scheduled to air in the last possible week with the potential of cot death to occur. In February 1998, Ellen and David were shocked to discover her baby daughter Rose, had died in her sleep. The scene was shot with the baby's actress but Malcolm was directed to quickly pick her up and then the shot was changed to a close up, to avoid any movements <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> The couple's devastation at Rose's death saw them break up and date other characters. However, over a year later they finally put Rose to rest and reconciled. The storyline landed Malcolm with her first ever television acting nomination. The subject of a child's death was dealt with once more in the soap, 5 years later in the death of Te Ngakau Hudson.|$|E

500|$|With {{a newborn}} involved, the {{decision}} is made more complex due {{to the principles of}} respect for autonomy and consent, as a newborn cannot understand or engage in a logical discussion of his own values and best interests.

2500|$|Addiction to any substance, {{including}} crack, {{may be a}} {{risk factor}} for child abuse or neglect.

Mothers who continue to use drugs once their babies are born have trouble forming the normal parental bonds, more often interacting with their babies with a detached, unenthusiastic, flat demeanor. Conversely, low-stress environments and responsive caregiving may provide a protective effect on the child's brain, potentially compensating for negative effects of PCE.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fast-track}} trial {{opened on}} 6 April and was adjourned until 31 May. El Mahroug's lawyer said that Mahroug {{would not be}} attaching herself to the case as a civil complainant and denies that she ever made herself available for money. Another alleged victim, Giorgia Iafrate, also decided {{not to be a}} party to the case. In January 2013, judges rejected an application from Berlusconi's lawyers to have the trial adjourned so that it would not interfere with Italy's 2013 general election in which Berlusconi was participating. On 24 June 2013, Berlusconi was found guilty of paying El Mahroug for sex when she was 17 years old, and of abusing his powers in an ensuing cover up. He was sentenced by the Court of First Instance to seven years in jail, and banned from public office for life. In January 2014, Silvio Berlusconi deposited an appeal against the judgment, requesting complete absolution. The appeal process began on 20 June. On 18 July 2014, the Italian appeals court announced the appeal had been successful and the convictions against Berlusconi were being overturned. According to the court's published summary of the judgement, Berlusconi was acquitted from the extortion charges (abuse of power) because [...] "the fact does not exist" [...] and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> prostitution charge because [...] "the fact is not a crime".
