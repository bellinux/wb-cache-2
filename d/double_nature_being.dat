40|$|Conny Svensson, Hedenvind and Boccaccios kock (The Cook of Boccaccio). It is here {{argued that}} in the novel Boccaccios kock (1954) by the Swedish author Gustav Hedenvind-Eriksson the {{narrative}} strategy aims at creating expectations as to literary genre, which are never fulfilled. Thus, the prelude offers obvious associations to the classical historical novel {{in the tradition of}} Walter Scott, but then historical illusion is abandoned by means of anachronistic allusions to the author's own time. Existential questions concerning life and death are formulated as in a philosophical dialogue, but answers are never provided in the conversations. Instead this novel turns out to be an Allkunstwerk combining different genres, and also a metaliterary text about itself and conditions of literature in general. Paradoxes frequently recur; events are timeless as well as time-bound, man is immutable and changeable at the same time. The title of the novel suggests this <b>double</b> <b>nature</b> of man <b>being</b> earth­bound like the cook but also a dreaming visionary like Boccaccio the poet...|$|R
60|$|This {{did not in}} any way tend {{to lessen}} Mr. Markam's concern, but on the {{contrary}} seemed to impress the prophecy more deeply on his mind. Of all the books which he had read on his new subject of study none interested him so much as a German one Die Döppleganger, by Dr. Heinrich von Aschenberg, formerly of Bonn. Here he learned for the first time of cases where men had led a <b>double</b> existence--each <b>nature</b> <b>being</b> quite apart from the other--the body being always a reality with one spirit, and a simulacrum with the other. Needless to say that Mr. Markam realised this theory as exactly suiting his own case. The glimpse which he had of his own back the night of his escape from the quicksand--his own footmarks disappearing into the quicksand with no return steps visible--the prophecy of Saft Tammie about his meeting himself and perishing in the quicksand--all lent aid to the conviction that he was in his own person an instance of the döppleganger. Being then conscious of a double life he took steps to prove its existence to his own satisfaction. To this end on one night before going to bed he wrote his name in chalk on the soles of his shoes. That night he dreamed of the quicksand, and of his visiting it--dreamed so vividly that on walking in the grey of the dawn he could not believe that he had not been there. Arising, without disturbing his wife, he sought his shoes.|$|R

40|$|Although {{indispensable}} and {{in daily}} use, money {{and more specifically}} money creation in our two-layered fractional reserve banking system is still poorly recognized by social science at large. Its main features are outlined {{in order to identify}} (a) money’s <b>double</b> <b>nature</b> to be private and public at once and (b) inflation and speculative excess as two of its inherent dangers. Bitcoin and sovereign money are discussed as prominent examples of, on the one hand, private or libertarian and, on the other hand state-oriented or social-democratic monetary reforms, each intended to solve one of the two systemic problems our currency order. The new money’s respective advantages notwithstanding, it is shown that neither Bitcoin nor sovereign money can overcome money’s <b>double</b> <b>nature</b> or realize the dream of an eventually neutral money...|$|R

Finally, Aaltonen's analysis on social, cultural and theatrical processes, which take place when dramatic texts cross borders, will be shown as "a reaction to the Other"...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to answer the {{following}} question: can the school institution to collaborate to make our forthcoming societies the most rational and humanistic ones? First of all, it is argued that, if a school institution is able to get priority for its critical function, it can effectively contribute to improve the rationality of both the social and individual ways of life. For that to be possible, the school must organize its dynamics around the communicative rationality criteria. Second, it is marked that, in general, the school institution has a <b>double</b> <b>nature,</b> as well as, particularly, the school organization, showing the need ofr breaking the reductionist conceptions restricting the understading of the school phonomena when these are faced solely from an exclusive and particular wiewpoint; this <b>double</b> <b>nature</b> of the school relates with the two kinds of rationality technical and practical which pervade the school actions and functions. Third, the habermasian concept of communicative rationality is introduced as a norm reference for the life and dynamics of the school when its purpose is to contribute to reach a better rationality into society. All these arguments are embedded into the Critical Theory of Education...|$|R
