50|$|Federal Grand <b>Jurors</b> <b>are</b> paid {{a nominal}} fee for all days {{they are in}} court and receive travel expenses. The {{experience}} opens a small window into {{the inner workings of}} criminal proceedings and the input of Grand <b>Jurors</b> <b>is</b> an important check and balance to the government. <b>Jurors</b> <b>are</b> exposed to all manner of cases and work with a cross section of society to come to decisions on probable cause.|$|R
25|$|Modern American {{jurisprudence}} {{is generally}} intolerant of the practice, and a <b>juror</b> can <b>be</b> {{removed from a}} case if the judge believes that the <b>juror</b> <b>is</b> aware {{of the power of}} nullification.|$|R

They despise the Children of Misfortune because the core made them and they are the only beings capable of understanding it.|$|R
5|$|There was a {{tremendous}} public outcry when Ward was found not guilty. Newspapers across the nation condemned the verdict and Crittenden {{for his role in}} securing it. Only Prentice, in the Courier-Journal, defended Crittenden and the Ward family. Several public meetings passed resolutions calling for Crittenden's resignation from the Senate. After one such meeting, a mob gathered and Crittenden, Prentice, the Wards, and the twelve <b>jurors</b> <b>were</b> burned in effigy.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{told the}} Times {{that they were}} {{critical}} of {{the membership of the}} five regional juries and especially opposed to the New York jury, the National Jury of Selection and the Jury of Awards. The New York <b>jurors</b> <b>were</b> Charles Burchfield, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Leon Kroll, Ogden Pleissner, Vaclav Vytlacil and Paul Sample. The national jury consisted of Robert Beverly Hale, Ogden Pleissner, Maurice Sterne, Millard Sheets, Howard Cook, Lamar Dodd, Francis Chapin, Zoltan Sepeshy and Esther Williams. The jury of awards included William M. Milliken, Franklin C. Watkins and Eugene Speicher.|$|E
5|$|In 1195 Walter {{issued an}} {{ordinance}} by which four knights were appointed in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians of the peace, a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice of the Peace. His use of the knights, who appear {{for the first time in}} political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as members of parliament or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those <b>jurors</b> <b>were</b> elected.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{there is}} always the {{possibility}} of jurors not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate <b>jurors</b> <b>are</b> selected. Alternates are present for the entire trial but do not take part in deliberating the case and deciding the verdict unless {{one or more of the}} impaneled <b>jurors</b> <b>are</b> removed from the jury. [...] In Connecticut, alternate <b>jurors</b> <b>are</b> dismissed before the panel of sworn jurors begin deliberation. [...] Connecticut General Statutes 51-243(e) and 54-82h do not allow alternate <b>jurors</b> to <b>be</b> segregated from the regular sworn jurors. In civil cases in Connecticut, C.G.S. 51-243(e) provides that alternate <b>jurors</b> [...] "shall <b>be</b> dismissed." [...] This differs from the power given to the court in criminal trials under C.G.S. 54-82h, permitting the court not to dismiss the alternate jurors, and to have the regular jury panel begin deliberations.|$|R

5|$|The {{revolt of}} 1381 {{broke out in}} Essex, {{following}} the arrival of John Bampton to investigate non-payment of the poll tax on 30 May. Bampton {{was a member of}} Parliament, a Justice of the Peace and well-connected with royal circles. He based himself in Brentwood and summoned representatives from the neighbouring villages of Corringham, Fobbing and Stanford-le-Hope to explain and make good the shortfalls on 1 June. The villagers appear to have arrived well-organised, and armed with old bows and sticks. Bampton first interrogated the people of Fobbing, whose representative, Thomas Baker, declared that his village had already paid their taxes, and that no more money would be forthcoming. When Bampton and two sergeants attempted to arrest Baker, violence broke out. Bampton escaped and retreated to London, but three of his clerks and several of the Brentwood townsfolk who had agreed to act as <b>jurors</b> <b>were</b> killed. Robert Bealknap, the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who was probably already holding court in the area, was empowered to arrest and deal with the perpetrators.|$|E
5|$|From 1987 through 1994 {{the award}} was given {{out by a}} panel of science fiction experts led by Orson Scott Card. Beginning in 1995, the {{committee}} was replaced by a group of jurors, who vote on the nominations submitted for consideration. The initial <b>jurors</b> <b>were</b> James Gunn, Frederik Pohl, and Judith Merril. Merril was replaced on the jury by former winner Kij Johnson in 1997, one of Sturgeon's children—Noel Sturgeon in most years—was added to the panel in 1999, and George Zebrowski was added to the panel in 2005. Nominations are submitted by reviewers, fans, publishers, and editors, and are collated by the current Director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, Christopher McKitterick, into a list of finalists to be voted on by the jury. The maximum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Campbell Award. Winners are always invited to attend the ceremony. Since 2004 winners have received a personalized trophy, while since the inception of the award a permanent trophy has recorded all of the winners.|$|E

25|$|However {{eighteenth-century}} society {{struggled with}} the relation between drunkenness and responsibility especially when crime was involved. On one hand, {{it was believed that}} intoxication could alter a person's nature leading him to criminal behaviour, and consequently the judges and <b>jurors</b> <b>were</b> inclined to be tolerant towards these infractions. On the other hand, both citizens and law authorities shared the opinion that drunkenness was an unacceptable excuse, so if a crime was committed in such a state the felon must be fully prosecuted. With the harsh punishments of the Bloody Code pending on the head of the offender, English judges and <b>jurors</b> <b>were</b> usually willing to admit a plea for drunkenness. It was often regarded as an extenuating circumstance and most frequently resulted in the possibility of mitigation, acquittal, or pardon.|$|E
25|$|Simpson {{wanted a}} speedy trial, {{and the defense}} and prosecuting {{attorneys}} worked around the clock for several months to prepare their cases.

50|$|United States v.

The case had important implications for secrecy of the jury deliberation process outweighs the ability to dismiss a juror for nullification.|$|R
25|$|After {{five days}} {{and more than}} 25 hours of deliberation, the jury decided that the state had not met its burden for a conviction.

Following the acquittal, a jury member told the press that the specific wording of the law regarding culpable negligence was the main factor among many leading to the verdict.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Canada, Burns and Rafay confessed to undercover Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The RCMP used the Mr. Big tactic {{to extract the}} confessions, a practice that is illegal in the United States, but was legal {{at the time in}} Canada. The use of the Mr. Big tactic has been since deemed illegal by the Canadian Supreme Court. After the investigation was complete, Burns and Rafay claimed their confessions were false, and that <b>jurors</b> <b>were</b> biased by the media coverage of the crime. Nonetheless, plans were made to extradite Burns and Rafay.|$|E

Opening statements were expected to begin on October 29, 2007; however, they were postponed, and rescheduled for November 5, 2007. The defense stated that the delay was due to possible prejudicial information in a television segment about the case to be aired on November 2. The prosecutor stated the delay was necessary as more time was needed for additional pretrial motions.|$|E
