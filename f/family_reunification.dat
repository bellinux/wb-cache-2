5|$|Canada {{has one of}} {{the highest}} per-capita {{immigration}} rates in the world, driven mainly by economic policy and, to a lesser extent, <b>family</b> <b>reunification.</b> The Canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the current level of immigration. In 2014, a total of 260,400 immigrants were admitted to Canada. The Canadian government anticipated between 280,000 and 305,000 new permanent residents in the following years. a similar number of immigrants as in recent years. New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Canada also accepts large numbers of refugees, accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements.|$|E

30|$|Another novel {{characteristic}} {{today is}} the feminization of labour migration.

40|$|M. A. Child {{migration}} in society today {{appears to be}} escalating {{at a very high}} rate. The influx of child migrants has put an enormous strain to social workers in terms of rendering <b>family</b> preservation and <b>reunification</b> services. In most cases families are not available to enable social workers to render <b>family</b> preservation and <b>reunification</b> services. International Social Services (ISS) assist in tracing families of across the border child migrants but the service does not extend beyond reunifying the child with family. There are no monitoring and tracking systems to prevent the child from migrating again. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify and describe the challenges faced by social workers in rendering <b>family</b> preservation and <b>reunification</b> services to child migrants. The objectives of the study are as follows: to conduct a literature study on <b>family</b> preservation and <b>reunification</b> services and the child migrant; to determine social workers’ strategies used in <b>family</b> preservation and <b>reunification</b> services to child migrants, and the challenges they are experiencing; to obtain social workers’ views on effective strategies that can be implemented in rendering <b>family</b> preservation and <b>reunification</b> services to child migrants and to make recommendations that will assist social workers in rendering <b>family</b> preservation and <b>reunification</b> services. A qualitative study of two focus groups consisting of 15 social workers each from Department of Social Development Johannesburg Region was conducted.

Even though both groups show a feminisation of flows, high participation in the labour market and strong involvement in the domestic and care sectors, our research highlights the existence of two different migration profiles. Migration from Ukraine, mostly mature women, is mainly temporary; on the contrary, Moldovans tend to be younger, with a higher share of male and <b>family</b> <b>reunifications</b> and tend to migrate permanently.|$|R

25|$|Almost all Israeli Jews {{oppose a}} literal {{right of return}} for Palestinian {{refugees}} {{on the grounds that}} allowing such an influx of Palestinians would render Jews a minority in Israel, thus transforming Israel into an Arab-Muslim state. In addition to the right-wing and center, a majority of the Israeli left, including the far-left, opposes the right of return on these grounds. The Israeli left is generally open to compromise on the issue, and supports resolving it by means such as financial compensation, <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> initiatives, and the admittance of a highly limited number of refugees to Israel, but is opposed to a full right of return. The vast majority of Israelis believe that all or almost all of the refugees should be resettled in a Palestinian state, their countries of residence, or third-party countries. The Israeli political leadership has consistently opposed the right of return, but it has made offers of compensation, assistance in resettlement, and return for an extremely limited number of refugees based on <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> or humanitarian considerations during peace talks.|$|E

Although this growth was slowing down, it did continue to grow to 72,000 Turks by 1985. By 1996, there were 81,744 Turks in Belgium, 26% of whom lived in Brussels and 50% in Flanders-particularly in Antwerp and Ghent.

25|$|Initially, some Bulgarian Turks {{arrived in}} Germany during the {{introduction}} of the <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> laws of 1974. The Bulgarian Turks were {{able to take advantage of}} this law despite the very small number of Bulgarian citizens in Germany. This is because some Turkish workers in Germany who arrived from Turkey were actually part of the Bulgarian-Turkish minority who had left Bulgaria during the communist regime during the 1980s and still held Bulgarian citizenship, alongside their Turkish citizenship.|$|E
25|$|Most Turkish {{people who}} immigrated to West Germany {{intended}} {{to live there}} temporarily {{and then return to}} Turkey so that they could build a new life with the money they had earned. Indeed, return-migration had increased during the recession of 1966-1967, the 1973 oil crisis, followed by the policy of giving remigration bonuses in the early 1980s. However, the number of Turkish migrants who returned to Turkey ultimately remained relatively small compared to the number of Turkish immigrants arriving in Germany. This was partly due to the <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> rights that were introduced in 1974 which allowed Turkish workers to bring their families to Germany. Consequently, between 1974–88 the number of Turks in Germany nearly doubled, acquiring a normalised sex ratio and a much younger age profile than the German population. Moreover, once the recruitment of foreigner workers was reintroduced after the recession of 1967, the BfA (Bundesversicherungsanstalt für Angestellte) granted most work visas to women. This was in part because labour shortages continued in low paying, low-status service jobs such as electronics, textiles, and garment work; and in part to further the goal of <b>family</b> <b>reunification.</b>|$|E

In essence, while nonportability can be justified on equity and insurance grounds, it risks creating a kink in potential return migrants’ intertemporal budget constraints, affecting their return decision. With the top-up and other amenities, migrants are financially better off staying in the host country than returning to their home country. However, the limited return of migrants to their former home country seems to be motivated by incentives well beyond mere financial considerations: access to a more advanced {{health care system in}} the host country (albeit those in Turkey and Morocco have made significant progress); family roots established in the host country (due to <b>family</b> <b>reunifications</b> in recent decades); or estrangement over decades from family left behind.|$|R

500|$|Generally, {{the party}} wants a stricter {{immigration}} policy, {{so that only}} {{those who are in}} need of protection according to the UN Refugee Convention are allowed to stay in Norway. In a speech in the 2007 election campaign, Siv Jensen claimed that the immigration policy was a failure because it let criminals stay in Norway, while throwing out people who worked hard and followed the law. The party claims the immigration and integration policy to be naïve. In 2009, the party proposed an official goal of reducing accepted asylum seekers by about 90%, from 1,000 to 100 a month, the standards then said to be used in Denmark and Finland, although less than 100 a year was proposed in 2008. In 2008, the party wanted to [...] "avoid illiterates and other poorly resourced groups who we see are not able to adapt in Norway"; which included countries as Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
