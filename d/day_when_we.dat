2500|$|On June 2, 1924, Du Bois visited Fisk on the {{occasion}} of his daughter Yolanda's graduation, and gave a speech to Fisk students, alumni and guests in connection with the University's commencement exercises. Du Bois was an outspoken critic of Fisk Presidents. In spring 1908, Du Bois visited Fisk to give the university's commencement address, and used the opportunity to criticize President Merrill's addition of industrial coursework at Fisk. While Merrill had no intent to industrialize the Fisk curriculum, the fallout from Du Bois's speech and continued problems fund raising led him to drop the proposal and submit his resignation three months later. [...] Fisk had recently announced the one million dollar fund fully subscribed and irrevocable, and Du Bois sensed the timing to challenge the administration. In front of a packed Fisk Memorial Chapel, and with McKenzie and his wife sitting in the front row, Du Bois declared, [...] "I have come to address you and, I say frankly, I have come to criticize." [...] Asserting that [...] "I have never known an institution whose alumni on the whole are more bitter and disgusted with the present situation in this university than the alumni of Fisk University today." [...] Du Bois endeavored to inform the administration [...] "openly and before your face what so many of your graduates are saying secretly behind your back." [...] Du Bois attacked the Fisk administration as sinister. [...] "For a long time a powerful section of the white South has offered to give its consent and countenance to the higher training of Negroes only on condition that the white South control and guide that education." [...] Du Bois protested that Fisk sold out to Northern foundations and Southern White interests in pursuit of fiscal security. Du Bois remarked, [...] "Of all the essentials that make an institution of learning, money is the least." [...] "And it is possible that for a million dollars the authorities of Fisk University have been asked either openly or by implication to sell to the white South the control of this institution." [...] Du Bois challenged the Fisk code of student conduct and discipline. [...] "I do not for a moment doubt that the object which Fisk today wishes to gain by her discipline are in themselves perfectly good objects," [...] "but the trouble is that she is trying to accomplish her ends by methods which are medieval, and long since discredited." [...] Du Bois suggested students learned discipline through freedom, and lamented, [...] "self-expression and manhood are choked at Fisk in the very <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> need expression to develop manhood in the colored race." [...] Du Bois accused Fisk administrators allowing segregated ticket windows and seating at a Jubilee Singers concert, and of McKenzie leading female members of the Fisk Glee Club through the servants' entrance to sing for Southern White men. Du Bois called on alumni to reclaim Fisk's spirit, and proclaimed, [...] "the alumni of Fisk University are and of right ought to be, the ultimate source of authority in the policy and government" [...] of the University. He argued that alumni had no voice in the policies of Fisk, and complained alumni serving as board members were selected by McKenzie and other trustees and [...] "may not represent the opinion of the alumni." [...] Du Bois encouraged alumni to make public, [...] "what is happening at Fisk University," [...] to organize in order to save Fisk, and to demand elective representation on the board of trustees. Du Bois argued that until conditions at Fisk changed for the better, students should boycott the University.|$|E
