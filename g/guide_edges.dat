40|$|A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} method is {{proposed for the}} vibration analysis of rectangular plates {{with one or more}} <b>guided</b> <b>edges,</b> in which bicubic B-spline interpolation in combination with a new type of basis cubic B-spline functions is used to approximate the plate deflection.

The frequency characteristic equation is formulated based on classical thin plate theory by performing Hamilton's principle. The present solutions are verified with the analytical ones. Fast convergence, high accuracy and computational efficiency have been demonstrated from the comparisons. Frequency parameters for 13 cases of rectangular plates with at least one <b>guided</b> <b>edge,</b> which are possible by approximate or numerical methods only, are presented.

We then consider a two-source Hanbury Brown Twiss experiment which demonstrates strikingly that even in geometries without an Aharonov-Bohm effect in the conductance matrix (second-order interference), correlation functions can (due to fourth-order interference) be sensitive to a flux. Interestingly we find that this fourth-order interference effect {{is closely related to}} orbital entanglement.

Abstract — We propose a technique that allows straight-line graph drawings to be rendered interactively with adjustable level of detail. The approach consists of a novel combination of edge cumulation with density-based node aggregation and is designed to exploit common graphics hardware for speed. It operates directly on graph data and does not require precomputed hierarchies or meshes. As proof of concept, we present an implementation that scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges, and discuss several example applications.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} avoid the complex {{calculation}} and poor robustness in automatic visual modeling process, a man-machine interaction based stereo vision system is developed for modeling an unknown environment. The operator’s knowledge about a scene is used as a guidance for modeling 3 D environment. The modeling technique has advantage in terms of reliability and robustness over other automatic modeling approaches. The data points needed for modeling an objects are obtained through the intersection of lines, or calculation from equations of curve, derived via fitting from human <b>guided</b> <b>edge</b> detection. The modeling accuracy is ensured by using image feature extraction. A multi-viewpoint modeling approach has been developed {{in order to deal with}} occlusion problems. Both accuracy and speed issues are addressed in this paper. The system implementation and some 3 D measurements on real scene have been performed using cameras lenses of 16 mm and 8 mm with an accuracy 0. 5 mm and 0. 8 mm over the field of view, respectively. The virtual environment rendering based on the modeling data of real scenes with known model of mobile robot is given at the end of this paper...|$|R

40|$|Interference of {{standing}} waves in electromagnetic resonators {{forms the basis}} of many technologies, from telecommunications and spectroscopy to detection of gravitational waves. However, unlike the confinement of light waves in vacuum, the interference of electronic waves in solids is complicated by boundary properties of the crystal, notably leading to electron guiding by atomic-scale potentials at the edges. Understanding the microscopic role of boundaries on coherent wave interference is an unresolved question due {{to the challenge of}} detecting charge flow with submicron resolution. Here we employ Fraunhofer interferometry to achieve real-space imaging of cavity modes in a graphene Fabry-Perot resonator, embedded between two superconductors to form a Josephson junction. By directly visualizing current flow using Fourier methods, our measurements reveal surprising redistribution of current on and off resonance. These findings provide direct evidence of separate interference conditions for edge and bulk currents and reveal the ballistic nature of <b>guided</b> <b>edge</b> states. Beyond equilibrium, our measurements show strong modulation of the multiple Andreev reflection amplitude on an off resonance, a direct measure of the gate-tunable change of cavity transparency. These results demonstrate that, contrary to the common belief, electron interactions with realistic disordered edges facilitate electron wave interference and ballistic transport.

40|$|To {{assess the}} growth stage of pine {{seedlings}} in the field, nurseries annually measure the root collar diameter (RCD) {{of a large}} number of seedlings. Traditionally this is done manually using a slide micrometer and registration on paper, a tedious and error-prone practice. As an alternative, two generic semi-automatic diameter measurement devices were developed, based on an optical time-of-flight principle. Here the diameter was obtained using the timing information generated by the shadow of an object passing a pair of receivers. In the first method named the ‘sliding-edge device’, the operator manually slides the object along a <b>guiding</b> <b>edge</b> after which the diameter is measured and recorded automatically. In the second method named the ‘counterbalanced device’ the operator places the object on a table after which the device measures and records the diameter at the push of a button. Both devices were tested using cylindrical objects with known diameters. The sliding-edge device produced a maximum systematic error of 0. 3 mm (9. 5 %), most likely owing to inaccurate model assumptions and a maximum variability of 0. 1 mm. The counterbalanced device proved superior with a maximum systematic error of 0. 1 mm (1 %), virtually independent of operator skill, and a maximum variability of 0. 1 mm...|$|R

40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} a novel {{two-stage}} Projection Correction Modeling (PCM) framework for image reconstruction from (non-uniform) Fourier measurements. PCM consists of a projection stage (P-stage) motivated by the multi-scale Galerkin method and a correction stage (C-stage) with an <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> regularity fusing together the advantages of total variation (TV) and total fractional variation (TFV). The P-stage allows for continuous modeling of the underlying image of interest. The given measurements are projected onto a space in which the image is well represented. We then enhance the reconstruction result at the C-stage that minimizes an energy functional consisting of a fidelity in the transformed domain and a novel <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> regularity. We further develop efficient proximal algorithms to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Various numerical results in both 1 D signals and 2 D images have also been presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed two-stage method to other classical one-stage methods.

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} problem of space-variant image deblurring, where {{different}} parts of the image are blurred by different blur kernels.

We then generalize the method to the challenging case of unknown boundaries between the blur domains. Using variational and level set techniques, the image is processed globally. The space-variant deconvolution process is stabilized by a unified common regularizer, thus preserving discontinuities between the differently restored image regions. In the case where the blurred subregions are unknown, a segmentation procedure is performed using an evolving level set function, <b>guided</b> by <b>edges</b> and image derivatives. ...|$|R

Recently proposed Block-matching and 3 D filtering (BM 3 D) is {{the current state of}} the art algorithm for denoising images corrupted by Additive White Gaussian noise (AWGN). Though BM 3 D outperforms all existing methods for AWGN denoising, still its performance decreases as the noise level increases in images, since it is harder to find proper match for reference blocks in the presence of highly corrupted pixel values. It also blurs sharp edges and textures. To overcome these problems we proposed an <b>edge</b> <b>guided</b> BM 3 D with selective pixel restoration. For higher noise levels it is possible to detect noisy pixels form its neighborhoods gray level statistics. We exploited this property to reduce noise as much as possible by applying a pre-filter.
