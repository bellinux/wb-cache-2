500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I {{see that they are}} like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me".|$|E
500|$|Masempe Theko was {{participating}} {{in her first}} Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 25. She qualified after receiving a universality place awarded by FINA because her best time of 49.75 seconds in her selected event, the women's 50 metre freestyle, was 23.99 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] standard qualifying time. Theko said that it was an [...] "honour" [...] that she was chosen to respent her country: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> it, but in my head it really plays out big. I'm looking forward to the event, being in London and meeting new friends and acquaintances." [...] She was drawn in the first heat of the women's 50 metre freestyle on 3 August, finishing third (and last), with a time of 42.35 seconds. Theko reacted over a second after the gun fired to signal the start of the heat, although she improved her personal best time by over seven seconds. She ranked behind heat winner Nafissatou Moussa Adamou of Niger (37.29 seconds) and Togo's Adzo Kpossi (37.55 seconds). Theko finished 73rd (and last) of all swimmers overall, and did not advance to the semi-finals because her time was 17.07 seconds slower than the slowest athlete who progressed to the later stages.|$|E

2500|$|Predicting {{critical}} reception to the {{new direction}} of the album, Cronise proposed that [...] "It will absolutely alienate some fans. The kind of music we play is partially described as heavy metal and unfortunately, a lot of dudes that like heavy metal are very narrow-minded and only like it to sound one particular way. So I'm sure we alienated people with our second album." [...] Despite this, he assured that {{the sound of the}} music would not change as much, explaining that [...] "There'll definitely still be heavy stuff on the record, and fast, thrashy, and slow and sludgy stuff like we've done before. Heavy metal, basically. But a lot of the songs are just what I'd call hard rock songs. The attitude and the vibe is different. It's not as aggressive, sonically. It's a little bit more ... I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> it. It's just rock. It's a rock album. Some parts will be heavier than the heaviest stuff we've done, but at the same time, there will be acoustic stuff. It is a varied record, I guess.|$|E

6000|$|Miller {{put in a}} {{last word}} of warning: [...] "Because a {{phenomenon}} has not been explained, and no one <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> it, {{is no reason for}} supposing there is anything extraphysical about it. No one has explained the first cause of the development of an embryo. No one knows what goes on in an active nerve, or why atoms are selective in their associates. Ignorance is not a proper basis for speculation, and if one must have a theory, let it be one having some obvious continuity with our best physical knowledge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] he continued, [...] "there {{has always}} been in our love-making a touch of amateurishness. It is an awkward word, but I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> better <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> myself." ...|$|R
50|$|Sebald {{was born}} in Wertach, Bavaria, one of three {{children}} of Rosa and Georg Sebald. From 1948 to 1963, he lived in Sonthofen. His father joined the Reichswehr in 1929 and remained in the Wehrmacht under the Nazis. His father remained a detached figure, {{a prisoner of war}} until 1947; a grandfather was the most important male presence in his early years. Sebald was shown images of the Holocaust while at school in Oberstdorf and recalled that no one <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> what they had just seen. The Holocaust and post-war Germany loom large in his work.|$|R

5000|$|The Our Gang {{series was}} at its most popular and {{successful}} under McGowan's direction; when he became ill in the late-1920s and had {{to turn over the}} director's chair to nephew Robert A. McGowan (billed as [...] "Anthony Mack" [...] to distinguish himself from his uncle) for two years, the series faltered. McGowan was a natural with kids, and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> scenes and comic business to his young charges to elicit convincing performances out of them.

5000|$|Even {{as a young}} woman, Leah was {{renowned for}} her {{exceptional}} learning. In an era when many women did not learn to read, {{and those who did}} rarely learned more than the rudiments of Hebrew, Horowitz studied the Talmud with commentaries and also read some kabbalistic works. The memoirist Ber of Bolechów reports that {{when he was a boy}} of twelve, Leah helped him prepare for his Talmud lesson with her brother, the rabbi Mordecai. [...] "She would begin to recite the words of Talmud or Rashi by heart, in clear language, explaining it well as it was written there, and I learned from her words. And when the rabbi awoke from his sleep, I <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the passage in the Talmud to him properly." [...] In the same passage, Ber refers to her as [...] "the learned and famous Mistress Leah, of blessed memory". Other authors also knew of her reputation for learning. The anonymous work Sefer Ozar Sihot Hakhamim describes her as [...] "a great scholar, well-versed in the Talmud" [...] and recounts her Talmudic discussion with another learned lady, Dinah, the wife of Saul Halevi (chief rabbi of The Hague from 1748 to 1785).|$|R

60|$|It struck even George {{that this}} was a way in which Emily Hotspur should not be described. She had been {{acknowledged}} to be the beauty of the last season, one of the finest girls that had ever been seen about London; and, as for loving her,--he did love her. A man might be fond of two dogs, or have two pet horses, and why shouldn't he love two women! Of course he loved his cousin.

60|$|Lilias, on her part, endeavoured {{to prevail}} upon Darsie {{to partake of}} the food which she offered him, with a kindly and affectionate {{courtesy}} corresponding to {{the warmth of the}} interest she had displayed at their meeting; but so very natural, innocent, and pure in its character, {{that it would have been}} impossible for the vainest coxcomb to have mistaken it for coquetry, or a desire of captivating a prize so valuable as his affection. Darsie, with no more than the reasonable share of self-opinion common to most youths when they approach twenty-one, <b>knew</b> not <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> her conduct.|$|R
60|$|He {{left her}} a moment later, and, though she did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> she was <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the matter <b>to</b> Miss Rawlinson, who was of an {{independent}} disposition, {{it occurred to her}} that he, at least, had found a rather graceful way out of the difficulty.

50|$|Janssoone {{was born}} in the town of Ghyvelde, in the French Department of Nord, the country's most northwestern corner, on 19 November 1838. It is a part of French Flanders where the local {{language}} is French Flemish. He was the eighth and youngest of the thirteen children of Pierre-Antoine Janssoone and Marie-Isabelle Bollengier, and was christened Frédéric-Cornil. He {{was born in}}to a prosperous farming family who prized culture, education and their faith. He was just nine years old in January 1848 when his father died. Four years later, in response, to a religious calling, the young Frédéric enrolled in a college and then graduated to the Institut Notre-Dame des Dunes in nearby Dunkirk to prepare for the priesthood. In 1855, however, the family fell on hard times, so the boy left school to help support his mother and siblings. He went to work for some textile merchants, for whom he became a traveling salesman. He soon realized that he had a talent for selling. He liked meeting new people and he <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> his products. His mother died in 1861, at which point Janssoone decided to resume his studies. After their completion, on 24 June 1864, he entered the novitiate of the Friars Minor, where he added the patronage of St. Yves to his name, making his profession the following year. He was ordained in Bourges on 17 August 1870. His ordination was done earlier than in the normal scheme, due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War at the time. Military chaplains were in great need, and he was quickly assigned to serve at a military hospital. After the war Jannsoone helped to establish a friary in Bordeaux, where he was appointed as guardian in 1873. Since he found the role unbearable, he was relieved of this responsibility a year later. His release gave him the freedom to take a course in homiletics, at which he would excel all his life.|$|R
