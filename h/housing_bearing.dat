50|$|Merlin {{took the}} form of a {{rectangular}} device about eight inches long and three inches wide. The play area of the game consisted of a matrix of 11 buttons; each button contained a red LED. The array was encased in a red plastic <b>housing,</b> <b>bearing</b> a slight resemblance to an overgrown touch-tone telephone. Four game-selection and control buttons were also placed {{at the bottom of the}} unit; a speaker took up the top section. Supporting electronics (including a simple microprocessor) were contained within the shell of the game. Parker Brothers later released Master Merlin with more games, and the rarer Split Second, where all games involve time with a more advanced display, sporting line segments around the dots. Both of these share the same general case shape, and came out a few years after Merlin.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} control of an integrated direct-drive joint suitable for applications that require a high-precision motion control system. The joint integrates a directdrive synchronous motor with axial air gap, a torque sensor, and a high-resolution position sensor. The key design aspects of the integrated joint, like the motor’s armature, cooling system, motor <b>housing,</b> <b>bearing</b> arrangement, sensors, and power electronics are detailed. We also present a number of advanced implementations in motor torque control, optimal joint torque sensory feedback, and motion control using positive joint torque feedback. Experimental results illustrate an outstanding performance regarding thermal response, torque ripple, reference trajectory tracking, torque disturbance rejection, and joint stiffness...|$|E

The double face sealing device includes a plurality of sections or segments mounted {{to one of the}} surfaces, each having a main body portion, a pair of outwardly extending and diverging, cantilever, spring arms, and a pair of inwardly extending and diverging, cantilever, spring arms, an elastomeric cover on the distal, free, ends of the outwardly extending and diverging spring arms, and an elastomeric cover on the distal, free, ends of the inwardly extending and diverging spring arms. The double face sealing device has application or use in all environments requiring a seal, but is particularly useful to seal openings or hatchways between compartments of spacecraft or aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to design a {{lightweight}} aluminum differential housing to replace the cast-iron housing used in the Torsen® T- 1. The redesigned housing was destined for use in the 2004 MIT Formula SAE vehicle, a small high-performance formula-style car. FEA analysis was used to create a two-piece design that was significantly lighter than the original Torsen <b>housing.</b> <b>Bearing</b> mounts used to attach the unit to the FSAE chassis as well as inboard driveline joints were also designed and fabricated. The remainder of the driveline system was outlined and sourced. Additionally, a second design incorporating the original cast-iron housing was created for the FSAE vehicle to use in competition while the original design undergoes testing.

40|$|Experimental {{orbits of}} a free-mounted, three-wave gas journal <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> were {{recorded}} and compared to transient predicted orbits.

The family owned vineyards around the town of Cognac and were already distilling and ageing 'eaux-de-vie'. The following year he bought the Château de Cognac, built in the tenth century to protect the villagers from Norman invaders, as a base for his business. The cellars of the château, which can be visited, are still used for storing and ageing the casks of cognac.|$|R
