40|$|Lumbar {{vertebra}} {{motion analysis}} provides objective measurement of lumbar disorder. The automatic tracking algorithm {{has been applied}} to Digitalized Video Fluoroscopy (DVF) sequence. This paper proposes a new Auto-Tracking System (ATS) with a guide device and a motion analysis to automatically measure human lumbar motion. Digitalized Video Fluoroscopy (DVF) sequence was obtained during flexion-extension lumbar movement under guide device. An extraction of human vertebral body and its motion tracking were developed by particle filter. The results showed a good repeatability, reliability and robustness. In model test, the maximum <b>fiducial</b> <b>error</b> is 3. 7 % and the repeatability error is 1. 2 % in translation and the maximal repeatability error is 2. 6 % in rotation angle. In this simulation study, we employed a lumbar model to simulate the motion of lumber flexion- extension with the stepping translation of 1. 3 mm and rotation angle of 1 ?. Results showed that the <b>fiducial</b> <b>error</b> was measured as 1. 0 %, while the repeatability error was 0. 7 %. The sequence can be detected even noise contamination as more as 0. 5 of the density. The result demonstrates that the data from the auto-tracking algorithm shows a strong correlation with the actual measurement and that the Vertebral Auto-Tracking System (VATS) is highly repetitive. In the human lumbar spine evaluation, the study not only shows the reliability of Auto-Tracking Analysis System (ATAS), but also reveals that it is robust and variable in vivo. The VATS is evaluated by the model, the simulated sequence and the human subject. It could be concluded that the developed system could provide a reliable and robust system to detect spinal motion in future medical application. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The system combines electrostatic sensors with capacitive sensors and incorporates data fusion techniques. As the electrostatic sensor is more sensitive to dilute pulverized coal and the capacitive sensor is more sensitive to biomass particles, both sensor techniques are integrated for the concentration measurement of biomass and pulverized coal in biomass/coal/air three-phase flow. First, the flow regime is identified through the Hilbert marginal spectrum of the electrostatic sensor output signal. Then, under certain identified flow regimes, the dual regression analysis method is applied {{to work out the}} biomass concentration and the pulverized coal concentration.

40|$|International audienceThe {{synchronization}} {{and registration}} of dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance images (MRI) {{of the heart}} is required to perform a combined analysis of their complementary information. We propose a novel method that synchronizes and registers intrapatient dynamic CT and cine-MRI short axis view (SAX). For the synchronization step, a normalized cross-correlation curve is computed from each image sequence to describe the global cardiac dynamics. The time axes of these curves are then warped using an adapted dynamic time warping (DTW) procedure. The adaptation constrains the time deformation to obtain a coherent warping function. The registration step then computes the rigid transformation that maximizes the multiimage normalized mutual information of DTW-synchronized images. The DTW synchronization and the multiimage registration were evaluated using dynamic CT and cine-SAX acquisitions from nine patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy. The distance between the end-systolic phases after DTW {{was used to evaluate}} the synchronization. Mean errors, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} RR-intervals, were 3. 9 % and 3. 7 % after adapted DTW synchronization against 10. 8 % and 11. 3 % after linear synchronization, for dynamic CT and cine-SAX, respectively. This suggests that the adapted DTW synchronization leads to a coherent warping of cardiac dynamics. The multiimage registration was evaluated using fiducial points. Compared to a monoimage and a two-image registration, the multiimage registration of DTW-synchronized images obtained the lowest mean <b>fiducial</b> <b>error</b> showing that the use of dynamic voxel intensity information improves the registration. © 2015 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Previous lumbar motion {{analyses}} {{suggest the}} usefulness of quantitatively characterizing spine motion. However, the application of such measurements is still limited {{by the lack of}} user-friendly automatic spine motion analysis systems. This paper describes an automatic analysis system to measure lumbar spine disorders that consists of a spine motion guidance device, an X-ray imaging modality to acquire digitized video fluoroscopy (DVF) sequences and an automated tracking module with a graphical user interface (GUI). DVF sequences of the lumbar spine are recorded during flexion-extension under a guidance device. The automatic tracking software utilizing a particle filter locates the vertebra-of-interest in every frame of the sequence, and the tracking result is displayed on the GUI. Kinematic parameters are also extracted from the tracking results for motion analysis. We observed that, in a bone model test, the maximum <b>fiducial</b> <b>error</b> was 3. 7 %, and the maximum repeatability error in translation and rotation was 1. 2 % and 2. 6 %, respectively. In our simulated DVF sequence study, the automatic tracking was not successful when the noise intensity was greater than 0. 50. In a noisy situation, the maximal difference was 1. 3 mm in translation and 1 ° in the rotation angle. The errors were calculated in translation (fiducial error: 2. 4 %, repeatability error: 0. 5 %) and in the rotation angle (fiducial error: 1. 0 %, repeatability error: 0. 7 %). However, the automatic tracking software could successfully track simulated sequences contaminated by noise at a density ≤ 0. 5 with very high accuracy, providing good reliability and robustness. A clinical trial with 10 healthy subjects and 2 lumbar spondylolisthesis patients were enrolled in this study. The measurement with auto-tacking of DVF provided some information not seen in the conventional X-ray. The results proposed the potential use of the proposed system for clinical applications. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved. postprin...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundUnderstanding the {{irradiated}} {{area and}} dose correctly {{is important for}} the reirradiation of organs that deform after irradiation, such as the liver. We investigated the spatial registration error using the deformable image registration (DIR) software products MIM Maestro (MIM) and Velocity AI (Velocity). MethodsImage registration of pretreatment computed tomography (CT) and posttreatment CT was performed in 24 patients with liver tumors. All the patients received proton beam therapy, and the follow-up period was 4 – 14 (median: 10) months. We performed DIR of the pretreatment CT and compared it with that of the posttreatment CT by calculating the dislocation of metallic markers (implanted close to the tumors). ResultsThe <b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error</b> was comparable in both products: 0. 4 – 32. 9 (9. 3 [*]±[*] 9. 9) mm for MIM and 0. 5 – 38. 6 (11. 0 [*]±[*] 10. 0) mm for Velocity, and correlated with the tumor diameter for MIM (r[*]=[*] 0. 69, P[*]=[*] 0. 002) and for Velocity (r[*]=[*] 0. 68, P[*]=[*] 0. 0003). Regarding the enhancement effect, the <b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error</b> was 1. 0 – 24. 9 (7. 4 [*]±[*] 7. 7) mm for MIM and 0. 3 – 29. 6 (8. 9 [*]±[*] 7. 2) mm for Velocity, which is shorter than that of plain CT (P[*]=[*] 0. 04, for both). ConclusionsThe DIR performance of both MIM and Velocity is comparable with regard to the liver. The <b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error</b> of DIR depends on the tumor diameter.

40|$|Abstract. Daily {{estimates}} of the Earth's pole position have been obtained with measurements from a worldwide network of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, obtained during the three week GIG' 91 experiment in January-February, 1991. For this short-term study, the GPS based polar motion series agrees with the other space based geodetic echniques (Very Long Baseline Interferometry and Satellite Laser Ranging) to- 0. 4 mas rms, after the removal of mean biases of order 1 - 3 mas. The small error in day-to-day variability is not sensitive to the fiducial strategy used, nor are fiducial sites even necessary for monitoring high frequency pole position variability. The small biases indicate that the applied reference frames of the three geodetic techniques are nearly aligned, that the GPS <b>fiducial</b> <b>errors</b> are small, and that systematic errors in GPS are also small (of order 5 ppb). A well determined reference frame is necessary for monitoring the long-term stability of polar motion and for separating it from other long-term signals such as tectonic motion and internal systematic errors...|$|R
40|$|Fiducials {{imprinted}} on laser beams {{are used to}} perform video image based alignment of the beams in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In any laser beam alignment operation, a beam needs to be aligned to a reference location. Generally, the beam and reference fiducials are composed of separate beams, as a result only a single feature of each beam needs to be identified for determining {{the position of the}} beam or reference. However, it is possible to have the same beam image contain both the beam and reference fiducials. In such instances, it is essential to separately identify these features. In the absence of wavefront correction or when image quality is poor, the features of such beams may get distorted making it difficult to distinguish between different <b>fiducials.</b> <b>Error</b> checking and correction mechanism must be implemented to avoid misidentification of one type of feature as the other.

30|$|Here, we {{introduce}} {{the use of}} surface images obtained during the fDOT acquisition session for the automatic identification of the FM's positions in space. Surface reconstruction by laser patterning [19] can retrieve the 3 -D surface of the subject and of the FM in close vicinity. Surface reconstruction is directly implemented into the 3 -D fDOT-PET combined image. We show that this method efficiently performs co-registration of fDOT and PET images of the same mouse with a co-registration <b>error</b> (<b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error,</b> FRE) smaller than the intrinsic resolution of PET and fDOT. This new automatic method facilitates the accurate co-registration of fDOT with PET and other imaging modalities. As a proof of concept, we imaged mice bearing neuroendocrine tumors for glycolytic metabolism with FDG-PET and for tumoral blood pool with a fluorescent blood pool contrast agent. We show that these two tumoral hallmarks occupy partially overlapping volumes, suggesting that the tumor-induced induction of blood supply could be spatially restricted to {{a portion of the}} tumor mass.|$|R

Craniofacial features were employed as the registration basis to map the CT space onto the simulated intraoperative space.

This configuration of fiducials is then analysed theoretically as well as practically to understand how it is performing. The error on tracking the target point of the pointer is found with simulation to be around 0. 7 times the error of measuring one fiducial in space.

We propose to use cortical vessels as landmarks for registering the preoperative images to the operating space.

However the configuration of fiducial points has a great influence on the registration accuracy at the target point. Now almost all the optimization method of fiducial points configuration relies on the empirical simulation-based Fitz-patrick’s target registration error (TRE). In this paper, a phantom and some markers were designed and some experiments were conducted to measure and compare the affecting factors on the registration. By the markers repeated selections, the <b>fiducial</b> location <b>error</b> (FLE) has a small deviation of maximum 0. 4 mm, and {{the average of the}} Fitzpatrick’s TRE (F-TRE) has almost 86 % proportion to the average of the actual TRE (A-TRE), but the standard deviation (STD) just has 7 % propor-tion. Also, the experiment result showed that six fiducial markers already had the 86 % accuracy, and spreading the fiducial markers led to 30 % reduction in mean of A-TRE and 40 % reduction in STD of A-TRE comparing with the centralized. Overall, to find a strategy of optimization, reducing the TRE has the great meaning to support safer and more accurate mini-mally IGS procedures...|$|R

Currently, surface landmarks are used for thoracic cavity registration; however, this approach is unreliable due to skin movement relative to the ribs. An alternative method for providing surgeons with image feedback {{in the operating room}} is to integrate images acquired during surgery with images acquired pre-operatively.

Misleading surrogate parameters such as the <b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error</b> are often used to describe the success of the registration process, while a lack of methods describing the effects of navigation errors, such as those caused by tracking or calibration, may prevent the {{application of}} image guidance in certain accuracy-critical interventions. During minimally invasive mastoidectomy for cochlear implantation, a direct tunnel is drilled from the outside of the mastoid to a target on the cochlea based on registration using landmarks solely {{on the surface of the}} skull. Using this methodology, it is impossible to detect if the drill is advancing in the correct direction and that injury of the facial nerve will be avoided. To overcome this problem, a tool localization method based on drilling process information is proposed. The algorithm estimates the pose of a robot-guided surgical tool during a drilling task based on the correlation of the observed axial drilling force and the heterogeneous bone density in the mastoid extracted from 3 -D image data. We present here one possible implementation of this method tested on ten tunnels drilled into three human cadaver specimens where an average tool localization accuracy of 0. 29 mm was observed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION Over {{the last}} twenty years, image-guided {{interventions}} have been greatly expanded by the advances in medical imaging and computing power. A key step for any image-guided intervention {{is to find the}} image-to-patient transformation matrix, which is the transformation matrix between the preoperative 3 D model of patient anatomy and the real position of the patient in the operating room. In this work, we propose a robust registration algorithm to match ultrasound (US) images with preoperative Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of the Humerus. MATERIALS AND METHODS The fusion of preoperative MR images with intra-operative US images is performed through an NDI Spectra® Polaris system and a L 12 - 5 L 60 N TELEMED® ultrasound transducer. The use of an ultrasound probe requires a calibration procedure {{in order to determine the}} transformation between an US image pixel and its position according to a global reference system. After the calibration step, the patient anatomy is scanned with US probe. US images are segmented in real time in order to extract the desired bone contour. The use of an optical measurement system together with trackers and the previously-computed calibration matrix makes it possible to assign a world coordinate position to any pixel of the 2 D US image. As a result, the set of US pixels extracted from the images results in a cloud of 3 D points which will be registered with the 3 D Humerus model reconstructed from MR images. The proposed registration method is composed of two steps. The first step consists of US 3 D points cloud alignment with the 3 D bone model. Then, the second step performs the widely-known Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. In order to perform this, we define the coordinate system of both the 3 D Humerus model and the US points cloud. The frame directions correspond to the directions of the principal axes of inertia calculated from the matrices of inertia of both the preoperative 3 D model and the US data obtained intra-operatively. Then, we compute the rotation matrix to estimate the transformation between the two coordinate systems previously calculated. Finally the translation is determined by evaluating the distance between the mass centres of the two 3 D surfaces. RESULTS In order to evaluate the performance of this registration method in terms of precision and accuracy, we performed the US/MRI fusion on 8 patients. The evaluation criterion used for the validation step was the <b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error</b> (FRE) estimation based on 8 anatomic fiducials detected on the Humerus of the patient. The mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of the 8 <b>Fiducial</b> Registration <b>Errors</b> were 4. 34, 2. 20, 2. 81 and 9. 48 mm, respectively. DISCUSSIONS In this work, we propose a robust registration method of MR and US data. Thanks to the optical system, this fusion will allow us for example to guide and assist surgeons in the positioning of the radiofrequency probe for bone tumor ablation. In addition to the fact that it is completely automatic, the proposed image-to-patient registration method is minimally invasive...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm called CIPDEC (Content Integrity of Printed Documents using Error Correction), which identifies any modifications {{made to a}} printed document. CIPDEC uses an error correcting code for accurate detection of addition/deletion of even a few pixels. A unique advantage of CIPDEC is that it works blind – {{it does not require}} the original document for such detection. Instead, it uses <b>fiducial</b> marks and <b>error</b> correcting code parities. CIPDEC is also robust to paper-world artifacts like photocopying, annotations, stains, folds, tears and staples. Furthermore, by working at a pixel level, CIPDEC is independent of language, font, software, and graphics that are used to create paper documents. As a result, any changes made to a printed document can be detected long after the software, font, and graphics have fallen out of use. The utility of CIPDEC is illustrated in the context of tamper-proofing of printed documents and ink extraction for form-filling applications...|$|R
40|$|Portal imaging of {{implanted}} fiducial markers {{has been}} in use for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer, with ample attention to localization accuracy and organ motion. The geometric uncertainties in point-based rigid-body matching algorithms during localization of prostate fiducial markers can be quantified {{in terms of a}} <b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error</b> (FRE). In this study, the aim is to demonstrate how statistical process control (SPC) can be used to intercept potential problems with rigid-body matching algorithms in a retrospective study of FRE for a pilot cohort of 34 patients with fiducial markers. A procedure for estimating control parameters of a SPC control chart (x-chart) from a small number of initial observations (N) of FRE was implemented. The sensitivity analysis of N on the number of `in-control' and `out-of-control' x-charts was also performed. Uncorrected rotational offsets of an individual patient were examined to elucidate possible correlations with the behaviours of an x-chart. Four specific types of qualitative x-chart behaviour have been observed. The number of out-of-control processes was insensitive to the choice of N, provided N >= 5. Residual errors of rigid-body registration were contributed from uncorrected rotational offsets in 5 out of 15 `out-of-control' x-charts. Out-ofcontrol x-charts were also shown to be correlated with potential changes in the IGRT processes, which may compromise the quality of the radiation treatment delivery. The SPC methodology, implemented in the form of individually customized x-charts, {{has been shown to be}} a useful tool for monitoring process reliability during fiducial-based IGRT for prostate cancer...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE Images from {{computed}} tomography (CT), combined with navigation systems, improve {{the outcomes of}} local thermal therapies that are dependent on accurate probe placement. Although the usage of CT is desired, its availability for time-consuming radiological interventions is limited. Alternatively, three-dimensional images from C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) can be used. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of navigated CBCT-guided needle punctures, controlled with CT scans. METHODS Five series of five navigated punctures were performed on a nonrigid phantom using a liver specific navigation system and CBCT volumetric dataset for planning and navigation. To mimic targets, five titanium screws were fixed to the phantom. Target positioning accuracy (TPECBCT) was computed from control CT scans and divided into lateral and longitudinal components. Additionally, CBCT-CT guidance accuracy was deducted by performing CBCT-to-CT image coregistration and measuring TPECBCT-CT from fused datasets. Image coregistration was evaluated using <b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error</b> (FRECBCT-CT) and target registration error (TRECBCT-CT). RESULTS Positioning accuracies in lateral directions pertaining to CBCT (TPECBCT = 2. 1 ± 1. 0 mm) were found to be better to those achieved from previous study using CT (TPECT = 2. 3 ± 1. 3 mm). Image coregistration error was 0. 3 ± 0. 1 mm, resulting in an average TRE of 2. 1 ± 0. 7 mm (N = 5 targets) and average Euclidean TPECBCT-CT of 3. 1 ± 1. 3 mm. CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic needle punctures might be planned and performed on volumetric CBCT images and controlled with multidetector CT with positioning accuracy higher or similar to those performed using CT scanners...|$|R
40|$|Use of image-guided surgery (IGS) {{systems in}} otolaryngology, {{particularly}} rhinology, has grown exponentially in recent years. Central to their use is {{the understanding of}} the accuracy of each system. The purpose of this review is to discuss the error inherent in all IGS systems. A standardized technique (currently used in the engineering literature) for understanding and reporting error in IGS systems is reviewed. Using this technique, the error of commercially available IGS systems is reviewed. Recent findings The most commonly used IGS systems depend on the conformation of the skin, as opposed to relying on bone-implanted devices. For these systems, mean accuracies 2 mm or less are routinely reported. This finding is independent of fiducial markers (eg, proprietary headsets, skin-affixed markers, or laser scanning of skin surfaces). Techniques of fiducial localization and registration of CT scans to intraoperative anatomy are proprietary to each company. As such, there is great variability in reporting system specifications—particularly error of IGS systems. This lack of standardization makes comparison of one system to another difficult if not impossible. Summary Image-guided surgery systems commonly used in rhinology report mean accuracies of 2 mm or less. Surgeons must be aware that this value represents a mean of a distribution of errors. As such, 95 % of the time error can be expected to be less than approximately 1. 7 times its mean value. However, outliers (errors much larger and much smaller than the mean) may exist for each IGS intervention. As noted, IGS systems function to complement—not replace—knowledge of surgical anatomy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} postimplantation migration of percutaneously implanted cylindrical gold seeds ("seeds") and platinum endovascular embolization coils ("coils") for tumor tracking in pulmonary stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). We retrospectively analyzed the migration of markers in 32 consecutive patients with computed tomography scans postimplantation and at simulation. We implanted 147 markers (59 seeds, 88 coils) in or around 34 pulmonary tumors over 32 procedures, with one lesion implanted twice. Marker coordinates were rigidly aligned by minimizing <b>fiducial</b> registration <b>error</b> (FRE), the root mean square of the differences in marker locations for each tumor between scans. To also evaluate whether single markers were responsible for most migration, we aligned with and without the outlier causing the largest FRE increase per tumor. We applied the resultant transformation to all markers. We evaluated migration of individual markers and FRE of each group. Median scan interval was 8 days. Median individual marker migration was 1. 28 mm (interquartile range [IQR] 0. 78 - 2. 63 mm). Median lesion FRE was 1. 56 mm (IQR 0. 92 - 2. 95 mm). Outlier identification yielded 1. 03 mm median migration (IQR 0. 52 - 2. 21 mm) and 1. 97 mm median FRE (IQR 1. 44 - 4. 32 mm). Outliers caused a mean and median shift in the centroid of 1. 22 and 0. 80 mm (95 th percentile 2. 52 mm). Seeds and coils had no statistically significant difference. Univariate analysis suggested no correlation of migration with the number of markers, contact with the chest wall, or time elapsed. Marker migration between implantation and simulation is limited and unlikely to cause geometric miss during tracking...|$|R
