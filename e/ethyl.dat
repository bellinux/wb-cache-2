5|$|Bromoacetic acid, {{which is}} esterified {{to produce the}} reagent <b>ethyl</b> bromoacetate.|$|E
5|$|Chloroacetone turns brown-orange {{when exposed}} to light, while <b>ethyl</b> bromoacetate is a yellow liquid at {{tropical}} outdoor temperatures. Both have similar colors to the liquid used on the demonstrators. Some varieties of French tear gas contained phosgene oxime or hydrogen cyanide. These two chemicals can be fatal, {{but none of the}} protestors in this incident died.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture forages {{using its}} keen {{eyesight}} to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses {{its sense of}} smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting the scent of <b>ethyl</b> mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{olfactory}} lobe of its brain {{responsible for}} processing smells is particularly large {{compared to other}} animals. This characteristic of New World vultures {{has been used by}} humans: <b>ethyl</b> mercaptan is injected into pipelines, and engineers looking for leaks then follow the foraging vultures.|$|E
5|$|Using modern catalysts, this {{reaction}} {{can have an}} acetic acid yield greater than 95%. The major side-products are <b>ethyl</b> acetate, formic acid, and formaldehyde, {{all of which have}} lower boiling points than acetic acid and are readily separated by distillation.|$|E
5|$|A bromine {{extraction}} {{plant was}} opened in Amlwch in 1953 by Associated <b>Ethyl</b> (soon renamed Associated Octel, and later {{part of the}} Great Lakes Chemical Corporation). Chlorine produced at a plant in Ellesmere Port was brought by rail to Amlwch, which was used to extract bromine from sea water. The resulting ethylene dibromide was taken from Amlwch by rail as well. The company built a light railway through the town to Amlwch station, and a marshalling yard for exchanging freight wagons.|$|E
5|$|Mercury is an {{ingredient}} in dental amalgams. Thiomersal (called Thimerosal in the United States) is an organic compound {{used as a}} preservative in vaccines, though this use is in decline. Thiomersal is metabolized to <b>ethyl</b> mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link. Nevertheless, thiomersal has been removed from, or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 {{years of age and}} under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.|$|E
5|$|When World War II {{threatened}} tropical {{sources of}} natural latex for rubber, Sarnia {{was selected as}} the site to spearhead development of synthetic petroleum-based rubbers for war materials, and Polymer Corporation was built by Dow Chemical {{at the request of the}} Government of Canada. Large pipelines bring Alberta oil to Sarnia, where oil refining and petrochemical production have become mainstays of the city's economy. Shell Canada, Imperial Oil, and Suncor Energy (Sunoco) operate refineries in Sarnia. Large salt beds found under the city became a source of chlorine and other significant ingredients which contributed to the success of Chemical Valley. Chemical companies operating in Sarnia include NOVA Chemicals, Bayer (Lanxess and H.C. Starck), Cabot Corporation and <b>Ethyl</b> Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is an {{important}} industrial ingredient. It has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as <b>ethyl</b> halides, <b>ethyl</b> esters, diethyl ether, acetic acid, and <b>ethyl</b> amines.|$|E
25|$|Fermentation {{products}} like 2-ethyl-3-methyl butyric acid and esters like <b>ethyl</b> butanoate and <b>ethyl</b> hexanoate {{give rise to}} the sweet and fruitiness of rum.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of entomology, <b>ethyl</b> acetate is an {{effective}} asphyxiant for use in insect collecting and study. In a killing jar charged with <b>ethyl</b> acetate, the vapors will kill the collected insect quickly without destroying it. Because it is not hygroscopic, <b>ethyl</b> acetate also keeps the insect soft enough to allow proper mounting suitable for a collection.|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, {{mixtures}} containing <b>ethyl</b> acetate {{are commonly}} used in column chromatography and extractions. <b>Ethyl</b> acetate is rarely selected as a reaction solvent because it is prone to hydrolysis and transesterification.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to {{transportation}} fuel there are six ether additives: dimethyl ether (DME), diethyl ether (DEE), methyl teritiary-butyl ether (MTBE), <b>ethyl</b> ter-butyl ether (ETBE), ter-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and ter-amyl <b>ethyl</b> ether (TAEE).|$|E
25|$|Related {{compounds}} may {{be formed}} by replacing a hydrogen atom with another functional group; the ethane moiety is called an <b>ethyl</b> group. For example, an <b>ethyl</b> group {{linked to a}} hydroxyl group yields ethanol, the alcohol in beverages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethyl</b> acetate {{is formed}} in wine by the {{esterification}} of ethanol and acetic acid. Therefore, wines with high acetic acid levels {{are more likely}} to see <b>ethyl</b> acetate formation, but the compound does not contribute to the volatile acidity. It is a common microbial fault produced by wine spoilage yeasts, particularly Pichia anomala or Kloeckera apiculata. High levels of <b>ethyl</b> acetate are also produced by lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its highly}} {{pyrophoric}} nature, diethylzinc {{is an important}} chemical reagent. It is used in organic synthesis {{as a source of}} the <b>ethyl</b> carbanion in addition reactions to carbonyl groups. For example, the asymmetric addition of an <b>ethyl</b> group to benzaldehyde | collvol = 10 | collvolpages = 635 | year = 2004 | prep = v79p0139}} and imines.|$|E
25|$|Overexposure to <b>ethyl</b> acetate {{may cause}} {{irritation}} of the eyes, nose, and throat. Severe overexposure may cause weakness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Humans {{exposed to a}} concentration of 400ppm in 1.4mg/L <b>ethyl</b> acetate {{for a short time}} were affected by nose and throat irritation. <b>Ethyl</b> acetate is an irritant of the conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has central nervous system depressant and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000ppm (2.0–4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known of irritation of the conjunctiva with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin. The irritant effect of <b>ethyl</b> acetate is weaker than that of propyl acetate or butyl acetate.|$|E
25|$|Mixed ethers or {{unsymmetrical}} ethers; e.g., methyl <b>ethyl</b> ether, methyl phenyl ether, etc.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like <b>ethyl</b> butyrate, <b>ethyl</b> caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|Simple organoboranes such as triethylborane or tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron can be {{prepared}} from trifluoroborane (as the ether complex) and the <b>ethyl</b> or pentafluorophenyl Grignard reagent.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} the {{application}} of pressure-swing distillation is during the industrial purification of <b>ethyl</b> acetate after its catalytic synthesis from ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{levels of}} the amino acid {{arginine}} (greater than 400mg/l), especially {{near the end of}} fermentation, can pose the risk increase the production of <b>ethyl</b> carbamate. This is because arginine gets broken down into urea which can be reabsorbed and utilized by yeast or metabolized into ammonia. However, urea also reacts with ethanol if it is not completely metabolized which coupled with long term exposure (as well as high temperatures) can lead to the production of the ester <b>ethyl</b> carbamate.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol) {{are obtained}} by hydrogenating over a catalyst (e.g., Raney nickel) the corresponding ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl <b>ethyl</b> ketone, diethyl ketone).|$|E
25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol, wood naphtha or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (<b>ethyl</b> alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for <b>ethyl</b> alcohol. It is not popular for machinery, but {{may be found in}} automotive windshield washer fluid, de-icers, and gasoline additives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethyl</b> acetate is used {{primarily}} as a solvent and diluent, being favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, {{it is commonly used}} to clean circuit boards and in some nail varnish removers (acetone and acetonitrile are also used). Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent. It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener. <b>Ethyl</b> acetate is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In perfumes, it evaporates quickly, leaving only the scent of the perfume on the skin.|$|E
25|$|HBr {{requires}} refluxing with a {{sulfuric acid}} catalyst. <b>Ethyl</b> halides can, in principle, also {{be produced by}} treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents, such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus tribromide.|$|E
25|$|The cooxidation {{technique}} uses {{an auxiliary}} substance which is simultaneously oxidized to hydrogen peroxide {{which increases the}} activity of the oxidation catalyst. Auxiliaries include: acetaldehyde (Toray process, Japan), paraldehyde (Eastman, USA), and methyl <b>ethyl</b> ketone.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{can also}} be used to make {{compounds}} in reactions which are not specifically named. Examples of such compounds include: ammonium perchlorate, ammonium nitrate, formamide, dinitrogen tetroxide, alprazolam, ethanolamine, <b>ethyl</b> carbamate, hexamethylenetetramine, and ammonium bicarbonate.|$|E
25|$|An alkyl group, {{generally}} abbreviated {{with the}} symbol R, is a functional group that, like an alkane, consists solely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms connected acyclically—for example, a methyl or <b>ethyl</b> group.|$|E
25|$|One {{major problem}} with older breath analyzers is non-specificity: the {{machines}} identify {{not only the}} <b>ethyl</b> alcohol (or ethanol) found in alcoholic beverages but also other substances similar in molecular structure or reactivity.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} asterric acid derivatives, some with {{antibacterial}} or antifungal activity, have been isolated from an unidentified Geomyces isolate {{found in a}} soil sample from King George Island, Antarctica: <b>ethyl</b> asterrate, n-butyl asterrate, and geomycins A-C.|$|E
25|$|Extraction by organic {{solvents}}: Certain organic solvents such as <b>ethyl</b> acetate present {{much less}} {{health and environmental}} hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.|$|E
25|$|Creatine {{is sold in}} {{a variety}} of forms, {{including}} creatine monohydrate and creatine <b>ethyl</b> ester, amongst others. Though all types of creatine are sold for the same purposes, there are subtle differences between them, such as price and necessary dosage.|$|E
25|$|Diethylzinc (C2H5)2Zn, or DEZ, is {{a highly}} {{pyrophoric}} organozinc compound consisting of a zinc center bound to two <b>ethyl</b> groups. This colourless liquid is an important reagent in organic chemistry and available commercially as a solution in hexanes, heptane, or toluene.|$|E
25|$|Aldol {{condensation}} of acetone and <b>ethyl</b> acetoacetate gave β-keto-ester 3. A Grignard reaction involving methylmagnesium bromide provided alcohol 4, {{which was}} subjected to acid catalyzed elimination to give diene 5. Reduction and acylation gave diene 7 (Scheme 3, compound 1).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes azeotropes {{are useful}} in {{separating}} zeotropic mixtures. An example is acetic acid and water, which do not form an azeotrope. Despite this {{it is very difficult}} to separate pure acetic acid (boiling point: 118.1°C) from a solution of acetic acid and water by distillation alone. As progressive distillations produce solutions with less and less water, each further distillation becomes less effective at removing the remaining water. Distilling the solution to dry acetic acid is therefore economically impractical. But <b>ethyl</b> acetate forms an azeotrope with water that boils at 70.4°C. By adding <b>ethyl</b> acetate as an entrainer, it is possible to distill away the azeotrope and leave nearly pure acetic acid as the residue.|$|E
