40|$|Abstract. Twist drill {{is widely}} used in hole-making process in industries, due their low {{production}} cost and ease of regrinding after wear. However, drilling of fiber reinforced plastics with twist drill often results in defects and damages, such as delamination, debonding, spalling and fiber pullout. The chisel edge of twist drill is the mainly influence for the thrust force and the hole quality in drilling carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates. Pre-drilled pilot hole or reduce chisel edge can eliminate the threat for twist drill in drilling induced-delamination. Drilling-induced thrust force was selected as quality character factors to optimize the drilling parameters (<b>drill</b> <b>type,</b> feed rate and spindle speed) to get the smaller the better machining characteristics by Taguchi method. The {{results show that the}} feed rate and <b>drill</b> <b>type</b> are the most significant factor affecting the induced-thrust in drilling CFRP laminates...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} {{the energy}} required {{during the dry}} drilling of PEEK GF 30, a thermoplastic material, polyether-ether- ketone, reinforced with glass fiber. Three different types of drills are used, respect to material and geometry, under nine cutting conditions based on cutting speed of 6000, 7000 and 8000 rpm, and feed rate of 300, 400 and 500 mm/min. The results show that similar outcomes are obtained with two drills, one of them, wolfram carbide with coating of TiAlN y another of wolfram carbide with point of diamond. This aspect is important due to the economic advantages of the first drill respect to the second one. An analysis of variance, ANOVA, shows that the <b>drill</b> <b>type</b> is the more influent factor, and that the optimal situation can be given with drill of WC and point of diamond with the higher cutting conditions. The energy required, assigned to the torques, is superior to 98 %, in each case, question that could be taken in account in the tools design...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{and performance of}} drilling holes in stacks made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) and aluminum or titanium is a major topic in the aircraft industry. High performance drilling of holes in CFRP material requires a special type of drills and process parameters, while drilling holes in aluminum or titanium requires {{a different type of}} drills and process parameters. For this reason, drilling holes in a stack made of CFRP and metal with the same <b>drill</b> <b>type</b> using the same process parameters results in compromising in the quality of the holes, including burr formation, chip flow and surface quality. It was shown that analyzing acoustic emission (AE) signal in real time can result in determining the time when the drill is close to exit the first layer and enter the second one or exit the stack. A special algorithm has been developed for finding the time when changes in the AE signal occur, indicating that the drill is entering or coming close {{to the end of a}} layer. The results showed the possibility to identify ahead of time when the drill is coming close to the end of the CFRP layer. The AE system will enable a change of machining conditions during drilling in order to improve {{efficiency and}} performance...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of drill microgeometry and cooling supply in the surface integrity of machined holes. The changes in the holes surface and subsurface due to differences on tools features were presented. Design/methodology/approach: Two types of carbide drills with differences in microgeometry and internal/external cooling were used in the machining of SAE 1045 steel. The surface integrity of the holes was evaluated in terms of surface and subsurface quality. The holes surface was examined using optical microscopy (texture) and roughness measurement. The subsurface analysis included plastic deformations, and micro and nanohardness. Findings: The differences in the cooling supply and drills microgeometry showed influence on surface integrity results. The <b>drill</b> <b>type</b> with internal cooling and improved microgeometry produced holes with a smoother surface and subsurface changes of lower magnitude. The most influent feature of microgeometry was the margin thickness. The drill with a thicker margin presented better results, mainly due to friction reduction. Practical implications: The performed investigations could be useful in the industrial practice and give the information for tool selection in drilling of SAE 1045 steel, which is very used in mechanical components industry. Originality/value: The paper shows the importance of analysing the effect of differences of tools features in surface integrity, which is often neglected, but has great influence on the components performance, mainly under severe mechanical and thermal loads. This work also presents the benefits in surface integrity due to drills microgeometry improvement...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium based {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} {{are widely used}} in automobile components such as cardan shaft of Chevrolet corvette, disc brake and engine push rod. In this experiment a Hybrid Metal Matrix Composites (HMMC) are fabricated and drilled. Drilling {{is the process of}} making slots in disc brake and thread in the engine parts. The surface quality of the drilled specimen depends on the speed, feed, <b>drill</b> <b>type</b> and the thrust force. Thrust force plays the major role in drilling the specimen. In this experiment HMMCs are fabricated using two processes-called, sonication and casting. Sonication is the process of coating the carbon nanotubes over the silicon carbide particles (SiCp). Semisolid stir casting is used to reinforce the coated SiCp in the LM 25 alloy. A drilling process is performed on HMMC to analyse {{the extent to which the}} input parameters influence the thrust force and Ovality. The tools used for drilling are solid carbide tools of three different diameters. Taguchi’s experimental design is adopted for the drilling operation. A mathematical model is used to determine the influence of input parameters on the outputs thrust force and ovality. This paper proves the combination of N 3, f 1 and d 1 of the carbide tool results in the lowest value of thrust force and ovality while drilling HMMCs. In this work the HMMC is prepared by coating the abrasive nature, silicon carbide particle and there is a good interfacial bonding between the reinforced particle and matrix and the drilling process becomes smoother. The new being of this article is the treated ceramics, SiCp with carbon nanotubes.
