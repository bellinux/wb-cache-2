40|$|Many {{problems}} associated with the development of nanotechnology require custom designed molecules. We use <b>genetic</b> <b>graph</b> software, a new development, to automatically evolve molecules of interest when only the requirements are known. <b>Genetic</b> <b>graph</b> software designs molecules, and potentially nanoelectronic circuits, given a fitness function that determines which of two molecules is better. A set of molecules, the first generation, is generated at random then tested with the fitness function, Subsequent generations are created by randomly choosing two parent molecules with a bias towards high scoring molecules, tearing each molecules in two at random, and mating parts from the mother and father to create two children. This procedure is repeated until a satisfactory molecule is found. An atom pair similarity test is currently used as the fitness function to evolve molecules similar to existing pharmaceuticals...|$|E

Look-ahead dynamic inter-processor {{connection}} reconfiguration is a multi-processor architectural model, {{which has}} been proposed to eliminate connection reconfiguration time overheads. It consists in preparing link connections in advance in parallel with program execution. An application program is partitioned into sections, which are executed using redundant communication resources. Parallel program scheduling in such a kind of environment incorporates graph partitioning problem. The paper presents a scheduling algorithm for look-ahead reconfigurable multi-processor systems. It is based on list scheduling and utilizes a fast section clustering heuristic for graph partitioning.

40|$|Molecular {{nanotechnology}} is the precise, three-dimensional {{control of}} materials and devices at the atomic scale. An important part of nanotechnology is the design of molecules for specific purposes. This paper describes early results using genetic software techniques to automatically design molecules {{under the control of}} a fitness function. The fitness function must be capable of determining which of two arbitrary molecules is better for a specific task. The software begins by generating a population of random molecules. The population is then evolved towards greater fitness by randomly combining parts of the better individuals to create new molecules. These new molecules then replace some of the worst molecules in the population. The unique aspect of our approach is that we apply genetic crossover to molecules represented by graphs, i. e., sets of atoms and the bonds that connect them. We present evidence suggesting that crossover alone, operating on graphs, can evolve any possible molecule given an appropriate fitness function and a population containing both rings and chains. Prior work evolved strings or trees that were subsequently processed to generate molecular graphs. In principle, <b>genetic</b> <b>graph</b> software should be able to evolve other graph representable systems such as circuits, transportation networks, metabolic pathways, computer networks, etc...|$|E

40|$|Qualitative models support {{interactive}} simulations {{that are}} well suited to help learners in acquiring causal interpretations of physical systems and their behavior. Such simulation models can be large, particularly if they include many subsystems. When simulations are too big they hardly can be used effectively for teaching purposes. They have to be reorganized into smaller sets of simulation models and ordered in a sequence for the learner to progress through. Model-dimensions and techniques such as Causal Model Progression have been presented as means to address this problem. In this paper we investigate how to decompose a large qualitative simulation into a progressive sequence of smaller simulations, useful for teaching purposes, {{in the domain of}} ecology. Based on notions introduced by Causal Model Progression, the <b>Genetic</b> <b>Graph,</b> and the Didactic Goal Generator, we have constructed a set of dimensions {{that can be used in}} this respect. Following these dimensions we show how a large qualitative simulation model of the Brazilian Cerrado vegetation dynamics can be rearranged into a sequence of clusters, each representing and simulating distinct features of such ecological systems. These clusters are ordered in evolutionary model progression lines according to movements from static to dynamic models and, by incorporating structural changes, from less complex to more complex models. The approach presented in this paper thus provides means, in terms of knowledge characteristics, to effectively reorganize qualitative simulation models for teaching purposes. In the discussion we briefly argue that this approach may also be applicable to qualitative simulation in other domains...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 This thesis {{presents}} {{our investigation}} {{of the problem of}} creating an intelligent tutor for solving algebra word problems that employs effective pedagogy. Among our major concerns are the problems of sufficient knowledge and proper knowledge organization. From student protocols and test papers, we derived sets of general purpose strategic rules and computation rules to formulate a cognitive model of problem solving. The model incorporates levels of strategic ability that form a progression from novice to expert. Additional analysis of the data was done to uncover, categorize, generalize, and explain the errors made by students when solving algebra word problems. We implemented a computer program, al-Khorezmi, that exploits the model to trace a student's performance, catch errors and provide corrective feedback explaining the cause of the error, and give help that relates the help to knowledge that it has discussed with the student. The cognitive model emphasizes simulating correct, but not necessarily optimal, strategies that students employ. With our model, we can ensure that a student performs correctly when he employs his own approach before he is taught advanced strategies. Therefore, al-Khorezmi exploits an "understanding" of the student's approach to problem solving. The model incorporates three levels of expertise in the form of strategic rule sets. Al-Khorezmi correlates the strategies with student actions to determine the student's problem-solving skill. We studied the rules of our model to identify relationships important to learning and to interconnect the rules in an extended <b>genetic</b> <b>graph.</b> This knowledge structuring process led to observing that skill improvement can be accomplished (or explained to the student) by applying analogous rules that exploit more powerful methods. Furthermore, problem solving efficiency can be increased (or explained to the student) by combining rules into more powerful rules. Rule simplification can be exploited to establish a simulation model of the generation of errors. Errors are classified as incorrect applications of correct rules, correct applications of incorrect or deviant rules, and incorrect applications of deviant rules. The latter category allows al-Khorezmi to recognize compound errors and account for some of the otherwise unexplained student errors found in our data...|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{diversification}} and coexistence of genes and {{species have been}} traditionally studied in isolated biological levels. Ecological and evolutionary views {{have focused on the}} mechanisms that enable or constrain species coexistence, genetic variation and the genetics of speciation, but a unified theory linking those approaches is still missing. Here we introduce evolutionary graphs in the context of neutral theories of molecular evolution and biodiversity to provide a framework that simultaneously addresses speciation rate and joint genetic and species diversities. To illuminate this question we also study two models of evolution on graphs with fitness differences, which provide insights on how genetic and ecological dynamics drive the speed of diversification. Neutral evolution generates the highest speed of speciation, species richness (i. e. five times and twice as many species as compared to <b>genetic</b> and ecological <b>graphs,</b> respectively) and <b>genetic</b> [...] species diversity (i. e., twice as many as <b>genetic</b> and ecological <b>graphs,</b> respectively). Thus the speed of speciation, the genetic [...] species diversity and coexistence can differ dramatically depending on whether genetic factors versus ecological factors drive the evolution of the system.
