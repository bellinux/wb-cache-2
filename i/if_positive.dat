25|$|Since the physicist's {{concept of}} force has a {{direction}} and a magnitude, {{it may be}} seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force F of 15 newtons. If the positive axis is also directed rightward, then F is represented by the vector 15 N, and <b>if</b> <b>positive</b> points leftward, then the vector for F is −15 N. In either case, the magnitude of the vector is 15 N.

The number printed in the lower right corner indicates how many loyalty counters the planeswalker enters the battlefield with. Planeswalkers' loyalty abilities each have a positive or negative loyalty cost; this is how many counters must be added (<b>if</b> <b>positive)</b> or removed (if negative) to activate that ability. Abilities with negative loyalty costs may only be activated if there are enough loyalty counters to remove. Regardless of the loyalty costs, a single planeswalker may only use one loyalty ability once per turn, and only on its controller's turn during his or her main phase.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} Maimonides’ notion that God cannot be {{described}} in any positive terms, but rather only in negative conceptions. The Jewish Encyclopedia notes his view that “As to His essence, {{the only way to}} describe it is negatively. For instance, He is not physical, nor bound by time, nor subject to change, etc. These assertions do not involve any incorrect notions or assume any deficiency, while <b>if</b> <b>positive</b> essential attributes are admitted it may be assumed that other things coexisted with Him from eternity.” Unrestrained anthropomorphism and perception of positive attributes is seen as a transgression as serious as idolatry, because both are fundamental errors in the metaphysics of God’s role in the universe, and that is {{the most important aspect of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|Random {{microsatellite}} primers can {{be developed}} by cloning random segments of DNA from the focal species. These random segments are inserted into a plasmid or bacteriophage vector, which is in turn implanted into Escherichia coli bacteria. Colonies are then developed, and screened with fluorescently–labelled oligonucleotide sequences that will hybridize to a microsatellite repeat, if present on the DNA segment. <b>If</b> <b>positive</b> clones {{can be obtained from}} this procedure, the DNA is sequenced and PCR primers are chosen from sequences flanking such regions to determine a specific locus. This process involves significant trial and error on the part of researchers, as microsatellite repeat sequences must be predicted and primers that are randomly isolated may not display significant polymorphism. Microsatellite loci are widely distributed throughout the genome and can be isolated from semi-degraded DNA of older specimens, as all that is needed is a suitable substrate for amplification through PCR.|$|E

2500|$|In mathematics, a {{negative}} number {{is a real}} number that is less than zero. [...] Negative numbers represent opposites. [...] <b>If</b> <b>positive</b> represents movement to the right, negative represents movement to the left. [...] <b>If</b> <b>positive</b> represents above sea level, then negative represents below level. [...] <b>If</b> <b>positive</b> represents a deposit, negative represents a withdrawal. [...] They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency. [...] A debt that is owed may {{be thought of as}} {{a negative}} asset, a decrease in some quantity may {{be thought of as a}} negative increase. [...] If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses, then one may choose to distinguish between those senses—perhaps arbitrarily—as positive and negative. [...] In the medical context of fighting a tumor, an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage. [...] Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero, such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature. [...] The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic. [...] For example, − − 3 = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original thing.|$|E
