5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging <b>in</b> <b>political</b> deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being <b>in</b> <b>political</b> dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
