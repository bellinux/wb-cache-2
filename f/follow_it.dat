On December 12, 1962, I-96 was completed around the Lansing area, and M-78 was rerouted to <b>follow</b> <b>it.</b> A year later, I-496 was partially opened through the Lansing area, and M-78 was routed to <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> as well; the former route through downtown was redesignated Business M-78 (Bus. M-78). Around the same time, I-94 was extended along the Blue Water Bridge approach freeway.|$|E

In a few decades to <b>follow,</b> <b>it</b> was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria.

That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E

5|$|Lekson {{developed}} a theory called the Chaco Meridian, {{which is based}} on architectural similarities between the Ancestral Puebloan sites at Aztec Ruins and Chaco Canyon, and Paquime at Casas Grandes in northern Mexico.

The Great North Road roughly follows the Chaco Meridian, and many of the ancient roads in the area appear to <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> towards key sites in the basin.|$|E

Monarchs are usually crowned with St Edward's Crown but some have chosen to use other crowns because it weighs 2.23kg (4.9lb).

5|$|A bowl {{of living}} larvae is {{served at the}} meal, to Picard's disgust. He {{attempts}} to leave, only to find Riker blocking his way. The commander appears {{to be controlled by}} the parasite Quinn brought to the Enterprise. When the others see a prosthetic protrusion on the back of Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. They reveal that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is about to put a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a phaser and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker <b>follow</b> <b>it.</b> They find Remmick ingesting the parasite to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Disney also {{encouraged}} {{his staff to}} see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)— to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin— to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{as well as the}} two Disney films to <b>follow</b> <b>it,</b> were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.|$|E

The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and <b>follow</b> <b>it</b> to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills.
