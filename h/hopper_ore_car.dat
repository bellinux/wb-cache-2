50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} faced by the Cartier Railway during the winter months was keeping the concentrate from freezing to the sides of the <b>ore</b> <b>cars,</b> which could make dumping the concentrate a very slow process. The solution to this problem was to line the insides of the <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> with styrofoam sheets and cover it with plywood. Steam was injected in the plywood/styrofoam liner at the mine and it would keep the ore insulated until it reached the unloader at Port-Cartier.|$|R

Trains on the Lamco Railway were normally made up of three [...] locomotives hauling ninety <b>ore</b> <b>cars.</b> When loaded, they carried a total of 10530 LT of ore.

The system is based around a SICK laser scanner mounted above the rails which scans the cars as they pass underneath. Data obtained from the scan is processed by an embedded PC.

5000|$|Through the [...] "Lukács László" [...] tunnel {{from the}} {{inclined}} plane, a 633mm gauge, electrified railway with an incline of 4‰ {{was built to}} the [...] "Kerpely" [...] adit where formally a horse-drawn existed and was electrified, also the inclined plane from Retişoara valley was overhauled to lower and raise 4 filled <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> and 4 empty <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> on the two platforms. The inclined plane worked by gravity so {{the weight of the}} first platform with the filled <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> descending to the valley floor, pulled up via a cable the platform with the empty <b>ore</b> <b>cars.</b> The iron <b>ore</b> lowered on the inclined plane was forwarded via an 850 metre long electrified (sometimes helped by a steam locomotive) which started {{from the base of the}} inclined plane and ended at the Retişoara's terminus where three electrically driven jaw crushers were installed to crush and sort the iron ore into eight class loading bins where they've loaded the iron <b>ore</b> into the <b>cars</b> of the train from where the iron ore was transported to the ironworks from Govăjdia and Hunedoara. The trackbed preparation work began in 1888 and in 1897 and 1898 were so advanced, that for the line construction the decision steps where, made after the connection of the Ghelari mine railway to the Retişoara inclined plane and after the overhaul of the Retişoara inclined plane, further more the legal occupation of the necessary terrain for the railway has started, the surveying of the trackbed was done successfully between January 9-13, 1899, the ministry of commerce asked for a visit from the government that was held at the Hunedoara town hall on 14 February 1899, the construction authorization was given verbally on the mining company's responsibility. The construction of the railway was started at the beginning of spring, on 4 March 1899 with the ceremonial first hoe stroke. The contract for the construction and usage of the railway was made between three Austrian companies called Gfrerer, Schoch and Grossmann under the ordinance number 24089 from 15 March 1899 issued by the Hungarian Kingdom's Finance Ministry.|$|R

5000|$|During the 50s {{this method}} was {{widespread}} throughout the mine. According to the inclination of the veins, used: parallel fronts (for sub-horizontal veins) or irregular fronts, also called [...] "modas e bordados” (fashions and embroideries) (for veins with a slope between 7º and 12º). Wooden <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> circulated within the stope (manual filling) that transported the ore to the bins where it dropped by gravity to the Lower Scrolling Level. Mechanical drilling {{was done with}} compressed air jacklegs and the start off was done, as today by explosives. When filling the <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> the waste was chosen remaining as a wall that accompanied the advancement of the excavation constituting the structure responsible {{for the support of}} the cavity. This method had several drawbacks such as the requirement of a lot of labour and the loss of the finer fraction of the ore as it was violently thrown against the stone walls. The method was improved in order to find solutions for the loss of this finer fraction and consequently more mineralized.|$|R
