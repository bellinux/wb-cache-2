40|$|A common {{method of}} {{determining}} the power rating of a photovoltaic system is through a regression analysis using historical air temperature, wind speed, irradiance and AC production data (1, 2, 3, 4). The derived polynomial, with its system-specific coefficients, describes the system being rated under a range of possible environmental conditions. From this rating method the photovoltaic system AC power output, at standard test conditions (STC), or under any other conditions, can be estimated. This approach often becomes the criterion for assessing contract compliance or the level of subsidy. Through this method the analysis can answer the basic question, “Did the customer or funding agency get the system capacity specified in the contract? ” One of the difficulties with this method is that it requires a selectively <b>filtered</b> <b>body</b> of raw data amassed over a significant period – weeks or even months—of time.

The model used a single membrane filter with a homogeneous 2 D transmission structure. In the model, the individual sieve with a uniform transmission structure in 2 D space was applied. Because of the required survival of biological particles, the presented model was limited to the narrow filtration conditions that guarantee biological activity of these particles. In this model, the filtration process proceeds in the gravitational field without the involvement of external forces forcing or inhibiting the filtration process. Based on this model there were given basic dependencies describing the required filtration process conditions, such as filtration time and internal forces for particle migration in the <b>filtered</b> <b>body</b> fluid. The basic relationships between the height of the filtered column, duration of the process, and average fluid expenditure of the filtration process for different shapes of the channels molecular drainage lines filter have been determined.

40|$|Coal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} fossil-fuel resource in the United States. `Clean coal` technologies, such as pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) and integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC), require a hot gas filter to remove the corrosive and erosive coal ash entrained in the combustion gas stream. These hot gas filters, or candle filters, must be cost-effective while able to withstand the effects of corrosion, elevated temperature, thermal shock, and temperature transients. Ash loadings may range from 500 to 10, 000 ppm by weight, and may contain particles as fine as 0. 008 mils. The operating environment for the hot gas filter can range in pressure from 10 to 20 atm, in temperatures from 700 to 1750 {degrees}F, and can be oxidizing or reducing. In addition, the process gases may contain volatile chloride, sulfur, and alkali species. Field testing of various commercially available, porous, ceramic filter matrices has demonstrated a loss of up to 50 percent of as-manufactured strength after 1, 000 to 2, 000 hours of exposure to these operating conditions, although full-scale elements have remained intact during normal process operations. Ultramet, a small business specializing in advanced materials R&D, has developed {{a new class of}} hot gas filter materials that offers lower back-pressure, higher permeability, longer life, and high filtration efficiency in the PFBC and IGCC environments. Subscale Ultrafoam Duplex Filter elements have undergone accelerated corrosion testing at temperatures of up to 2370 {degrees}F (at Ultramet), and have been subjected to over 2, 800 hours of exposure to hot PFBC gases (in the Westinghouse Advanced Particulate Filtration System at Brilliant, OH) without any loss in strength in either case. The Ultrafoam Duplex Filter matrix demonstrated 100 percent particle- capture efficiency of coal ash, and had an initial pressure drop of 0. 1 to 0. 6 in-wc/fpm. The Ultrafoam Duplex Filter is composed of a chemical vapor deposition (CVD), silicon carbide (SiC), reticulated, open-cell foam <b>filter</b> <b>body</b> supporting a porous mullite membrane filter. The reticulated foam structure is 70 to 90 percent porous, enabling high permeability, while the 3 -D interconnected cellular lattice resists crack propagation. The CVD SiC material is fine-grained for maximum strength and corrosion resistance, and has no binders or impurities. The porous, mullite, membrane filter is impregnated into the outer surface of the CVD SiC Ultrafoam filter element. The membrane bonds to the foam ligaments, while the foam ligaments reinforce and support the membrane. The mullite membrane, which acts as a barrier filter, is resistant to thermal shock and corrosion. The thin membrane minimizes pressure drop and thermal gradients. The composite Ultrafoam Duplex Filter was designed to combine optimal material selection with functional structural design to maximize corrosion resistance, thermal shock resistance, strength, toughness, and life while minimizing pressure drop and weight. Oxidation rate, corrosion resistance, creep strength, compressive strength, and C-ring strength of the CVD SiC Ultrafoam <b>filter</b> <b>body,</b> and pressure drop and filtration efficiency for subscale Ultrafoam Duplex Filter elements, are reported.

The tube current-time product was 60 mAs at routine dose and subsequently decreased to 33, 24 and 15 mAs to achieve 45 %, 60 % and 75 % dose reduction, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the head losses in several type metal body disc filters manufactured by domestic companies. In order to meet the objective, three different filter designs (L, LT and Y type), each at four different inlet and outlet pipe diameters, were used to measure the head losses at different flow rates in the laboratory. A total of sixteen filters manufactured by three domestic companies (A, B and C) and two different disc elements (linear and curly) were taken into consideration in this study. A comparison of the different filter designs in terms of measured the head losses indicated that in all cases while the L type filters gave the highest head loss, the other two designs provided less head losses at the same flow rate. Furthermore, the head losses in C−LT type filters with curly groove shape discs were less than B−LT type filters with linear groove shape discs in comparing with the LT type filters produced by two different manufacturers even though the design and the size of the <b>filter</b> <b>body</b> were similar. The differences in the head loss can be clarified with the help of the results obtained from the structural characteristic of filtering elements. As a result, in drip irrigation systems, the use of Y and LT type disc filters with curly groove shaped discs are recommended in order to obtain less head losses and low energy requirements when compared with filters used in this study.

30|$|The PMF sampler {{consists}} of special depth-filters (fleece filters) made of coated, thermally bound and progressively layered polypropylene fibres. This design provides low aerodynamic resistance and easy flow of ambient air through the filter. Further on, {{the characteristics of}} the filter material ensure that particles larger than 10  µm (most pollen ranges from 10 to 120  µm in diameter) adhere {{to the surface of the}} fibres and are retained. If it rains, parts of the pollen are washed off the surface of the fibres into the collection flask. The samples for downstream analyses are extracted from the filter material and from the liquid collected in the flask using a special sample preparation procedure described below. For the horizontal wind component the effective flow cross-section (height × width) of the <b>filter</b> <b>body</b> is 100  mm × 80  mm = 0.008  m² for all wind directions. This omnidirectional sampling enables us to collect maize pollen in a representative way and even close to strong sources like the maize field or even in the midst of it, which cannot be done reliably using the standard pollen traps of Hirst-type (Hofmann et al. 2005). Furthermore, the PMF collects more pollen leading to improved detection limits (VDI 4330 Part 3 2007). The measuring points met standard conditions with unobstructed air flow. Because of the high temporal variation of maize pollen shedding in the northern hemisphere (Hofmann et al. 2009 b; Hout et al. 2008; Jaroz et al. 2005; Kawashima et al. 2005), the exposure time has to be standardised covering the main maize flowering period as a requirement for comparable results. This was met by the exposure times from July 11 th until August 4 th in 2007 and from July 11 th until August 8 th in 2008.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{two stage}} {{vertical}} flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) for sewage treatment post coarse screening is an established option in France.

Two stage VFCWs {{have been identified as}} a candidate technology to meet these aspirations. However, there is a paucity of information concerning operation and performance during the start-up period which could last up to two years as well as knowledge transfer relating to differences in hydraulic and organic loading patterns. Accordingly, the UK’s first two stage VFCWs for municipal sewage treatment has been recently built and operated to assess its suitability. Overall, the site performed similar to values reported in the literature regarding total suspended solids, biological demand and ammonium-N being respectively 6. 2 ± 3. 4 mg·L- 1, 5. 6 ± 2. 6 mg·L- 1 and 5. 8 ± 3. 8 mg·L- 1 compared to literature values of 10 ± 10 mg·L- 1, 6 ± 4 mg·L- 1 and 5 ± 6 mg·L- 1, based on composite sampling. However, a key difference compared to operating systems in France was sustained operating periods beyond the design hydraulic load leading to long periods of surface ponding. This had two major impacts: a limiting ability to re- oxygenate the <b>filter</b> <b>body</b> affecting the nitrification performance and retardation of the sludge mineralisation rate reducing the operating infiltration rate and hydraulics of the filters. This highlights the hydraulic limitations of the young filter (5 months of operation) especially in winter conditions.

40|$|Rapid {{pathogen}} dispersal by circulating nutrient {{solutions in}} closed hydroponic systems poses {{a major threat}} to this production method. Slow filtration is very effective against important fungal pathogens such as Phytophthora cryptogea and Pythium aphanidermatum. Filter efficacy against pathogens can partly be predicted by observation of autochthonous microbial communities in slow filters and filter efficacy can be improved by manipulation of these communities. However, data about factors influencing filter efficacy are scarce. Generally, slow filter efficacy is the result of complex interactions between abiotic and biotic attributes of nutrient solution and <b>filter</b> <b>body.</b> Selected abiotic (electric conductivity, pH, oxygen content, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon) and biotic factors (general bacterial and fungal microflora, fluorescent pseudomonads, filamentous actinomycetes, Fusariumoxysporum, P. aphanidermatum, biochemical oxygen demand, enzyme activity) were monitored in a two-year study of two distinct commercial hydroponic systems (tomatoes and ornamentals) with integrated slow filters in supernatant, filter skin and effluent. The same filter skin parameters were monitored in six small-scaleexperimental systems with slow filters to establish possible correlations with filter efficacy against F. oxysporum f. sp. cyclaminis. In half these systems, filter skins were enriched with fungal cell wall preparation to enhance biological activity of microfauna. Total polysaccharide and extracellular biofilm polysaccharide content of the filter skin were determined and a method for extracellular biofilm polymer extraction devised. The hydroponic systems studied differed in terms of chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, oxygen consumption of slow filters by aerobic autochthonous microorganisms and fungal densities before and after slow filtration. A seasonal influence on xylanase enzyme activity in filter skins was also observed. However, as filter efficacy and other parameters in the experimental systems exhibited no significant differences, no firm conclusions could be drawn. Total polysaccharide content within filter skins increased over time and was a good parameter for demonstrating the effects of organic amendments on filter skin formation. Extracellular biofilm polysaccharide content of filter skins was not influenced by organic matter addition but {{more research is needed to}} reveal the influence of this parameter on filter efficacy...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the react {{catastrophe}} in Chernobyl hit White Russia to a particularly great extent. Practically {{one quarter of the}} country is regarded as being radioactively contaminated. According to estimates made by Japanese experts, the damage and the losses enforced on White Russia by Chernobyl amount to approximately 171 billion dollars. This corresponds with approximately the size of 60 annual budgets of the Republic of White Russia and constitutes a severe economic, social and ecological burden for the country - in addition to the common burdens which all Eastern European states are forced to deal with {{as a result of the}} processes of transformation. The radioactive contamination of the soil, which will hardly change in the long term, is the most severe problem regarding its economic usability and other functions (habitat for plants and animals), a <b>filter</b> <b>body</b> for ground water, etc.). Additionally, it is a continual source for the secondary transfer of radioactive substances from the soil to the other environmental media and the food-chain. The radioactive contamination of the atmosphere and the waters, in some cases even in the flora and fauna, has dropped considerably since 1986. However, in certain seasons, increases of a more or less severe nature do occur due to the secondary substance migration from the soil or from the vegetation layer closest to the soil. This leads to the transportation of the radionuclides even beyond the boundaries of the primarily contaminated areas. The areas that are affected by this catastrophe include natural regions with, in comparison to the rest of the country, good to very good ecological qualities and potential, but whose utilisation is now limited. Some of these areas were marked by considerable pollution, even before 1986. Of course, this fact only serves to make the problem even more drastic. Increasingly, in the last few years -also in the Ukraine and Russia- tendencies have become noticeable which, due to the economic situation, will lead to a revision of the agreed political guidelines and safety-orientated restrictions to the residence and economic exploitation in the radiocatively contaminated regions. In addition to the health risks facing the affected population, the re-utilisation of regions suffering from a relatively severe radioactive contaminat ion induces the danger of an increased release and regional and cycle-related migration of radionuclides. Despite a reasonable, controlled revival of the land utilisation in those areas affected to a lesser extent by the contamination, the primary alternative should be sought in the development of the future-orientated, natural potentials of other regions which were unaffected by the contamination, i. e. in the Northern regions of the country (Oblast Vitebsk), incorporated in long-term regional politics, taking into account future requirements and prognosed demographic developments in White Russia...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{peculiarities of}} fitness gyms is the {{succession}} of people who try and follow a training programme and {{are not able to}} stick to it. Based on ethnographic research I try to account for this phenomenon. For regular participants, fitness training is not only important for the kind of body it will hopefully produce in the long run, but also for how it is lived in the present. I will try to show that the way gyms are locally organized - spatiality and interaction rules during training - is as important for exercise adherence as the culturally shaped ideals which sustain fitness culture. In particular, gyms need to provide not only for the substantial body objectives pursued by clients but also for their expressive demands. They need to offer not only competent trainers, but also training spaces where clients may feel secure enjoying a measure of discretion and sober informality. Still, the correct attitude towards fitness work-out is not a passive lack of desire. Fitness work-out asks for the demonstration of a particular kind of desire: each client can and must learn to concentrate only on him or herself in the attempt to improve his or her own exercise performance. Elaborating on my fieldwork, I propose that the more participants in fitness measure themselves against each other and a fantasized body ideal the less will be their capacity to continue attending the gym regularly. The more the desired objectives are perceived as vital, the more participants will feel inadequate, and the more difficult will be for them to concentrate on performing each and all movements and, consequently, to construct and continue a fitness programme. The possibility of <b>filtering</b> <b>body</b> ideals while pursuing an activity which is aimed at their achievement is decisive in protecting individuals from the dangerous exposure of their inadequacies. I conclude on the nature, importance and consequences of this paradoxical construction of experience. Body Projects; Fitness; Interaction; Involvement; Leisure; Pleasure. ...|$|R
30|$|Next, we {{can find}} {{solutions}} based on the Kalman filter for {{a specific set of}} segments by predetermining the DOF at the connections between the segments of the model. Such solutions are based on the Denavit–Hartenberg convention and use Euler angles as their orientation representation. Examples are the extended Kalman <b>filter</b> for lower <b>body</b> parts (hip, knee, ankle) (Lin and Kulić 2012) and the unscented Kalman filter with similar process and measurement model for shoulder and elbow joint angle tracking (El-Gohary and McNames 2012).|$|R
40|$|Miniaturized Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) {{has been}} widely used in many motion {{capturing}} applications. In order to overcome stability and noise problems of IMU, a lot of efforts {{have been made to}} develop appropriate data fusion method to obtain reliable orientation estimation from IMU data. This article presents a method which models the errors of orientation, gyroscope bias and magnetic disturbance, and compensate the errors of state variables with complementary Kalman <b>filter</b> in a <b>body</b> motion capture system. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method significantly reduces the accumulative orientation estimation errors...|$|R
