5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things.

Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E

5|$|Late in 1912 Lasker {{entered into}} {{negotiations}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> title match with Akiba Rubinstein, whose tournament {{record for the}} previous few years {{had been on a}} par with Lasker's and a little ahead of Capablanca's. The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played. This situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.|$|E

Aries agreed to Hogan's terms, on the condition that the X Division Champion be given the same opportunity in future years. Aries would then relinquish the X Division Championship and successfully defeated Bobby Roode for the World title.|$|E

5|$|The 1973–74 season saw {{the arrival}} of a new player in Johan Cruyff, who was bought <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> record £920,000 from Ajax. Already an {{established}} player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season {{for the first time since}} 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu along the way.
