40|$|Tylosin, a {{macrolide}} antibiotic, was co-produced {{with four}} structurally similar antibiotics in fermentation cultures of Streptomyces fradiae. Macrocin, <b>desmycosin,</b> lactenocin, and relomycin {{were found to}} be components of a common pathway that functions in tylosin biosynthesis. Data obtained by the addition of the purified 14 C-labeled antibiotics to cultures of S. fradiae revealed that macrocin and <b>desmycosin</b> were direct precursors of tylosin, whereas lactenocin was an immediate precursor of both macrocin and <b>desmycosin.</b> Incubation of these cultures with [14 C]tylosin resulted in an equivalent distribution of radioactive label between relomycin and an unidentified component. The kinetics of incorporation of label into the two species were similar, suggesting that both were derived directly from tylosin. A system that supported that methylation of macrocin to tylosin by cell-free extracts of S. fradiae was developed. A proposed scheme defining the terminal stages of tylosin biosynthesis is presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 20 -deoxo- 20 -cyclic (alkylamino) {{derivatives}} of tylosin, <b>desmycosin,</b> macrocin and lactenocin was prepared by reductive amination of the C- 20 aldehyde group. The {{majority of the}} compounds were prepared using metal hydrides (sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride) as the reducing agents and a suitable cyclic alkylamine. Subsequently, a more convenient procedure was developed using formic acid as a reducing agent. The C- 20 amino derivatives prepared from <b>desmycosin</b> exhibited good in vitro antimicrobial activity against Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida (MIC range of 0. 78 approximately 6. 25 micrograms/ml) as well as Mycoplasma species (MIC range of 0. 39 approximately 6. 25 micrograms/ml). Several derivatives showed excellent oral efficacy against infections caused by P. multocida in chicks. One of these derivatives, 20 -deoxo- 20 -(3, 5 -dimethylpiperidin- 1 -yl) <b>desmycosin</b> (tilmicosin or EL- 870) was selected for development as a therapeutic agent for pasteurellosis in calves and pigs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Modification of the {{aldehyde}} {{group in}} tylosin and related macrolide antibiotics dramatically enhanced the oral {{efficacy of the}} derivatives against experimental infections caused by susceptible bacteria in laboratory animals. A large number and wide variety of aldehyde-modified macrolide derivatives were prepared, utilizing the Mitsunobu reaction and other chemical transformations. Evaluation of in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity indicated that derivatives of demycarosyltylosin (<b>desmycosin)</b> combined the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial activity with the best efficacy and bioavailability after oral administration. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground:The polyketide lactone tylactone is {{produced}} in Streptomycesfradiae by the TyIG complex of five multifunctional proteins. As with other type I polyketide synthases, the enzyme catalysing the final elongation step (TyIGV) possesses an integral thioesterase domain that {{is believed to be}} responsible for chain termination and ring closure to form tylactone, which is then glycosylated to yield tylosin. In common with other macrolide producers, S. fradiae also possesses an additional thioesterase gene (orf 5) located within the cluster of antibiotic biosynthetic genes. The function of the Orf 5 protein is addressed here. Results:Disruption of orf 5 reduced antibiotic accumulation in S. fradiae by atleast 85 %. Under such circumstances, the strain accumulated <b>desmycosin</b> (demycarosyl-tylosin) due to a downstream polar effect on the expression of orf 6, which encodes a mycarose biosynthetic enzyme. High levels of <b>desmycosin</b> production were restored in the disrupted strain by complementation with intact orf 5, or with the corresponding thioesterase gene, nbmB, from S. narbonensis, but not with DNA encoding the integral thioesterase domain of TyIGV. Conclusions:Polyketide metabolism in S. fradiae is strongly dependent on thethioesterase activity encoded by orf 5 (tylO). It is proposed that the TyIG complex might operate with a significant error frequency and be prone to blockage with aberrant polyketides. A putative editing activity associated with TyIO might be essential to unblock the polyketide synthase complex and thereby promote antibiotic accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Reductive amination of the C- 20 {{aldehyde}} {{group of}} tylosin and related macrolides yielded a large series of derivatives with potentially useful antibiotic properties. Evaluation {{of these new}} compounds {{was conducted on the}} basis of: 1) Broad antimicrobial spectrum in vitro, with particular emphasis on inhibition of Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica; 2) in vivo efficacy, especially when given orally, against P. multocida in experimental infections in chicks; and 3) bioavailability after oral administration to laboratory animals. The most useful activity was found within a series of derivatives produced by reductive amination of <b>desmycosin</b> with secondary amines. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotics {{are mixed}} with the food of bees to fight against diseases. No maximum residue limits have been set for honey. Recommended {{concentrations}} (RCs) have been published by European Union Reference Laboratories for tylosin and streptomycin. The objective of this project was to select and validate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for the screening of tylosin and streptomycin/dihydrostreptomycin residues to be implemented in the French honey control plan. Four ELISA kits for tylosin and five ELISA kits for streptomycin were evaluated. At the end, one kit each was selected and validated for tylosin (TECNA AB 620) and streptomycin (Europroxima). Both ELISA kits for tylosin and streptomycin are specific, robust, fast and easy-to-use tests. The detection capability CC β of tylosin A was {{less than or equal}} to 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1) (half the RC). The CC β of <b>desmycosin</b> (the hydrolysed product of tylosin A in acidic conditions) is approximately 200 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1), which is five times the RC for tylosin (20 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)). Thus, this kit is fit for the screening of tylosin A but is unsuitable to detect <b>desmycosin.</b> The detection capability CC β of streptomycin was {{less than or equal to}} 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1) (one fourth the RC). The cross-reactivity with dihydrostreptomycin was equal to 136 %. Both ELISA kits were applicable to a wide variety of honey (single flower and multiflower, different floral origins, different geographic origins, different consistencies [liquid or solid] and different colours) ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{series of}} semi-synthetic {{derivatives}} of tylosin-related macrolides were evaluated for utility in veterinary medicine. 23 -Modified derivatives of 5 -O-mycaminosyltylonolide (OMT) possessed potent activity in vitro against species of Pasteurella and Mycoplasma. An experimental infection in chicks caused by Pasteurella multocida was utilized to evaluate efficacy; {{several of these}} derivatives of OMT effectively treated the infection when given subcutaneously, but none were effective after oral administration in drinking water. Macrolides retaining the 4 '-O-mycarosyl moiety (tylosin, DMT) had relatively poor activity against Pasteurella in vitro. Certain 20 -modified derivatives of <b>desmycosin</b> demonstrated good oral bioavailability in chicks and a lead compound with oral efficacy in the Pasteurella infection model was discovered. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Two {{microbiological}} kits {{based on}} Bacillus stearothermophilus (Eclipse 50 ® and Premi®Test) {{have been evaluated}} and validated according to the European guideline for the validation of screening methods (January 2010) and {{in relation to the}} concentrations recommended by the EU-RL in 2007. Both tests are robust, a fast method and easy to implement. Both tests are applicable to a very large variety of honeys from different floral and geographical origins (rosemary, lavender, scrub, heath, alder, forest, lemon, acacia, chestnut, raspberry, mountain and flowers) as well as honey of different colours (from blank honey to brown honey, including yellow and orange honey). A satisfactory false-positive rate of 5 % was obtained for the Eclipse 50 ® test. The observed detection capabilities CCβ of the Eclipse 50 ® kit were: chlortetracycline (> 75 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), oxytetracycline (≤ 200 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), tetracycline (> 100 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), cloxacillin (≤ 40 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), tylosin (≤ 200 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), <b>desmycosin</b> (> 400 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfadiazine (≤ 300 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfadimethoxine (≤ 250 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamerazine (> 300 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethazine (> 1000 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethizole (> 75 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethoxazole (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfanilamide (≫ 1000 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfaquinoxaline (> 75 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfathiazole (≤ 250 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)) and lincomycin (> 1500 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)). These levels were all higher than the recommended concentrations where they exist. Due to its lack of sensitivity, it cannot be recommended for reliable routine use. The observed CCβ of the Premi®Test kit were: chlortetracycline (10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), oxytetracycline (> 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), tetracycline (≤ 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), cloxacillin (≤ 5 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), tylosin (≤ 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), <b>desmycosin</b> (≤ 15 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfadiazine (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfadimethoxine (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamerazine (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethazine (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethizole (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethoxazole (≤ 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfanilamide (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfaquinoxaline (≤ 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfathiazole (25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)) and lincomycin (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)).

40|$|International audienceA new, {{simple and}} fast method was {{developed}} for the determination of multi-class antibiotic residues in honey (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides). Separation and determination were carried out by LC-MS/MS. During sample preparation, various parameters affecting extraction efficiency were examined, including the type of solvent, pH, efficiencies of cleavage of N-glycosidic linkages by hydrochloric acid, ultrasonic extraction and its duration compared with shaking, along with dispersive SPE clean-up. Experiments with fortified samples demonstrated that 10  min of ultrasonic treatment with acidified methanol (HCl 2  M) followed by dispersive SPE clean-up with 50  mg PSA gave an effective sample preparation method for several classes of antibiotics in honey. Anhydroerythromycin A, erythromycin A enol ether and <b>desmycosin</b> were used as markers {{for the presence of}} erythromycin A and tylosin A in honey samples. The method was validated according to European Commission Decision (EC) No. 2002 / 657. The recoveries of analytes ranged from 85 % to 111 %. Repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility were < 20. 6 % and 26. 8 %, respectively. Decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) ranged from 6 to 9  µg kg– 1 and from 7 to 13  µg kg– 1, respectively, except for streptomycin and neomycin, which showed slightly higher CCα at 25  µg kg– 1 and CCβ at 34  µg kg– 1. Finally, the method was applied to the honey test material 02270 through a FAPAS proficiency test (PT) for the determination of tetracyclines. PT results were obtained within a z-score range of ± 2, proving that the validated method is suitable for routine analysis to ensure the quality of honey...|$|E
40|$|The {{utility of}} {{spiramycin}} for preventing transplacental transmission of toxoplasmosis and {{the efficacy of}} conventional macrolides against Toxoplasma gondii are subjects of active debate. An in vitro microassay was developed to determine the relative inhibitory activity against T. gondii of 24 conventional macrolides derived from erythromycin and tylosin (14 - and 16 -membered macrolides, respectively). Macrolides and T. gondii RH tachyzoites were added to monolayers of BT cells grown in 96 -well plates. Plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 degrees C, {{and the growth of}} T. gondii was then measured by the selective incorporation of [3 H]uracil in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material during an additional incubation of 20 h. Dose-response curves and 50 and 90 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 and IC 90, respectively) were determined for each drug. Microscopic examination was performed on stained replicates of the infected monolayers, and the relative toxicities of the drugs for host cells were determined. Spiramycin and tylosin showed only limited activity against T. gondii (IC 50 of 20. 16 and 20. 00 micrograms/ml, respectively). Erythromycin and azithromycin had a better anti-Toxoplasma activity with IC 50 of 14. 38 and 8. 61 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas drugs like <b>desmycosin,</b> dirithromycin, and roxithromycin had no detectable activity. Although many macrolides inhibited intracellular proliferation of T. gondii, azithromycin was the only macrolide demonstrating prolonged inhibitory activity on the replication of intracellular tachyzoites. We conclude that conventional 14 - and 16 -membered macrolides often interfere with the growth of, but may not kill, T. gondii RH tachyzoites in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Streptomyces fradiae {{produces}} the macrolide antibiotic tylosin which {{is composed of}} a polyketide lactone, tylactone, and three deoxyhexose sugars. The addition of the first sugar, mycaminose, confers antimicrobial activity onto the inert polyketide. The tyllBA and tylLM loci from the tylosin gene cluster {{are involved in the}} production and addition of mycaminose. tylL and tylA mutants are defective in the biosynthesis or addition of all three sugars, in contrast to the TylM and TylB lesions which are mycaminose specific. Little was known about the tylLM region, but the tylL and tylM mutants had both been complemented with an 8 kb fragment of tyl DNA (Fishman et. al. 1987).;Sequence has been generated for the tylLM region, identifying four ORFs (1 *- 4 *), which could have roles in deoxyhexose metabolism (Gandecha et. al., 1997). The tylM mutant was complemented by integrating a wild-type copy of orf 3 * into the mutant genome; this gene is thought to be the methyltransferase which acts in the mycaminose pathway. The wild-type orf 2 * integrated into the tylL mutant chromosome restored tylosin biosynthesis, and an in-frame stop codon was located part way through orf 2 * amplified from the tylL genome. orf 2 * was a surprising candidate for the tylL gene because it is the mycaminosyl-glycosyltransferase. The tylM mutant could not convincingly convert OMT, DMT or <b>desmycosin</b> to tylosin. We therefore believe that the TylL phenotype is the result of multiple mutations or a physiological effect. The function of orf 1 * is still unknown, although matches with other genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino sugars suggest that it is involved in mycaminose production.;Analysis of the orfl* transcript suggest that, during antibiotic biosynthesis, orf 1 * may be co-transcribed with tylG, with two additional transcripts initiating independently of tylG. Promoter-probe vectors have been of limited use in identifying promoters...|$|E
