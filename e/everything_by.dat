5|$|Planning for Dragon Quest II {{began in}} April 1986, {{a month before}} the release of the {{original}} Dragon Quest. With the system and memory map decided, they started development in early July. At the beginning of development, producer Yukinobu Chida asked director and programmer Koichi Nakamura for a definite release date, and he offhandedly set one. Then the development team was divided into two groups, with one designing the story, as well as the monsters, and one doing the programming. The initial deadline was set for early November, but the game ultimately suffered a small delay. The development team had finished programming almost <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> the time of the initial release and believed the game could be released {{by the end of that}} year. In the Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, published on November 11, 1986, it was announced that the game would be released in late December. However, the developers found that the game was too difficult, so it was delayed for month to adjust the balance. They had to finish the final version in mid-December, which they did, and then rushed to deliver to Nintendo to make the physical game cartridges. The game was released on January 26, 1987.|$|E
25|$|Concerned about {{corruption}} in Chinese science, some Chinese scientists, including Professor Liu Ming 刘明 of Zhejiang University in his 2005 book Critique of the Academic Evaluation System 学术评价制度批判, argue that interference from {{government officials and}} university bureaucrats makes peer review far less effective in China than it could be. The time scientists spend cultivating politically influential people is lost to scientific research. Liu argues that the command economy mentality of measuring <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> the numbers combined with pervasive political interference results in a great waste of money, human talent as well as considerable {{corruption in}} Chinese science. A 2008 investigation into a certification for high-tech enterprises allowing large tax breaks and other advantages {{found that more than}} 70% of the enterprises had gained this under questionable circumstances and an investigation of a sample found that 73% did not pass the requirements.|$|E
25|$|Dr. David Clark's Canadian Army Trilogy, The Ridge (1994), Lamone (2001) and Lucifer's Gate 2002 {{outlines}} {{the stories of}} two generations of the Warwick family and the Canadian Army in World War I. In Lucifer's Gate, Captain James Niles, a Royal Military College graduate, is posted temporarily to a recruit training battalion. He is a professional officer, all spit and polish, <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> the King's Regulations. After ordering the crowd to disperse, Niles accepts thanks from German proprietors of a tailor shop, Hans and Analise Holzhauer and falls for their daughter, Rosamund. The lovely Rosamund is unfortunately, an unsuitable match since they are worlds apart in social position. Niles, who is practically engaged to the Colonel's daughter Roselyn, comes to realize while serving under General Arthur Currie in France, that Roselyn never has a serious thought, caring only about tennis and garden parties.|$|E

[...] He pronounced The New Woman (the first novel by Prus that he read) [...] "better than Dickens"—Dickens being a favorite author of Conrad's.

[...] Zygmunt Szweykowski similarly faulted The New Womans loose, tangential construction; but this, in his view, was partly redeemed by Prus' humor and by some superb episodes, while [...] "The tragedy of Mrs. Latter and the picture of [...] Iksinów are among the peak achievements of [...] novel-writing." ...|$|E

Recording at RCA Victor was a different experience for Presley and his band, who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at Sun Studio. Guitar player Scotty Moore later commented, [...] "It was a larger studio than Sun's and more regimented - they called <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> a tape number. We would sit around at Sun, eat hamburgers and then somebody would say, 'Let's try something.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Smith {{has said}} of his character: [...] "The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. By <b>everything.</b> <b>By</b> every single thing. That's what's {{wonderful}} about him as a character. It's why children like him, I think. Because he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe." [...] In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with Orbital, and performed with them {{a version of the}} Doctor Who theme, at the Glastonbury Festival. Smith hosted the Doctor Who Prom at the Royal Albert Hall on 24–25 July 2010. On the morning of 26 May 2012, Smith carried the Olympic torch in Cardiff, an activity which was noted by Doctor Who fans for its resemblance to a 2006 episode of the show in which the Doctor carried the torch. On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} 2013 Christmas special.|$|E
500|$|Plutarch lauds Demosthenes for {{not being}} of a fickle disposition. Rebutting {{historian}} Theopompus, the biographer insists that for [...] "the same party and post in politics which he held from the beginning, to these he kept constant to the end; and was so far from leaving them while he lived, that he chose rather to forsake his life than his purpose". On the other hand, Polybius, a Greek historian of the Mediterranean world, was highly critical of Demosthenes's policies. Polybius accused him of having launched unjustified verbal attacks on great men of other cities, branding them unjustly as traitors to the Greeks. The historian maintains that Demosthenes measured <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> the interests of his own city, imagining that all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed upon Athens. According to Polybius, {{the only thing the}} Athenians eventually got by their opposition to Philip was the defeat at Chaeronea. [...] "And {{had it not been for}} the king's magnanimity and regard for his own reputation, their misfortunes would have gone even further, thanks to the policy of Demosthenes".|$|E
500|$|Without a map, {{the route}} they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to [...] {{and could see}} the {{northern}} coast. They were above Possession Bay, which meant {{they would need to}} move eastward to reach their intended destination of Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge. There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge. [...] Early next morning, 20 May, seeing Husvik Harbour below them, they knew that they were on the right path. At seven o'clock in the morning they heard the steam whistle sound from Stromness, [...] "the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914". After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.|$|E

500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by <b>everything.</b> <b>By</b> books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E
500|$|On {{stage in}} 2009, Hoffman played Iago in Peter Sellars' futuristic {{production}} of Othello (with {{the title role}} by John Ortiz), which received mixed reviews. Ben Brantley, theatre critic of The New York Times, {{found it to be}} [...] "exasperatingly misconceived", remarking that even when Hoffman is attempting to [...] "manipulate others into self-destruction, he comes close to spoiling <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> erupting into genuine, volcanic fury". Hoffman also did his first vocal performance for the claymation film Mary and Max, although the film did not initially have an American release. He played the male title character, a depressed New Yorker with Asperger syndrome, while Toni Collette voiced Mary– the Australian girl who becomes his pen pal. Continuing with animation, Hoffman then worked on an episode of the children's show Arthur and received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Performer In An Animated Program. Later in the year, he played a brash American disc jockey opposite Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans in Richard Curtis's British comedy The Boat That Rocked (also known as Pirate Radio)– a character based on Emperor Rosko, a host of Radio Caroline in 1966. He also had a cameo role as a bartender in Ricky Gervais's The Invention of Lying.|$|E
500|$|The video {{stood out}} conspicuously to Aguilar for its chaotic texture through the rapid editing of the {{multiple}} shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an [...] "apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation", she added. Since chaos has traditionally {{been associated with the}} female ontogenetic principle as opposed to male principle of order, the video in turn came to be associated with duality between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc. Aguilar also drew parallel between Metropolis and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work. However, unlike Metropolis which portrayed repression of a rebellious proletariat, the chaotic nature of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] video showed freedom instead. Caryn James from The New York Times added that [...] "asked about the video, [...] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.' You don't have to buy Madonna's next loopy bit of symbolism—'I was chained to my desires'—to believe the feminist subtext she finds in the video. 'I do <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> my own volition. I'm in charge, O.K.' Madonna in chains, though, is far removed from those unfortunate women who don't know that they have options." [...] Madonna also complained about the feminist criticisms of her [...] "crotch-grabbing", saying that [...] "if male singers like Michael Jackson can get away with it, why can't women?" [...] Theorist Douglas Kellner further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end. According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images {{in the beginning of the}} video, but contrasted them with her [...] "crotch-hugging" [...] male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position. As feminist author Susan Bordo pointed out, [...] "it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition." ...|$|E

[...] This has been variously and contentiously interpreted by many authors. Ludo Rocher almost entirely dismisses Megasthenes as unreliable, questioning the wording used by Megasthenes' informant and Megasthenes' interpretation of them. Timmer considers it to reflect a misunderstanding that the Mauryans were illiterate [...] "based upon the fact that Megasthenes rightly observed that the laws were unwritten and that oral tradition played such an important part in India." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sam Moskowitz's biographical {{essay on}} Smith in Seekers of Tomorrow {{states that he}} {{regularly}} read Argosy magazine, and <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, H. Rider Haggard, Edgar Allan Poe, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Moskowitz also notes that Smith's [...] "reading enthusiasms included poetry, philosophy, ancient and medieval history, and all of English literature". (Smith's grandson notes that he spoke, and sang, German.) The influence of these is not readily apparent, except in the Roman section of Triplanetary, and in the impeccable but convoluted grammar of Smith's narration. Some influence of 19th-century philosophy of language may be detectable in the account in Galactic Patrol of the Lens of Arisia as a universal translator, which is reminiscent of Frege's strong realism about Sinn, that is, thought or sense.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} incident, Yang Biao (楊彪), the Grand Commandant, {{was arrested and}} imprisoned for {{allegedly}} conspiring with Yuan Shu, a warlord who rebelled against the Eastern Han dynasty. Man Chong, {{who was in charge}} of interrogating Yang Biao, received requests from his colleagues Xun Yu and Kong Rong to refrain from using torture on Yang Biao during the interrogation. However, Man Chong ignored them and did <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> the book. A few days later, Man Chong reported to Cao Cao: [...] "Yang Biao had nothing to say when I interrogated him. Before executing a criminal, we must first produce evidence of his guilt and show it to the public. Yang Biao is a reputable man. If we execute him without sufficient evidence to show that he is guilty, the people will lose faith in us. I hope you will reconsider your decision carefully and not be too hasty in ordering Yang Biao's execution." [...] Cao Cao then released Yang Biao. Xun Yu and Kong Rong were initially angry with Man Chong when they found out that he tortured Yang Biao during the interrogation. However, they became more amiable towards him after they heard what he told Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{shareholders}} {{expressed concerns}} about the merger, notably Square's original founder and largest shareholder Miyamoto, who would find himself holding a significantly smaller percentage of the combined companies. Other criticism came from Takashi Oya of Deutsche Securities who expressed doubts {{about the benefits of}} such a merger: [...] "Enix outsources game development and has few in-house creators, while Square does <b>everything</b> <b>by</b> itself. The combination of the two provides no negative factors but would bring {{little in the way of}} operational synergies." [...] Miyamoto's concerns were eventually resolved by altering the exchange ratio of the merger so that each Square share would be exchanged for 0.85 Enix shares rather than 0.81 shares, and the merger was greenlit. The merger was set for April 1, 2003, on which date the newly merged entity Square Enix came into being. At the time of the merger, 80% of Square Enix staff were made up of former Square employees. As part of the merger, former Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed president of the new corporation, while former Enix president Keiji Honda became its vice president. The founder of Enix and the largest shareholder of the newly combined corporation, Yasuhiro Fukushima, was made its honorary chairman.|$|E
