25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a <b>displacer</b> <b>piston.</b> The <b>displacer</b> <b>piston</b> is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E
25|$|A gamma Stirling {{is simply}} a beta Stirling in which the power piston is mounted in a {{separate}} cylinder alongside the <b>displacer</b> <b>piston</b> cylinder, but is still connected to the same flywheel. The gas in the two cylinders can flow freely between them and remains a single body. This configuration produces a lower compression ratio because {{of the volume of}} the connection between the two but is mechanically simpler and often used in multi-cylinder Stirling engines.|$|E
25|$|Thermoacoustic {{devices are}} very {{different}} from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each working gas molecule does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling <b>displacer</b> <b>piston.</b> Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have a displacer, as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E

40|$|The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer- 02 (AMS- 02) is an {{experiment}} {{that will be}} flown as an attached payload on the International Space Station to detect dark matter and antimatter. It uses large superconducting magnets cooled with superfluid helium to bend the path of cosmic particles {{through a series of}} detectors, which then measure the mass, speed, charge, and direction of the particles. Four Sunpower M 87 N Stirling-cycle cryocoolers are used to extend the mission life by cooling the outer vapor-cooled shield of the dewar. The main magnet coils are separated by a distance of approximately 1 m and the coolers are located approximately 1. 5 m from the center line of the magnet, where the field is as high as 925 gauss perpendicular to the cryocooler axis and 400 gauss along the cryocooler axis. Interactions between the applied magnetic field and the linear motor may result in additional forces and torques on the compressor piston. Motion of the compressor arid <b>displacer</b> <b>pistons</b> through the magnetic field spatial gradients will generate eddy currents. Additional eddy currents are created during magnet charge, discharge, and quench by the time-varying magnetic field.

40|$|In this paper, pole placement-based {{design and}} {{analysis}} of a free piston Stirling engine (FPSE) is presented and compared to the well-defined Beale number design technique. First, dynamic and thermodynamic equations governing the engine system are extracted. Then, linear dynamics of the free piston Stirling engine are studied using dynamic systems theory tools such as root locus. Accordingly, the effects of variations of design parameters such as mass of pistons, stiffness of springs, and frictional damping on the locations of dominant closed-loop poles are investigated. The design procedure is thus conducted to place the dominant poles of the dynamic system at desired locations on the s-plane so that the unstable dynamics, which is the required criterion for energy generation, is achieved. Next, the closed-loop poles are selected based on a desired frequency so that a periodical system is found. Consequently, the design parameters, including mass and spring stiffness for both power and <b>displacer</b> <b>pistons,</b> are obtained. Finally, the engine power is calculated through the proposed control-based analysis {{and the result is}} compared to those of the experimental work and the Beale number approach. The outcomes of this work clearly reveal the effectiveness of the control-based design technique of FPSEs compared to the well-known approaches such as Beale number...|$|R

Magnetic suspension of the RSSPC power piston can potentially increase overall efficiency by 0. 5 to 1 percent (0. 1 to 0. 3 efficiency points).

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{governing}} thermodynamic and dynamic equations {{of the engine}} were first extracted. Then, the fifth- and sixth-order models were described and discussed in detail. Consequently, {{the effectiveness of the}} two methods on the FPSE performance using the locations of the closed-loop poles was compared and also evaluated. The results showed that the effect of the pressure drop using the mass flow rate change (sixth order) did not have a considerable effect on the FPSE performance, while it is supposed that the heat transfer coefficient (fifth-order model) has a profound effect on the FPSE performance. Accordingly, the fifth-order model was selected as the design scheme. The aim of the proposed method is to design the essential parameters of the Stirling engine, which plays a fundamental role in the FPSE system, including the power and <b>displacer</b> <b>pistons</b> and springs attached to the pistons. Next, the experimental study was conducted to evaluate the validity of the design procedure as well as the simulation. The validity of the proposed design procedure as well as the corresponding simulation results is a significant issue that must be addressed at this point. Hence, the simulation outcomes were compared to the measured parameters which are clearly in a good agreement. Lastly, the prototype experimental engine (SUTech-SR- 1) is developed and experimented. Then, based on the values of designed parameters, the performance of the engine was investigated and compared to the empirical results. The results could predict the operating frequency of the SUTech-SR- 1 as 68.2  rad/s with an error less than 0.4 %, without causing any practically meaningful error in the design scheme, compared to the experimental results.|$|R

The model validation {{and the engine}} testing are being done under a joint interagency agreement between the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and NASA-Lewis. A kinematic code developed at Lewis was upgraded to permit simulation of free-piston engine performance; it was further upgraded and modified at Lewis and is currently being validated. The model predicts engine performance by numerical integration of equations for each control volume in the working space. Piston motions are determined by numerical integration of the force balance on each piston or can be specified as Fourier series. In addition, the model Fourier analyzes the various piston forces to permit the construction of phasor force diagrams.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first order analysis of {{four types of}} overdriven free-displacer Stir-ling machines. All the presented types of machines can work as refrigerating machines, prime movers or heat exchange accelerators depending on parameters such as the hot to cold source temperatures ratio, the nondimensional mass of working gas in the ma-chine, the displacer rod to displacer cross sectional area ratio, the corrected dead space to piston cylinder volume ratio and the <b>displacer</b> to <b>piston</b> cylinder volume ratio. In its analytical form this theory holds for machines at low speed as {{it is assumed that}} the piston displacement can be neglected during the displacer movement duration. This analysis may be used to find the conditions and values giving either the best theoretical refrigerating cycle or the best theoretical prime mover cycle, the associated reference work, reference time, efficiency and heat quantities involved. A table gives the analyti-cal expressions and the limiting values of the main parameters for the four different types of Ringbom machines considered.
