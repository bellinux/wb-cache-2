50|$|In the Second World War, Lübbecke largely escaped {{attack and}} was {{occupied}} on 3 April 1945 by British troops without great resistance. The {{nearby town of}} Bad Oeynhausen became {{the headquarters of the}} British forces and British administrative authorities and military staff elements were also housed in Lübbecke. To that end 251 of the 432 houses in Lübbecke were commandeered and cordoned off as accommodation for the Allies. Almost the entire town centre became an <b>exterritorial</b> zone, because all the important administrative buildings of the town's infrastructure went to the British. The finance office on Kaiserstraße was used as the head office of the British Occupation Zone authorities. Even after the foundation of the Federal Republic of West Germany this building remained a base for British military staff, its last use being as the headquarters of the 2nd Armoured Division (Herford being the headquarters of the 1st Armoured Division) before it withdrew in 1983.|$|E

40|$|First, we {{will explain}} {{the concept of}} globalization. We will {{describe}} its conceptual variants and point {{to some of the}} phenomena that are associated with this process. Next we will describe the traditional paradigm of CSR where the responsibilities of businesses are discussed vis-a-vis a more or less properly working nation state system and a homogenous moral (cultural) community. We will argue that both these assumptions become problematic in the current 'post-national constellation' (Habermas 2001). We describe the new situation with regulatory gaps in global regulation, an erosion of national governance (loss of national sovereignty and the <b>exterritorial</b> application of national law), and a loss in moral and cultural homogeneity in the corporate environment. We discuss the consequences of the post-national constellation with the help of two recent observations of business firms' behavior which call for a fresh view on the concept of CSR.

40|$|The Dutch west Caribbean {{company is}} a modest proposal. The company was created as an {{architectural}} response to an ongoing geopolitical and geoeconomic process (the development of the offshore economy). A process, whereby not only unusual goods such as artworks, battles of wine and stolen antiquities (that were in times past, part of the collective goods) were turned into commodities, but also basic human rights such {{as the right to}} asylum, freedom of speech, right to health and more are being turned into commodities. The Dutch west Caribbean company is focused on tax havens and the Freeport as a withdrawal facility, one that seeps through the cracks of national sovereignty and establishes its own logistics network. The offshore world has been gaining enormous popularity since the 1980 ’s and despite increasingly defining the operations of the globalized economy and the spaces it generates, it is a spatial phenomenon that is mostly ignored by the architectural and urban discourse. Manifested by the forms of tax havens, freeports and special economic zones, the offshore world offers an <b>exterritorial</b> space where people, objects, and capital can operate beyond the burdens of national sovereignty, and remain in an unregulated limbo, in theory, forever.

40|$|During {{the reign}} of Reza Shah, policy of magisterial {{modernization}} was done {{on the basis of}} society modernization by importing products, civilization manifestations, modern management, monopolizing political power and governmentalizing economy. Social structures, under the influence of integration in global system and the effects caused by two world wars, as a semi-periphery region, did not stay away from unpleasant consequences of the situation such as immigration inside the borders of Iran and immigration among the political borders of Iran especially in eastern borders. Because of special geographical situation (border region) and economic situation (silk trade route), eastern borders had an important role in Iran’s <b>exterritorial</b> immigration system and were receptive to resident ethnics in neighbor countries (Hazara in Afghanistan, Sikh, etc.) and were also the entry gate of immigrants to eastern cities of Iran. In this research, emphasizing on Iran’s situation in global system, immigration and its causes on Zahedan have been studied. The results suggest that the strategic location of Zahedan was a predisposing factor of preliminary foundations such as railway for economy growth of the city and a small group of Hindus’ immigration for employment in this part. Gradually, central government actions in customs section and transportation development, turned Zahedan into a suitable region for trade that resulted immigration and habitation of many citizens of neighboring countries in order to work in economic fields. Because of disability in adaption to new conditions and lack of proficiency, many native inhabitants immigrated to the other regions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks into}} the nature of {{contemporary}} modernity as reflected by the metaphorical discourses of Zygmunt Bauman, an outstanding sociological writer, and Salman Rushdie, a famous novelist. This approach to the two writers’ echoing discourses focuses upon their new perceptions of frontiers, which are crucial in their inquiries. When Rushdie weaves a whole lecture, later published in book form under the title Step Across this Line, around the idea of frontier, he echoes Bauman’s vocabulary and perceptions when he explores his own ideas of modern “liquidity. ” Rushdie, whose book-length essay came out in 2002, never references Bauman’s Liquid Modernity, published in 2000. Arguably, Rushdie may have never read Bauman’s book. However, the similarity of their perceptions upon the “liquid” nature of modernity, especially when applied to frontiers not only spatially but also temporally, is striking. Bauman’s statements that “in the fluid stage of modernity, the settled majority is ruled by the nomadic and <b>exterritorial</b> elite,” that “holding the ground is not that important if the ground can be reached and abandoned at whim, in a short time or in no time,” that “being modern means being perpetually ahead of oneself, in a state of constant transgression” find a mirror in Rushdie’s contentions that “in our deepest natures, we are frontier-crossing beings,” that “we are living in a frontier time, one of the great hinge periods in human history, in which great changes are coming about at great speed. ...|$|E
40|$|The author, Director of the Max Planck Institute for International Patent, Copyright and Competition Law in Munich {{considers}} {{the influence of}} full uniformization of the EEC market after 1992 on the protection of industrial property and on free flow of goods within the Community. He pays {{much attention to the}} relations between the internal legal systems regulating the protection of patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights to the law of the Community. Both in the present {{as well as in the}} past — 1992 prospective regulation of the EEC law a departure from the protection granted by internal (national) legal systems seems not only undesirable but also impossible. Much time is needed for common European protection laws to supersede the coexisting protection provided by internal systems. The analysis of particular industrial property rights allows the author to formulate the conclusion that the greatest progress in that respect has been achieved in the EEC patent law; European patents granted on the strength of the Munich Convention of 1973 are much in demand. It should be stressed that the creation by the end of 1992 of uniform internal EEC market is a strong incentive for intensifying the works on the uniformization of industrial property protection. The author also analyses the decisions of the EEC Court with respect to the law on industrial property and free flow of goods on the EEC market, paying special attention to decisions based on Art. 36 of the Treaty of Rome. As to the relation between the principle of free flow of goods and the restrictions resulting from internal systems of industrial property law hitherto existing decisions of the EEC Court will fully remain in force also after 1992. The Court adopted a principle, well known in German law since long, of exhaustion of a right to trademark. This principle allows neither to divide the Common Market by means of national trademarks nor to isolate it from goods produced or reimported from the outside of the Common Market as long as such goods have been provided with a trademark by an authorized person. Circulation restrictions are to maintain arificially high prices for trademarked goods. Towards the end of his article the author points out that there is a danger of changing that situation once the European trademark law comes into force. Recently, under the pressure of industrial lobbies, views have been expressed that this law should regulate only the institution of „European" and not „exterritorial" exhaustion of a right. Such a short-sighted and economically unjustified regulation could lead to the protectionistic isolation of the Community from the rest of the world. The author is strongly for retaining the conception of <b>exterritorial</b> exhaustion of a right to a trademark...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this invited essay is to assess {{the future of the}} CSR {{performance}} of American multinationals in light of several ongoing trends. These trends include companies’ voluntary CSR programs and the global self-regulatory standards for responsible company activities that are developing in almost every industry. Moreover, the decade-long project at the United Nations to identify multinational companies’ responsibilities with respect to international human rights, ultimately spearheaded by Special Representative John Ruggie, has for the first time established global expectations of responsible corporate activity. At the same time, however, legal developments in the United States may be trending in the opposite direction, toward increased power and diminished accountability for corporations. Two legal developments that highlight this counter-trend will frame this discussion. The first, the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U. S. 310 (2010) recognizes a constitutional right for corporations to give financial support {{to a wide range of}} electioneering activities, including by using corporate funds to pay for and broadcast advertisements for specific candidates for office. The effect is to allow American companies to further consolidate their already substantial political power. The second, the opinion by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 621 F. 3 d 111 (2 d Cir. 2010), reh’g en banc denied, 642 F. 3 d 379 (2011), aff’d, 569 U. S. __, 133 S. Ct. 1659 (Apr. 17, 2013), denied the possibility of corporate liability under the Alien Tort Statute for Royal Dutch Shell’s employees’ alleged violations of Nigerian community members’ international human rights. A 2 - 1 majority held instead that violations of international law could only be asserted against natural persons or nations. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and in a decision handed down on April 17, 2013, the Court unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Second Circuit. The five-Justice opinion of the Court held that the ATS cannot be used to redress violations of the law of nations that occur outside the territory of the United States, except in exceptional circumstances not found in Kiobel. Neither the majority opinion nor the concurrence addressed the corporate liability issue, which means that the Second Circuit’s ruling on that issue remains the law of the Second Circuit — an important outcome, given the significance of the Second Circuit as a venue for ATS cases. Taken together, the overall effect of the Second Circuit’s rejection of corporate liability for human rights violations and the Supreme Court’s rejection of <b>exterritorial</b> application of the ATS to any defendant, corporate or otherwise, is the substantial evisceration of companies’ legal accountability for international human rights violations under the ATS. On a theoretical level, these decisions send mixed messages about corporate personhood and identity. But on a practical level, the two decisions work in unfortunate concert to increase the already considerable political power of U. S. corporations at home, even as they reduce the risk of legal accountability for their actions abroad. By doing so, they shrink the shadow of the law — the threat of 2 ̆ 2 hard 2 ̆ 2 legal regulation — that has been an important incentive to the adoption of voluntary, 2 ̆ 2 soft-law 2 ̆ 2 CSR standards. Thus, these legal developments, though ostensibly unrelated to the voluntary pursuit of CSR activity, may in fact act as a disincentive to that activity...|$|E
