5|$|The Estates-General were {{convened in}} May 1789 to ratify {{financial}} reforms. The Count of Provence favoured a stalwart position against the Third Estate and <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> for tax reform. On 17 June, the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly, an Assembly {{not of the}} Estates, but of the people.|$|E
5|$|The Poor People's Campaign was {{controversial}} {{even within}} the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that {{the goals of the}} campaign were too broad, that <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.|$|E
5|$|After the Belgian {{surrender}} on 28 May 1940, the Germans {{formed a}} Militärverwaltung (Military Administration) in the country; commanded by the German aristocrat and career soldier, General Alexander von Falkenhausen. A {{section of the}} administration called the Militärverwaltungsstab (Military Administrative Staff), commanded by SS-Gruppenführer Eggert Reeder, was reponsable for the day-to-day civil administration of the territory. The Militärverwaltungsstab would present <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> to the Secretaries-General, even though the Committee was separate, {{in order to have}} them carried out.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil {{prepared for what}} {{was seen as an}} imminent conflict. PedroII was the main reason for Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|Years after independence, West Bengal {{was still}} {{dependent}} on the central government for help in meeting <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> for food; food production remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, {{there has been a}} significant increase in food production since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–1981, declining to 5% by 1997–1998. In contrast, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate.|$|E
5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E

5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in <b>its</b> <b>demands,</b> because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Odex {{blamed the}} {{approximate}} 70% fall in its Video CD (VCD) and Digital Video Disc (DVD) sales in 2006 and 2007 on illegal downloading. The response of anime fans {{was that the}} fall in sales was because Odex's products were inferior, inaccurately translated, and released later than the online versions. Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes (such as yaoi) and on fansubbers—anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue—whom they had hired. In response, the Board of Film Censors said {{that it did not}} ask for subtitles to be changed, that it merely classified content, and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles. In addition to problems of quality and scheduling, criticisms were directed at Odex's litigious strategy and poor public relations. Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS) in making <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> for compensation.|$|E

25|$|The {{union was}} {{recognized}} by France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan in the Treaty of Paris of 1920, which however never came into force, because Japan did not ratify it. The United States refused to sign the treaty {{on the grounds that}} Russia was not represented at the Conference. Soviet Russia (and later, the USSR) did not recognize the union, and by 1924, after <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> for a regional plebiscite were declined by Romania for the second time, declared Bessarabia to be Soviet territory under foreign occupation.|$|E
25|$|From May to August 1907, {{the city}} {{was the site of}} a smelter workers' strike {{organized}} by Local 545 of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), with the goal of a fifty-cent per day pay raise.

Ioan Vodă's revolt against the Ottomans ended in his execution (1574). The country descended into political chaos, with frequent Ottoman and Tatar incursions and pillages. The claims of Mușatins to the crown and the traditional system of succession were ended by scores of illegitimate reigns; one of the usurpers, Ioan Iacob Heraclid, was a Protestant Greek who encouraged the Renaissance and attempted to introduce Lutheranism to Moldavia.|$|E
25|$|A horreum was a type {{of public}} {{warehouse}} used during the ancient Roman period. Although the Latin term {{is often used to}} refer to granaries, Roman horrea were used to store many other types of consumables; the giant Horrea Galbae in Rome were used not only to store grain but also olive oil, wine, foodstuffs, clothing and even marble. By the end of the imperial period, the city of Rome had nearly 300 horrea to supply <b>its</b> <b>demands.</b> The biggest were enormous, even by modern standards; the Horrea Galbae contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000m²).|$|E

However, {{following the death of}} Franco, many Basque nationalists demanded that the Basque language be recognized. One of these groups was Euskadi Ta Askatasun (ETA). ETA had initially begun as a nonviolent group to promote Basque language and culture. However, when <b>its</b> <b>demands</b> were not met, it turned violent and evolved into violent separatist groups. Today, ETA's demands for a separate state stem partially from the problem of perceived linguistic discrimination. However, ETA called a permanent cease-fire in October 2011.|$|E
