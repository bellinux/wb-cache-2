5|$|On 19 September, a JNA force {{consisting}} {{of at least}} 100 T-55 and M-84 tanks with armoured personnel carriers and heavy artillery pieces left Belgrade. It crossed into Croatia near the Serbian town of Šid on 20 September. The Croatians were quickly routed and fell back to Vukovar. The JNA's 1st Guards Mechanised Brigade soon reached the Vukovar barracks and lifted the Croatian siege of the facility. They also moved to encircle Vukovar. By 30 September, the town was almost completely surrounded. All roads in and out were blocked, and the only route in was via a <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> through a perilously exposed cornfield.|$|E
25|$|From Knapton {{the path}} heads south east across several open fields towards {{the village of}} Edingthorpe. The {{approach}} to the village is up a gently sloping <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> towards Edingthorpe Parish church which is called All Saints.|$|E
25|$|Hardwick Court Farm, Hardwick Court when a manor, is a {{large farm}} with {{farmhouse}} in the west of Chertsey, Surrey, England and was first established during the Saxon period. A Saxon main road to Chertsey once ran through it but is now reduced to just a <b>farm</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

25|$|The 1921–28 Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} {{the area as}} Laigh Milton for the first time. The first viaduct is still clearly shown {{as part of the}} <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> to Cockhill farm from West Gatehead. No sign of the wooden viaduct is {{indicated}} and a saw mill is now marked, possibly the cause of the need for the extra definition of the name of the site.|$|E
25|$|The {{common land}} {{includes}} both SSSI/LNR sites and also extends over a larger region, including three additional areas contiguous {{with the larger}} SSSI/LNR site: north of Sound Lane, and in the triangles formed by Sound Lane, Wrenbury Heath Road and Heath View, and Wrenbury Heath Road, the Red Lion <b>Farm</b> <b>track</b> and an unnamed north–south track. It is open access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
25|$|The first Ordnance Survey map of 1860 shows a <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> {{crossing}} the viaduct {{as part of}} a byway from West Gatehead farm to Cockhill farm and the Craig estate. The new wooden viaduct of 1846 carries the railway. The new bridge required embankments to give sufficient height over the river, whereas the first viaduct was sprung from higher river embankments. On the Troon side the site of the old track has been obliterated by Fairlie Colliery (Pit No.3) and its spoil heaps.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the quality}} of roads {{improved}} there was little demand for faster vehicles and engines were geared accordingly to cope with their use on rough roads and <b>farm</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Transporting {{materials}} and supplies to the RNAS Training Establishment along <b>farm</b> <b>tracks</b> was always difficult; a railway running parallel to Ermine Street from Ancaster was initially proposed, but severe gradients were found when surveying the route.|$|R
50|$|The station {{became known}} locally as Ilkeston Junction, and when first opened had no road leading from it to either Cossall or Ilkeston. Passengers would use <b>farm</b> <b>tracks</b> and the canal towpath to reach its {{isolated}} location.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, one of {{the last}} {{photographs}} ever taken of Mannock was discovered in Northern France. The photograph was found in an old album belonging to a French farmer whose land had been used by the Royal Air Force during the summer of 1918. The photograph shows Mannock in RAF uniform. He is standing on a <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> holding a walking stick and gloves with his right hand. His left hand rests on the shoulder of a dark-haired young French girl.|$|E
25|$|As the V corps {{moved forward}} slowly, Warren became {{concerned}} {{about the safety of}} his left flank. He directed Crawford's division to move south along a <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> to Old Church Road, where they erected simple breastworks. Crawford sent forward the brigade of Col. Martin Davis Hardin, men of the Pennsylvania Reserves whose enlistments were due to expire that day. Rodes's men marched directly into Hardin's brigade at about noon and routed them. Crawford's entire division formation collapsed, exposing the V Corps' left flank. Unfortunately for the Confederates, Rodes lost control of his men, who ran beyond their objectives and descended into confusion. Warren began shifting his corps to face south toward Early.|$|E

He directed Crawford's division to move south along a <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> to Old Church Road, where they erected simple breastworks. Crawford sent forward the brigade of Col. Martin Davis Hardin, men of the Pennsylvania Reserves whose enlistments were due to expire that same day; one of his regiments, the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves, was already eligible for discharge. To their right were two large but inexperienced regiments under Col. J. Howard Kitching. Rodes's men marched directly into Hardin's brigade at about noon and routed them. The retreat to behind Beaver Dam Creek was contagious and Crawford's entire division formation collapsed, exposing the V Corps' left flank.|$|E
30|$|Construction {{debris from}} {{buildings}} can be contaminated with PCBs and is partly used for landscaping. Such debris {{was also used}} on farm land (e.g., for <b>farm</b> <b>tracks),</b> scattered and incorporated into soil of pasture area, contaminating the cattle [17].|$|R

2500|$|A public {{footpath}} between Gains Lane and Cadman's Lane {{crosses the}} route, {{and this will}} be partially re-routed along the towpath. A <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> then crosses a culvert, both of which will be altered to allow the culvert to pass under the canal without using an inverted syphon. A public footpath called Cadman's Lane will be diverted to cross the canal at the next lock. Three locks follow, called Dark Lane, Pylon and Cadman's. Pylon Lock is so named because it is located close to a large electricity pylon. At Cadman's Lock a <b>farm</b> <b>track</b> will be routed over the tail of the lock, and an adjacent ditch will be routed under the canal at the top end of the lock, to maintain the water levels. The canal then crosses Cadman's Lane again, which will be diverted for some distance along the towpath, mitigating the problems caused {{by the fact that the}} lane is often flooded by the Wash Brook, and becomes impassable. Wash Brook Lock will include a bridge over its tail to allow Cadman's Lane to rejoin its original route. Beyond the lock, the canal will be built on an embankment, some [...] high in places.|$|E

50|$|The Great Central Railway (Nottingham) {{have stated}} their {{intention}} to develop the site {{along the lines of}} Swithland Sidings, though there is no road access to the site, there are however <b>farm</b> <b>tracks.</b> The original Signal Box diagrams survive in Loughborough Central Museum.|$|R
50|$|This ephemeral {{community}} is widely {{distributed throughout the}} lowlands of Britain. Characteristic habitats are on <b>farm</b> <b>tracks,</b> around gateways where trampling is only moderate, and on verges alongside roads, wherever disturbance and spray-wash from vehicles prevents {{the development of a}} closed perennial sward.|$|R
2500|$|The Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of Sound Heath was {{designated}} in 1963 and occupies 4.80Ha. The Local Nature Reserve (LNR), which is named Sound Common, {{was designated}} in 1992; it is slightly smaller at 4.61Ha. Both SSSI and LNR include two distinct sites: the larger site (3.84Ha in the SSSI) lies between Wrenbury Heath Road–Sound Lane and the Red Lion <b>Farm</b> <b>track,</b> and is centred at around [...] A second smaller area (0.96Ha) lies {{northeast of the}} main site, {{to the north of}} Wrenbury Heath Road, and is centred at around [...]|$|E

The route then passes along {{the north and east}} edge of a spoil tip {{associated}} with the Wyrley No. 3 Colliery, and crosses over the Wash Brook, which will be culverted at this point. Following discussions with landowners, the canal will be located in a [...] deep cutting to cross fields. Further on, embankments have been sized so that the excavated spoil can be used, without having to remove spoil from the site. A fixed bridge will then carry an access track over the alignment, after which the canal passes under Gains Lane. This will require the road surface to be raised by about [...] to provide navigable headroom of [...] below the bridge structure. The canal then crosses Wash Brook, which will be regraded for about , to ensure a suitably-sized culvert can be constructed. Atkins have identified this section as the most critical, because of the proximity of the road and the brook.|$|E
