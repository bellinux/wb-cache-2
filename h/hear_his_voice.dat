500|$|Writing in Rolling Stone, Jon Landau {{compared}} the less-polished performance of [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] with the studio version's [...] "perfect production" [...] and concluded: [...] "it is exhilarating to <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> clearly singing the {{song for the}} first time, likewise the excellent guitar." [...] In his album review for Melody Maker, Williams wrote of Harrison's opening trio of songs: [...] "Unbelievably, they're {{as good as the}} originals, and in some ways even better, because they combine the power of the arrangements for horns and rhythm with a sense of joy that comes only in live performance. The two drummers (Ringo and Jim Keltner) are just breathtaking on 'Awaiting'..." [...] Planer also compliments what he calls [...] "the tag-team percussion" [...] of Starr and Keltner, which [...] "driv through the heart of the performance".|$|E

500|$|Sheen came to {{international}} attention in 2006 for {{his portrayal of}} Tony Blair in The Queen. The film focused on the differing reactions of the British Royal Family and the newly appointed Prime Minister {{following the death of}} Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997; it was Sheen's third collaboration with director Stephen Frears and his second with screenwriter Peter Morgan. He enjoyed reprising his role because Blair, at this point in his career, had [...] "a weight to him that he didn't have before". When asked to discuss his personal opinion of Blair, Sheen admitted that the more time he spent working on the character, the [...] "less opinion" [...] he has of the politician: [...] "Now when I watch him on TV or <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> it's sort of like a cross between a family member, a friend and seeing a really old embarrassing video of yourself." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised [...] "a sensational performance, alert and nuanced" [...] while Empire spoke of an [...] "uncanny, insightful performance". Sheen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His second film appearance of 2006 was a supporting role in Blood Diamond as an unscrupulous diamond dealer. Also in 2006, Sheen starred as the troubled English comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four's [...] In preparation for the role, he lost two and a half stone (approx. 35lbs), studied archival footage and read Williams' published diaries. Sheen has said he is [...] "fascinated by finding the private side of the public face". The Times found his performance [...] "mesmerising" [...] while The Observer described it as [...] "a characterisation for which the description tour-de-force is, frankly, pretty faint praise". He won a RTS Award for Best Actor, and received his second BAFTA nomination of 2006, for Best Television Actor. Sheen starred in two other BBC television productions in 2006, playing H. G. Wells in [...] and Nero in [...]|$|E
2500|$|In the Bible, Jesus {{spoke to}} the Jews in Jerusalem of [...] "other sheep" [...] who would <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> The Book of Mormon claims {{this meant that the}} Nephites and other {{remnants}} of the lost tribes of Israel throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his resurrection.|$|E
2500|$|The {{early part}} of his {{confinement}} is marked by indecent letters to Sophie (first published in 1793), and the obscene Erotica biblion and Ma conversion In Vincennes, he met the Marquis de Sade, who was also writing erotic works; however the two disliked each other intensely. It was in these writings, however, that Mirabeau developed experience as an orator. He learned how to curb his natural eloquence and his dialectic became firm, commanding and moving. [...] The prison {{in which he was}} held was the first platform to <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> Later during his confinement, he wrote Des Lettres de Cachet et des prisons d'état, published after his liberation (1782). It exhibits an accurate knowledge of French constitutional history, skillfully marshaled to demonstrate that the system of lettres de cachet was not only philosophically unjust but constitutionally illegal. It shows, though in a rather diffuse and declamatory form, wide historical knowledge, keen philosophical perception, and genuine eloquence, applied to a practical purpose, which was the great characteristic of Mirabeau, both as a political thinker and as a statesman.|$|E

2500|$|A {{resulting}} {{conclusion of}} noting similarities {{of the two}} events, including {{the description of the}} event within Psalms 105 and 106, such as, [...] "In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test," [...] the reason for Jesus' temptation was that the Lamb of God was taking on the sins of the forefathers of Israel who had rebelled against him when he led them with his Holy Spirit through the desert, and, as John the Baptist did in the desert around the same time to prepare the way for him, show everyone the path of righteousness so we all would repent and understand. He did all of this so that the [...] "lost sheep of Israel" [...] and later, all people, would believe in him and know him, the good Shepherd who saves from condemnation and death by laying down his life for his sheep, those who come to him to learn from him, who <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and know him, that they would have eternal life in him and be able to call on the Name of the Lord and have the Lord be their Righteousness and Salvation, Immanuel forever.|$|E
2500|$|The classic Bible passage cited {{to prove}} a limited extent to the atonement is [...] in which Jesus uses {{shepherding}} practices {{as a metaphor for}} his relationship to his followers. A shepherd of those times would call his sheep from a mix of flocks, and his sheep would <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and follow, while the sheep of other flocks would ignore any but their own shepherd's voice.. In that context, Jesus says, [...] "I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, ...and I lay down my life for the sheep," [...] and he tells the Pharisees that they [...] "do not believe because [...] are not part of [...] flock." [...] He continues, [...] "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand." [...] Since Calvinists (and many other Christians) believe that not all have eternal life with God, Calvinists conclude that there are only two possibilities: either Jesus was wrong in saying that he would lose none of his sheep (a conclusion they reject), or Jesus must not have laid down his life for everyone, as they understand [...] to imply. Formally, the Calvinist position can be expressed this way: ...|$|E
