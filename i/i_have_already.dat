Goods for blood– blood for goods. You can take them from any country you like, wherever you can find them– Hungary, Poland, the Ostmark, from Theresienstadt, from Auschwitz, wherever you like.|$|E
5|$|Let {{it not be}} concluded, that I wish {{to invert}} the order of things; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> granted, that, from the {{constitution}} of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> cabled you, I granted {{leave to}} Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

500|$|Concurrently {{with his}} work at The Spectator, Levin was the drama critic of The Daily Express from 1959, {{offending}} many in theatrical circles by his outspoken verdicts. He modelled his reviewing style on that of Bernard Shaw's musical reviews of the late 19th century. He gave a fellow-critic an edition of Shaw's collected criticism, writing inside the cover, [...] "'In the hope that when you come across the phrases <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> stolen you will keep quiet about it".|$|E
500|$|At Beauregard's request, {{his allies}} in the Confederate Congress petitioned Davis to restore his command in the West. Davis {{remained}} angry at Beauregard's absence {{and told him he}} should have stayed at his post even if he had to be carried around in a litter. He wrote, [...] "If the whole world were to ask me to restore General Beauregard to the command which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> given to General Bragg, I would refuse it." [...] Beauregard was ordered to Charleston and took command of coastal defenses in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, replacing Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton. The latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure was}} Leopold's inability, despite his persistence, {{to secure a}} prestigious {{appointment}} either for himself or for Wolfgang. Leopold was evidently unaware of the negative light {{in which he was}} generally viewed; he did, however, perceive that there was some intangible barrier to his Italian ambitions, and eventually recognised that he could not overcome whatever forces were arrayed against him. In any event, Wolfgang's Italian triumphs proved short-lived; despite the critical and popular successes of his Milan operas, he was not invited to write another, and there were no further commissions from any of the other centres he had visited. With all hopes of an Italian court appointment gone, Leopold sought to secure the family's future by other means: [...] "We shall not go under, for God shall help us. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> thought out some plans." ...|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
500|$|While Wollstonecraft does {{call for}} {{equality}} {{between the sexes}} in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state {{that men and women}} are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: [...] "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God." [...] Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her.|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} day <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{arranged}} {{to drive to the}} farm, being resolved not to disappoint Eunice. But I shrank from the prospect of having to distress her as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> distressed Miss Jillgall. The only alternative left was to repeat the sad story in writing, subject to the concealments which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> observed. This <b>I</b> did, and sent the letter by messenger, overnight, so that Eunice might know when to expect me.|$|R

2500|$|In event finals, Ponor placed fourth on beam (15.066) {{and second}} on floor (15.200). On beam, {{she had the}} same score as American Aly Raisman, but after a tie-breaking procedure, Raisman was awarded the bronze medal. Ponor said, [...] "I will say it again, and I want {{everyone}} to know, I will quit without regrets. I have worked every second for my team, I have worked every second for myself, I have worked every second for everybody. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> been an Olympic champion.

2500|$|... "The {{temple of}} Aphrodite was so rich that it {{employed}} {{more than a}} thousand hetairas, whom both men and women had given to the goddess. Many people visited the town on account of them, and thus these hetairas contributed to the riches of the town: for the ship captains frivolously spent their money there, hence the saying: 'The voyage to Corinth is not for every man'. (The story goes of a hetaira being reproached by a woman for not loving her job and not touching wool, and answering her: 'However you may behold me, yet in this short time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> taken down three pieces'.)" ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 7, Huckabee sent an {{open letter}} to Fred Thompson {{inviting}} him to participate in a Lincoln-Douglas style debate.

[...] "I agree that what is needed is a real discussion by the candidates about their vision for the future of our country." [...] He suggested that the first debate be held in New Hampshire.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese {{additionally}} {{differs from}} English {{in that it}} forms another kind of sentence by stating a topic and following it by a comment. To do this in English, speakers generally flag the topic of a sentence by prefacing it with [...] "as for." [...] For instance, one might say, [...] "As for the money that Mom gave us, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> bought candy with it." [...] Note that the comment {{in this case is}} itself a complete sentence with subject, verb, and object. The Chinese version is simply, 妈妈给我们的钱,我已经买了糖果。'Māma gěi wǒmen de qián, wǒ yǐjīng mǎile tángguǒ(r). This might be directly translated as [...] "The money Mom gave us, I already bought candy," [...] lacking a preface as in English.|$|E
2500|$|Erasmus {{had been}} working for years on two projects: a {{collation}} of Greek texts and a fresh Latin New Testament. In 1512, he began his work on a fresh Latin New Testament. He collected all the Vulgate manuscripts he could find to create a critical edition. Then he polished the Latin. He declared, [...] "It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin." [...] In the earlier phases of the project, he never mentioned a Greek text: [...] "My mind is so excited at the thought of emending Jerome’s text, with notes, that I seem to myself inspired by some god. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> almost finished emending him by collating a large number of ancient manuscripts, and this I am doing at enormous personal expense." ...|$|E
