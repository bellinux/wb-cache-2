5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} 14 Devastators from VT-6 {{from the}} carrier , led by Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's aircraft tried to sandwich Kaga, but the CAP, reinforced by an additional eight Zeros launched by Akagi at 09:33 and 09:40, shot down all but {{four of the}} Devastators, and Kaga <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> torpedoes. Defensive fire from the Devastators shot down one of Akagis Zeros.|$|E
5|$|The third {{encounter}} {{was between}} A.J. Styles and Hiroshi Tanahashi, which lasted 11 minutes and 3 seconds. During the bout, Shannon Moore interfered {{trying to hit}} Styles with Styles' Mr. TNA plague. Styles <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> assault, causing Tanahashi to take the blow. Styles followed up by slamming Tanahashi face-first into the mat with his signature Styles Clash maneuver and pinned him to win the bout.|$|E
5|$|After being {{questioned}} sharply, Đính quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International {{asked him to}} name the country that he was referring to, but Đính <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> question. Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero {{should be able to}} identify the national enemy, and asked him to call Madame Nhu, the de facto First Lady known for her anti-American comments, to get help in identifying the hostile country in question. After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments, Đính stormed out of the conference.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dodge</b> Lancer is an {{automobile}} {{which was built}} by Dodge. Initially introduced as a hardtop version of <b>the</b> full-sized 1955 <b>Dodge,</b> <b>the</b> original version was produced until 1959. In 1961, <b>Dodge</b> revived <b>the</b> Lancer nameplate on the compact Chrysler A platform, but this only remained in production for two model years before it was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>Dodge</b> Dart. For 1985, <b>Dodge</b> used <b>the</b> Lancer nameplate on a car based on the mid-sized Chrysler H platform, and this model remained in production until it was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>Dodge</b> Spirit in 1989.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dodge</b> Charger (LX) is a {{rear-wheel drive}} four-door {{automobile}} introduced in February 2005.

5|$|Breckinridge <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> issue {{during the}} campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, {{he had to come}} down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 June, two Argentine Dagger {{aircraft}} attacked Cardiffs Lynx helicopter, no.335 of 829NAS, while it was searching in the Falkland Sound area. Poor weather had forced the Argentine craft to abandon their original mission of bombing Mount Longdon, and the third Dagger of their formation had suffered a mechanical failure and returned to base. The Lynx began evasive manoeuvres and <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> attacks; the pilot, Lieutenant Christopher Clayton, was mentioned in despatches for his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, 14 Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6) from Enterprise, led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's {{aircraft}} {{tried to}} sandwich Kaga, but the CAP, reinforced by 4 additional Zeros launched by Hiryū at 09:37, shot down all but 4 of the Devastators, and Kaga <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> torpedoes. Hiryū launched another trio of CAP Zeros at 10:13 after Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3) from Yorktown was spotted. Two of her Zeros {{were shot down}} by Wildcats escorting VT-3 and another was forced to ditch.|$|E

5|$|Bobby Roode faced Jeff Hardy in {{the sixth}} encounter. Roode's fellow Team Canada member Petey Williams {{interfered}} in the contest distracting the referee, allowing Roode to attempt to hit Hardy with the a hockey stick. Hardy <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> swing and countered with his signature Twist of Fate maneuver, forcing Roode's chin into his shoulder. Afterwards, Hardy jumped {{off the top of}} a padded turnbuckle onto both Williams and Roode at ringside. Later, Roode re-entered the ring with Hardy remaining at ringside, allowing Jeff Jarrett to attack Hardy from behind with a hockey stick. Jarrett then pushed Hardy into the ring with Roode covering for the pinfall victory at 9 minutes and 7 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{planners}} {{believed that}} Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) {{would be the}} most fruitful of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. intelligence analysts claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese trucks were destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. 0–1 observation aircraft, flying near the Mu Gia Pass, <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from Laotian soil. This event, and others like it, were compounded by the crossing into Laotian airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 Guideline)s and another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.|$|E
5|$|The first main {{match was}} for the WWE Championship, in which {{champion}} Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita. In {{the beginning of the}} match, Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring. Van Dam, however, managed to execute a crossbody on Edge inside the ring, resulting in the two landing {{on the outside of the}} ring floor. Both men took the upper hand in the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title. Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title, but Van Dam <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> hit as he performed a spinning kick on the title, resulting in hitting Edge's face. Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a shoulder block takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge went for the shoulder block takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting in Edge to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle on Edge, which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.|$|E
50|$|Although {{settlers}} {{first arrived}} in <b>the</b> <b>Dodge</b> area in <b>the</b> 1820s, the community was founded in 1872 by William H. Parmer, the son of Martin Parmer.

5|$|The first {{match of}} the event saw The Bad Guys, which {{consisted}} of Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, the Davey Boy Smith, and The Headshrinkers (Sione and Fatu) versus The Teamsters, composed of Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, and Jim Neidhart. The opening minutes of the match featured brothers-in-law Hart and Smith trading moves as well as Jarrett and Ramon brawling. Fatu became the first wrestler eliminated after Diesel performed a Jackknife powerbomb on him. Diesel eliminated the 1-2-3 Kid forty-two seconds later after another Jackknife powerbomb. Sione followed thirty-one seconds later after being pinned by Diesel. Davey Boy Smith entered the ring, but Diesel soon knocked him between the ropes to the arena floor. Hart and Neidhart prevented Smith from getting back in the ring, and Smith was eliminated after the referee counted him out. Razor Ramon was left as {{the only member of}} his team to face the five members of The Teamsters. He fought with Diesel for several minutes, but Diesel then performed the Jackknife powerbomb on him and prepared to pin him for the victory. Michaels insisted on having Diesel hold Ramon while Michaels performed a superkick on their opponent. Ramon <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> kick, and Michaels kicked Diesel in the face. Diesel became angry at Michaels, particularly because the same mistake had cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam. He and Michaels argued outside the ring {{while the rest of the}} team attempted to calm them down. The referee counted all five wrestlers out of the ring and declared Razor Ramon the winner of the match. Shawn Michaels was shown backstage after the match, and he stated that he was disbanding his tag team with Diesel and vacating the Tag Team Championship. He then got into a car and drove away from the arena.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{he fell in}} {{love with}} Nora and became {{dedicated}} to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Tansley {{and others}} {{referred}} to {{the high point of}} the range as Mt. Jefferson, at 10,600ft. The northern peak was labeled Mt. Jefferson on the Gallatin National Forest map of 1937, with an erroneous (but long-perpetuated) elevation of 10,740’ given. The southern peak was called Hollow Top Mountain, at 10,513’. The next year, 1938, the Deerlodge National Forest map <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> issue: the northern peak received two designations — Hollowtop Mtn. and Mt. Jefferson. The southern peak was labeled with the JEFFERSON control station only.|$|E

25|$|Pukanić, an {{influential}} and controversial person in Croatian politics, was already targeted {{in a murder}} attempt on April 9, 2008 in western downtown Zagreb, near Franjo Tuđman Square. He was shot at with a silenced pistol at close range. Pukanić crouched as the perpetrator pointed his gun at him and successfully <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> bullet, which created {{a hole in the}} window of a nearby gift shop. The perpetrator's gun subsequently jammed, enabling Pukanić to pull his legally-owned Glock 17 out of his bag. Pukanić fired a warning shot, causing the perpetrator to flee the crime scene. A facial composite of the perpetrator, who was unmasked and wore a dark knitted cap, was publicly released five days after the attack.|$|E
25|$|After {{contemplating the}} hijack {{of a ship}} to run the {{gauntlet}} of Bolshevik-operated coastal craft, Dunsterville decided not to risk alienating local opinion and turned back, intending to meet the party en route from Europe and make arrangements in Iran, while waiting for another chance to reach Tiflis. On 20 February, the party <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> local authorities and returned to Hamadan, where it could use MEF and Russian army wireless stations, {{to keep in touch}} with Baghdad. It had become clear that there was little chance that the Russians formerly under Baratov could be induced to remain on service and that only Bicherakov and some of his Cossacks were willing to continue. On 11 February, Bicherakov flew to Baghdad and told Marshall that the Cossacks were willing to act as rearguard for the Russians before leaving and that the Tiflis initiative was doomed to failure. Marshall wanted an advance on Mosul to protect the Persian road but was over-ruled, in preference for operations in Palestine and at Hamadan, Dunsterville claimed that the Iranian public welcomed British protection and requested that he might wait at Hamadan to try again.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, The Giant began a {{feud with}} nWo member Nash, who {{constantly}} <b>dodged</b> <b>the</b> Giant, including no-showing their scheduled match at Starrcade. In 1998, at Souled Out, the two finally {{met in the}} ring, with Nash accidentally injuring The Giant's neck when he botched his signature jackknife powerbomb finisher. Nash couldn't lift The Giant high enough to execute the move properly and ended up dropping him onto his head. The announcers were noticeably stunned, as were Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, who were standing ringside to support Nash and {{had a hard time}} staying in character. The botch was worked into a storyline, according to which Nash had intentionally dropped the Giant on his head in order to break his neck. When Nash left the nWo and formed his own stable, the nWo Wolfpac, The Giant rejoined the original nWo to oppose Nash and his allies. While back with the nWo, The Giant won two more Tag Team Championships, once with Sting as an unwilling partner (as the match was signed before The Giant returned to the nWo) and once with Scott Hall. In the interim between those two reigns, he lost his half of the titles to Sting in a singles match where only the winner would remain champion and could choose a new partner.|$|E
