While living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, he ventured to the pedestrian walkway of the Williamsburg Bridge to practice, {{in order to avoid}} disturbing a neighboring expectant mother. [...] Almost every day from the summer of 1959 through the end of 1961, Rollins practiced on the bridge, next to the subway tracks. [...] In the summer of 1961, the journalist Ralph Berton happened to pass by the saxophonist on the bridge one day and published an article in Metronome magazine about the occurrence. [...] During this period, Rollins became a dedicated practitioner of yoga. [...] Rollins ended his sabbatical in 1962. [...] He later said [...] "I could have probably spent {{the rest of my life}} just going up on the bridge. I realized, no, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the real world." [...] In 2016, a campaign was initiated that seeks to have the bridge renamed in Rollins's honor.|$|E

DepotArmy Air FieldTonopah NevadaJanuary 3, 1943 Dear Chairman, Just a {{few lines}} {{to let you know}} that I {{received}} your Christmas gift in good condition and in plenty of time for Christmas. I want to thank you and all the members of Bryant College for the gift for I appreciated them very much. You know it is nice to receive and unexpected gift, for I had thought the Service Club had lost track of me with all the moving I have been doing lately. I have been moving around California and Nevada for the past few months but I hope I am permanently settled here for a little while at least. I imagine Bryant is just about the same except for the fact that there are very few men inrolled, now that Uncle Sam is taking just about everybody. the Air Corps claims they are short of administrative men so if some lucky G. I. s were sent to school there, I know they would have a swell time. Few of us will ever forget all the good times we had there, not to mention the education itself. You know, I would like to get one of those letters you have sent me in the past with some of the boys addresses. So if you have any printed in the future, I hope you will put my name on the mailing list. Well, I am afraid I will have to sign off now, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to work now. However, before I do, again, let me thank you for the cigarettes. Sincerely,Timothy J. McCarthy[Transcription ends...|$|E

O. now and it’s crowded as hell, in fact all you see {{all over}} town are {{soldiers}} and more soldiers. I ate dinner at the Brooklyn Spaghetti House. It was pretty crumby. This afternoon we stood retreat, that’s when they lower the flag. It was very impressive {{lined up on the}} huge parade ground were about 15, 000 men. We all saluted while the flag was lowered and the band played the national anthem. Then we passed in review in front of the C. O., who, by the way, is now a Colonel, General Brady having left. There was one quite funny thing about the ceremony. The C. O. stands about 500 feet from the main group- consisting of all the wing group in camp. He gives his orders to the adjutant who in turn has to give the orders of the C. O. to the O. D. who is about 200 feet from the C. O. But in order to do this he (the adjutant) has to walk to the O. D. (officer of the day). He covers that 200 feet in record time but he can’t run. It’s very comical to see him scooting back and forth between these two men, his gate being quite similar to a man in a walking race. I got your package today hon, and thanks alot. That fruit cake will hit the spot after a good workout on the drill field. And that candy is just what I like with the chewy centers. Thanks again, angel. Mom, when you address my letters don’t put the training group number down, tent is 1176. For one thing it’s not necessary, and another thing I 2 ̆ 7 m in 1177 now. Jim Koenigar is shipping out Sunday, boy is he lucky. I’m learning {{a hell of a lot}} down here. Yesterday I field stripped a carbine. An automatic rifle that fires 15 shots as fast as you can pull the trigger. It’s a sweet piece. (Rifles aren’t called that here, they’re pieces). Next week we’ll start using the Thompson Submachine Gun! I got a seven page letter from Judy today, also one from Charlie, and a card from Ace. I thrilled to hear that you rented the apartment, sweetheart, and I think is a good price. If I’m still here when you go to Texas try ad work it so you can stop by and see me on the way. It’s starting get damned cold down here. We had frost this morning, and along with the cold we had to go over the obstacle course right after breakfast. This course is really terrific. It starts off with a 3 foot handle, then a 3 foot hurdle, an 8 foot wall, followed by a ladder, horizontal to the ground which we have to hang on to and reach from rung to rung. Then there is a 2 foot hurdle, a 20 foot ladder we have to climb up and over and down the other side. The next thing we meet is a 5 foot wall then a bunch of logs we have to walk over, succeeded by a log over a stream that we have to cross hand over hand. This we call Guadalcanal. Quite a few fellows fall in the drink. Then finally we come upon a low tunnel we have to crawl through. One fellow went over this course in 2 min and 14 seconds. That’s really goin’ some. My xo!x?o watch broke today so I’ll have to have it fixed, for a change. That’s all I do to that hairy thing, break it and have it fixed. Did I tell you I got a letter from Nan? Thank her for me. Well <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to camp beautiful so take care of yourself and tell Bobby to get rid of that cold. I feel very flattered that she should cry over my letter. I really love those two daughters of yours, you don’t realize it until you’re far away from them. I love you too, darling. More than you or anyone can ever know. Good night sweet heart.
