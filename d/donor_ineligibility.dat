40|$|The {{demand for}} {{unrelated}} haematopoietic cell (HPC) donors has risen threefold {{over the last}} decade, {{and is likely to}} continue to rise over the next 10 years. The time taken from diagnosis to transplant is recognised to adversely affect patient outcome, and provision of unrelated donors (UDs) has been identified as a key source of delay. Obstacles to provision of UD include: delays in referral to a transplant centre, awaiting sibling typing, lack of matched donors (particularly for those from ethnic minorities and/or with rare HLA phenotypes), low- or intermediate-resolution donor HLA typing, donor attrition from the registries, <b>donor</b> <b>ineligibility</b> on grounds of health and difficulties encountered transporting HPC across international borders. There are now over 18 million volunteer donors in registries worldwide, and efficiency has improved, at least in part, because of a switch from paper to electronic searches. As a result, the average time from search request to transplant is estimated to be less than half of what it was two decades ago. Furthermore, registries have developed a number of strategies designed to minimise delays and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes. These include: optimisation of donor numbers and ethnic mix through focused and selective recruitment; high-resolution typing at donor recruitment; cord blood banking with aggressive recruitment in ethnic minorities; early identification of those unlikely to find a match so alternative transplant options may be pursued in a timely manner, through use of HLA-based predictive algorithms; reduction of donor attrition; centralised, registry-based, donor identification services; and provision of a back-up donor...|$|E
40|$|Heart {{transplant}} {{is often}} {{considered the best}} treatment for prolonged left ventricular failure. However due to limited <b>donor</b> hearts and <b>ineligibility</b> of some patients to get a transplant, heart assist devices are considered a short/long term option to assist the failing ventricle. Numerous in vitro and animal trials are conducted to study the flow fields in artificial ventricles to avoid hemolysis and thrombosis but the effects of flow fields corresponding to the angle of LVAD insertion into the aorta are often neglected. This experiment uses 30, 60 and 90 degree glass models to signify different angles of the surgical end to side anastomosis. Particle Image Velocimetry is used to study the flow fields at the interface and determine optimum angle amongst the three to avoid blood trauma. Use of a 30 degree glass interface minimizes stagnation zone, recirculation patterns, flow reversal, high shear region and other flow irregularities which may lead to reduced hemolysis, thrombosis and blood trauma in a clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|A triagem sorológica de doadores de sangue com baixos índices de prevalência de infecção, como no caso da hepatite C (HCV), gera um percentual considerável de resultados falso-positivos e descarte de bolsas de hemocomponentes freqüentemente não infectados. O objetivo deste estudo foi pesquisar o perfil sorológico e, com base no teste confirmatório, a ocorrência de hepatite C nos doadores com sorologia positiva ou indeterminada do Hemocentro Regional de Uberaba (HRU). Os testes confirmatórios foram realizados por meio da detecção do RNA do HCV no plasma, utilizando-se o método RT-PCR qualitativa. Foram realizadas, no período de 1992 a 2005, 171. 027 doações de sangue no HRU, sendo 24, 3 % de doadores iniciais e 75, 7 % de retorno. O índice de inaptidão para HCV foi de 0, 3 % (561 doações), sendo que 53, 0 % destas eram de doadores iniciais e 47, 0 % de retorno, com prevalências de 0, 5 % e 0, 2 %, respectivamente (p Serological {{screening}} of blood donors with low indexes of infection, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), {{accounts for a}} substantial percentage of false-positive results with consequent loss of non-infected blood components. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the occurrence of hepatitis C using confirmatory tests for blood donors with positive or inconclusive results at Hemocentro Regional de Uberaba (HRU). Confirmatory tests were performed by the detection of HCV RNA in plasma using qualitative RT-PCR. The study was carried out from 1992 to 2005 for 171, 027 blood donors, 24. 3 % first-time and 75. 7 % repeat <b>donors.</b> The <b>ineligibility</b> rate to HCV was 0. 3 % (561 donors) with 52. 9 % of them being first-time donors and 47. 0 % repeat donors with prevalences of 0. 5 % and 0. 2 % respectively (p< 0. 0001). The rate of inconclusive results was significantly higher among repeat donors (p= 0. 0214). Ninety-eight samples were subjected to qualitative PCR and only 34. 7 % (34) had positive results, with a significantly lower rate of positiveness for repeat donors (p = 0. 0184) and almost a threefold lower rate of inconclusive results for the same donors. These results showed that, for a large number of donors with positive and inconclusive tests for anti-HCV, the infection was not confirmed. We concluded that serological ineligibility for hepatitis C of donors at HRU was not always associated with the presence of viral infection...|$|R
