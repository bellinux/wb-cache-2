40|$|We {{need to make}} a {{correction}} to our earlier work [1], namely a critical error in the relative sign between the lowest-dimensional term and the leading nonperturbative contribution. By correcting the sign error and evaluating an additional contribution which we omitted earlier, we conclude that our new prediction on the weak pion-nucleon coupling fπNN is in the vincinity of 3 × 10 − 7, and is stable. The main idea of our approach is that both the strong and parity-violating pionnucleon couplings, gπNN and fπNN, respectively, are given by the lowest <b>dimensional</b> <b>diagram</b> and by a pion vacuum susceptibility, χπ. Therefore, by using the known value of gπNN one can determine χπ and thereby predict the value of fπNN. Using definitions for the susceptibilities given in Ref.

The Hindu temple is a three <b>dimensional</b> <b>diagram</b> of the subtle levels of existence, which takes us from the mundane world to the divinity embodied in a particular image or icon in the sanctum. It is a metaphor for the journey of the worshipper from this manifest world to the divinity within; a point of stillness beyond space and time, and beyond place. The place itself may be the physical locus for a particular aspect of the Absolute, but the realisation of that Absolute within oneself, is the ultimate aim of the temple.

40|$|AbstractGraham and Lehrer {{have defined}} {{cellular}} algebras {{and developed a}} theory that allows in particular to classify simple representations of finite dimensional cellular algebras. Many classes of finite dimensional algebras, including various Hecke algebras and diagram algebras, {{have been shown to}} be cellular, and the theory due to Graham and Lehrer successfully has been applied to these algebras. We will extend the framework of cellular algebras to algebras that need not be finite dimensional over a field. Affine Hecke algebras of type A and infinite <b>dimensional</b> <b>diagram</b> algebras like the affine Temperley–Lieb algebras are shown to be examples of our definition. The isomorphism classes of simple representations of affine cellular algebras are shown to be parameterised by the complement of finitely many subvarieties in a finite disjoint union of affine varieties. In this way, representation theory of non-commutative algebras is linked with commutative algebra. Moreover, conditions on the cell chain are identified that force the algebra to have finite global cohomological dimension and its derived category to admit a stratification; these conditions are shown to be satisfied for the affine Hecke algebra of type A if the quantum parameter is not a root of the Poincaré polynomial...|$|E

Montmorillonite stability and/or formation vs that of kaolinite for the soil clays was evaluated by a plot of the solute activity functions on a three <b>dimensional</b> <b>diagram</b> derived for montmorillonite, kaolinite, and gibbsite at constant temperature (25 ~ and constant pressure (one atm.). Although all the soil clays contained both montmorillonite and kaolinite, the position of the soil clay solute activity functions in the stability diagram clearly reflected the {{influence of}} the geomor-phological-geochemical site conditions in which each soil horizon was developed, with corresponding differences in the SIO 2 /A 1203 molar ratio of the reactive fraction.

30|$|These four {{identities and}} {{diagrams}} relate {{to one another}} in a single relationship that can be represented in three-dimensional space. In the “Diagram of the hexad identity” section we render a diagram of the demographic time identity. We argue that the full three <b>dimensional</b> <b>diagram</b> is not necesarily a practical way to represent demographic data, but that it forms a useful reference to understand demographic structure. Practically, data structured by all six demographic time measures can be represented on any of the four diagrams if controlled properly. In the “Application” section we present a brief application of this technique to the prevalence of poor self-reported health in older ages in the USA. We show that the choice of age pattern when calculating prevalence-based measures of healthy life expectancy can have a large impact on healthy life expectancy. The size of the effect varies depending on the morbidity pattern, and on how fast mortality and morbidity are both changing. However, the experience of old-age mortality improvement in recent decades leads us to suspect that many projections of old-age morbidity burden are likely to be needlessly pessimistic if it is the case that the prevalence of pertinent health conditions varies primarily as a function of time to death. This clearly merits further study in the case of human population health, and we speculate that findings of similar import may arise if this framework is used to visualize data and inform new methods in other unrelated areas of investigation.|$|E
40|$|The more {{rigorous}} approach {{on the behavior}} of unsaturated soils using two independent stress state variables is increas_ingly gaining acceptance. The proposed shear strength equation based on this approach (i. e., Ï„ = c' + (ua - u w tan Ï† b + (Ïƒ - ua) tan Ï†'), requires that the stress circle corresponding to the failure conditions be plotted on a three <b>dimensional</b> <b>diagram.</b> In this diagram, the axes in the horizontal plane are the stress state variables,(Ïƒ - ua) and (ua - uw), and the ordinate axis is the shear strength, Ï„. The failure conditions define a surface. If one stress variable is maintained constant, say the variable (Ïƒ - ua), then the relationship between Ï„ and (u a - uw can be portrayed on a two dimensional plot. The resulting envelope in this plane of Ï„ versus (ua - uw will be called the suction envelope. The validity of the form of the proposed shear strength equation has been verified by results from laboratory testing of unsaturated soils where the stress state variables at failure are known. So far, these results indicated that the failure surface is planar, i. e, the suction envelope is linear. Results also showed that the friction angle,Ï† b, associated with the suction envelope is always smaller than the angle of shearing resistance, Ï†'. A completely constant Ï†b (i. e., a linear suction envelope), however, is found to be inconsistent with pieces of experimental evidence obtained from tests on saturated soils under suction. The linear suction envelope also frequently results in an abrupt break in the failure surface when crossing from positive pore-water pressure over to negative pore-water pressure. The result is {{that there is not a}} smooth transition from soil with positive pore-water pressure to soil with negative pore-water pressure. A theoretical investigation of unsaturated soils from a phenomenological standpoint predicts a curved suction envelope comprising of two linear sections connected by a transition curve. The angle of the slope of the initial linear section is equal to Ã˜' while the angle of the slope of the latter linear section, Ã˜ b, is smaller than Ã˜'. An experimental program of multistage direct shear tests on a Saskatchewan till was conducted. Theses tests were carried out over a suction range of 0 kPA to 500 kPa. Results confirmed that the suction envelope is nonlinear and that the slope of this envelope varies from Ã˜b = Ã˜ = 25. 5 degrees, to Ã˜b = 7 degrees constant. For the investigation in this thesis, a direct shear box was modified, utilizing the axis translation technique, to render the equipment suitable for unsaturated soil testing. There are two reasons for wanting a direct shear apparatus capable of testing unsaturated soils. First, unsaturated soil testing using the triaxial apparatus is complicated and takes a long time. Second, larger strain is possible in the direct shear which makes is more suitable for multistage testing. Multistage testing is desirable to reduce the number of variables involved...|$|E

By swinging the dissected value, the change in phase relations can be examined as a function of given chemical potential.

In this model one organizes political views not as usually around the concept of freedom (personal and economic), but around the concept of private property. Therefore we are able to include in this model anarchism, which is usually ignored, as a non-political view...|$|R
