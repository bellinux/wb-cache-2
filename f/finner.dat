40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the hemodynamic responses to nociceptive stimuli in children submitted to videolaparoscopic appendectomy under balanced anesthesia with isoflurane and dexmedetomidine. METHODS: Randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study involving 26 children submitted to videolaparoscopic appendectomy {{carried out at}} Hospital São Lucas (PUCRS) between May 2004 and February 2005. Patients were assigned to two groups: (a) Dexmedetomidine group (n= 13) : infusion of 1 µg/kg over 10 minutes and maintenance dose of 0. 5 µg/kg/h) as an adjuvant to inhaled isoflurane anesthesia; (b) Control group (n= 13) : normal saline infusion at a similar rate and volume of the dexmedetomidine infusion. During the different surgical and anesthetic periods, groups were compared regarding heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures as well as need of supplemental fentanyl infusion. Student's t test, ANOVA, and <b>Finner's</b> procedure were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: During the strongest nociceptive stimuli (airway access and abdominal catheter placement), the heart rate and systolic blood pressure increased significantly (p< 0. 001) {{in the control group}} compared to the dexmedetomidine group. Compared to baseline levels, the hemodynamic responses to nociceptive stimuli were more stable when dexmedetomidine was used in combination with inhaled isoflurane anesthesia. The need for supplemental doses of fentanyl and the hemodynamic parameters were similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine combined with inhaled isoflurane for anesthesia of children submitted to videolaparoscopic appendectomy, efficiently blocks the hemodynamic responses to nociceptive stimuli. When compared to placebo, the use of dexmedetomidine did not change the need for supplemental doses of fentanyl for maintenance of hemodynamic parameters during the intraoperative period...|$|R
40|$|Evaluating {{potential}} effects of {{conservation and management}} actions in marine reserves requires an understanding {{not only of the}} biological processes in the reserve, and between the reserve and the surrounding ocean, but also {{of the effects of the}} wildlife on the wider political and economic processes. Such evaluations are made considerably more difficult in the absence of good ecological data from within reserves or consistent data between reserves and the wider marine environment, as is the case in much of mainland Ecuador. We present an approach to evaluate the effects of a wide range of possible management processes on the marine ecology of the Machalilla National Park, as well as that of the surrounding marine environments (including recently established reserves) and related socio-economic pressures. The approach is based on Bayesian belief networks, and as such can be used in the presence of sparse data from multiple and disparate sources. We show that currently there are no observable benefits of marine reserves to reef and fish community structure, and that high value (normally predatory) fish, which are sought by fishers and shark <b>finners</b> are frequently absent from reef systems. We demonstrate that there is broad similarity in ecological communities between most shallow marine systems, in or out of marine reserves, and predict there can be a strong effect from actions outside the reserve on what is present within it. We also show that establishing a stronger link between (responsible) ecotourism and the marine environment could reduce the need for income in other more destructive areas, such as fishing and particularly shark finning, and discuss ways that high value, low impact eco-tourism could be introduced...|$|R

5000|$|In the Orbit of Saturn (October 1931), first {{published}} in Astounding Stories. The sixth story featuring the Interplanetary Flying Police. Set in the 22nd century, in the year 2159, in the space surrounding the outer planets. The spaceship Celestia is captured by space pirates, who use a type of cloaking device to remain invisible to other ships. Quirl <b>Finner,</b> {{a member of the}} Police, is among the captives. He spends part of the story trying hard to protect the safety of Lenore, [...] "a remarkably rich young woman". <b>Finner</b> has ambiguous feelings about the pirates themselves. They are led by Captain Strom, who is both an honorable man and an idealist dreamer. Once a would-be social reformer, Strom was framed for treason and exiled. He managed to escape and turn to crime, but crime and piracy are {{a means to an end}} for him. He still dreams of social reform and wants to acquire the means to colonize a small planet, and create his ideal society. <b>Finner</b> can sympathize with this dream. But the more wicked side of the pirates is represented by mate Gore, a brutal thug-for-hire, who treats the prisoners harshly. The story concludes with a mutiny on board and with <b>Finner</b> sabotaging the cloaking device, leaving the pirate ship an easy target for the Police. Bleiler considered this a well-written action story. In his view, the developing romance between the wealthy woman and her poor protector adds a fairy tale aspect to the story.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are also}} {{advanced}} professional ballistic models like PRODAS available. These {{are based on}} {{six degrees of freedom}} (6 DoF) calculations. 6 DoF modeling accounts for x, y, and z position in space along with the projectiles pitch, yaw, and roll rates. 6 DoF modeling needs such elaborate data input, knowledge of the employed projectiles and expensive data collection and verification methods that it is impractical for non-professional ballisticians, but not impossible for the curious, computer literate, and mathematically inclined. Semi-empirical aeroprediction models have been developed that reduced extensive test range data {{on a wide variety of}} projectile shapes, normalizing dimensional input geometries to calibers; accounting for nose length and radius, body length, and boattail size, and allowing the full set of 6-dof aerodynamic coefficients to be estimated. Early research on spin-stabilized aeroprediction software resulted in the SPINNER computer program. [...] The <b>FINNER</b> aeroprediction code calculates 6-dof inputs for fin stabilized projectiles. [...] Solids modeling software that determines the projectile parameters of mass, center of gravity, axial and transverse moments of inertia necessary for stability analysis are also readily available, and simple to computer program. [...] Finally, algorithms for 6-dof numerical integration suitable to a 4th order Runge-Kutta are readily available. All that is required for the amateur ballistician to investigate the finer analytical details of projectile trajectories, along with bullet nutation and precession behavior, is computer programming determination. Nevertheless, for the small arms enthusiast, aside from academic curiosity, one will discover that being able to predict trajectories to 6-dof accuracy is probably not of practical significance compared to more simplified point mass trajectories based on published bullet ballistic coefficients. 6 DoF is generally used by the aerospace and defense industry and military organizations that study the ballistic behavior of a limited number of (intended) military issue projectiles. Calculated 6 DoF trends can be incorporated as correction tables in more conventional ballistic software applications.|$|E
