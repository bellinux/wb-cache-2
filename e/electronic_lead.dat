40|$|We {{report an}} {{observation}} of charge conservation breaking {{in a model}} study of electronic current noise of transport through a dissipative double quantum dot within generalized master equation formalism. We study the current noise through a double quantum dot coupled to two <b>electronic</b> <b>leads</b> in the high bias limit and a dissipative heat bath in the weak coupling limit. Our calculations {{are based on the}} solution of a Markovian generalized master equation. Zero-frequency component of the current noise calculated within the system, i. e., between the two dots, via the quantum regression theorem exhibits unphysical negative values. On the other hand, current noise calculated for currents between the dots and the leads by the counting variable approach shows no anomalies and seems physically plausible. We inquire into the origin of this discrepancy between two nominally equivalent approaches and show that it stems from the simultaneous presence of the two types of baths, i. e., the <b>electronic</b> <b>leads</b> and the dissipative bosonic bath. This finding raises interesting questions concerning conceptual foundations of the theory describing multiple-baths open quantum systems widely encountered in nanoscience.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the active isolation of a system containing a distributed parameter isolator using absolute velocity feedback control. The main differences between this type of system and one with a massless isolator, is that there are isolator resonances. It is shown that the vibration at these resonance frequencies cannot be suppressed using a simple velocity feedback control strategy. Moreover, it is found that the isolator resonances can cause the control system to become unstable, if the isolated equipment is supported on a flexible base. A stability criterion based on the mode shapes of the system is presented. Two techniques to stabilise the system are investigated and compared. The first involves the addition of mass on the base structure, and the second involves an <b>electronic</b> <b>lead</b> compensator. Experimental results are presented to support the theoretical findings. It is shown that even if the instability due to the isolator resonances and flexibility of the base can be prevented, the instability due to the flexibility of the equipment remains a proble...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} electronic transport {{through a}} single-electron quantum dot that is tunnel-coupled to an <b>electronic</b> <b>lead</b> and a metallic island. A background reservoir keeps the metallic island at a thermal {{state with the}} ambient temperature, while the charge accumulated on the island is reflected in a time-dependent chemical potential. Without feedback, a current would flow through the system until the chemical potentials of island and lead are equilibrated. A feedback loop can be implemented by a quantum point contact detecting the dot state, classical processing of the result and appropriate feedback actions on the electronic tunneling rates taken, with the objective to direct the current in a preferred direction. Since we directly take the detector counting statistics into account, this automatically includes measurement errors in the description. When mainly the rates are modified but hardly any energy is exchanged with the system, this feedback loop effectively implements a Maxwell demon, capable of transporting electrons against an electric bias and thereby charging the metallic island. Once the feedback protocol is stopped, the metallic island simply discharges. We find that a quantitative detector model may be useful for a realistic statistical description of feedback loops.

40|$|Cooling nanoelectronic devices below 10 mK {{is a great}} {{challenge}} since thermal conductivities become very small, thus creating a pronounced sensitivity to heat leaks. Here, we overcome these difficulties by using adiabatic demagnetization of both the <b>electronic</b> <b>leads</b> and the large metallic islands of a Coulomb blockade thermometer. This reduces the external heat leak through the leads and also provides on-chip refrigeration, together cooling the thermometer down to 2. 8 ± 0. 1 mK. We present a thermal model which gives a good qualitative account and suggests that the main limitation is heating due to pulse tube vibrations. With better decoupling, temperatures below 1 mK should be within reach, thus opening the door for microkelvin nanoelectronics. Comment: 4 pages, 3 color figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate a}} quantum dot coupled to fermionic (<b>electronic)</b> <b>leads</b> and show how zero-point quantum fluctuations stemming from bosonic environments permit the rectification of the current. The bosonic baths are either external impedances modeled as tunable transmission lines or LC resonators (single-mode cavities). Voltage fluctuations {{stemming from the}} external impedances at zero temperature are described through harmonic oscillators (photon-like excitations) then producing the quantum vacuum fluctuations. The differing sizes of the zero-point fluctuations of the quantum vacuum break the spatial symmetry of the system if the quantum dot is coupled to two reservoirs or two junctions with different bosonic environments. We consider current rectification and power production when the system is operated as a heat engine in both non-resonant and resonant sequential tunneling cases. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
40|$|We study {{a system}} of two quantum dots, each with several {{discrete}} levels, which are coherently coupled to a microwave oscillator. They are attached to <b>electronic</b> <b>leads</b> and coupled to a phonon bath, both leading to inelastic processes. For a simpler system with a single level in each dot {{it has been shown}} that a population inversion can be created by electron tunneling, which in a resonance situation leads to lasing-type properties of the oscillator. In the multi-level system several resonance situations may arise, some of them relying on a sequence of tunneling processes which also involve non-resonant, inelastic transitions. The resulting photon number in the oscillator and the current-voltage characteristic are highly sensitive to these properties and accordingly can serve as a probe for microscopic details.

40|$|The {{influence}} of an electron-vibrational coupling on the laser control of electron transport through a molecular wire that {{is attached to}} several <b>electronic</b> <b>leads</b> is investigated. These molecular vibrational modes induce an effective electron-electron interaction. In the regime where the wire electrons couple weakly to both the external leads and the vibrational modes, we derive within a Hartree-Fock approximation a nonlinear set of quantum kinetic equations. The quantum kinetic theory is then {{used to evaluate the}} laser driven, time-averaged electron current through the wire-leads contacts. This novel formalism is applied to two archetypical situations in the presence of electron-vibrational effects, namely, (i) the generation of a ratchet or pump current in a symmetrical molecule by a harmonic mixing field and (ii) the laser switching of the current through the molecule.

40|$|In this paper, {{the exact}} {{transient}} quantum transport of non-interacting nanostructures is investigated {{in the presence}} of initial system-lead correlations and initial lead-lead correlations for a device system coupled to general <b>electronic</b> <b>leads.</b> The exact master equation incorporating with initial correlations is derived through the extended quantum Langevin equation. The effects of the initial correlations are manifested through the time-dependent fluctuations contained explicitly in the exact master equation. The transient transport current incorporating with initial correlations is obtained from the exact master equation. The resulting transient transport current can be expressed in terms of the single-particle propagating and correlation Green functions of the device system. We show that the initial correlations can affect quantum transport not only in the transient regime, but also in the steady-state limit when system-lead couplings are strong enough so that electron localized bound states occur in the device system.

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of magnetotransport through an {{electronic}} orbital, where the electron spin interacts with a (sufficiently) large external spin via an exchange interaction. Using a semiclassical approximation, we derive a set of equations of motions for the electron density matrix and the mean value of the external spin {{that turns out to}} be highly nonlinear. The dissipation via the <b>electronic</b> <b>leads</b> is implemented in terms of a quantum master equation that is combined with the nonlinear terms of the spin-spin interaction. With an anisotropic exchange coupling a variety of dynamics is generated, such as self-sustained oscillations with parametric resonances or even chaotic behavior. Within our theory we can integrate a Maxwell-demon-like closed-loop feedback scheme that is capable of transporting particles against an applied bias voltage and that can be used to implement a spin filter to generate spin-dependent oscillating currents of opposite directions.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the entanglement and the Rényi entropies of two <b>electronic</b> <b>leads</b> {{connected by a}} quantum point contact. For non-interacting electrons, the entropies {{can be related to}} the cumulants of the full counting statistics of transferred charge which in principle are measurable. We consider the entanglement entropy generated by operating the quantum point contact as a quantum switch which is opened and closed in a periodic manner. Using a numerically exact approach we analyze the conditions under which a logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy predicted by conformal field theory should be observable in an electronic conductor. In addition, we consider clean single-particle excitations on top of the Fermi sea (levitons) generated by applying designed pulses to the leads. We identify a Hong-Ou-Mandel-like suppression of the entanglement entropy by interfering two levitons on a quantum point contact tuned to half transmission.

40|$|We study {{coherent}} transport {{through a}} double quantum dot. Its two <b>electronic</b> <b>leads</b> induce <b>electronic</b> {{matter and energy}} transport and a phonon reservoir contributes further energy exchanges. By treating the system-lead couplings perturbatively, whereas the coupling to vibrations is treated non-perturbatively in a polaron-transformed frame, we derive a thermodynamic consistent low-dimensional master equation. When the number of phonon modes is finite, a Markovian description is only possible when these couple symmetrically to both quantum dots. For a continuum of phonon modes however, also asymmetric couplings can be described with a Markovian master equation. We compute the electronic current and dephasing rate. The electronic current enables transport spectroscopy of the phonon frequency and displays signatures of Franck-Condon blockade. For infinite external bias but finite tunneling bandwidths, we find oscillations in the current {{as a function of}} the internal bias due to the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we derive the full fluctuation theorem and show its identity to the entropy production in the system. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
