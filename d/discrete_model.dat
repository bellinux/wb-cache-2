25|$|A digital {{computer}} simulation model of an analog system {{such as the}} brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion. However, the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision, for example due to background noise. The errors of the <b>discrete</b> <b>model</b> can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate, and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities. The computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations, preferably in real time.|$|E

The drag forces exerted on the particles by the relative velocity by {{them and the}} flow were treated as additional forces acting on the particles. Therefore, these multiphase flow phenomena including a solid e.g.~particulate and a gaseous or fluid phase resolve the particulate phase by discrete methods, while gas or liquid flow is described by continuous methods, and therefore, is labelled the combined continuum and <b>discrete</b> <b>model</b> (CCDM) as applied by Kawaguchi et al., Hoomans, Xu 1997 and Xu 1998. [...] Due to a discrete description of the solid phase, constitutive relations are omitted, and therefore, leads {{to a better understanding}} of the fundamentals. This was also concluded by Zhu 2007 et al. and Zhu 2008 et al. during a review on particulate flows modelled with the CCDM approach. It has seen a mayor development in last two decades and describes motion of the solid phase by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) on an individual particle scale and the remaining phases are treated by the Navier-Stokes equations. Thus, the method is recognized as an effective tool to investigate into the interaction between a particulate and fluid phase as reviewed by Yu and Xu, Feng and Yu [...] and Deen et al. [...] Based on the CCDM methodology the characteristics of spouted and fluidised beds are predicted by Gryczka et al.|$|E

30|$|It is {{generally}} known {{that in the}} theory of population dynamics, {{there are two kinds of}} mathematical models: the continuous models governed by differential equations and the <b>discrete</b> <b>models</b> governed by difference equations. When the population size is small or when births and deaths all occur at <b>discrete</b> times, <b>discrete</b> <b>models</b> would be more appropriate than the continuous <b>models.</b> Meanwhile, <b>discrete</b> <b>models</b> give rise to more efficient computational models for numerical simulations and these results exhibit rich dynamics of the <b>discrete</b> <b>models</b> compared with the continuous ones. In fact, even in one-dimensional <b>discrete</b> <b>models</b> denoted by iterated quadratic maps, like the well-known logistic map, periodic and chaotic trajectories can easily be observed. Moreover, two-dimensional <b>discrete</b> <b>models</b> can reveal a plethora of complicated asymptotic behaviors, from convergence to a fixed point or a periodic cycle until a quasi-periodic orbit along a closed invariant curve or even an erratic motion inside a bounded chaotic attractor (see e.g. [1 – 5]).|$|R
