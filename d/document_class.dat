40|$|Automatic text {{classification}} is {{the process}} of automatically classifying text documents into pre-defined <b>document</b> <b>classes.</b> Traditionally <b>documents</b> are represented in the so called bag-of-words model. In this model documents are simply represented as vectors, in which dimensions correspond to words. In this project a representation called bag-of-concepts has been evaluated. This representation is based on models for representing the meanings of words in a vector space. Documents are then represented as linear combinations of the words' meaning vectors. The resulting vectors are high-dimensional and very dense. We have investigated two different methods for reducing the dimensionality of the document vectors: feature selection based on gain ratio and random mapping. Two domains of text have been used: abstracts of medical articles in english and texts from Internet newsgroups. The former has been of primary interest, while the latter has been used for comparison. The classification has been performed by use of three different machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost and Decision Stump. Results of the evaluation is difficult to interpret, but suggest that the new representation give significantly better results on <b>document</b> <b>classes</b> for which the classical method fails. The representations seem to give equal results on <b>document</b> <b>classes</b> for which the classical method works fine. Both dimensionality reduction methods are robust. Random mapping, while being much less computationally expensive, shows greater variance...|$|R

Introduction Designing structured multimedia authoring systems is a great challenge for the industry which has to handle large amount of information.

In this paper, we exploit these unchanged associations as the bridge of knowledge transformation from the source domain to the target domain by the nonnegative matrix tri-factorization. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization framework of the two matrix tri-factorizations for the source and target domain data respectively, in which the associations between word clusters and <b>document</b> <b>classes</b> are shared between them. Then, we give an iterative algorithm for this optimization and theoretically show its convergence. The comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of this method.

40|$|The use {{of generic}} {{model for a}} <b>document</b> <b>class</b> as the {{knowledge}} base in a Document Analysis System facilitates the analysis and understanding of documents belonging to this class. Nevertheless, absence of tools permitting the acquisition {{of this type of}} model is an hindrance to the conception of entirely automatic systems. In this paper, we present a method for acquiring the generic model for a <b>document</b> <b>class</b> from document samples belonging to this class. Our method is based on Inference of Tree Grammars and combination of generic constructors of type ODA. The method constructs speciøc physical structure for each document sample and invites the user to assign logical labels to its components. From these logically labeled speciøc structures, the method generates and modi øes the generic model for the class under treatment.
