5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, {{based on}} its {{interior}} chemistry, that the comet formed in the Uranus and Neptune Oort cloud region of the Solar System. A comet which forms <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the Sun {{is expected to have}} greater amounts of ices with low freezing temperatures, such as ethane, which was present in Tempel 1. Astronomers believe that other comets with compositions similar to Tempel 1 are likely to have formed in the same region.|$|E
5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they {{do not seem to}} have any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> their mothers and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E

5|$|Władysław {{was criticized}} for being a spendthrift; he lived lavishly, {{spending}} more than his royal court treasury could afford. He also dispensed much wealth among his courtiers, who were seen by people <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the court as {{taking advantage of the}} king. He has also been known to maintain several mistresses throughout his life, including during his married period.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E

5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from cosmic {{radiation}} to a noteworthy degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|In Leiden, the {{congregation}} gained {{the freedom to}} worship as they chose, but Dutch society was unfamiliar to them. Scrooby had been an agricultural community, whereas Leiden was a thriving industrial center, and the Separatists found the pace of life difficult. The community remained close-knit, but their children began adopting the Dutch language and customs, and some also entered the Dutch Army. The Puritans also were still not free from the persecutions of the English Crown. English authorities came to Leiden to arrest William Brewster in 1618, after he published comments {{highly critical of the}} King of England and the Anglican Church. Brewster escaped arrest, but the events spurred {{the congregation}} to move <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> England.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans do not {{maintain}} a fixed separation from Jupiter. They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically {{moving closer to}} Jupiter or <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> it. Jupiter trojans generally follow paths called tadpole orbits around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their libration is about 150 years. The amplitude of the libration (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6° to 88°, with the average being about 33°. Simulations show that Jupiter trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another—these are called horseshoe orbits (currently no Jupiter Trojan with such an orbit is known).|$|E
5|$|MS is {{more common}} in people who live <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the equator, {{although}} exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the equator such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand Māori, and Canada's Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians and Parsis. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.|$|E

5|$|Pallas is <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> Earth {{and has a}} {{much lower}} albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth. Indeed, the much smaller 7 Iris {{marginally}} exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude. Pallas's mean opposition magnitude is +8.0, which is well {{within the range of}} 10×50 binoculars, but, unlike Ceres and Vesta, it will require more-powerful optical aid to view at small elongations, when its magnitude can drop as low as +10.6. During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, right on the edge of naked-eye visibility. During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6.96.|$|E
5|$|San Diego's roadway system {{provides}} an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown {{tend to be}} utility cycling oriented. This is {{partly because of the}} grid street patterns now absent in newer developments <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly {{from one to another}} and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are {{the focal point of the}} neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to Osawatomie, Kansas, in 1859, but the {{frontier}} violence caused them to move to Missouri in 1860. Eventually, Daniel succeeded in curing Martha's disease. As the American Civil War neared, violence spread into Missouri during the Bleeding Kansas incidents. In October 1860 several men led by Duff Green demanded that Daniel Marshall provide medical assistance to the pro-slavery faction, but he refused, and the men left. When the Marshalls' neighbors warned that Green was planning to return and murder them, the family quickly packed their belongings and escaped by steamboat to Illinois. The Marshalls remained in Illinois only briefly, before relocating to Indiana, which was even <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> the volatile border region.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 38, all small except one, are irregular satellites, whose orbits {{are much}} <b>farther</b> <b>from</b> Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or {{debris from the}} breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families. The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies. The largest of the irregular moons is Phoebe, the ninth moon of Saturn, discovered {{at the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
