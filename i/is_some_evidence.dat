5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> {{from the}} Classic period that women {{provided}} supporting roles in war, {{but they did}} not act as military officers with the exception of those rare ruling queens. By the Postclassic, the native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{circumcision}} {{is associated}} with lower risk of prostate cancer. A 2015 meta-analysis found a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with circumcision in black men. A 2016 meta-analysis found that men with prostate cancer {{were less likely to}} be circumcised.|$|E
5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems {{had no effect on}} aging.|$|E

5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> it supports bone health.|$|E
5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament {{and the extent to which}} attachment acts as a moderator. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.|$|E
50|$|O. pinorum is {{predominantly}} autogamous. It produces about 700 seeds per capsule and over 70,000 seeds per plant. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of xenogamy, but potential pollinators were rarely observed.|$|R
50|$|Analyses {{of recent}} {{elections}} {{suggest that there}} may <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of a diminution in the 'Bradley Effect'. However at this stage such evidence is too limited to confirm a trend.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} have the desired effect, the {{question}} must imply something uncommon enough not to <b>be</b> asked without <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> to the fact. For example, the question [...] "Does Mr. Jones have a brother?" [...] would not cause the listener to think there must <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that he does, since this form of general question is frequently asked with no foreknowledge of the answer.|$|R
5|$|It is {{generally}} believed the house's first owner was Sir William Compton, Groom of the Stool to Henry VIII {{and one of}} the period's prominent courtiers, who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514. However, {{there is no evidence of}} Compton's living in the house, and there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> the building dates to a later period.|$|E
5|$|Many predators feed on {{the milk}} shark, {{including}} larger sharks such as the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni), and possibly also marine mammals. Off KwaZulu-Natal, the decimation of large sharks {{by the use of}} gillnets to protect beaches has led to a recent increase in milk shark numbers. A known parasite of this species is the copepod Pseudopandarus australis. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that male and female milk sharks segregate from each other.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{effects on}} {{fisheries}} are mostly restricted to raiding by birds on aquaculture, although long-lining fisheries {{also have to}} deal with bait stealing. There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks, and while there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of this, the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of marine mammals and predatory fish (like tuna).|$|E
5000|$|Suggestions of {{turbulence}} and/or [...] "wide cones" [...] in {{the inner}} parts of the jets have been put forward to try to counter such problems, {{and there seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> for this.|$|R

50|$|Argula von Grumbach was {{reported}} in a local chronicle to have died in 1554, but there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> from correspondence of the Munich City Council indicated {{that she could have}} been alive as late as 1563.|$|R
5|$|Populations of Gyromitra esculenta {{appear to}} vary {{geographically}} in their toxicity. A French study {{has shown that}} mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, and there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of territoriality, as {{birds in}} the Wheatbelt {{maintain}} territories year-round there. The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle, square-tailed kite and Australian hobby. The species has been observed bathing by shaking its wings in water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.|$|E

5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that the}} effect has {{implications}} for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately {{large number of people}} donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|After {{teaching}} as a master of arts in Paris for over forty years, Robert was recalled to England by King Henry II in 1160, and was appointed Bishop of Hereford in 1163. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas Becket. Becket had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that Pope Alexander III {{had a hand in}} Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E
