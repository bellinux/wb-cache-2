40|$|Inlet {{guide vanes}} (IGV) of high {{temperature}} gas turbines require an effective trailling edge cooling.

Generally the blade trailing <b>edge</b> <b>losses</b> belong to the most importantpenalties for the overall turbine stage efficiency. They are functionof the trailing edge thickness and the base pressure and may amount to 30 % of the losses for cascades operating at transonic outlet Mach numbers. It is also known that the ejection of coolant flow from the trailing edge affects considerably the base pressure and thereby the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>losses.</b> Most investigations refer to coolant flow ejection through the trailing edge but the actual tendency seems to favour the ejection of the coolant from the pressure side {{just ahead of the}} trailing edge.

40|$|Tooth colour {{is often}} {{measured}} with a small window for illumination and measurement. This causes edge loss of the light, resulting in systematic errors in colour coordinates. This paper gives a quantification of the <b>edge</b> <b>losses,</b> and explains their cause. We measured reflectance spectra for 27 Formalin fixated extracted incisors using a small-window reflectance spectrophotometer equipped with external diaphragms of 3, 4, and 5 mm diameter, and using a spectroradiometer. We calculated the colour coordinates L*a*b* from these spectra. Finally, 16 randomly chosen teeth were illuminated with a pencil beam (lambda = 543 nm, and lambda = 633 nm) while the emerging light was measured {{as a function of}} distance from the illuminated spot using a CCD detector. These data were used to calculate small-window <b>edge</b> <b>losses,</b> and thus to predict the small-window reflectance factors relative to spectroradiometrically determined reflectance, at both 543 nm and 633 nm. In all instruments the same spot on the tooth was illuminated and measured, and the teeth were always wet. Colour coordinates for the small-window colour measurements deviate significantly from those determined using the spectroradiometer. These deviations can be explained from the wavelength-dependant edge loss that arises in small-window colour measurement...|$|E

40|$|A 1 MW Lower Hybrid Current drive (LHCD) {{radiofrequency}} {{system is}} used to replace inductive drive on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. It was designed to test Advanced Tokamak (AT) scenarios for future steady-state diverted, high field tokamaks. However, at reactor-relevant densities (n̄e > 1. 10 20 m- 3), an anomalous current drive loss is observed. This loss, known as the LHCD density limit, occurs in diverted plasmas and is correlated with the plasma current and plasma density. Several mechanisms have been implicated {{in the loss of}} current drive, with both experimental and theoretical results suggesting edge power loss. Power modulation is a standard technique used for characterizing power sources and plasma power balance. In this case, the Lower Hybrid radiofrequency (LHRF) power is modulated in time in a set of plasmas across the density range from efficient to negligible current drive. This data {{is used to}} characterize the absorption of LHRF power through the calculation of the LHRF power balance within 15 %, typical of power balance studies. This power balance is used to derive characteristics of the cause behind the LHCD density limit. The immediate nature of LHRF-induced conducted and radiated power losses confirm that LHRF power is absorbed in the edge plasma, even at the lowest densities. The <b>edge</b> <b>losses</b> increase to balance the reduced current drive, indicating that the observed power in the scrape-off-layer (SOL) limits the available power for current drive and the <b>edge</b> <b>losses</b> represent a parasitic mechanism. Unlike <b>edge</b> <b>losses</b> of other radiofrequency systems, this absorption occurs {{with a high degree of}} toroidal symmetry near the plasma separatrix. This indicates absorption occurs just inside the separatrix, or just outside the separatrix over multiple SOL traversals. Measurements of the poloidal distribution of ionization and recombination in the edge were made using a specially designed Ly[alpha] pinhole camera. It utilizes a MgF 2 filter and AXUV diode array to measure Ly[alpha] emission from the lower to upper divertor. Edge deposited LHRF power was found to promptly ionize the active divertor plasma in all diverted topologies. This result highlights the power flow and importance of the divertor plasma in the LHCD density limit. Three independent characteristics indicate the thermal absorption of LHRF power. First, in- /out balance of radiated and conducted LHRF power change with the reversal of the tokamak magnetic fields. Second, comparisons of the conducted heat via Langmuir probes and IR thermography are similar with and without LHRF power. Lastly, the Langmuir probe ratio of Vf l/Te does not significantly modulate with modulated LHRF. A second experiment utilized a high strike-point diverted discharge to determine the edge loss of fast electrons. The high strike point could be observed using the hard X-ray camera, which can compare core and edge X-ray emission. The measured count rates from thick-target bremsstrahlung were interpreted into fast electron fluxes using the Win X-ray code. Theoretical treatments of the fast-electron confinement time were also calculated for Alcator C-Mod. In all cases the fast-electron <b>edge</b> <b>losses</b> are minimal and will be unimportant for future tokamaks due to the small fast electron diffusivity and their large size. The loss of current drive in high density diverted plasmas correlates with high edge plasma collisionality. The newly derived characteristics set stringent requirements in nk for electron Landau damping to cause the edge absorption of LHRF power. Several observed attributes, namely high frequency modulation and low density absorption do not correlate with Landau damping characteristics. However, parasitic collisional absorption in the divertor plasma yields the necessary plasma current, topology, symmetry, thermal, and ionization characteristics. High divertor plasma collisionality is expected if not required for future tokamaks. LHRF systems of future tokamaks must must avoid propagation through collisional regions, even on the first traversal through the SOL. by Ian Charles Faust. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The radial {{structure}} of intra-cavity light pulses is {{considered in the}} hole-coupled free-electron laser (FEL) oscillators of the Dutch FEL facility, FELIX. In a previous numerical study, it was shown that the radial profile can vary significantly over the light pulse, in particular when the electron pulses are short {{with respect to the}} slippage length. In this paper experimental indications are presented for the predicted transverse profile of the radiation. The decay of the power coupled out through the hole has been measured, after the electron beam was switched off, for the two different resonators employed in FELIX. These resonators differ in cavity length, mirror curvature and aperture radius, and in the width of the vacuum tube inside the undulator. The decay rate of the extracted radiation is interpreted according to the calculated intra-cavity mode structure from ELIXER.

40|$|A unique {{sequence}} of 120 almost identical plasmas in the Joint European Torus (JET) recently provided two {{orders of magnitude}} more statistically equivalent data than ever previously available. The purpose was to study movement of eroded plasma-facing material from JET's new Beryllium wall, but it has allowed the statistical detection of otherwise unobservable phenomenon. This includes a sequence of resonant-like waiting times between edge-localised plasma instabilities (ELMs), instabilities that must be mitigated or avoided in large magnetically confined plasmas such as those planned for ITER. Here, we investigate {{the cause of this}} phenomenon, using the unprecedented quantity of data to produce a detailed picture of the plasma's behaviour. After combining the data, oscillations are clearly observable in the plasma's vertical position, in <b>edge</b> <b>losses</b> of ions, and in Beryllium II (527 [*]nm) light emissions. The oscillations are unexpected, are not obvious in data from a single pulse alone, and are all clearly correlated with each other. They are likely to be caused by a small vertical oscillation that the plasma control system is not reacting to prevent, but a more complex explanation is possible. The clearly observable but unexpected link between small changes in the plasma's position and changes to edge-plasma transport and stability suggest that these characteristics cannot always be studied in isolation. It also suggests new opportunities for ELM mitigation and control that may exist...|$|E

A vacuum super insulation (VSI) with micro-porous powders (perlite or fumed silica) in an evacuated (0. 1 mbar) stainless steel envelope {{has been developed}} for the rear side of the collector which replaces the mineral wool insulation of standard collectors. CFD simulations of the equivalent thermal conductivity of the VSI including losses via the powder and <b>edge</b> <b>losses</b> have been performed depending on geometry. Applying a 100 μm thin VA foil as VSI cover, the collector losses can be reduced by about 0. 6 W/m 2 K.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{analytical}} profiling of radial stator blades is considered, which {{in combination with}} numerical modelling of three-dimensional viscous flows allows us to improve {{the efficiency of the}} flow part of high-loaded centripetal turbines. The profile of radial blades is determined in a curvilinear coordinate system and consists of the trailing and leading edges, and also of suction and pressure sides described by polynomial curves of the 5 th and 4 th order, respectively. Thanks to this method, highly efficient radial stator blades of high-loaded stages can be designed. The special form of blade-to-blade channels allows us to obtain a low level of profile and trailing <b>edge</b> <b>losses,</b> as well as low supersonic and shock wave losses of kinetic energy. Three variants of turbines with different types of stator blade profiles are considered: the profile developed using a standard method for axial blades; the “half-drop” profile and the profile developed using the proposed method. For the stator profile developed in this paper, the stator kinetic energy losses related to the enthalpy drop in the stage were decreased by 2, 2 % compared to the profile of a classic form, and by 1, 1 % compared to the “half-drop” profile. Using of the high-loaded stage with a new type of stator blade profile allowed us to significantly improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the flow part in the whole stage.
