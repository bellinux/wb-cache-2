40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to analyse the changes in anxiety and {{depression}} symptoms from early pregnancy to 30 months postpartum according to <b>gender</b> and <b>parity.</b> Method: 129 couples (N = 258) recruited from an obstetrics unit completed self-report measures of anxiety and depression at each pregnancy trimester, childbirth, 3 and 30 months postpartum. Using multilevel modelling, piecewise dyadic growth curve models were performed, assessing time, <b>gender</b> and <b>parity</b> as predictors of anxiety and depression symptoms. Results: Anxiety and depression symptoms decreased from the rst trimester to 3 months postpartum and increased from 3 to 30 months postpartum, returning to the baseline levels in the overall sample. The symptoms were positively correlated within-dyad; in a given time point when a partner reported more symptoms, the other reported more symptoms as well. Changes in anxiety and depression symptoms over time were di erent according to <b>gender</b> and <b>parity,</b> especially from 3 to 30 months postpartum. Primiparous women revealed low stable symptoms, whereas multiparous women revealed the steepest symptoms increase (in comparison to primiparous men and women and multiparous men). Conclusions: This study corroborates the literature considering that the transition to parenthood can last until the child’s age of 2 or 3 years. Results point out that the risk for anxiety and depression symptoms increasing over the postpartum period is greater for multiparous and lesser for primiparous women. Future studies should explore the factors that contribute to the high risk of symptoms increase over the postpartum period for multiparous women. Screening and intervention should target couples and not only women. PTDC/SAU/ SAP/ 116738 / 2010; FCTinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{scholarship}} {{of the welfare}} state is turning strongly comparative, yielding among other fruits an increasingly rigorous comparative history. The 'social policy regime' is an analytic concept being developed to compare welfare states across time, place and types of political system. Usages to date have centred primarily on state/economy relations, giving little specific attention to gender. This paper attempts to extend the concept, identifying basic components of gender in the social policy regimes {{of the welfare state}}. Using examples from the Australian state, it suggests there are key dimensions of state/gender relations in such a regime. One dimension concerns the gender basis of legal personhood in the liberal democratic welfare state, including equality and difference in both legal authority over self and body and <b>gender</b> <b>parities</b> in obligation to contribute and right to claim the benefits of social citizenship. A second dimension concerns labour and the relation between state and economy: the key question here concerns how the sexual division of labour is institutionalised in paid employment and closely associated social policy fields such as education and child care. The third dimension of family and reproduction is already widely recognised as a strongly gendered area of social policy. Central issues in this area concern the institutionalisation of dependency in the rights and obligations of citizen entitlements and the privileging of heterosexuality over other forms of sexual relation. An adequate development of the concept of the social policy regime must also identify regimes of race and ethnicity in the institutional structures and social provisions of the welfare state. The paper concludes with discussion of some of the points of connection between class, gender and race and ethnic relations in social policy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} {{prevalence}} of pelvic floor disorders in a non-institutionalised community and to determine the relationship to <b>gender,</b> age, <b>parity</b> and mode of delivery. DESIGN: A representative population survey using the 1998 South Australian Health Omnibus Survey. SAMPLE: Random selection of 4400 households; 3010 interviews were conducted in the respondents' homes by trained female interviewers. This cross sectional survey included men and women aged 15 - 97 years. RESULTS: The prevalence {{of all types of}} self-reported urinary incontinence in men was 4. 4 % and in women was 35. 3 % (P 20 weeks), regardless of the mode of delivery, greatly increased {{the prevalence of}} major pelvic floor dysfunction, defined as any type of incontinence, symptoms of prolapse or previous pelvic floor surgery. Multivariate logistic regression showed that, compared with nulliparity, pelvic floor dysfunction was significantly associated with caesarean section (OR 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 4. 3), spontaneous vaginal delivery (OR 3. 4, 95 % CI 2. 4 - 4. 9) and at least one instrumental delivery (OR 4. 3, 95 % CI 2. 8 - 6. 6). The difference between caesarean and instrumental delivery was significant (P< 0. 03) but was not for caesarean and spontaneous delivery. Other associations with pelvic floor morbidity were age, body mass index, coughing, osteoporosis, arthritis and reduced quality of life scores. Symptoms of haemorrhoids also increased with age and parity and were reported in 19. 9 % of men and 30. 2 % of women. CONCLUSION: Pelvic floor disorders are very common and are strongly associated with female <b>gender,</b> ageing, pregnancy, <b>parity</b> and instrumental delivery.

40|$|Background: Pregnancy and {{postpartum}} {{have been}} associated to several physiological changes;however, empirical evidence was almost exclusively obtained in primiparous women and few studies focus on hormonal changes in men and second-time parents. The main {{aim of this study}} is to examine 24 -h urinary free cortisol from mid-pregnancy to 3 -months postpartum, comparing women/men and first/second-time parents. Methods: Twenty-six women and 22 men (N = 48) were recruited from an antenatal obstetric unit in Porto, Portugal. 24 -h urinary free cortisol was measured at the 2 nd and 3 rd trimester and at 3 -months postpartum. Repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted, in order to analyze 24 -h urinary free cortisol patterns of change over this period. <b>Gender</b> and <b>parity</b> were included in the analyses as potential modifiers, in order to compare women and men, and first-and second-time parents. Results: An increase from the 2 nd to the 3 rd trimester (p =. 006) and a decrease from the 3 rd trimester to 3 -months postpartum (p =. 005) were reported in all parents’ 24 -h urinary free cortisol. The interaction effects for Time * Gender (p =. 03) and Time * Parity (p =. 02) were found. Women and first-time parents revealed higher levels, while men and second-time parents showed lower 24 -h urinary free cortisol levels at the 2 nd trimester than at 3 -months postpartum. Conclusions: Findings appear to clarify the direction, as well as, the timing, <b>gender</b> and <b>parity</b> extension of 24 -h urinary free cortisol changes from mid-pregnancy to 3 -months postpartum. The same pattern of change in all parents’ 24 -h urinary free cortisol from mid-pregnancy to 3 -months postpartum is consistent with the proposed role of hormones in preparation to parenting.

25|$|While {{most of the}} Millennium Development Goals face a {{deadline}} of 2015, the <b>gender</b> <b>parity</b> target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, {{it will be impossible}} to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths. Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths. Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze {{individual}} and dyadic trajectories of change for positive and negative partner relationship from early pregnancy up to 30 months postpartum, while considering time, <b>gender,</b> and <b>parity.</b> Two hundred sixty couples (N 520) recruited from an Obstetrics Outpatient Unit (Portugal) completed a self-report measure of partner relationship at the first, second, and third pregnancy trimester, at childbirth, and again at 3 and 30 months postpartum. Using multilevel modeling, piecewise dyadic growth curve models were performed to predict positive and negative partner relationship through time, <b>gender,</b> and <b>parity.</b> From the first trimester to 3 months postpartum, positive and negative partner relationship decreased, and from 3 to 30 months postpartum positive partner relationship decreased, while negative partner relationship increased, revealing the deterioration of partner relation- ship over time. The positive and the negative partner relationship dimensions were positively correlated within-dyad. From the first trimester to 3 months postpartum the deterioration of partner relationship was worse for women and for second-time parents, whereas from 3 to 30 months postpartum was worse for first-time parents. These findings provided a relevant contribution toward the body of knowledge related with partner relationship quality over pregnancy and the postpartum period. Additionally, the findings presented a relevant practical contribution. Prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing the risk of deterioration in partner relationship over pregnancy and the postpartum would benefit from including men and women, first- and second-time parents, while addressing the difficulties and challenges that the transition to parenthood poses to partner relationship quality.

Adolescent programmes, many {{in the form of}} school-based projects, youth centres, youth-friendly clinics, and peer education programmes, have for the most part focused their efforts on the unmarried.

40|$|Critical or delayed bone {{healing in}} rat {{osteotomy}} (OT) models is mostly achieved through large defects or instability. We aimed {{to design a}} rat OT model for impaired bone healing based on age, <b>gender</b> and <b>parity.</b> The outcome should be controllable through variations of the haematoma in the OT including a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 guided positive control. Using external fixation to stabilise femoral a 2 mm double OT in 12 month old, female Sprague Dawley rats after a minimum of 3 litters healing was characterised following in situ haematoma formation (ISH-group)), transplantation of a BMP charged autologous blood clot (BMP-group) and the artificial blood clot only (ABC-group) into the OT-gap. In vivo micro-computer tomography (µCT) scans were performed after 2, 4 and 6 weeks. After 6 weeks specimens underwent histological analyses. In µCT examinations and histological analyses no bony bridging was observed {{in all but one}} animal in the ISH-group. In the BMP group complete bridging was achieved in all animals. The ABC-group showed less mineralised tissue formation and smaller bridging scores during the course of healing than the ISH-group. In this pilot study we introduce a model for impaired bone healing taking the major biological risk factors into account. We could show that the in situ fracture haematoma is essential for bone regeneration. Using BMP as a positive control the presented experimental setup can serve to evaluate innovative therapeutical concepts in long bone application...|$|R
40|$|Between 2005 and 2008 {{there were}} 8413 newborns at the {{maternity}} of the Hospital Dona Estefânia (HDE), comprising about 8 % {{of the total}} number of newborns in Portugal in the same period. Fetal mortality (0, 20 %) met the goal of the Portuguese National Health Plan (NHP) and was at the lowest levels reported in the European Union. The percentage of preterm deliveries (8, 1 %) and caesareans (31, 9 %), however, are still above the goals established by the NHP, respectively, 4, 9 % and 24, 8 %. In newborns, the odds ratio of a low Apgar index at five minutes was 1, 35 for each 100 g of birth weight less and 1, 33 for each gestational week less. Average maternal age was 30, 4 years old, with 3, 8 % being adolescents. About 22 % were foreign mothers, a number well above the Portuguese national average of 9 %. The percentage of preterm births and caesareans were lower among Chinese mothers and quite variable among nationalities. Weight at birth was found to correlate significantly with gestational age, type of pregnancy (twins/singleton), foetus <b>gender,</b> maternal <b>parity</b> and age at delivery. On average, when everything else remained constant, one additional gestational week translated into more 176 g; a twin newborn was, on average, 381 g lighter than a singleton, and a female newborn was, on average, 48 g lighter than a male. We present percentile tables of weight at birth by sex and gestational age (36 - 41 weeks) for newborns at the HDE.

40|$|While {{language}} use {{has been argued}} to reflect <b>gender</b> asymmetry, increasing <b>parity</b> has been evidenced in official settings (Holmes, 2000; Dister and Moreau, 2006). Our hypothesis is that the French national press has developed a norm of equal linguistic treatment of men and women. In a corpus of articles from Libération, Le Monde, and Le Figaro, we examine the treatment of Arlette Laguiller, the female leader of the French extreme-left 'Worker's Struggle' Party (Lutte Ouvrière), during {{the run-up to the}} 2007 presidential elections. How Laguiller is referred to and described in comparison with her male counterparts evidences no asymmetry. Breaches to parity are only found in the right-wing Figaro newspaper. The ideological distance between the newspaper and the candidate suggests that power struggles are a primary source of asymmetrical treatments. The discursive functions of such treatments can be understood through an investigation based on a portable corpus linguistics methodology for the measure of discrimination...|$|R
