It resulted ascending and proliferation of coli bacilli into the proximal portion of small intestine. The author has studied the above-described facts, and also performed the tissue culture of the bone marrow of femul to see the function in anemic rats, and observed the therapeutic effect of antianemic substances on the anemic rats. 1) Intestinal Microrganisms In the normal rats every case showed coli bacilli in the duodenum but they were less in number and mostly lactic bacilli have occupied over 1 / 2 of the bacilli in the whole intestinal canal. In accordance with the inversion of acid into alkali in the intestinal canal after operation the coli bacilli have ascended and proliferated into the upper part of intestinal canal. Lactic bacilli, on the contrary, have disappeared in the proximal intestinal canal and become markedly less in number in the whole intestinal canal. 2) Tissue Culture of Bone Marrow It was observed that the comparative growth index and cellmigration velocity diminished, but the enlarging of growth area and cell-migration were not observed to stop at an early stage as in the control group; It did not show marked but moderate dysfunction. 3) Efficacies of V-B(12), Folic Acid and Iron Preparates V-B(12) and folic acid were noneffective but iron preparates reacted well to the anemia and restored the blood picture as that in the rats before operation, especially the restoration of hemoglobin level. The general condition was improved completely corresponding its restoration...|$|E
