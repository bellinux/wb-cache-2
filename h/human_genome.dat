5|$|The {{discovery}} of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the {{discovery of}} the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. Finally, the <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general <b>human</b> <b>genome.</b> This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published. The <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Project was {{the first step in a}} globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.|$|E

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) are {{a tremendous}} source of genome instability and genetic variation. Of {{particular interest to}} investigators of human biology and human evolution are retrotransposon insertions that are recent and/or polymorphic in the human population.

Five recent manuscripts each propose methods to scan whole <b>human</b> <b>genomes</b> to identify, map, and, in some cases, genotype polymorphic retrotransposon insertions in multiple <b>human</b> <b>genomes</b> simultaneously.

5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E

This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics.

Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies helps scientists to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans.

5|$|The {{development}} of such tools {{has been driven}} by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the <b>human</b> <b>genome.</b> It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E
