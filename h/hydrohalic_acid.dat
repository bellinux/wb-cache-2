5|$|The {{chemistry}} of arsenic is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys are mostly brittle. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. Arsenic generally forms compounds {{in which it has}} an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible {{with the addition of a}} <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid.</b> The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and arsenic acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry).|$|E

2500|$|In hydrohalogenation, an alkene {{reacts with}} a dry {{hydrogen}} halide (HX) like hydrogen chloride (...) or hydrogen bromide (...) to form a mono-haloalkane. The double bond of the alkene is replaced by two new bonds, one with the halogen and one with the hydrogen atom of the <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid.</b> Markovnikov's rule states that in this reaction, the halogen {{is more likely to}} become attached to the more substituted carbon. This is an electrophilic addition reaction. Water must be absent otherwise there will be a side product of a halohydrin. The reaction is necessarily to be carried out in a dry inert solvent such as [...] or directly in the gaseous phase. The reaction of alkynes are similar, with the product being a geminal dihalide; once again, Markovnikov's rule is followed.|$|E

5000|$|Hydrogen halides are {{diatomic}} {{inorganic compounds}} with the formula HX where X {{is one of}} the halogens: fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, or astatine.

50|$|Eucalyptol has a fresh mint-like {{smell and}} a spicy, cooling taste. It is {{insoluble}} in water, but miscible with ether, ethanol, and chloroform. The boiling point is 176 °C and the flash point is 49 °C. Eucalyptol forms crystalline adducts with <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids,</b> o-cresol, resorcinol, and phosphoric acid.

50|$|In {{the above}} reactions, HX (hydrogen halide or <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid)</b> is also formed. For example, if the acyl halide is an acyl {{chloride}}, HCl (hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid) is also formed.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen azide (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell {{and is a}} potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids,</b> such as {{hydrochloric}} acid, {{hydrogen fluoride}} {{is only a}} weak acid in water solution, with acid dissociation constant(pKa) equal to 3.19. HF's weakness as an aqueous acid is paradoxical considering how polar the HF bond is, {{much more so than}} the bond in HCl, HBr, or HI. The explanation for the behavior is complicated, having to do with various cluster-forming tendencies of HF, water, and fluoride ion, as well as thermodynamic issues. At great concentrations, a property called homoconjugation is revealed. HF begins to accept fluoride ions, forming the polyatomic ions (such as bifluoride, [...] ) and protons, thus greatly increasing the acidity of the compound. Hydrofluoric acid is also the strongest of the <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids</b> in acetic acid and similar solvents. Its hidden acidity potential is also revealed by the fact it protonates acids like hydrochloric, sulfuric, or nitric. Despite its weakness, hydrofluoric acid is very corrosive, even attacking glass (hydrated only).|$|R
5000|$|Building on {{the ideas}} of two-electron mixed-valency, Heyduk and Nocera {{developed}} a light-driven molecular photocatalyst. The absorption of light caused the two RhII-X bonds of a dirhodium compound to break, resulting in an active rhodium catalyst which was able to react with <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids.</b> Their 2001 report on the generation of H2 from halohalic acid using a molecular photocatalyst is considered to have [...] "opened the door" [...] to photocatalytic production of fuels.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydrogen}} halides are colourless gases at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) {{except for}} hydrogen fluoride, which boils at 19 °C. Alone {{of the hydrogen}} halides, hydrogen fluoride exhibits hydrogen bonding between molecules, and therefore has the highest melting and boiling points of the HX series. From HCl to HI the boiling point rises. This trend is attributed to the increasing strength of intermolecular van der Waals forces, which correlates with numbers of electrons in the molecules. Concentrated <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions produce visible white fumes. This mist arises from the formation of tiny droplets of their concentrated aqueous solutions of the <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The binary ferrous and ferric halides are well-known, {{with the}} {{exception}} of ferric iodide. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid</b> to give the corresponding hydrated salts.|$|E
50|$|SN1 ether {{cleavage}} {{is generally}} faster than SN2 ether cleavage. However, reactions {{that would require}} the formation of unstable carbocations (methyl, vinyl, aryl or primary carbon) proceed via SN2 mechanism. The <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid</b> also plays an important role, as the rate of reaction is greater with hydroiodic acid than with hydrobromic acid. Hydrochloric acid only reacts under more rigorous conditions. The reason lies in the higher acidity of the heavier hydrohalic acids as well as the higher nucleophilicity of the respective conjugate base. Fluoride is not nucleophilic enough to allow for usage of hydrofluoric acid to cleave ethers in protic media. Regardless of which <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid</b> is used, the rate of reaction is comparably low, so that heating of the reaction mixture is required.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} benzo(f) {{quinoline}}, benzo(h) quinoline and acridine on the corrosion of zinc in <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids</b> has been studied. Halide ions accelerate the corrosion whereas quinolines and acridine act as corrosion inhibitors. Halide ions enhance {{the protection of}} zinc by each inhibitor. The polarization data reveal that these inhibitors act as ambiodic inhibitors. The mechanism of corrosion inhibition is discussed {{on the basis of}} coadsorption and synergistic effect of anions and inhibitor molecules...|$|R
50|$|Sodium sulfite (sodium sulphite) is a soluble {{sodium salt}} of sulfurous acid (sulfite) with the {{chemical}} formula Na2SO3. It {{is a product of}} sulfur dioxide scrubbing, a part of the flue-gas desulfurization process. It is also used as a preservative to prevent dried fruit from discoloring, and for preserving meats, and is used {{in the same way as}} sodium thiosulfate to convert elemental halogens to their respective <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids,</b> in photography and for reducing chlorine levels in pools.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{scientific}} {{concept of}} acids and bases {{was provided by}} Lavoisier in around 1776. Since Lavoisier's knowledge of strong acids was mainly restricted to oxoacids, such as [...] (nitric acid) and [...] (sulfuric acid), which tend to contain central atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by oxygen, and since he {{was not aware of}} the true composition of the <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids</b> (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI), he defined acids in terms of their containing oxygen, which in fact he named from Greek words meaning [...] "acid-former" [...] (from the Greek οξυς (oxys) meaning [...] "acid" [...] or [...] "sharp" [...] and γεινομαι (geinomai) meaning [...] "engender"). The Lavoisier definition was held as absolute truth for over 30 years, until the 1810 article and subsequent lectures by Sir Humphry Davy in which he proved the lack of oxygen in , H2Te, and the <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids.</b> However, Davy failed to develop a new theory, concluding that [...] "acidity does not depend upon any particular elementary substance, but upon peculiar arrangement of various substances". One notable modification of oxygen theory was provided by Berzelius, who stated that acids are oxides of nonmetals while bases are oxides of metals.|$|R
50|$|An {{instructive}} but obsolete {{route to}} Cp* complexes {{involves the use}} of hexamethyl Dewar benzene. This method was traditionally used for preparation of the chloro-bridged dimers Cp*IrCl22 and Cp*RhCl22. Such syntheses rely on a <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid</b> induced rearrangement of hexamethyl Dewar benzene to a substituted pentamethylcyclopentadiene prior to reaction with the hydrate of either iridium(III) chloride or rhodium(III) chloride.|$|E
50|$|Hydroiodic acid (or hydriodic acid) is {{a highly}} acidic aqueous {{solution}} of hydrogen iodide (HI)(concentrated solution usually 48 - 57% HI). It is the second strongest <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid,</b> after hydroastatic acid. Hydroiodic acid is a commonly used chemical reagent {{and is one of}} the strong acids that ionize completely in an aqueous solution. Concentrated hydroiodic acid has a pH of less than 0.|$|E
50|$|Alcohols and amines {{react with}} acid halides to produce esters and amides, respectively, in a {{reaction}} formally {{known as the}} Schotten-Baumann reaction. Acid halides hydrolyze {{in the presence of}} water to produce carboxylic acids, but this type of reaction is rarely useful, since carboxylic acids are typically used to synthesize acid halides. Most reactions with acid halides are carried out {{in the presence of a}} non-nucleophilic base, such as pyridine, to neutralize the <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acid</b> that is formed as a byproduct.|$|E
25|$|For example, the solvent glacial (anhydrous) {{acetic acid}} is less basic than water, {{and the extent}} of {{ionization}} of the <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids</b> varies in the order HI > HBr > HCl. These acids lose a proton to a CH3COOH molecule which forms its conjugate acid, CH3C(OH)2+, but the reaction is only partial. In contrast these three acids are all strong (completely ionized) in water. Acetic acid {{is said to be a}} differentiating solvent for the three solute acids, while water is not.|$|R
5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids,</b> which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|R
50|$|Water can {{dissolve}} the other hydrogen chalcogenides (at least those up to hydrogen telluride), forming acidic solutions known as hydrochalcogenic acids.

It is unknown if polonium hydride forms an acidic solution in water like its lighter homologues, or if it behaves more like a metal hydride (see also hydrogen astatide).|$|R

40|$|The {{meteoric}} rise of {{the field}} of perovskite solar cells has been fueled by the ease with which a wide range of high-quality materials can be fabricated via simple solution processing methods. However, to date, little effort has been devoted to understanding the precursor solutions, and the role of additives such as <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids</b> upon film crystallization and final optoelectronic quality. Here, a direct link between the colloids concentration present in the [HC(NH 2) 2] 0. 83 Cs 0. 17 Pb(Br 0. 2 I 0. 8) 3 precursor solution and the nucleation and growth stages of the thin film formation is established. Using dynamic light scattering analysis, the dissolution of colloids over a time span triggered by the addition of <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids</b> is monitored. These colloids appear to provide nucleation sites for the perovskite crystallization, which critically impacts morphology, crystal quality, and optoelectronic properties. Via 2 D X-ray diffraction, highly ordered and textured crystals for films prepared from solutions with lower colloidal concentrations are observed. This increase in material quality allows for a reduction in microstrain along with a twofold increase in charge-carrier mobilities leading to values exceeding 20 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1). Using a solution with an optimized colloidal concentration, devices that reach current-voltage measured power conversion efficiency of 18. 8 % and stabilized efficiency of 17. 9 % are fabricated...|$|R

[...] Attempting a similar reaction with potassium tetrachloroplatinate results in the formation of a pentamethylcyclopentadiene complex, (η4-Cp*H)PtCl2, indicating that the rhodium and iridium metal centres are necessary for the step in which the aromatic anion is formed.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike other <b>hydrohalic</b> <b>acids,</b> such as {{hydrochloric}} acid, {{hydrogen fluoride}} {{is only a}} weak acid in dilute aqueous solution.

At high concentrations, HF molecules undergo homoassociation to form polyatomic ions (such as bifluoride, [...] ) and protons, thus greatly increasing the acidity. This leads to protonation of very strong acids like hydrochloric, sulfuric, or nitric when using concentrated hydrofluoric acid solutions. Although hydrofluoric acid is regarded as a weak acid, it is very corrosive, even attacking glass when hydrated.|$|R
