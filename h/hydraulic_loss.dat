In order tostudy {{the internal}} flowsand <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> of reducing cross, numerical simulation {{was carried out}} on a horizontally installedreducing cross. Three schemes of pipe diameters were studied. The time-averaged N-S equations of three-dimensional steady flows in the reducing pipe were calculated by CFX 14. 5 based on the standard k-ε two equation turbulence model together with standard wall function. The {{results show that the}} higher the inlet velocity, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> become larger when the split ratios are same for the reducing cross. With the uniform inlet velocities the higher the inlet velocity, the quicker the increasing rate of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> in main pipe, as well as the branch pipe. The integral change rules of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> are similar with the condition of uniform flow rate inflow when the flow patterns at inlet are uniform. But with the same spilt ratio, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> of uniform velocity inflow is markedly less than that of uniform flow rate inflow in both main pipe and branch pipe. The bigger the differences of the diameters between the main pipe and the branch pipe, the larger the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> of thebranch pipe...|$|E

Lowering <b>hydraulic</b> <b>losses</b> in the Mutnovskoe field has been realized with the replacement of U-shaped compensators (expansion unit) on the bellows (a U-shaped compensator has a resistance coefficient eight times that of a bellows expansion joint), flattening of pipelines (to reduce the overall length of pipelines and exclude local resistance at turning of flow), dismantling non-functional valves, etc. Lowering the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>losses</b> in Pauzhetskoe field was also realized with the improvement of transportation conditions to the separator, change of separators type, and redistribution of the flow rate among the main steam pipelines.|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{efficiency}} improvement of pump as turbine (PAT) is inadequate. Blade thickness {{is an important}} geometry parameter in blade design. To explore effects of blade thickness {{on the influence of}} PAT, numerical research on three different specific speeds of PATs with different blade thickness was carried out. Their performance changes with blade thickness were presented. Besides, the variations of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> distribution with increasing blade thickness were performed. Theoretical analysis gives a reasonable explanation for the performance change. Results show thatPAT's flow versus efficiency curve (Q-η) is lowered; flow versus head (Q-H) curve and flow versus power (Q-P) curve are increased with increasing blade thickness. The increase of Q-P is mainly attributed to the increase of theoretical head caused by increasing blockage of impeller inlet area. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> distribution analysis indicates that the total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss</b> within PAT is increased with increasing blade thickness. The increase of Q-H curve is a combined effect of the increase in theoretical head and the total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loss.</b> The decrease of efficiency with increasing blade thickness indicates that the blade thickness of PAT should be as thin as possible if its strength could be met...|$|E

Significant contribution to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>losses</b> makes one selected design of the coolant supplies. It is, in particular, hemispherical or semi-elliptical shape of the supply reservoir, which is selected to reduce its mass, resulting {{in the formation of}} torusshaped vortex in the inlet manifold, that leads to uneven coolant velocity at the inlet into the core, the flow pulsations, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>losses.</b> To control the flow redistribution in the core according to the level of energy are used the switchgear - deflectors installed in a hemispherical reservoir supplying coolant to the fuel elements (FE) of the core of gas-cooled reactor. This design solution has an effect on the structure of the flow, rate in the cooling duct, and the flow resistance of the collector. In this paper we present the results of experiments carried out on the gas dynamic model of coolant paths, deflectors, and core, comprising 55 fuel rod simulators.
