5|$|Gout may be {{diagnosed}} and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis {{of the base}} of the great toe (known as podagra).

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. Cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>analysis</b> (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly {{performed in the}} {{diagnosis of}} GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but their contribution to diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as {{a low level of}} potassium in the blood. An abnormally low level of sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome. This has been attributed to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, leading to relative retention of water.|$|E
25|$|In general, PPS is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion whereby other possible causes of the symptoms are eliminated. Neurological examination aided by other laboratory studies can help to determine what component of a neuromuscular deficit occurred with polio and what components are new and to exclude all other possible diagnoses. Objective assessment of muscle strength in PPS patients may not be easy. Changes in muscle strength are determined in specific muscle groups using various muscle scales which quantify strength, such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuroimaging, and electrophysiological studies, muscle biopsies, or spinal <b>fluid</b> <b>analysis</b> may also be useful in establishing a PPS diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Design {{of fluid}} {{dynamically}} efficient ducts is addressed through {{the combination of}} an optimization analysis with a three-dimensional viscous <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>analysis</b> code. For efficiency, a parabolic <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>analysis</b> was used. Since each function evaluation in an optimization analysis is a full three-dimensional viscous flow analysis requiring 200, 000 grid points, {{it is important to}} use both an efficient <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>analysis</b> and an efficient optimization technique. Three optimization techniques are evaluated on a series of test functions. The Quasi-Newton (BFGS, eta =. 9) technique was selected as the preferred technique. A series of basic duct design problems are performed. On a two-parameter optimization problem, the BFGS technique is demonstrated to require half as many function evaluations as a steepest descent technique...|$|R
