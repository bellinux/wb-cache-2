6000|$|The Yankee has {{retained}} something of the long sound of the a in such words as axe, wax, pronouncing them exe, wex (shortened from aix, waix). He also says hev and hed (h[=a]ve, h[=a]d for have and had). In most cases he follows an Anglo-Saxon usage. In aix <b>for</b> <b>axle</b> he certainly does. I find wex and aisches (ashes) in Pecock, and exe in the Paston Letters. Golding rhymes wax with wexe and spells challenge chelenge. Chaucer wrote hendy. Dryden rhymes can with men, as Mr. Biglow would. Alexander Gill, Milton's teacher, in his 'Logonomia' cites hez for hath as peculiar to Lincolnshire. I find hayth in Collier's 'Bibliographical Account of Early English Literature' under the date 1584, and Lord Cromwell so wrote it. Sir Christopher Wren wrote belcony.

While the New Englander cannot be brought to say instead for instid (commonly 'stid where not the last word in a sentence), he changes the i into e in red for rid, tell for till, hender for hinder, rense for rinse.

40|$|Considering hollow railway <b>axles</b> <b>for</b> {{high-speed}} applications, {{an effective}} optimization of the maintenance non-destructive (NDT) inspections is mandatory {{to guarantee a}} safe service. Since observed failures are typically connected to crack propagation phenomena originated by corrosion-fatigue pits or ballast impacts, inspection intervals can be defined, for a given application, by a “damage tolerant” approach based on fracture mechanics concepts and the reliability (“Probability of Detection” curve) of the adopted NDT techniques. Starting from this background, the present paper describes a methodology for the optimization of inspection plans <b>for</b> high-speed <b>axles.</b> First, the design procedure <b>for</b> <b>axles</b> is presented along with the inspection design approach. The latter is here based on the innovative definition of “Model-Assisted Probability of Detection” curves considering a suitable, and cheaper, mix of experimental and numerical results. Then, the boreprobe is described as the fundamental system of an automatic and mechanised procedure, so to diminish the human errors, <b>for</b> inspecting hollow <b>axles.</b> Finally, the derivation of optimised inspection intervals is explained...|$|R
25|$|As {{the bridge}} and its {{approaches}} have only one lane in each direction, traffic backups and delays often occurred in more recent years. The Jordan Bridge was the oldest drawbridge in Virginia. Formerly operated by the City of Chesapeake's Department of Public Works, it had a restricted weight limit of 3 tons. Daily toll revenue was approximately $5,000. The toll (collected on the Chesapeake side) for both direction was 50 cents for motorcycles, 75 cents <b>for</b> two <b>axle</b> vehicles, $1.00 <b>for</b> three <b>axles</b> and $1.25 <b>for</b> four <b>axles.</b> There were no facilities for electronic toll collection.|$|R
50|$|Dropped axles {{were made}} of forged wrought iron. Although wood was widely used <b>for</b> <b>axles,</b> owing to its lightness, it could not easily be shaped with the sharp curves {{required}} to drop an axle.
