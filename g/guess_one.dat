25|$|In France, {{within a}} matter of hours, the French retake and then lose the city of Rouen. After the battle, Bedford dies, and Talbot assumes direct command of the army. The Dauphin is horrified at the loss of Rouen, but Joan tells him not to worry. She then persuades the {{powerful}} Duke of Burgundy, who had been fighting for the English, to switch sides, and join the French. Meanwhile, Henry arrives in Paris and upon learning of Burgundy's betrayal, he sends Talbot to speak with him. Henry then pleads for Richard and Somerset to put aside their conflict, and, unaware of the implications of his actions, he chooses a red rose, symbolically aligning himself with Somerset and alienating Richard. Prior to returning to England, in an effort to secure peace between Somerset and Richard, Henry places Richard in command of the infantry and Somerset in command of the cavalry. Meanwhile, Talbot approaches Bordeaux, but the French army swings around and traps him. Talbot sends word for reinforcements, but the conflict between Richard and Somerset leads them to second <b>guess</b> <b>one</b> another, and neither of them send any, both blaming the other for the mix-up. The English army is subsequently destroyed, and both Talbot and his son are killed.|$|E
500|$|Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo in Spider-Man 3, {{as he does}} in many Marvel-based films. He plays a man who, {{after reading}} a news {{bulletin}} along with Peter, tells him, [...] "You know, I <b>guess</b> <b>one</b> person can make a difference," [...] followed by his catchphrase [...] "Nuff said." [...] Actor Bruce Campbell, who had cameo roles as a wrestling ring announcer in [...] "Spider-Man" [...] and as a rude usher in [...] "Spider-Man 2," [...] returns in [...] "Spider-Man 3" [...] with a new cameo as a French maître d'. His character helps Peter try to propose to Mary Jane. Years later, Jeffrey Henderson, {{who worked on the}} storyboards for the canceled [...] "Spider-Man 4" [...] movie, released information regarding which villains would appear within the movie. One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck/Mysterio. Composer Christopher Young appears in the film as a pianist at Mary Jane's theater when she is fired, while producer Grant Curtis has a cameo as the driver of an armored car that the Sandman attacks. Joe Manganiello makes a cameo as Flash Thompson at Harry's funeral.|$|E
2500|$|Following their post-sleep period, {{the crews}} {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the first spacewalk of the mission. Stefanyshyn-Piper and Bowen were suited up and in the airlock ahead of schedule, and the EVA started at 18:09 UTC, with Piper becoming the first female Lead Spacewalker. While Piper was preparing to begin work on the SARJ, she noticed {{a significant amount of}} grease in her tool bag, [...] "I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag," [...] Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA. Mission Control managers instructed Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, one of the crew lock bags floated away. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>one</b> of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose," [...] Piper told Kimbrough. The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment. While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed, and all EVA tasks were accomplished. The estimated value of the lost tool bag was US$100,000. An amateur astronomer later observed the tool bag as it orbited the Earth prior to re-entering. It {{was not the first time}} that equipment had got away from spacewalkers, items lost in the past include tools, nuts and bolts, glue guns, cameras, cloths, and even a robotic arm. The United States Space Surveillance Network constantly monitors over 12,500 items in orbit around the Earth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Camellia is a 128 bit {{block cipher}} {{proposed}} by NTT and Mitsubishi. We discuss {{the security of}} Camellia against the square attack. We find a 4 round distinguisher and construct a basic square attack. We can attack 5 round Camellia by <b>guessing</b> <b>one</b> byte subkey and using 2 16 chosen plaintexts. Cosidering the key schdule, we may extend this attack up to 9 round Camellia including the first FL/FL − 1 function layer. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} guessing attacks upon security protocols, where an intruder <b>guesses</b> <b>one</b> {{of the values}} used (typically a poorly-chosen password) and then seeks to verify that guess. We formalise such attacks, {{and in particular the}} way in which the guess is verified. We then describe how to model such attacks within the process algebra CSP, so that they can be detected using the model checker FDR, and illustrate our technique on some examples...|$|R
