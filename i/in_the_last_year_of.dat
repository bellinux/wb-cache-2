The Kauravas wished to reveal Pandavas' real identities {{so that they would}} repeat another exile of 13 years in a cyclic fashion. The issues faced by the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi at Matsya due to various factors, notably Virata's brother-in-law Kichaka form the rest of the story.|$|E
5|$|Early in Ahmedabad's history, under Ahmed Shah, {{builders}} fused Hindu craftsmanship with Persian architecture, {{giving rise}} to the Indo-Saracenic style.

5|$|Throughout {{his life}} in {{politics}} and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but this can be measured against his generosity to the men under his command and genuine bravery. As {{a member of the}} landed aristocracy he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> his life he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.|$|E

5|$|Formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> World War II to {{undertake}} ground attack missions with de Havilland Mosquitos and Bristol Beaufighters in the South West Pacific theatre, No.86 Wing was reorganised in 1946 as a transport formation headquartered at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. It relocated to RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in 1949 and began operating Lockheed C-130 Hercules in 1958. Disbanded in 1964, the wing was re-established at Richmond in 1987, flying Boeing 707 tanker-transports {{as well as}} the Hercules. No.36 Squadron converted to Globemasters in 2006. No.33 Squadron retired its 707s in 2008, and did not become operational with the KC-30 until 2013. Having previously flown de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, No.38 Squadron converted to the King Airs in 2009. The Hercules were transferred to No.84 Wing in 2010. No.86 Wing headquarters relocated from Richmond to Amberley in January 2012.|$|E
5|$|From the {{unexpected}} realism {{of his first}} major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company {{with a variety of}} high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, {{it would be hard to}} maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by Class of '44, a slice-of-life film made up of vignettes about Herman Raucher and Oscar Seltzer's experiences in college. Class of '44 involves the boys facing army service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> World War II. The only crew member from Summer of '42 {{to return to the}} project was Raucher himself, who wrote the script; a new director and composer were brought in to replace Mulligan and Legrand. Of the principal four cast members of Summer of '42, only Jerry Houser and Gary Grimes returned for prominent roles, with Oliver Conant making two brief appearances totaling less than two minutes of screen time. Jennifer O'Neill did not appear in the film at all, nor was the character of Dorothy mentioned.|$|E

That year, the new mayor opened an investigation against eleven former city officials alleged to be involved in the financial case. On November 8, 2016, one of the city's former financial heads, Juan Fernando Miranda Macías, was arrested for illegally using city resources. He was released from prison in two days after a judge concluded that the accusations against him were inconclusive.|$|E

I {{can only hope that}} they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

5|$|Instrumental {{in facilitating}} the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's {{positive}} relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, {{who was his}} first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which {{kept him out of}} the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> his contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis {{seized from}} the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles {{of weapons and}} raw materials such as copper, tin, oil and nickel. Financial demands were levied on {{the governments of the}} occupied countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, {{but not as much as}} during World War I.

5|$|The {{civil war}} {{ended with the}} Treaty of Winchester, late in 1153, which {{provided}} that Matilda's son Henry would succeed Stephen after his death. When Stephen died the next year, this became a lasting peace. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> Stephen's reign, in mid-1154, Chesney acquired the right to operate a mint {{in the town of}} Newark, granted in perpetuity. But as there are no surviving coins, it seems that the mint was not in operation for long. Chesney also acquired the right of justice in the city of Lincoln, and was involved in the commercial life of his diocese, establishing a fair in the town of Banbury in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Yingzao Fashi is a {{technical}} treatise on architecture and craftsmanship written by Li Jie, an architect and {{official at the}} Directorate of Buildings and Construction.

His successor, Emperor Huizong of Song, had Li's treatise officially published three years later, in 1103, {{for the benefit of}} foremen, architects, and literate craftsmen. The book was intended to provide standard regulations, to not only the engineering agencies of the central government, but also the many workshops and artisan families throughout China who could benefit from using a well-written government manual on building practices.|$|E
5|$|Xiphias is next {{mentioned}} in the Battle of Kleidion in 1014, when Basil II was attempting to force the pass known as Kleidion or Kiava Longos, which the Bulgarians under their ruler Samuil had strongly fortified. Xiphias, still strategos of Philippopolis, suggested to the Emperor to bypass the Bulgarian positions and strike them from the rear. After Basil agreed, Xiphias led a picked infantry detachment over Mount Belasica, and on 29 July 1014, led his troops on a charge on the unsuspecting Bulgarians, who panicked and broke before the unexpected attack. For this feat, which resulted {{in one of the}} most decisive victories in the long Bulgarian war, he was rewarded with promotion to the rank of patrikios. In early 1015, Xiphias, along with Constantine Diogenes, subdued the region of Moglena, which had rebelled against imperial rule. Towards the end of the same year he campaigned from Mosynopolis to the region of Triaditza (Sofia), razing its environs and capturing the fort of Boyana. Finally, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> the Bulgarian war, in 1018, starting from Kastoria he subdued the remaining Bulgarian strongholds in the region of Servia.|$|E
