40|$|Acute {{porphyria}} afflicts a large kindred in Chester that {{stems from}} a marriage in 1896 that has produced 200 descendants; {{this is the largest}} porphyric kindred to be identified in the United Kingdom. Six members aged 51 or under died from the condition over the past eight years. The diagnosis of porphyria was overlooked in some as the symptoms may mimic those of other acute illnesses, so that incomplete or <b>incorrect</b> death <b>certificates</b> have been issued. Psychosis, hypertension, and renal complications are particularly common. The porphyric members of the kindred show a previously undescribed hereditary disorder in which the characteristic enzymatic defects of acute intermittent porphyria and variegate porphyria coexist in the same subject. Acute porphyria is poorly understood by hospital and general practitioners, and this has caused anxiety in the kindred. A register of the kindred has been established, and families at risk should be offered biochemical screening, education, and genetic counselling...|$|R
40|$|Necropsy {{reports were}} traced for 3928 of the 7049 Sheffield {{children}} who died between 1947 and 1979. Comparison of these reports with the related death certificates showed important {{differences in the}} underlying {{cause of death in}} 15 %, even after allowing for variation in diagnostic terms and <b>incorrect</b> completion of <b>certificates.</b> Approximately one third of certificates had the underlying cause of death entered first instead of last in Part I, and in 251 (6 %), the underlying cause of death was found in Part II of the certificate. There was an overrepresentation of infectious diseases and underrepresentation of malformations, deaths associated with perinatal factors, and cot deaths in the death certificates. Discrepancies were more frequent among very young children and among hospital deaths than home deaths. There was little variation in discrepancy frequency when analysed by parental occupation. A gradual decrease in the proportion of discrepancies occurred during the period studied, but this may be a consequence of a changing pattern of referral for necropsy rather than increasingly valid certification. The historical diagnoses 'convulsions due to an unknown but natural cause' and 'teething convulsions' may be analogous to the current diagnosis 'sudden infant death syndrome'...|$|R
