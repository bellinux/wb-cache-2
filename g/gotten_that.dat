500|$|Ellen {{goes out}} to dinner with her old friend Richard, a {{reporter}} who is in town to cover a story. His producer, Susan, joins them for dessert and she and Ellen hit it off. Ellen goes back to Richard's hotel room. He comes on to her and, uncomfortable, Ellen leaves. She runs into Susan in the hall and returns with her to her room. They continue to enjoy each other's company until Susan tells Ellen that she's gay and that she thought Ellen might be too. Ellen denies it and suggests that Susan is trying to [...] "recruit" [...] her. Susan sarcastically says that she'll have to call [...] "national headquarters" [...] and let them know Ellen got away. ("Damn, just one more and I would have <b>gotten</b> <b>that</b> toaster oven.") An agitated Ellen leaves Susan's room and returns to Richard's room, determined to have sex with him to prove to herself she is not gay.|$|E

But as the night progressed, they started liking it more and more." ...|$|E

[...] The state {{executives}} began {{to arrive at the}} Logan House Hotel in Altoona on September 23. The city was the ideal location for the meeting: it was near both the Midwest states as well as New England, and it also provided excellent transportation and luxury due to the massive Pennsylvania Railroad center that was based in Altoona. In fact, during the Gettysburg Campaign, the city was strongly considered by Confederate General Robert E. Lee as a potential target should his forces have <b>gotten</b> <b>that</b> far.|$|E

2500|$|Laird {{recalled}} that {{the publication of}} the first issue of his and Eastman's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin's uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: [...] "if we hadn't <b>gotten</b> <b>that</b> loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, and who knows what might have happened differently {{as a result of that}} delay?" [...] It occurred to him that [...] "there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of" [...] a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his [...] "good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out" [...] (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those [...] "involved in charitable organizations").|$|E
2500|$|Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{took the}} lead from Tony Stewart with four laps to go and held off a hard {{charging}} Jeff Gordon to score his first career win at Martinsville Speedway. “Oh, man, been trying to win here for so many years,” Earnhardt said. “Real emotional win. I can’t believe we won here. We’re going to {{drink a lot of}} beer tonight. It’s a real emotional win. This team on pit road was great and Steve (Letarte, crew chief) and the guys did a real good job all day. They gave me a great shot at it there with the call at the end to take tires. I can’t believe we won here. This means so much to all of us. It’s just real emotional.” [...] "That means so much to Hendrick Motorsports," [...] Gordon said. [...] "That's the best way you can possibly pay tribute to those that we lost 10 years ago. To have a 1-2 finish, that's pretty awesome. I {{would have loved to have}} <b>gotten</b> <b>that</b> win to move on to Homestead, but this is certainly a great start for us." [...] "I thought we had the car to beat," [...] Gordon said. [...] "Those last couple of laps were just wild. This means so much to Hendrick Motorsports. It's the best way to pay tribute to everyone we lost 10 years ago. I would have loved to get that win to move on to Homestead. But I'm real happy for Dale. I know this means so much to him." ...|$|E

3000|$|If {{the above}} {{algorithm}} does not finish at finite step, {{then it must}} produce an infinite sub-rectangle iteration sequence {X^k}, from the exhaustiveness of division approach, we <b>get</b> <b>that</b> the sub-rectangle sequence {X^k} must converge to a point. From the characteristics of our algorithm, we can <b>get</b> <b>that</b> {UB_k} and {LB_k} are nonincreasing and nondecreasing sequences, respectively. So that {UB_k-LB_k} is a monotonic non-increasing sequence. By the conclusion of Theorem  1, we <b>get</b> <b>that</b> the sequence {UB_k-LB_k} must be convergent to zero. From the structure of our algorithm, for each k, we have LB_k< v^*< UB_k. Therefore, we can <b>get</b> <b>that</b> [...] _k→∞UB_k= _k→∞LB_k=v^*. From steps of our algorithm, we know that x^k is always a feasible point of the initial NQCQP, we can get UB_k=G_ 0 (x^k). By the continuity of constrained functions, we <b>get</b> <b>that</b> the limitation point x^* of {x^k} is also a feasible point of the initial NQCQP, {{and we can get}} the global optimum value v^*=G_ 0 (x^*). Hence, the conclusion is proved.|$|R

That man might never have <b>gotten</b> <b>that</b> dog back at all, if it hadn't been for me. My principles have remained to this day what they were then.

When we told them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed; for it was the sight of the horses that made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey; and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun; but they being excessive hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of danger; and that if we had not by the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood all together, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and being so many in number.|$|E
