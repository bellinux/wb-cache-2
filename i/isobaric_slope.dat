40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{mean and}} synoptic fluctuation of the wintertime Taiwan Warm Current (TWC) were investigated using a well-validated finite volume community ocean model. The spatial distribution and {{dynamics of the}} synoptic fluctuation were highlighted. The seasonal mean of the wintertime TWC has two branches: an inshore branch between the 30  and 100  m isobaths and an offshore branch between the 100  and 200  m isobaths. The Coriolis term is {{much larger than the}} inertia term and is almost balanced by the pressure gradient term in both branches, indicating geostrophic balance of the mean current. Two areas with significant fluctuations of the TWC were identified during wintertime. One of the areas is located to the north of Taiwan with velocities varying in the cross-shore direction. These significant cross-shore fluctuations are driven by barotropic pressure gradients associated with the intrusion of the Taiwan Strait Current (TSC). When a strong TSC intrudes to the north of Taiwan, the <b>isobaric</b> <b>slope</b> tilts downward from south to north, leading to a cross-shore current from the coastal area to the offshore area. When the TSC intrusion is weak, the cross-shore current to the north of Taiwan is directed from offshore to inshore. The other area of significant fluctuation is located in the inshore area between the 30  and 100  m isobaths. The fluctuations are generally strong both in the alongshore and cross-shore directions, in particular at the latitudes 26. 5  and 28 ° N. Wind affects the synoptic fluctuation through episodic events. When the northeasterly monsoon prevails, the southwestward Zhe-Min coastal current dominates the inshore area associated with a deepening of the mixed layer. When the winter monsoon is weakened or the southwesterly wind prevails, the northeastward TWC dominates in the inshore area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAircraft {{measurements}} of the power spectra of the horizontal wind field typically find a transition from approximate to k(- 5 / 3) to approximate to k(- 2. 4) at scales somewhere around 40 km (k is a wave number). In the usual interpretation this represents a transition between an isotropic three-dimensional (3 -D) (k(- 5 / 3)) and an isotropic 2 -D(k(- 3)) turbulence; we have recently argued that the turbulence is so highly anisotropic that it has different exponents in the horizontal and vertical. When coupled with gently <b>sloping</b> <b>isobaric</b> aircraft trajectories this predicts the break as a transition from a roughly horizontal spectrum at small scales to the spurious appearance of the vertical spectrum at large scales. If the atmosphere indeed has wide-range horizontal scaling, then {{it is important to}} test out the multiplicative cascade models that predict its statistical behavior. In this paper, we do this by analyzing wind, temperature, pressure, and humidity data from the Winter Storm 2004 experiment using 24 aircraft legs, each 1120 km long and at 280 m resolution. We analyze both the turbulent fluxes and the fluctuations showing that in spite of the nonflat trajectories, there is good evidence of roughly planetary-scale multiplicative cascades. By carefully determining the scale-by-scale effects of intermittency on the aircraft altitude and measurements, we estimate the corresponding scaling exponents. We argue that our results should finally permit the emergence of a long-needed consensus about the basic scale-by-scale statistical properties of the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the space-time scaling {{properties of the}} European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis products for the wind (u, v, w), humidity (h(s)), temperature (T), and geopotentials (z) and their corresponding turbulent fluxes using the daily 700 mbar products for the year 2006. Following previous studies on T, h(s), and u, we show that that the basic predictions of multiplicative cascade models are well respected over space-time scales below similar to 5000 km, shorter than similar to 5 - 10 days providing precise scale by scale determination of the reanalysis statistical properties (needed for example for stochastic parameterizations in ensemble forecasting systems). We innovate by including the meridional and vertical wind components (v, w) and geopotential (z), and by considering their horizontal anisotropies, their latitudinal variations and, perhaps most importantly, by directly analyzing the fields (not just fluxes). Whereas the fluxes have nearly isotropic exponents in space-time with little latitudinal variation (displaying only scale independent "trivial" anisotropy), the fields have significant scaling horizontal anisotropies. These complicate the interpretation of standard isotropic spectra {{and are likely to}} be artifacts. Many of the new (nonconservation) exponents (H) are nonstandard and currently have no adequate theoretical explanation although the key horizontal wind and temperature H exponents may be consequences of horizontal Kolmogorov scaling, combined with <b>sloping</b> <b>isobaric</b> surfaces. In time the scaling is broken at around 5 - 10 days, i. e., roughly the lifetime of planetary structures; lower frequencies are spectrally flatter: the "spectral plateau," weather-low-frequency weather regime...|$|R
