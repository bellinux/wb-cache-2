Shackleton decided {{to wait a few}} days {{in the hope that the}} ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E
5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she had to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E

After Amira has received money to remain silent about Bart's actions in Dubai, she goes at Chuck's and tells him she will help him find what he is hiding. Meanwhile, Nate goes out for a drink with Sage (Sofia Black-D'Elia), a girl who wants to interview him.

500|$|Following {{the defeat}} on Lake Champlain, Arnold {{accompanied}} Major General Horatio Gates {{as he led}} {{a portion of the}} army at Ticonderoga south to assist General Washington in the defense of New Jersey. [...] On December 7, 1776, a large British force under Lieutenant General Henry Clinton occupied Newport, Rhode Island. [...] In response Washington ordered Arnold to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> England to raise militia and coordinate the defense of Rhode Island. [...] Arnold was made Deputy Commander of the Eastern Department of the Continental Army under Major General Joseph Spencer, and left Washington's camp in Pennsylvania on December 22.|$|E
500|$|Gaga further {{elaborated}} on {{the inspiration}} behind the song as walking towards the light force {{in her life}} and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto {{the source of the}} light. [...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York, confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for her, something she could not escape. Gaga said: [...] "I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am." ...|$|E
500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud as I want, I might as well <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, you called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E

2500|$|Weld {{resigned}} {{the governorship}} on July 29, 1997, to devote his full attention to campaigning for the ambassadorship, even though few {{thought he would}} be successful; there was speculation that he was really resigning because he had become tired of serving as governor. A bipartisan majority of Senators signed letters demanding that Helms advance his nomination, but Helms refused. After an intensive six-week battle, Weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on September 15, 1997. He commented sarcastically, [...] "I asked President Clinton to withdraw my name from the Senate so I can <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> England, where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask it to do its duty." ...|$|E

After winning the role, Budig further {{explained}} {{her interest in}} the part and her early portrayal of the character: [...] "This was a recurring role," [...] she stated. [...] "I didn't {{have to go in}} and test [...] the process proceeded swiftly." [...] Judy [...] told me that Greenlee was a bad girl who comes to Pine Valley and causes trouble. It was the summer; I figured there wasn't going to be anything going on in L.A. [...] why not <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York? Plus, I never get to play the bad girl and delve into the dark side. I'm always playing the good girl. It's been exciting because the role has really come to fruition these past three months. Her dad's a drunk, her mother pays no attention to her, she lives with her grandmother [...] she's pathetically desperate, kind of like me. I'm kidding. I love her name; it's so debutante. I think she's {{going to continue to be}} a spoiler.|$|E
