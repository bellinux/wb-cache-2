40|$|Recently, we have {{demonstrated}} that ultrathin (« 30 nm) films of Al 2 O 3 synthesized by (plasma-assisted) atomic layer deposition (ALD) provide an excellent level of surface passivation of c-Si which may find important applications in (high-efficiency) solar cells. In this contribution, the Al 2 O 3 passivation mechanism has been further elucidated by the contactless characterization of the c-Si/Al 2 O 3 interface by optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). SHG has revealed effective field-effect passivation of the c-Si surface caused by a negative fixed charge density of 5 × 1012 cm- 2 in an annealed, 11 nm thick Al 2 O 3 film while {{it is on the}} order of 1011 cm™ 2 in the as-deposited film which shows negligible passivation.

40|$|Bibliography: leaf [70]The United States' {{electronic}} industry {{continues to}} look for better methods to control processes {{in order to improve}} yields and reduce costs. One area of concern in the thick film portion of the industry is the question of what effect the standard resistor printing and firing variables have on the negative Beta thick film thermistor. This study is an analysis of the effects on resistance and Beta with common variations in <b>firing</b> <b>furnace</b> characteristics. The changes in <b>firing</b> <b>furnace</b> characteristics which would commonly vary during day-to-day operations are the peak temperature and the volume of air flow. In addition, the time at peak temperature and the effects of palladium silver versus gold for use as a terminating conductor were also studied. A total of seven thermistor pastes ranging in value from 1000 ohms to 6000 ohms and from - 350 to - 2600 Beta were studied under the different conditions. The study attempted to control all other possible parameters, such as printed thickness variations, to reasonable, but not perfect, conditions. This permitted the study to take on the appearance of actual production conditions rather than looking like a laboratory experiment. Once samples had been printed under these conditions, sets were processed under the five different furnace variables to be studied. The fired parts were then measured for resistance and Beta was calculated. The results were summarized in tabular form and statistical comparisons were made. The study concluded that most of the pastes tested were relatively unaffected by the realistic changes that occur in furnace peak temperature and air flow on a daily basis. Changes in time at peak temperature, specifically changing from a 30 -minute profile to a 60 -minute profile did not significantly change the Beta but did cause a large increase in resistance which is undesirable. The comparison of palladium silver to gold for termination also showed no significant changes. The study showed that standard furnace parameters and the use of either conductor for termination were acceptable in daily operations without loss of control of the thermistor. M. S.

Thereby, we have examined their optimal composition and thickness with regards to passivation quality, optical properties, and especially the contact formation during a co-firing step. These parameters were addressed in separate investigations: 1) simulation of the optical properties of a bifacial silicon solar cell, 2) measurement of the passivation quality on lifetime samples, 3) measurement of contact resistance (of aerosol printed fingers) to analyze the contact formation during the co-firing process, and 4) differential scanning calorimetry measurement were conducted to fundamentally understand reactions during contact formation in a fast <b>firing</b> <b>furnace.</b> The passivation layers tested were silicon nitride (SiNx), titanium oxide (TiO 2), and silicon oxide (SiO 2) on lowly phosphorus-doped silicon n+-layers, whereas aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) stacks, capped with SiNx and TiO 2, were studied on lowly boron-doped silicon p+-layers. The results show that a dielectric stack, consisting of 10 -nm-thick Al 2 O 3 and 60 -nm-thick SiNx layers on the boron-diffused silicon front side and a single 50 -nm SiNx layer on the phosphorus-diffused silicon rear side, provides low emitter saturation current density (J 0 e), high optical absorption current density, and low contact resistance for printed and co-fired contacts...|$|E

We use AlOX and SiNX dielectric stack as ARC and passivation. The unique point is on the cell's rear side, we use the phosphorous ion implantation to form the Back Surface Field (BSF). Due to the flexible on the implant process, we can choose different implant mask pattern to form the heavy doping region to achieve the selective Back Surface Field(s-BSF) structure. Finally we use the industrial screen printing technique to form the metal contact. The front (boron) side is printed with Ag/Al paste and the rear (phosphorous) side is with two printing steps; at the first step, we use high solid content and firing-through silver paste to form the contact on the heavy doping region, and second, we use the low solid content and non-firing through silver paste to connect all the metal contact formed on the first step.

40|$|AbstractA firing {{study has}} been {{conducted}} {{for a variety of}} samples with different surface morphologies as well as with different bulk and emitter doping concentrations. In this study the firing settings were fixed and the temperature profile on the sample was measured with thermocouples. We have observed that the measured peak temperature on solar-cell R&D samples in an infrared (IR) conveyer belt <b>firing</b> <b>furnace</b> is strongly dependent on the surface morphology of the sample and its doping level. The surface morphology determines the coupling of IR radiation into the substrate. Samples with a random pyramids (RP) surface texture have reached temperatures that were 150 oC higher than that of their polished counterparts. In addition to that, the doping level determines the free carrier absorption (FCA) and thus the heating up due to absorption of IR radiation. We have derived an analytical expression for a Planck-spectrum weighed FCA coefficient that is inversely proportional with the absolute black-body temperature (T) squared. Since the total energy radiated by a black body scales with T 4, the radiation absorption is proportional with T 2. The total doping level of a sample was quantified by Gtot, the summation of the sheet conductance values [Ω- 1 /sq] of the base and emitter region(s). For a sample with a base resistivity of 3 Ωcm and two emitters of 100 Ohm/sq on either side, yielding Gtot= 0. 028 Ω- 1 /sq, the measured peak temperature was found to be 150 oC higher than that of a ‘bare’ (lifetime) sample of 10 Ωcm with Gtot= 0. 0016 Ω- 1 /sq...|$|E
40|$|Fire-resistance testing {{laboratory}} for building products and constructions is a production {{room with a}} substantial excess heat (over 23 W/m). Significant sources of heat inside the aforementioned laboratory are <b>firing</b> <b>furnace,</b> designed to simulate high temperature effects on structures and products of various types in case of fire development. The excess heat production in the laboratory during the tests is due to firing furnaces. The laboratory room is considered as an object consisting of two control volumes (CV), in each of which there may be air intake and air removal, pollutant absorption or emission. In modeling air exchange conditions the following processes are being considered: the processes connected with air movement in the laboratory room: the jet stream in a confined space, distribution of air parameters, air motion and impurity diffusion in the ventilated room. General upward ventilation {{seems to be the}} most rational due to impossibility of using local exhaust ventilation. It is connected with the peculiarities of technological processes in the laboratory. Air jets spouted through large-perforated surface mounted at the height of 2 m from the floor level, "flood" the lower control volume, entrained by natural convective currents from heat sources upward and removed from the upper area. In order {{to take advantage of the}} proposed method of the required air exchange calculation, you must enter additional conditions, taking into account the provision of sanitary-hygienic characteristics of the current at the entrance of the service (work) area. Exhaust air containing pollutants (combustion products), is expelled into the atmosphere by vertical jet discharge.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of silicon solar cells such that the cost/watt could be reduced to a competitive level. In this thesis, three aspects of the front-side of crystalline silicon solar cells have been investigated. Advanced texturing, emitter formation and passivation are detailed in chapters 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Below, each chapter is summarized. In chapter 2, a new technique has been developed that textures the frontside while polishing the rear-side. The technique involves the application of an acrylic adhesive micro-masking layer to a rough, as-cut wafer. Upon removal, remnants of the adhesive layer adhere only to the peaks of the as-cut wafer. The wafer is then subject to a 4 minute 12. 5 wt% heated NaOH etch, where the front-side of the wafer is textured and the rearside of the wafer is polished. The developed technique can lead to savings by: decreasing cycle time (4 min vs. 20 min conventional texturing time), saving consumables (one chemical solution vs. two) and reducing the amount of silicon loss (15 &# 956;m vs. 25 &# 956;m from texturing both sides and then polishing the rear). Equivalent solar cell efficiencies have been achieved when comparing the developed technique to conventional random pyramid textured and in-line polished wafers. Chapter 3 focuses on a novel emitter formation process that has been developed. The process involves the combination of ion implantation, passivation and annealing in a <b>firing</b> <b>furnace.</b> The developed process may enable ion implant technology to have a lower cycle time than conventional diffusion as the anneal is done in a <b>firing</b> <b>furnace</b> (within 90 seconds). Cell results show that implantation-induced damage can be annealed to an extent to reach open circuit voltages above 640 mV. Along with emitter formation, intentional and unintentional emitter alterations have also been investigated. wo processes that cause unintentional emitter etch back have been investigated, the rear emitter removal process as well as surface cleaning processes. Processes that alter the emitter profile necessitate an increase in sheet resistance monitoring. To reduce recombination, the phosphorus profile was altered. While this improved current and open circuit voltage, the use of aggressive screen printing paste shunted shallow junctions and significantly decreased the fill factor. The need for improved contact formation was evident for higher sheet resistance emitters developed in chapter 3, which has been done in chapter 4. In chapter 4, passivation and contacting of emitters developed in chapter 3 were improved with the introduction of thermal oxidation. Thermal oxide has been shown to improve i-PERC solar cell efficiency by 0. 6 - 1. 0 % absolute. There are clear differences between improvements made on the front-side and the rear-side due to thermal oxide, the individual contributions of which are detailed in chapter 4. It has been shown that the gain in efficiency is largely attributed to the front-side. Careful selection of the emitter {{must be taken into account}} when attempting to enhance performance by oxidation. The recombination reduction is caused by the additional phosphorus drive-in and has been assessed separately from passivation enhancement achieved by the silicon oxide. Besides the expected improvement in open circuit voltage (passivation), the fill factor has also shown to improve. The improvement in fill factor is due to a significant (one order of magnitude) reduction in contact resistance in high sheet resistance (> 85 &# 8486;/&# 9633;) emitters. This has been accredited to a large peak of phosphorus in the thermal oxide, which has been confirmed by SIMS and XPS measurements. Contact characterization by means of SEM, EDX, and C-AFM show that the large phosphorus content in the silicon oxide may improve crystallite formation or may form AgPx as detected by EDX. Phosphosilicate glass was used as an alternate method to introduce phosphorus in the passivation layer. Although PSG is not adequate for passivation, it has been shown to be able to enable a contact resistance below 3 mWcm² on a 95 &# 8486;/&# 9633; emitter, which demonstrates the potential of phosphorus incorporation in passivation layers. The reliability and stability of the contacts has been assessed. Extended versions of the IEC 61215 s damp heat and thermal cycling tests have been performed. Phosphorus rich silicon oxide passivated i-PERC cells are shown to be as reliable as conventional screen printed cells. abstract iii samenvatting v acknowledgments vii list of abberviations and symbols xi 1 introduction 1 1. 1 The Problem (Global Warming)............... 1 1. 2 A Solution (PV)....................... 6 1. 3 Thesis Motivation (c-Si PV)................. 8 2 advanced texturing 13 2. 1 Theory............................. 13 2. 1. 1 Motivation...................... 13 2. 1. 2 Pyramid Textured Front-Side and Polished Rear-Side 18 2. 1. 3 Texturing Chemistry................. 21 2. 1. 4 Spectrophotometer Reflectance Measurements... 22 2. 2 State of the Art In Industry................. 23 2. 2. 1 Texturing....................... 25 2. 2. 2 Polishing....................... 26 2. 3 Contribution......................... 27 2. 3. 1 Optimizing random pyramid texturing....... 27 2. 3. 2 Fingerprints...................... 31 2. 3. 3 Texturing and Polishing in One Solution...... 33 2. 4 Conclusion.......................... 43 3 advanced electron collector formation 45 3. 1 “Emitter” vs. “Collector”.................. 45 3. 2 Diffusion Theory....................... 47 3. 2. 1 Diffusivity and Fick’s Laws of Diffusion...... 48 3. 2. 2 Phosphorus Diffusion Using POCl 3........ 52 3. 2. 3 Phosphorus Implantation.............. 54 3. 3 State of the Art In Industry................. 58 3. 3. 1 POCl 3 In Industry.................. 58 3. 3. 2 Industrial Implantation Processes.......... 59 3. 4 Contribution......................... 61 3. 4. 1 Non Intentional Emitter Etch Back......... 61 3. 4. 2 Intentional Emitter Etch Back........... 65 3. 4. 3 POCl 3 Process Parameters............. 69 3. 4. 4 Diffusion Uniformity Improvements......... 72 3. 4. 5 Novel Implantation Process............. 76 3. 5 Conclusion.......................... 88 4 advanced passivation + contact formation 91 4. 1 Theory............................ 91 4. 1. 1 Recombination Basics................ 91 4. 1. 2 The Silicon Surface.................. 95 4. 1. 3 Measuring J 0 n+ by QSSPC............. 97 4. 1. 4 Contact Resistance................. 98 4. 1. 5 Transfer Length Method............... 100 4. 2 State of the Art In Industry................. 102 4. 2. 1 PECVD Silicon Nitride............... 102 4. 2. 2 Contacting Using Screen-Printed Silver...... 104 4. 3 Contribution (Oxidation Enhanced i-PERC)....... 107 4. 3. 1 Initial J 0 n+ and Lifetime Investigation....... 107 4. 3. 2 Varying Oxidation Time.............. 111 4. 3. 3 Pre-Oxidation POCl 3 Re-Optimization...... 117 4. 3. 4 Impact of Oxidation Temperature......... 122 4. 3. 5 Oxidation vs. N 2 anneal............... 127 4. 3. 6 Individual Front/Rear Thermal Oxide Enhancement 132 4. 3. 7 Altering Phosphorus Content in Thermal Oxide. 138 4. 3. 8 Ag Screen Printed Contact Characterization.... 147 4. 3. 9 Contact Stability and Reliability.......... 152 4. 4 Conclusion.......................... 157 5 summary and outlook 159 5. 1 Summary........................... 159 5. 2 Loss Analysis......................... 161 5. 3 Outlook............................ 165 5. 4 Last word........................... 167 appendix (confirmed cell efficiencies) 169 publications 171 bibliography 175 nrpages: 216 status: publishe...|$|E
