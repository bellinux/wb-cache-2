5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

Typically, he passes no definitive judgment on what he has heard. In the case of conflicting or unlikely accounts, he presents both sides, says what he believes and then invites readers to <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> The work of Herodotus is reported to have been recited at festivals, where prizes were awarded, as for example, during the games at Olympia.|$|E

25|$|There is {{disagreement}} among American physicians as {{to whether}} the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Around the world there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of physician assisted death, or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the Hemlock Society of the United States and the Dignity in Dying campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient’s life only if the patient is conscious enough to <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.|$|E
25|$|The main {{theme of}} the Lincoln–Douglas debates was slavery, {{particularly}} the issue of slavery's expansion into the territories. It was Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act that repealed the Missouri Compromise's ban on slavery in the territories of Kansas and Nebraska, {{and replaced it with}} the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which meant that the people of a territory could <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> whether to allow slavery. Lincoln said that popular sovereignty would nationalize and perpetuate slavery. Douglas argued that both Whigs and Democrats believed in popular sovereignty and that the Compromise of 1850 was an example of this. Lincoln said that the national policy was to limit the spread of slavery, and mentioned (both at Jonesboro and later in his Cooper Union Address) the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which banned slavery from {{a large part of the}} modern-day Midwest, as an example of this policy.|$|E
500|$|Although Harrison's pro-slavery {{position}} {{made him}} unpopular with the Indiana Territory's antislavery supporters, {{he used his}} political power to make several attempts to introduce slavery into the territory. His efforts were ultimately unsuccessful due to the territory's growing anti-slavery movement. In 1803, Harrison lobbied Congress to {{vote in favor of}} a petition to suspend Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years, a move that would allow slavery in the Indiana Territory. At the end of the suspension period citizens in the territories covered under the ordinance could <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> whether to permit slavery. Harrison claimed the suspension was necessary to encourage settlement and would make the territory economically viable, but Congress rejected the idea. In 1803 and 1805 Harrison and the ...|$|E

500|$|Symbols {{of death}} proliferate {{throughout}} The Wind Will Carry Us with scenes {{set in a}} graveyard, the imminence of the old woman’s passing, and the ancestors that the character of Farzad mentions in an early scene. Such devices ask the viewer to consider {{the parameters of the}} afterlife and the concept of immaterial existence. [...] In the film’s opening sequence, Behzad tells Farzad that like people, cars have ghosts. This becomes the theme of the work and the subject of the film — they are waiting for the old woman to give up the ghost. The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to the soul after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami stated that his function is that of one who raises questions, rather than answers them. Kiarostami affirms that [...] the audience must <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Gamasutra's Matt Barton, {{some have}} argued that these changes put Morrowind closer in spirit to the {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game, where players take a more creative role in their play, and where players are left to <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> the [...] "right" [...] action. This is a view paralleled by Rolston, who has stated that [...] "The goal of every [...] game is to create something that resembles a pen and paper RPG on the computer." [...] The sheer number of quest possibilities, combined with what developer Ken Rolston identified as a lack of [...] "narrative urgency", left many critics dissatisfied with the main plot. Ken Rolston later stated that the main quest might have been presented with greater force, {{in the style of the}} game's successor, , without losing the free-form design of the series, but such concerns were not addressed prior to Morrowinds release.|$|E
500|$|Aesthetically, {{the world}} of Spira is {{essentially}} unchanged {{in the two years}} since Final Fantasy X, and many locations return from the game. There are, however, major changes in the ideology of Spira's people. After Sin's defeat came the arrival of an era known as [...] "the Eternal Calm". The priests of the Yevon religion chose to expose the truth about the order, leaving the population to <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> how to live in a world without that religion and without Sin. Advanced technology and the Al Bhed are now embraced by the population as a whole, which has begun to pursue leisures such as attending musical concerts and participating in the sport of blitzball. Others have become hunters of ancient treasures, ranging from coins and machinery to spheres in forgotten caves and ruins. Those who pursue the latter are known as [...] "sphere hunters", of which many groups have formed.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team depicted {{reality in}} the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Curé syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as [...] "vague existences", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which [...] "should be fictional" [...] remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die {{at some point during the}} game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> what the answer would be.|$|E
