40|$|The Internet has {{significantly}} changed how libraries provide and library users access information. Libraries increasingly acquire electronic reference (<b>eReference)</b> books while collection of their print counterparts is diminishing. <b>eReference</b> books are not found on libraries' reference shelves and may easily go unnoticed. Libraries face {{the dilemma of}} how to make <b>eReference</b> books more accessible to patrons since they are buried in the catalog. K-State Libraries are addressing this challenge by utilizing enhanced metadata behind OPAC records to create browseable <b>eReference</b> lists. The lists are also published as RSS feeds which can be pushed to users. The article describes an approach that does not require programming skills and may be used by subject librarians and catalogers to make <b>eReference</b> books more accessible to patrons...|$|E
40|$|Providing {{real-time}} <b>eReference</b> {{services is}} a logical choice for information agencies, such as libraries, as these kinds of services have already proven useful to private companies when communicating with customers or offering virtual support. While the <b>eReference</b> concept {{has been around for}} some time now, {{it is only in the}} last couple of years that these services have seen a major boost, due in large part to the expanding number of consortiums springing up (including one between major Kansas universities). The popular choices for offering <b>eReference</b> seem to be products created by library vendors, such as OCLC’s QuestionPoint (now fused to their 24 / 7 Reference service), and they will be referred to as virtual reference (VR) services in this paper. These products, designed with the help of librarians to suit the needs of librarians, should have been a phenomenal success following the current trends of text messaging and Instant Messaging. However, the general consensus is that QuestionPoint, and products like it, are a dismal failure. In total contrast, the use of instant messaging products, such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Yahoo! Instant Messenger (YIM), and MSN, are really beginning to take flight at the reference desk. Many libraries are now making the crossover from VR to IM in order to provide a more user-centered service, and hopefully increase their <b>eReference</b> statistics. Also, many libraries that are looking towards <b>eReference</b> services for the first time are considering IM right from the start. This paper explores the reasons behind the successes and failures of these two approaches to <b>eReference</b> and how IM is becoming more acclimated for reference use. Three libraries that have chosen IM over VR programs are briefly profiled, and finally some suggestions are offered for libraries who are considering IM services...|$|E
40|$|SAGE <b>eReference</b> is {{launching}} in January 2007 and libraries {{will be able}} to acquire it at a substantial discount. In addition, instead of the customary short-term trials, librarians {{will be able to}} select one of three encyclopedias to try out in advance of purchase and be able to keep that title for life! SAGE <b>eReference</b> provides students and researchers online access to all the SAGE Reference titles, presenting a wealth of knowledge right at their fingertips. SAGE <b>eReference</b> includes all 48 best-selling and award-winning SAGE Reference encyclopedias, including such titles as Encyclopedia of Anthropology, Encyclopedia of Disability, and Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics. “SAGE <b>eReference</b> is more than ‘just another database ’ with the typical ‘one-size-fits-all ’ purchasing plan, ” commented Vice President and Publisher Rolf Janke. SAGE worked with librarians to offer SAGE <b>eReference</b> many library-friendly options including: Freedom to choose – Purchase a single title or the entire list—no minimum order, no hidden fees Purchase to own – Once you buy it, you own it forever Unlimited users – Many users can simultaneously access the same encyclopedia No hosting access fees – For the first 5 years For a limited time libraries can purchase the complete catalog of online encyclopedias from SAGE Reference at 40 % off the print price. And, if they’d like to peruse it in advance, librarians {{will be able to get}} a free trial, and lifetime ownership, of one of an online encyclopedia so that they can discover for themselves all the valuable features: Offers access from the library’s browser—no downloads or special readers needed Allows printable pages, copying, pasting, “email this entry, ” and “cite this entry ” options Helps libraries build an encyclopedia collection that doesn’t take up shelf spac...|$|E
40|$|An isogeometric {{continuum}} shell formulation {{is proposed}} in which NURBS basis functions {{are used to}} construct the reference surface of the shell. Through the thickness behavior is also interpolated using an arbitrary higher-order B-spline which {{is in contrast to}} the standard continuum shell (solid-like shell) formulation where a linear Lagrange shape function is typically used in the thickness direction. This yields a complete isogeometric representation of the continuum shell formulation. The proposed shell element is implemented in a standard finite element code using Bezier extraction which facilitates numerical integration on the <b>ereference</b> surface of the shell. Through the thickness integration is done using a connectivity array which determines the support of a B-spline basis function over an element. The formulation has been verified using different linear and geometrically non-linear examples. The ability of the formulation in modelling delamination buckling in composite materials is also demonstrated...|$|E
