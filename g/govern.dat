This article compares the <b>governing</b> of publicly funded primary schools (for 5 – 11 year olds) and secondary schools (for 11 – 18 year olds).

Primary school <b>governing</b> is closer to the school and children, and the images held by governors of the system to be <b>governed</b> are better developed in primary schools.
