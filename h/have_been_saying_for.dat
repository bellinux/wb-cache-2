2500|$|The International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS) {{heavily criticized}} Virgin Galactic {{within hours of}} the accident. Tommaso Sgobba, Executive Director of the IAASS, claimed that Virgin Galactic had refused to let IAASS {{scientists}} review its procedures and snubbed industry gatherings. He stated: [...] "They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand. They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design. They use outdated methods like testing and then seeing what happens. There has been no independent oversight. There is no peer review. I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> some years now this was an accident waiting to happen." [...] Sgobba, the former head of flight safety for the European Space Agency, said on November 6, 2014 that industry best practice called for operators to build in [...] "two-failure tolerance", or sufficient safeguards to survive two separate, unrelated failures—two human errors, two mechanical errors or one of each. [...] "What we see in the incident is what we call 'zero-failure tolerance'," [...] Mr Sgobba said. [...] "So you make the mistake—you have a catastrophe. The design would not be acceptable in other safety-critical industries, such as aircraft manufacture." [...] Other members of IAASS also commented on the accident in the immediate aftermath. Rocket propulsion expert and rocket powered dragster driver Carolynne Campbell-Knight was quoted as saying that Virgin Galactic [...] "...should stop, give up. Go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones. They should stay out of the space business." [...] Campbell-Knight also stated that an explosion of the nitrous oxide hybrid propulsion system was the cause of the accident, although the initial NTSB report did not indicate that the propulsion system contributed to the breakup of the vehicle.|$|E

6000|$|It {{has long}} been {{generally}} recognised {{that there are two}} quite divergent ways of attacking sociological and economic questions, one that is called scientific and one that is not, and I claim no particular virtue in the recognition of that; but I do claim a certain freshness in my analysis of this difference, and it is to that analysis that your attention is now called. When I claim freshness I do not make, you understand, any claim to original discovery. What I have to say, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> some time, is also more or less, and with certain differences {{to be found in the}} thought of Professor Bosanquet, for example, in Alfred Sidgwick's [...] "Use of Words in Reasoning," [...] in Sigwart's [...] "Logic," [...] in contemporary American metaphysical speculation. I am only one incidental voice speaking in a general movement of thought. My trend of thought leads me to deny that sociology is a science, or only a science in the same loose sense that modern history is a science, and to throw doubt upon the value of sociology that follows too closely what is called the scientific method.|$|E

And the lady is one who has nothing to give in return but her hand, and her heart, and herself. The neighbours all round the country <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> the last five years that Harry Gilmore was looking out for an heiress; for it has always been told of Harry, especially among those who have opposed him in politics, that he had a keen eye for the main chance. But Mary Lowther has not, and never can have, a penny with which to make up for any deficiency in her own personal attributes. But Mary is a lady, and Harry Gilmore thinks her the sweetest woman on whom his eye ever rested. Whatever resolutions as to fortune-hunting he may have made,--though probably none were ever made,--they have all now gone to the winds. He is so absolutely in love that nothing in the world is, to him, at present worth thinking about except Mary Lowther. I do not doubt that he would vote for a conservative candidate if Mary Lowther so ordered him; or consent to go and live in New York if Mary Lowther would accept him on no other condition. All Bullhampton parish is nothing to him at the present moment, except as far as it is connected with Mary Lowther. Hampton Privets is dear to him only as far as it can be made to look attractive in the eyes of Mary Lowther. The mill is to be repaired, though he knows he will never get any interest on the outlay, because Mary Lowther has said that Bullhampton water-meads would be destroyed if the mill were to tumble down. He has drawn for himself mental pictures of Mary Lowther till he has invested her with every charm and grace and virtue that can adorn a woman. In very truth he believes her to be perfect. He is actually and absolutely in love. Mary Lowther has hitherto neither accepted nor rejected him. In a very few lines further on we will tell how the matter stands between them.|$|E

5000|$|The Ogiek {{tribes of}} the Mau Forest are also targets of land {{restrictions}} and evacuations from their native lands. The Ogiek tribe {{has been described}} as a peaceful group of people who specialize in cultivating honeybees, but will grow beans and potatoes if needed. The Ogiek subsist on animals that are only in abundance in the forest. Once the tribe notices a decline in population of a particular animal due to hunting, the Ogiek will practice [...] "self-imposed conservation" [...] by raising sheep and goats for food. The animals that are killed are for their use only and the Ogiek do not participate in the bush meat market. They are regarded as [...] "the best imaginable conservators of land". The first attempt to displace the Ogiek people was as early as the 1900s, when British settlers attempted to clear out the forest areas for tea plantations. Through the Forest Act of 1957 and the Wildlife Conservation Act of 1977, governments have continuously displaced the Ogiek for forest conservation and they were often moved to lands that were unfertile and useless to their customary lifestyle of bee production and animal hunting. This displacement caused many of the Ogiek to be homeless, in poverty, and suffered from sicknesses and their life expectancy declined from sixty to forty-six years. In June 2005, it was issued to stop the evictions through High Court order, but was later appealed five months later. During the case, it was emphasized that the Ogiek were not fit to inhabit the Mau Forest, yet the courts failed to mention the destruction that was taking place due to illegal, massive logging operations. Presently, ecologists and hydrologists are now giving credit to what the Ogiek <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> years; that Kenya forests are the main suppliers of water for the nation and if not preserved, will result is massive starvations and death. Already Kenya's forests have started to decline.|$|E

WHEN Australia’s federal education minister Christopher Pyne claimed that independent public schools are always better than those run by public authorities, he was only repeating what successive education secretaries in Britain <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> years. His plan {{to spend a lot}} of public money enticing public schools to become independent, while light on detail, has been British government policy since 2000, when Tony Blair’s education secretary David Blunkett introduced privately run academies. The momentum was briefly lost during Gordon Brown’s prime ministership because Brown and his education secretary Ed Balls were not wholly convinced that private is always better, though they dared not speak the heresy in public. But since David Cameron’s Conservative-dominated coalition government took office in 2010, the education secretary has been Michael Gove, for whom it is an article of faith that the best schools are private schools.

30|$|Certainly the {{granting}} and funding and tenure cultures need to enforce good behavior, which people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> years. NIH now mandates that provisions for data sharing {{be included in}} research applications for $ 500, 000 or more of direct costs in any single year and several other agencies have similar provisions.

The two-page data management plan submitted as part of the application may include ‘policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives’ and ‘plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them.’ Although the NSF-wide mandate takes precedence, there are variations within the directorates [59]. For example, the NSF Division of Earth Sciences allows up to 2 years of exclusive data use for selected principal investigators. The directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences allows for the possibility of ethical and legal restrictions regarding access to non-aggregated data.|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I will be reviewing a few much-cited theories {{from the}} fields of psychology and neurobiology concerning the building of autobiographical memories, {{of a sense of}} self and of narrative identity. I will then compare some of these theories and findings to what literary theorists <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> years about the matter of fiction vs. non-fiction in the genre of autobiography. Philippe Lejeune's idea that autobiography is in essence a contractual genre will be central to my conclusion. I recognize the importance of his well-known "autobiographical pact", and I suggest that there is yet another pact involved in the reading and writing of autobiographical narratives; what I would like to call the "neurobiological pact". Using Brazilian author Graciliano Ramos' autobiography Infância ("Childhood") as an example, I will try to show how the narrative found in autobiographies relate to what is know about the narrative constructions we all make in order to form a coherent life story and maintain a unified sense of self. Steering my argumentation is the idea that autobiography does not "feel to the reader precisely like fiction" and that the critical pushing of autobiography into the realm of fiction does not agree with the fundamental human experience of self and identity...|$|E
