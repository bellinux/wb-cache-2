5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered {{brothers and sisters and}} are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan <b>endogamy</b> even it is present is of no value. Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to villages that are three to five miles away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endogamy,</b> {{restrictions}} on marrying a person outside caste, {{but in some}} situations hypergamy allowed. Far less rigidity on inter-marriage between different sub-castes than between members of different castes in some regions, while in some <b>endogamy</b> within a sub-caste was the principal feature of caste-society.|$|E
25|$|Racial <b>endogamy</b> is {{significantly}} stronger among recent immigrants. This result holds for all racial groups, with the strongest <b>endogamy</b> found among immigrants of African descent. Interestingly, {{the gender differences}} in interracial marriage change significantly when the non-white partner is an immigrant. For instance, female immigrants of African descent {{are more likely to}} marry U.S.-born Caucasians than are their male counterparts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endogamy</b> {{is practiced}} by Hui, who mainly marry among {{themselves}} {{rather than with}} Muslims from other sects.|$|E
25|$|Póvoa de Varzim is an ethno-cultural entity. Until the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the communities of Póvoa de Varzim were marked by <b>endogamy,</b> exclusiveness and local identity features with several centuries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endogamy</b> {{is common}} in Islamic countries. The {{observed}} <b>endogamy</b> is primarily consanguineous marriages, where the bride and the groom share a biological grandparent or other near ancestor. The most common observed marriages are first cousin marriages, followed by second cousin marriages. Consanguineous endogamous marriages are most common for women in Muslim communities in the Middle East, North Africa and Islamic Central Asia. About 1 in 3 of all marriages in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan are first cousin marriages; while overall consanguineous endogamous marriages exceed 65 to 80% in various Islamic populations of the Middle East, North Africa and Islamic Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|The Urapmin {{practice}} <b>endogamy.</b> Since the Urapmin {{community is}} quite small, numbering in the hundreds, and Urapmin do not marry first cousins, {{the result is}} that most Urapmin are related to each other relatively directly.|$|E
25|$|Caste {{system has}} been {{observed}} among Muslims in India. They practice <b>endogamy,</b> hypergamy, hereditary occupations, avoid social mixing and have been stratified. There is some controversy if these characteristics make them social groups or castes of Islam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endogamy</b> is {{very common}} in Muslims {{in the form of}} {{arranged}} consanguineous marriages among Muslims in India and Pakistan. Malik states that the lack of religious sanction makes qaum a quasi-caste, and something that is found in Islam outside South Asia.|$|E
25|$|Kalang {{people were}} also noted for <b>endogamy.</b> Many marriages were between cousins, {{including}} first cousins, occurred in Kalang society. Sometimes the Kalang People in Tegalgendu exchanged marriage partners with other Kalang groups living in similar ghetto-like settlements in various places of Central and East Java.|$|E
25|$|Caste {{system in}} Jainism {{has existed for}} centuries, {{primarily}} in terms of <b>endogamy,</b> although, per Paul Dundas, in modern times the system does not play a significant role. This is contradicted by Carrithers and Humphreys who describe the major Jain castes in Rajasthan with their social rank.|$|E
25|$|Peter Masefield, in {{his review}} of caste {{situation}} in India states that anyone could in principle perform any profession. The texts state that the Brahmin took food from anyone, suggesting that strictures of commensality were as yet unknown. The Nikaya texts also imply that <b>endogamy</b> was not mandated.|$|E
25|$|There are {{instances}} {{of health problems}} attributed to <b>endogamy,</b> including glaucoma. In addition, {{there is a very}} high (42%) incidence of asthma among the population and research by Dr. Noe Zamel of the University of Toronto has led to discoveries about the genetic nature of the disease. Three of the original settlers of the island were asthma sufferers.|$|E
25|$|Today, most biologists, anthropologists, and sociologists {{reject a}} {{taxonomy}} of races {{in favor of}} more specific and/or empirically verifiable criteria, such as geography, ethnicity or a history of <b>endogamy.</b> To date, there is little evidence in human genome research which indicates that race can be defined {{in such a way as}} to be useful in determining a genetic classification of humans.|$|E
25|$|In the Torah's {{account of}} the rape of Dinah, wherein Dinah was raped (or in some versions, merely seduced) by a Canaanite named Shechem. Simeon and his brother Levi took violent revenge against the {{inhabitants}} of the city by tricking them into circumcising themselves and then killing them when they are weakened. The account dramatizes the theme of tension between marriage within a group (<b>endogamy)</b> and marriage with outsiders (exogamy).|$|E
25|$|The Urapmin used to ally {{with the}} Telefolmin in war against other Min peoples, {{practicing}} cannibalism against the enemy dead, but warfare ceased by the 1960s {{with the arrival}} of colonialism. A Christian revival in the 1970s led to the near-wholesale abandonment of traditional beliefs and the adoption of a form of Charismatic Christianity originally derived from Baptist Christianity. The Urapmin vigorously use their native Urap language, and their small community maintains the practice of <b>endogamy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{during the}} period of Ottoman Empire, Alevis were {{forbidden}} to proselytise, and Alevism regenerated itself internally by paternal descent. To prevent penetration by hostile outsiders, the Alevis insisted on strict <b>endogamy</b> which eventually made them into a quasi-ethnic group. Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre. Excommunication was the ultimate punishment threatening those who married outsiders, cooperated with outsiders economically, or ate with outsiders. It was also forbidden to use the state (Sunni) courts.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{practices}} of group <b>endogamy,</b> allele frequencies cluster locally around kin groups and lineages, or by national, ethnic, cultural and linguistic boundaries, giving a detailed {{degree of correlation}} between genetic clusters and population groups when considering many alleles simultaneously. Despite this, there are no genetic boundaries around local populations that biologically mark off any discrete groups of humans. Human variation is continuous, with no clear points of demarcation. There are no large clusters of relatively homogeneous people and almost every individual has genetic alleles from several ancestral groups.|$|E
25|$|Ashkenazi men show low Y-DNA {{diversity}} within each major haplogroup, meaning that {{compared to the}} size of the modern population, it seems there were once a relatively small number of men having children. This possibly results from a series of founder events and high rates of <b>endogamy</b> within Europe. Despite Ashkenazi Jews representing a recently founded population in Europe, founding effects suggest that they probably derived from a large and diverse ancestral source population in the Middle East, who may have been larger than the source population from which the indigenous Europeans derived.|$|E
25|$|In Bengal, some Muslims {{refer to}} the social {{stratification}} within their society as qaum (or Quoms), a term that is found among Muslims elsewhere in India, {{as well as in}} Pakistan and Afghanistan. Qaums have patrilineal hereditary, with ranked occupations and <b>endogamy.</b> Membership in a qaum is inherited by birth. Barth identifies the origin of the stratification from the historical segregation between pak (pure) and paleed (impure) - - defined by the family's social or religious status, occupation and involvement in sexual crimes. Originally, Paleed/Paleet qaum included people running or working at brothels, prostitution service providers or professional courtesan/dancers (Tawaif) and musicians. There is history of skin color defining Pak/Paleed, but that does not have historical roots, and was adopted by outsiders using analogy from Hindu Caste system.|$|E
25|$|The Sikh {{literature}} from the Islamic rule and British colonial era mention Varna as Varan, and Jati as Zat or Zat-biradari. Eleanor Nesbitt, {{a professor of}} Religion and author of books on Sikhism, states that the Varan {{is described as a}} class system, while Zat has some caste system features in Sikh literature. In theory, Nesbitt states Sikh literature does not recognise caste hierarchy or differences. In practice, states Nesbitt, widespread <b>endogamy</b> practice among Sikhs has been prevalent in modern times, and poorer Sikhs of disadvantaged castes continue to gather in their own places of worship. Most Sikh families, writes Nesbitt, continue to check the caste of any prospective marriage partner for their children. She notes that all Gurus of Sikhs married within their Zat, and they did not condemn or break with the convention of endogamous marriages for their own children or Sikhs in general.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Uyghurs {{comprised}} 45% of Xinjiang's population, {{but only}} 13% of Ürümqi's population. Despite having 9% of Xinjiang's population, Ürümqi accounts for 25% of the region's GDP, and many rural Uyghurs have been migrating to that city to seek {{work in the}} dominant light, heavy, and petrochemical industries. Hans in Xinjiang are demographically older, better-educated, and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur cohabitants. Hans {{are more likely to}} cite business reasons for moving to Ürümqi, while some Uyghurs also cite trouble with the law back home and family reasons for their moving to Ürümqi. Hans and Uyghurs are equally represented in Ürümqi's floating population that works mostly in commerce. Self-segregation within the city is widespread, in terms of residential concentration, employment relationships, and a social norm of <b>endogamy.</b> In 2010, Uyghurs constituted a majority in the Tarim Basin, and a mere plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.|$|E
25|$|The lower Himalayan foothills and Inner Terai or Doon Valleys of Nepal and India {{are highly}} malarial {{due to a}} warm climate and marshes {{sustained}} {{during the dry season}} by groundwater percolating down from the higher hills. Malarial forests were intentionally maintained by the rulers of Nepal as a defensive measure. Humans attempting to live in this zone suffered much higher mortality than at higher elevations or below on the drier Gangetic Plain. However, the Tharu people had lived in this zone long enough to evolve resistance via multiple genes. Medical studies among the Tharu and non-Tharu population of the Terai yielded the evidence that the prevalence of cases of residual malaria is nearly seven times lower among Tharus. The basis for resistance has been established to be homozygosity of α-Thalassemia gene within the local population. <b>Endogamy</b> along caste and ethnic lines appear to have prevented these genes from being more widespread in neighboring populations.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, with no endemic malaria, the {{prevalence}} of sickle-cell anaemia among African Americans is lower (about 0.25%) than in West Africa (about 4.0%) and is falling. Without endemic malaria, the sickle-cell mutation is purely disadvantageous and tends to decline in the affected population by natural selection, and now artificially through prenatal genetic screening. However, the African American community descends from a significant admixture of several African and non-African ethnic groups and also represents the descendants of survivors of slavery and the slave trade. Thus, a lower degree of <b>endogamy</b> and, particularly, abnormally high health-selective pressure through slavery {{may be the most}} plausible explanations for the lower prevalence of sickle-cell anaemia (and, possibly, other genetic diseases) among African Americans compared to West Africans. Another factor that limits the spread of sickle-cell genes in North America is the absence of cultural proclivities to polygamy, which allows affected males to continue to seek unaffected children with multiple partners.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese {{immigration}} into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries {{was marked}} by its concentration in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The immigrants opted mostly for urban centers. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country. However, even among the more recent influx of Portuguese immigrants {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, there were 319 men to each 100 women among them. The Portuguese were different from other immigrants in Brazil, like the Germans, or Italians who brought many women along with them (even though the proportion of men was higher in any immigrant community). Despite the small female proportion, Portuguese men married mainly Portuguese women. Female immigrants rarely married Brazilian men. In this context, the Portuguese had a rate of <b>endogamy</b> which was higher than any other European immigrant community, and behind only the Japanese among all immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Sephardic Bnei Anusim are the {{descendants}} of Sephardi Jewish nominal converts (conversos) to Catholicism who immigrated to the New World escaping the Spanish Inquisition in Spain and Portugal. Following {{the establishment of the}} Inquisition in the Iberian colonies, again they hid their ancestry and beliefs. Their numbers are difficult to ascertain as most are at least nominally Catholic, having been converted by force or coercion, or married into the religion. Collectively, people of Sephardic Bnei Anusim Jewish descent in Latin America is in the millions. Most would be of mixed ancestry, although a few claim some communities may have been able to maintain a degree of <b>endogamy</b> (marrying only other Crypto-Jews) throughout the centuries. They may or may not consider themselves Jewish, some may continue to preserve some of their Jewish heritage in secrecy, many others may not even be aware of it. The majority would not be halakhically Jewish, but small numbers of various communities have formally returned to Judaism over the past decade, legitimizing their status as Jews. See also Anusim.|$|E
25|$|The {{community}} name Ghatole {{is derived}} from Ghat meaning a hilly range. The community belongs mainly to {{the western part of}} the Vidhabha region of Maharashtra. Oral tradition speaks of their arrival from the Sahyadris in Panchimhat. In Vidharbha, they live mostly in the Aurangabad, Nashik, Buldhana, Amravati, Yavatmal, Parbhani and Akola districts. The Ghatole claim to be the same as the economically and numerically superior Tirole or Tilole. Per their oral tradition, those families which interrupted their migration march from the Ghats became the Ghatole whereas those who continued their journey eastwards became the Tirole Kunbi. Despite the oral tradition, the two communities are now two distinct communities due to geographical barriers the strict practice of <b>endogamy.</b> All women and most men are vegetarian though some are occasionally non-vegetarians who keep their utensils separate and cook outside of the family kitchen. Marriages are generally arranged and families are extended rather than nuclear. Locations of pilgrimage are Nasik, Shirdi, Tuljapur and Pandharpur. According to a report in 2009, the Ghatole Kunbi community in the Akola and Washim areas of Vidharbha prefer the Shivsena political party.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between related languages and dialects is notoriously vague in Mesoamerica. The dominant Mesoamerican socio-cultural pattern through millennia has been {{centered around the}} town or city as the highest level community rather than the nation, realm or people. This has meant that within Mesoamerica each city-state or town community, called in Nahuatl an altepetl, has had its own language standard which, in the typical case, has evolved separately from closely related but geographically remote languages. Even geographically close communities with closely related, mutually intelligible languages have not necessarily seen themselves as being ethnically related, or their language as being a unifying factor between them. The relative <b>endogamy</b> of the town community has also resulted in a large linguistic diversification between communities despite geographical and linguistic proximity, often resulting in a low intelligibility between varieties of the same language spoken in adjacent communities. The exception to this rule is when a common “lingua franca” has evolved to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups. This {{has been the case}} for Classical Nahuatl and Classical Maya, both of which, at different times in history, have been used as a common language between different ethnic groups. Further complicating matters are the semi-nomadic lifestyle of many Mesoamerican peoples, and political systems which often have used relocation of entire communities as a political tool. Dialect or variant “chaining” is common, where any adjacent two or three towns in a sequence are similar enough in speech to understand each other fairly well, but those separated more widely have trouble understanding each other, and there are no clear breaks naturally separating the continuum into coherent sub-regions.|$|E
500|$|According to Trautmann, Risley {{believed}} that ethnologists {{could benefit from}} undertaking fieldwork. He quotes Risley saying of ethnologists in India that they had relied too much: [...] Risley also viewed India as an ethnological laboratory, where the continued practice of <b>endogamy</b> had ensured that, in his opinion, there were strict delineations of the various communities by caste and that consequently caste {{could be viewed as}} identical to race. Whereas others, such as Ibbetson, considered caste to be best defined as based on occupation, he {{believed that}} changes in occupation within a community led to another instance of <b>endogamy</b> [...] "being held by a sort of unconscious fiction to be equivalent to the difference of race, which is the true basis of the system." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrianampoinimerina's Zafimamy {{ancestors}} practiced <b>endogamy</b> {{and therefore}} rarely {{mixed with the}} descendants of the legendary first inhabitants of Madagascar, the Vazimba. However, Ramboasalamarazaka had partial Vazimba ancestry on his mother's side through her antecedent, King Andriamanelo (1540–1575), son of Vazimba Queen Rafohy (1530–1540) and her Merina husband Manelo. [...] He was born during {{the first quarter of the}} moon (tsinambolana) of the month Alahamady, the sign of a highly auspicious birth according to popular belief. [...] Following the Merina customs of the time, his parents gave him the humble name Ramboasalama (Ra-amboa-salama, [...] "The healthy dog") to protect him from attracting the undesirable attention of jealous rivals or evil spirits, before being changed in childhood to Ramboasalamarazaka.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{practice}} of <b>endogamy</b> and the caste system, Póvoa's fishing community maintained local ethnic characteristics. Anthropological and cultural data indicate Nordic fishermen settling during the period of the coast's resettlement. In As Praias de Portugal (Beaches of Portugal, 1876), Ramalho ortigão wrote that the Povoan fishermen were a [...] "race" [...] in the Portuguese coast; entirely different from the Mediterranean type of Ovar and Olhão, Poveiro is of [...] "Saxon" [...] type. On the other hand, the man from the interior was a farmer with Galician character (Paleo and Nordid-Atlantid). In a 1908 research, anthropologist Fonseca Cardoso considered that Poveiros were the result of a mixture of Phoenicians, Teutons, Jews and, mostly, Normans. In the book The Races of Europe (1938), Poveiros were distinguished by having a greater than usual degree of blondism, broad faces of unknown origin, and broad jaws.|$|E
500|$|When Seligman {{inquired about}} the Waruge {{divisions}} of the Vedar, most of them did not remember their clan origins. Of those who remembered, most self-identified as Ura Waruge. Others mentioned clans such as Ogatam, Kavatam, Umatam, Aembalaneduwe and Aembale. They also had memories of other clans such as Morana and Unapana. [...] By the 1980s the Vedar {{had no knowledge of}} any word Waruge, although they vaguely used the Tamil term Vamisam (family origin) to indicate some division amongst them. Some had come up with a two-fold division of the Vedars based on the Kuti or matrilineal descent system popular in the East coast. These Kutis were supposed to have descended from former local chiefs called Vanniyar, who had ruled feudal divisions called Vannimai. But these clan divisions and related rules of <b>endogamy</b> were not totally followed by all Vedar, and there no practical prohibitions from marrying from each Kuti.|$|E
500|$|A {{generation}} {{younger than}} Ibrăileanu, George Călinescu also noted {{the contrast between}} Mihail Kogălniceanu and his predecessors, as two sets of [...] "Messianist" [...] intellectuals—in this contrast, Heliade Rădulescu was [...] "hazy and egotistic", whereas Kogălniceanu and others had [...] "a mission which {{they knew how to}} translate into positive terms". As a historian, Kogălniceanu notably introduced several more or less influential Romantic nationalist theses: after 1840, he was noted for stressing the image of the 17th-century Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave as a unifier of Romania, although this view had not been at all present in his earlier essays; he proposed that the Romanian folk was among the first European peoples to record history in their national language, although the earliest Romanian-language chronicles date back to the 17th century; additionally, he argued that the Second Bulgarian Empire was a Romanian state. In some of his works, he claimed that Romanians traditionally practiced <b>endogamy</b> to preserve their purity. His 1837 study of the Romani people (Esquisse sur l'histoire, les moeurs et la langue des Cigains, or [...] "Sketch of the History, Mores and Language of the Cigains") is however still seen as a groundbreaking work in its field. According to historian Viorel Achim, while it [...] "does not reach the standards of scientific research", the book is still [...] "a genuine contribution" [...] to [...] "Romology", and [...] "a work of reference".|$|E
