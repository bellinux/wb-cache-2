40|$|We {{explore the}} role of {{monetary}} policy {{in the aftermath of}} a financial crisis. We develop a small open economy model with limited participation of households in a financial intermediary that provides liquidity to satisfy firms' working capital needs. Firms require two forms of working capital: domestic funds to pay for the wage bill and foreign funds to finance imports of intermediate goods. A shortage of either one of the sources of working capital acts as a drag on economic activity. In normal times, an interest rate cut is expansionary. In a financial crisis, collateral constraints bind and an <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>liquidity</b> leads to a real exchange rate depreciation that further tightens the collateral constraint and offsets the traditional (expansionary) liquidity channel. In addition, the tightening of the collateral constraint places a premium on paying off foreign debt, reinforcing the contractionary effects of an interest rate cut. We study the conditions under which such monetary policy action is contractionary and relate them to recent emerging market crises. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of the international monetary}} System prompted the nine members of the E. E. C. to establish a European Monetary System. The new statutes of the I. M.

Further, the increasing importance of the international capital markets fosters the unlimited <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> international <b>liquidities.</b> it is in response to this context then that Europe seeks to create a zone of stability and to manage its own international tender in accordance with rules that it has set for itself. The author draws a positive conclusion as the System has operated without major problems so far. Nevertheless, difficulties remain: the international environment has not improved given the abrupt strengthening of the dollar and the increase in American interest rates. In addition, progress with regard to cooperation among the Nine remains slow and political change in France makes any prognosis respecting the future of the European Monetary System difficult. It was anticipated that the System would be Consolidated rapidly. It would in that event contribute more effectively to the stability of the international monetary System.

40|$|Recently {{a number}} of {{emerging}} economies, with high inflation and various kinds of imbalances have experienced {{what has come to}} be referred to as dollarization - the phenomenon of currency substitution where the dollar gradually replaces the national currency in the performance of its fundamental functions. The phenomenon is most commonly encountered as a component of the exchange-rate-based stabilization programs implemented in {{a number of}} emerging economies in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. The fundamental issue we want to explore is whether this process forces the monetary authorities of emerging economies to act with their hands tied, as if caught in a trap. It is argued that when the <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and domestic credit is determined by the quantity of foreign-exchange reserves, an independent monetary policy vanishes and national sovereignty itself is shackled. Since this scenario typically occurs in a world of increasing globalization of finance, this paper also discusses (with reference to emerging economies) the risks and implications of capital inflows for macroeconomic policy autonomy, economic instability, and vulnerability to external shocks.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of EconomicsWilliam F. BlankenauThe {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} the summer of 2007 has greatly tested the abilities of central banks to counter financial instability and economic slowdown through traditional monetary policy. This paper will examine in detail the monetary response of both the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States (Fed) and the Bank of England to the turmoil in the financial markets. The Bank of England, which adopted inflation targeting after the Black Wednesday crisis in 1992, and the Fed, which has no such stated policy, allows us to compare two different monetary regimes {{in the aftermath of a}} crisis. To counter the {{financial crisis}} the Bank of England resorted to unconventional monetary policies that included <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> easing operations and a policy of quantitative easing through purchase of debt securities. The Fed also made use of both traditional tools as well as more innovative measures to combat liquidity concerns in the financial market. A multitude of new programs was initiated by the Fed to supply liquidity to susceptible lending institutions and lower the spreads on commercial loans and securities. Overall, we find that the actions of the Bank of England and the Fed were effective in restoring stability to financial markets and preventing a prolonged economic depression. Further, the Bank of England's inflation targeting framework did not hinder its ability to respond to the crisis and there was no major divergence in the policy actions of the two central banks...|$|E

Drawing on public finance theory, financial markets microstructure research, and perspectives on corporate governance, Professor Rudnick proposes a profits tax on the liquid equity of firms.

The value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> in different capital markets is the crucial determinate. Under traditional tax policy criteria of horizontal and vertical equity and efficiency, this approach correctly classifies those firms that can normatively be included in a double tax system after an interest return on equity is deducted.

Our measure <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is based on Amihud (2002) and its volatility is measured using daily data. Furthermore, we document that total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is priced in the presence <b>of</b> systematic <b>liquidity</b> risk: the covariance of stock returns with aggregate <b>liquidity,</b> the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with aggregate liquidity, and the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with the market return. The separate pricing of total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> indicates that idiosyncratic liquidity risk is important in the cross section of returns. This result is puzzling in light of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) who develop a model in which only systematic liquidity risk affects returns. The positive correlation between the volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns suggests that risk averse investors require a risk premium for holding stocks that have high variation in liquidity. Higher variation in liquidity implies that a stock may become illiquid with higher probability {{at a time when it}} is traded.

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the {{internal}} factors which have potential infl uence on the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> the Slovenian banking sector. Unlike other studies, this paper uses multiple dependent variables, encompassing different views on liquidity and leading to higher complexity. These include the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> its outfl ow, net change and total reallocation, determined {{on the basis of}} a specifi c method <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> measurement – the gross liquidity fl ows. The chosen independent variables include various items of internal character such as loans, deposits, profi t, capital and the size of the bank. Robust regression analyses are performed. The results indicate that internal factors have the greatest infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> where almost all the variables considered were signifi cant. Used factors do not only affect liquidity creation, often investigated by authors, but affect other dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> as well. A signifi cant item which played a role in multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> was the value of loans and the size of the bank (total assets). The models have shown that any given factor only has an infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> without infl uencing its outfl ow and vice versa. Thus, when looking for determinants only for the creation or only for the outfl ow <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the results need not necessarily comprehensively show the infl uence of the given factors, and can lead to erroneous conclusions.
