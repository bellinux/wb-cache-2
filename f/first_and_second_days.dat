25|$|He umpired four Test matches between 1992 and 1994, all {{played in}} Zimbabwe. He made his debut as a Test umpire in Zimbabwe's inaugural Test, the single Test against India in Harare in October 1992. Kanjee also {{stood in the}} two {{back-to-back}} Tests against New Zealand the following month. An experimental umpiring system was used in these three Tests, in which Dickie Bird umpired from one end, and Kanjee shared the umpiring duties at the other end, swapping each day with a second senior Zimbabwean umpire, Ian Robinson. In another experiment, the 2nd Test against New Zealand {{was interrupted by a}} One-day International held on 8 November 1992, between the <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>days</b> of the Test. These experiments were not a success and were not repeated. Kanjee was included in the ICC's first original panel of International Panel of Umpires and Referees in 1994, and umpired his last Test in October 1994, the 3rd Test between Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in Harare.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera {{decided to}} portray her {{different}} image and persona from her previous stage name Xtina by adopting a new alter ego called Baby Jane, {{named after a}} character of the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. She also changed her public appearance as she removed her piercings, and dyed her hair platinum blonde, inspired by classic Hollywood movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard and Greta Garbo. The album's photography was taken by German photographer Ellen von Unwerth during three days; on the <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>days,</b> the photos were shot at the Hollywood Dell hotel. Aguilera and von Unwerth moved to Forty Deuce in Hollywood to take images inspired by 1920s burlesque clubs {{on the last day}} of the session. The album's cover artwork was revealed in late-June 2006, featuring Aguilera with bright red lipstick and curly blonde hair dressed in white and lounging on a bed. Greg Kot from The Baltimore Sun labelled the cover as [...] "a classy retro look, a sign that [...] is ready for her close-up as the leading lady of the teen brat pack that emerged in the late '90s".|$|E
2500|$|The fifth match earned notoriety. It was {{scheduled}} to be played at Lord's from 23 to 25 July 1821 but ended on the second day after the Gentlemen conceded. Known as the [...] "Coronation Match" [...] because it celebrated the accession of the unpopular George IV it was described by Derek Birley as [...] "a suitably murky affair". The Gentlemen had batted first and were quickly dismissed for 60. Then they had to spend {{a long time in the}} field through most of the <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>days</b> while the Players steadily built a big lead.

2500|$|The Russian {{government}} {{announced that it}} would not use force to rescue the hostages, and negotiations towards a peaceful resolution took place on the <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>days,</b> at first led by Leonid Roshal, a paediatrician whom the hostage-takers had reportedly asked for by name (Roshal had helped negotiate the release of children in the 2002 Moscow siege, but also had given advice to the Russian security services as they prepared to storm the theatre, for which he received the Hero of Russia award). However, a witness statement in the court indicated that the Russian negotiators confused Roshal with Vladimir Rushailo, a Russian security official. According to Savelyev's report, the official ("civilian") headquarters was looking for a peaceful resolution of the situation at the same time when the secret ("heavy") headquarters set up by the FSB was preparing the assault. Savelyev wrote that in many ways the [...] "heavies" [...] restricted the actions of the [...] "civilians", in particular in their attempts to negotiate with the militants.|$|E
