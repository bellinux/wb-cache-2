The work {{presented}} extends {{and contributes}} to research in earthing and lightning protection and focuses on the transient behaviour of a <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> earth electrode. Although previous {{work in this area}} has produced practical guidelines and models that may be used for lightning protection system design and analysis purposes, there has not been an investigation into the commonly encountered scenario of multiple layers of di erent soil types, particularly where high current densities cause ionisation to occur in the surrounding soil. In the research presented, the behaviour of a practical <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> earth electrode subjected to peak impulse currents of up to 30 KA is analysed. Measurements obtained using a large-scale experiment arrangement are compared against results obtained using a time-domain circuit model simulation. It is shown that a single apparent resistivity value calculated from the steady state resistance equation and the measured steady state resistance {{can be used as a}} simpli cation for modelling the lightning current transient behaviour of a <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> earth electrode in multi-layer soil.

50|$|These {{locomotives}} were articulated, {{with one}} large traction motor {{on each of}} the two bogies at each end. The jackshaft was thus placed above and between the driving wheels. To maximise the length of its <b>drive</b> <b>rod</b> and reduce its angulation, this was connected near to the furthest driven axle. The coupling rod between those axles was 'triangular', with an additional bearing mounted on its top edge, taking the thrust of the jackshaft <b>drive</b> <b>rod.</b> Unlike most connecting rods, this allows it to be mounted in the same plane as the coupling rod bearings. This reduces the overhung lengths of the crankpins and their bending loads.|$|E
50|$|The long {{horizontal}} slats {{are held}} one above {{the other by}} the rungs of ladder cords shaped like a ladder. The lower ends of {{the legs of the}} ladder cords are secured to the long rail under the slats. Their upper ends are attached to the <b>drive</b> <b>rod</b> in the housing, the elongated box above the slats. As the <b>drive</b> <b>rod</b> rotates, one leg of each ladder cord moves up while the other moves down, causing the angle of the slats to change. In one design, this rotation is achieved by pushing up or pulling down on a long handle called a tilt wand connected to the <b>drive</b> <b>rod</b> by a lever. Lift cords along the ladder cords are also attached to the rail. They pass through holes in the slats and into the housing above, where they go over pulleys, combine and exit through the cord lock. For safety it's important that the lock always works. A downward pull on the main lift cord raises the slats by the cords pulling up the rail below the slats. The cord lock holds the main lift cord to keep the slats up until the cord is pulled to release the lock. The safety lock made the cord lock easier to use.|$|E

40|$|Two new four-element {{fast wave}} current drive antennas have been {{installed}} on DIII-D. These antennas {{are designed for}} 10 -s pulses at 2 MW each in the frequency range of 30 to 120 MHz. Each element comprises two poloidal segments fed in parallel in order to optimize plasma coupling at {{the upper end of}} the frequency range. The antennas are mounted on opposite sides of the vacuum vessel, in ports designated 0 {degrees} and 180 {degrees} after their toroidal angle. Each antenna array is fed by a single transmitter. The power is first split two ways by means of a 3 -dB hybrid coupler, then each of these lines feeds a resonant loop connecting a pair of array elements. The power transfer during asymmetric phasing is shunted between resonant loops by a decoupler. The resonant loops are fitted with line stretchers so that multiple frequencies of operation are possible without reconfiguring the transmission line. Commissioning of these antennas has been underway since June 1994. Several deficiencies in the transmission line system were uncovered during initial vacuum conditioning, including problems with the transmission line insulators and with the <b>drive</b> <b>rods</b> for the variable elements. The former was solved by replacing the original alumina insulators, and the latter has been avoided during operation to date by positioning the tuners to avoid high voltage appearing on the <b>drive</b> <b>rods.</b> A modified design for the <b>drive</b> <b>rods</b> will be implemented before RF operations resume operation June 1995. New transmitters were procured from ABB for the new antennas and were installed in parallel with the antenna installation. During initial vacuum conditioning of the antenna in the 180 {degree} port a fast digital oscilloscope was used to try to pinpoint the location of arcing by a time-of-flight technique and to develop an understanding of the typical arc signature in the system...|$|R

40|$|When {{creating}} an electrical earth for a transformer with vertically <b>driven</b> earthing <b>rods,</b> problems can arise either because {{the ground is}} too hard or because the ground is too resistive to achieve the required earthing resistance. To assist in the planning of earthing installations a geographic information system (GIS) layer has been created. In its simplest form it consists of a colour coded map that indicates the most likely earthing installation: a single vertically <b>driven</b> <b>rod</b> (indicated by dark green); multiple vertically <b>driven</b> <b>rods</b> (indicated by light green); a horizontal trench, where a rod installation is unlikely (indicated by yellow); for difficult ground, a specialist installation (i. e. drilling; indicated by red). However, the GIS can be interrogated to provide site-specific information such as site conditions, likely depth of installation and quantity of earthing materials required. The GIS was created from a spatial model constructed from soil, superficial and bedrock geology that has been attributed with engineering strength and resistivity values. Calculations of expected earthing rod resistance, rod or trench length, and all possible combinations of ground conditions have been compared with the ‘likely’ conditions required {{for each of the}} four proposed installation scenarios to generate the GIS layer. The analysis has been applied to the electrical network distribution regions of Western Power Distribution, in the English Midlands, and UK Power Networks, which covers East Anglia, London and the SE of England. Because the spatial model that underlies the GIS has been constructed from national databases the analyses can be extended to other regions of the UK...|$|R
