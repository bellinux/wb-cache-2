The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E

5|$|Later, Michael tells Rex he {{must stay}} with his Aunt Carol, as Michael <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{case with a}} {{dangerous}} suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him {{to make sure he}} is alright, but then looks in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E
5|$|Sukhoi <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more {{advanced}} version, the Su-33K, a development {{to integrate the}} advanced technologies of the Su-35 fighters into the older Su-33 airframe. However, worries over other Chinese intentions emerged when {{it was reported that}} China had acquired one of the T-10Ks, a Su-33 prototype, from Ukraine, potentially to study and reverse engineer a domestic version. Various aircraft are alleged to have originated partially from the Su-33, such as the Shenyang J-15. Photos of Shenyang aircraft designers posing in front of a T-10K carrier based fighter prototype strongly suggest that the J-15 is directly related to T-10K. Negotiations stagnated as the Shenyang Aircraft company sought to reduce Russian content in the aircraft, while Sukhoi wanted to ensure a level of income from future upgrades and modifications made to the J-11.|$|E

5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> possible fix.|$|E
5|$|Kirill {{arrives at}} the {{workshop}} of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, who <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, humanistic and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and a chore in his disillusion with other people. His young apprentices have all run away to the town square, where a wrongly convicted criminal {{is about to be}} tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who according to Theophanes' comments has some fame as an icon painter in the outside world.|$|E

5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stud farm in the remote {{settlement}} of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol {{in the middle of}} the desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have travelled to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she is now in a relationship with his university 'best friend' Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her.|$|E
