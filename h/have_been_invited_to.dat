Raspe probably met Hieronymus von Münchhausen while studying at the University of Göttingen, and may even <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> dine {{with him at the}} mansion at Bodenwerder.

5|$|On 6 September 2007, eight {{members of}} the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian {{motorcade}} consisting of two motorcycles, two black four-wheel drive vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow—drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the summit as a world leader, to discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.|$|E

500|$|Another {{preliminary}} issue, that {{of whether}} the House of Lords had jurisdiction to challenge the validity of an Act of Parliament, was also not argued by the Attorney General in a move described by Ekins as [...] "an extraordinary concession".

Furthermore, the Bill of Rights 1689 prohibits review of parliamentary proceedings outside Parliament and section 3 of the Parliament Act 1911 specifically provides that [...] "any certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons [...] shall not be questioned in any court of law". Lord Bingham therefore wrote that he [...] " [...] some sense of strangeness at the exercise which the courts <b>have...</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> undertake in these proceedings".|$|E
