25|$|Paul Collingwood made a first-innings 190 - 52% of the Durham total - on {{his return}} to County Championship cricket {{following}} his stint with the England ODI team in the NatWest Series. However, Derbyshire's second highest score of the season, and rain cutting off about 80 overs of the match, resulted in the match in a draw. The hosts had taken three early Durham wickets for 59 after being put in the field, but Collingwood and skipper Dale Benkenstein lifted Durham with a 250-run partnership - to 309 for 4. However, Derbyshire did <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of revenge - five wickets fell for nine runs {{by the end of}} the day, as Durham were 363 for 9 at stumps, and only eight runs were taken before the last wicket fell on the second day. Durham took wickets as well, though, as Mark Davies got three wickets for four runs, including Michael di Venuto for 32, and Liam Plunkett also took three wickets as Derbyshire made 161 in 41.1 overs.|$|E

2500|$|In a mixed review, AllMusic's Andy Kellman felt that, despite {{moments when}} he is [...] "distinctively gripping," [...] The Weeknd lacks [...] "restraint, as he is prone to repetitious whining that is more young boy than young Keith Sweat". Kellman wrote that [...] "now that he's with a label, he'll {{hopefully}} <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of filter that enables him to fulfill the promise heard in these 160 minutes of one-dimensional, occasionally exhilarating overindulgence ... His potential is as obvious as his lyrics are toxic." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now found the music [...] "impressive", but found the [...] "lyrical ambivalence" [...] to be [...] "a bit one-note" [...] by the album's second hour. Although he found its [...] "excess oppressive" [...] when listened to in its entirety, Drowned in Sounds Robert Leedlum deemed Trilogy to be [...] "untouchable" [...] as a [...] "comprehensive document of a specific moment in time". Paul MacInnes of The Guardian wrote that its three discs [...] "offer a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover, through which an assertive voice gives way to one that sounds more troubled", and concluded, [...] "Trilogy does {{remove some of the}} Weeknd's mystique– lyrical formulae become apparent, and examples of engaging melody recede as the collection advances. Whatever its limits, however, Trilogy remains a striking piece of work." ...|$|E

2500|$|United States – The US Department of State {{announced}} limited {{support for}} the PYD in February 2016, although it opposes the unilateral establishment of a federal region in northern Syria.

We are grateful for that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role." [...] The USA have usually supported the YPG militia in its fight against ISIL, both with air support in combat and with embedded US Special Forces.

When in June 2016 the Manbij offensive started, the Washington Post reported it under the headline of [...] "Ignoring Turkey, U.S. backs Kurds in drive against ISIS in Syria".

Toner, the Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, said [...] "We don’t want to see any kind of ad hoc federalism or federalist system arise. We don’t want to see semi-autonomous zones. The reality is, though, as territory is liberated from Daesh, you got to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of governance back into these areas, but by no means are we condoning or – any kind of, as I said, ad hoc semi-autonomous areas in northern Syria". According to lieutenant general Stephen J.

25|$|The city began {{auctioning}} {{its enormous}} portfolio of Harlem properties {{to the public}} in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it (by lottery) below market value. The program was soon beset by scandal—buyers were acquiring houses from the city, then making deals with churches or other charities in which they would inflate the appraised values of the properties and the church or charity would take out federally guaranteed 203(k) mortgage and buy it. The original buyer would realize a profit and the church or charity would default on the mortgage (presumably <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of kickback from the developer). Abandoned shells were left to further deteriorate, and {{about a third of the}} properties sold by the city were tenements which still had tenants, who were left in particularly miserable conditions. These properties, and new restrictions on Harlem mortgages, bedeviled the area's residential real estate market for years.|$|R

For his follow-up, he's opted to sample TLC's 'No Scrubs'; a brave choice given its now iconic status in music history but also a sensible one now that we live in a time where '90s pop is old enough to become part of the revival trend. Given he's essentially repeating the trick as before it doesn't quite have the same impact as its predecessor, but crucially, its clever clipping and slinky electro grooves ensure 'Dance With Me' never once feels gimmicky." ...|$|R
