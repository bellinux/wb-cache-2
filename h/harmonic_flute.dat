Instead of the Positif, Cavaillé-Coll placed the Grand-Chœur manual as the lowest manual, and included couplers that allowed the entire tonal resources of the organ to be played from the Grand-Chœur. He refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters, thus increasing the organ's potential for expression. He adjusted pipemaking and voicing techniques, thus creating a whole family of stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe and the english horn. He popularized the <b>harmonic</b> <b>flute</b> stop, which, together with the montre, the gambe and the bourdon, formed the fonds (foundations) of the organ. He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils. [...] These allowed the use of higher wind pressures and for each manual's anches (reed stops) to be added or subtracted as a group {{by means of a}} pedal. Higher wind pressures allowed the organ to include many more stops of 8' (unison) pitch in every division, so complete fonds as well as reed choruses could be placed in every division, designed to be superimposed on top of one another. Sometimes he placed the treble part of the compass on a higher pressure than the bass, to emphasize melody lines and counteract the natural tendency of small pipes (especially reeds) to be softer.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the system}} of organ flue pipe scaling, [...] "flutes" [...] are {{generally}} the widest flue pipes and produce the tone with the most fundamental and the least harmonics among flue pipes. They are so named because they sound like the orchestral flute; though most flute stops are not intended to imitate the orchestral instrument, they produce a similar sound. A stopped flute, such as the [...] (German for [...] "covered"), produces a more muffled sound, while an open flute, such as the [...] (German for [...] "forest flute"), produces a rounder, open sound. The [...] (French for [...] "harmonic flute"), whose use the great 19th-century French organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll advocated, is a metal flute pipe of double length with a hole punched in the center, which causes the pipe to speak at its first partial with a very round, intense sound. Cavaillé-Coll used the names [...] and [...] for the 4-foot and 2-foot <b>harmonic</b> <b>flutes,</b> respectively.

I will explain how the Boehm system and other developments have impacted flute repertoire and works. The evolution of the modern flute in the nineteenth century along with the romantic musical style of the time gave rise to the romantic virtuosic flute. Moving forward through the development of the flute, I will end with today???s modern flute, which along with a progressive compositional style, gave rise to new flute techniques such as <b>harmonics</b> and alternative <b>flute</b> styles such as singing and playing at the same time.

50|$|The organ's history {{contains}} many mysteries. One concerns the famous and historic organ builder John Byfield {{who worked on}} the organ during 1740 according to reports in the Ipswich Journal. When Hunter rebuilt the organ in 1898 he used most of Thamar's pipework on the great organ except for the cornet and trumpet which he replaced with a <b>harmonic</b> <b>flute</b> and gamba. The cornet went missing and the trumpet was lost. The swell incorporated at least three eighteenth century stops. The restoration by Bishop and Son of Ipswich in 1970 was sensitive and imaginative. The Thamar organ was restored with no additions or subtractions (apart from a board for bottom C#). The cornet was rediscovered in the Rectory attic and repaired, restored and reconstructed. A very old rank of trumpet pipes was found to replace the lost set. The swell was matched up to complement the great and based on its 18th century content. The pedal was likewise treated. The Cromorne was introduced by John Budgen of Bishops and is an excellent and versatile addition to the swell organ. A pedal reed was also added. The organ specification is available at the National Pipe Organ Register. The organ has illustrious associations: Mendelssohn is believed to have given lessons to Caroline Attwood when he visited her elder brother George Attwood, then Rector. Mendelssohn knew George's father, Thomas Attwood, composer and organist of St. Paul's Cathedral and one time pupil of Mozart.|$|E

40|$|I Am My Own Escape is a one-act chamber opera {{with three}} characters, scored for soprano, tenor, and {{baritone}} voices respectively. The orchestra consists of flute, B flat clarinet, piano, violin, and violoncello, {{commonly known as}} the Pierrot ensemble. This work was written for fellow colleagues and students from Illinois State University, premiered on May 5, 2017. Leitmotifs are employed in this work – the characters each have unique vocal melodies, orchestral gestures, pitch collections, and/or rhythmic motives assigned to them (see figures below for examples). Contemporary or extended techniques such as scratch tones in the strings and <b>harmonics</b> in the <b>flute</b> are used periodically in the orchestra throughout the work at particularly emotional moments (see Performance Instructions, p. 2). Fig. 1, “guilt” motive Fig. 2, “ghost” motive Fig. 3, “Hector” motive The libretto of the work, written by the composer, conveys themes common of verismo-style operas. Characters are driven by passions that often lead to extreme acts of violence. Many character tropes common of the genre show the veristic influence on the work. The three characters, Sarah, Daniel, and Hector, were modeled after famous characters in verismo-style operas and similar dramatic musical works. Sarah, the soprano character, is a widowed woman who expresses guilt and sadness at her husband’s passing, but simultaneously expresses violent or possibly psychopathic tendencies. Throughout the work, she struggles with whether or not to move on from her departed husband, Daniel. This psychological imbalance is drawn from famous opera characters as Salome in Richard Strauss’ Salome, Wozzeck and Lulu in Alban Berg’s titular respective operas, and Canio in Ruggiero Leoncavallo’s I Pagliacci. Daniel, the lovelorn tenor, is the ghost of Sarah’s deceased husband who watches over her. He attempts to break through the metaphysical barrier to let his wife know he still loves her, but is unable to do so. Cio-Cio-san of Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, Armide of Jean-Baptiste Lully’s Armide, and, though less operatic, the Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Weber’s Phantom of the Opera were used as models when creating the character. Hector, the baritone, is a new man who meets Sarah for a date. He is very smooth-talking and a bit of a womanizer. Characters such as Don Giovanni in Mozart’s titular opera, the Duke of Mantua in Verdi’s Rigoletto, and Musetta of Puccini’s La bohème served as the basis of Hector’s character. The plot of I Am My Own Escape is veristic in nature. Plots for verismo-style operas are typically “short and shocking,” though not always, lasting around thirty minutes in length and involving violence or crimes of passion such as murder. I Am My Own Escape is around this duration, and features a murder scene at the end. The work is divided into three short scenes. In scene one, Sarah displays the psychological trouble she faces. Daniel unsuccessfully attempts to reach out to Sarah. Hector arrives and is attracted to Sarah. In scene two, Sarah and Hector have become slightly drunk and are forming a romantic relationship. Daniel watches with displeasure, and tries to remember the cause of his death. In the third and final scene, Sarah’s violent intentions become clear and Daniel recalls the cause of his death.
