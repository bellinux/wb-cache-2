For our private needs, {{there were only three}} chamberpots. They had to be emptied into an old rusty cauldron which also served for washing our clothes. We were forbidden to have food brought to us from outside, and were given disgusting soup cooked with soda ash which <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> {{in a constant state of}} dysentery. We were all in a deplorable state. The air was unbreathable and the babies choked many nights for lack of oxygen...|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Davis—the band's bassist—expounded on {{what they}} felt before {{releasing}} the song, [...] "After we started writing weird stuff like 'Ain't It Fun', we got nervous. But that was a comfort. We've grown and we don't like the same music we liked, so why would [...] not? That idea <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> pushing ourselves." [...] York considered {{that the decision to}} bring a gospel choir would have been difficult to approve if the original lineup of the band had remained. The track was mixed by Ken Andrews, and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound Studios.|$|E

500|$|Although US President Woodrow Wilson was re-elected in 1916 {{under the}} slogan [...] "He <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> {{out of the}} war", {{at the start of}} his second term he decided that Germany's {{continued}} deployment of unrestricted submarine warfare was sufficient cause for the US to enter World War I. Shortly afterward, Congress passed the Selective Service Act of 1917, which required all males aged 21–30 to register for military conscription. Goldman saw the decision as an exercise in militarist aggression, driven by capitalism. She declared in Mother Earth her intent to resist conscription, and to oppose US involvement in the war.|$|E
500|$|When Niedermeyer died in March 1861, Camille Saint-Saëns {{took charge}} of piano studies and {{introduced}} contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner.

500|$|At {{the heart}} of New Age Politics is a {{critique}} of the consciousness we all supposedly share, a [...] "six-sided prison" [...] that has <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> all trapped for hundreds of years. [...] The six sides of the [...] "prison" [...] are said to be: patriarchal attitudes, egocentricity, scientific single vision, the bureaucratic mentality, nationalism (xenophobia), and the [...] "big city outlook" [...] (fear of nature). [...] Since consciousness, according to Satin, ultimately determines our institutions, prison consciousness is said to be ultimately responsible for [...] "monolithic" [...] institutions that offer us {{little in the way of}} freedom of choice or connection with others. [...] Some representative monolithic institutions are: bureaucratic government, automobile-centered transportation systems, attorney-centered law, doctor-centered health care, and church-centered spirituality.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with an A-; he praised the [...] "fine job" [...] of director/writer Akiva Goldsman, and thought the climax was [...] "extraordinarily well-shot and performed". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, writing that it [...] "is {{a classic example}} of a story you have to be patient with. This was an episode with a compelling, {{shocking}} start that <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> hooked well enough to deal with some slow points {{in the rest of the}} first half-hour. But we were rewarded for our patience with one heck of a climax and epilogue. This was well-executed TV". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought that while the first half wasn't very exciting, the second half had [...] "plenty to keep up interest" [...] as more was revealed about Olivia and Walter's backgrounds.|$|E
500|$|Wilson supporters, {{including}} Barkley, {{campaigned for}} his re-election in 1916, using the slogan [...] "he <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> out of war". By early 1917, Germany had lifted all restrictions on attacks on neutral shipping supplying Britain and France, outraging many Americans. The publication in February of the Zimmermann Telegram, {{in which a}} German official proposed to Mexico that, if the U.S. entered the war, Mexico should declare war on them and the Germans would work to return Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico to Mexican control, also brought the United States closer to war. Wilson asked Congress for {{a declaration of war}} on April 2, 1917, and Barkley voted for the resolution when it came before the House two weeks later. At 40 years old, he considered resigning his seat to enlist in the U.S. Army, but Wilson persuaded him not to do so.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Parachutes, Coldplay {{returned}} to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, once again with Ken Nelson producing. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single {{because it was the}} track that made them want to record a second album, following a [...] "strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" [...] three months after {{the success of}} Parachutes. According to Martin [...] "one thing <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming." ...|$|E

500|$|The band started {{recording}} the album in London {{a week after}} the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their [...] "poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Lead singer Chris Martin said that once there they [...] "became obsessed with recording". [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album's lead single [...] "because it was the song that made us want to do a second album.

500|$|The episode's {{multiple}} perspectives were commented on: James Hibberd wrote for Entertainment Weekly that [...] "for {{a show that}} can often seem disjointed due by having so many storylines unfolding in different locations, {{this was the most}} cohesive episode we've seen yet, as the entire realm was impacted by Ned Stark being arrested for treason." [...] At HitFix, Alan Sepinwall called it [...] "by far the busiest episode of the series to date," [...] remarking that it not only moved [...] "pieces around the chess board to set things up for the season's final two episodes," [...] but also included [...] "some crackling dialogue, a few good character moments and some of the best action the show has featured to date." [...] David Sims from the A.V. Club wrote that the episode [...] "masterfully <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> abreast of everything going on, while sticking to the point-of-view style the show has held from the start." [...] On his blog Cultural Learnings, reviewer Myles McNutt found the episode [...] "filled with moments where much is done with very little. We don't really spend a sustained period in any one location, with only brief scenes possible to establish some pretty substantial story developments." ...|$|E
500|$|Sozin's Comet {{received}} critical acclaim; Ed Liu of Toon Zone {{stated that}} it made Avatar [...] "one of the finest animated television series ever made", and IGN stating that this [...] "film" [...] deserved an Academy Award. Toon Zone praised the skill of the animation directors in designing the sweeping movements of the battle scenes, {{as well as the}} slower scenes, [...] "including one moving reconciliation and the quiet coda that ties off many of the remaining loose ends of the series". IGN reviewer Tory Ireland Mell wrote that she would [...] "put it in the top ten films of all time". She also praised the artistic skill of the designers, stating that the [...] "whole dark tone was gorgeous to look at", especially the [...] "art of the Lion Turtle". She thought that Sozin's Comet lacked plot holes, as well as unnecessary plot devices, stating that the [...] "story moved and <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> moving right along with it from beginning to end". She gave Sozin's Comet a 10 out of 10 [...] "Masterful" [...] rating. Susan Stewart, reviewing for The New York Times, praised the show's effort at philosophizing, noting that [...] "this is complicated stuff, the reconciliation of religion and violence, and it’s beautifully rendered: simple enough for Nickelodeon fans and subtle enough for their parents, with humor to puncture the pomposity inherent in the heroic genre." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1916 season started, {{it became clear}} that the Dodgers were one of the better teams in the league. Robinson managed to squeeze one more year of {{productivity}} out of some older veterans such as Chief Meyers, who said of Stengel, [...] "It was Casey who <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> on our toes. He was the life of the party and just kept all us old-timers [...] pepped up all season." [...] Stengel, mostly playing right field, hit [...]279 with eight home runs, one less than the team leader in that category, Wheat. Stengel's home run off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, who won 33 games that year, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 30, provided the margin of victory as the Dodgers went into first place to stay, qualifying for their first World Series, against the Boston Red Sox. Despite getting two hits in a Game 1 loss at Boston, Stengel was benched for Game 2 because the Red Sox were pitching a left hander, Babe Ruth, and Stengel hit better against right handers. Stengel, back in the lineup for Game 3, got a hit in Brooklyn's only victory of the series. He was benched again in Game 4 against left hander Dutch Leonard, though he was inserted as a pinch runner, and got another hit in the Game 5 loss, finishing 4 for 11, [...]364, the best Dodger batting average of the Series.|$|E
500|$|The Danville Political Club, a debating {{society which}} existed between 1786 and 1790, {{frequently}} held its {{meetings at the}} tavern. Many members of this society {{went on to become}} prominent political leaders at the state and national levels. Eleven of the Club's thirty members would participate in {{at least one of the}} ten constitutional conventions that helped separate Kentucky from Virginia. Among the members were Kentucky's first Secretary of State (and future U.S. Senator from Louisiana), James Brown; its third governor, Christopher Greenup; chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, George Muter; federal judges Harry Innes, William McClung, and Samuel McDowell; Congressmen Willis Green, Stephen Ormsby, Thomas Speed, David Walker, and Matthew Walton; U.S. Senator John Brown; and Thomas Todd, a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The existence of the club was lost to history until Speed's grandson, Thomas Speed II, discovered extensive minutes of its meetings that his grandfather, the club secretary, had taken and stored in a desk drawer. The younger Speed later published these minutes with his own commentary about the club, in which he opined that [...] "Full and complete biographies of some of the members would present a history of Kentucky from the beginning of its settlement past the first quarter of the ensuing century." [...] One of the few extant references to the Club outside Speed's meeting minutes is an entry in the journal of a U.S. Army paymaster named Major Beatty; while staying overnight at Grayson's Tavern, Beatty recorded that he and his companions were [...] "very much disturbed by a Political Club which met in the next house where we slept and <b>kept</b> <b>us</b> awake till 12 or 1 o'clock." ...|$|E
