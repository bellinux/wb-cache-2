5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response,</b> {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{widespread}} belief, {{there is}} no empirical knowledge concerning extraterrestrial life forms and civilizations. The implications of a detection of extraterrestrial life would vary greatly depending {{on the nature of}} that life, its location, and how human society reacts. Because of this lack of certainty, PDPs consider a variety of scenarios and the appropriate reactions. The formulation of a cohesive plan <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to the detection of ETI would involve the development of scenario-contingent strategies for managing the discovery and its consequences.|$|E
25|$|After Emperor Charles's {{death on}} 20 October, Frederick quickly {{resolved}} to strike first; on 8 November {{he ordered the}} mobilization of the Prussian army, and on 11 December he issued an ultimatum to Maria Theresa demanding the surrender of Silesia. In return, he promised to acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction and to give his vote as elector of Brandenburg in the imperial election to Maria Theresa's husband, Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine. Not waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response,</b> he then led his troops across the lightly defended Silesian frontier on 16 December 1740, beginning the First Silesian War.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{is similar}} to the {{conversation}} poems created by Coleridge, including Dejection: An Ode. The poems were not real conversations as there is no response to the narrator of the poem, but they are written as if there would be a response. The poems seek to have a response, though it never comes, and the possibility of such a voice though absence is a type of prosopopoeia. In general, Coleridge's poems discuss the cosmic as they long <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response,</b> and it is this aspect, not a possible object of the conversation, that forms the power of the poem. Wordsworth took up the form in both Tintern Abbey and Ode: Intimations of Immortality, but he lacks the generous treatment of the narrator as found in Coleridge's poems. As a whole, Wordsworth's technique is impersonal and more logical, and the narrator is placed in the same position as the object of the conversation. The narrator of Wordsworth is more self-interested and any object beyond the narrator is kept without a possible voice and is turned into a second self of the poet. As such, the conversation has one of the participants lose his identity {{for the sake of the}} other and that individual represents loss and mortality.|$|E

25|$|Distractor {{inhibition}} {{model is}} the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect {{as the result of}} selective attention to a target stimulus. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, our response to the target is hampered due to immediate residual inhibition. Selective attention is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response.</b> To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving excitation to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the internal representations of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This {{is referred to as the}} transient residual inhibition. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater reaction time.|$|E

30|$|Responses to the {{negatively}} framed {{items in}} the scale were rated from 3 to 0 : 3 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ‘yes’ <b>response,</b> 2 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ‘possibly’ <b>response,</b> 1 <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ‘uncertain’ <b>response</b> and 0 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ‘no’ <b>response</b> <b>for</b> each item. This coding was reversed for positively framed items. Each of the items received equal weight when summed, {{to arrive at a}} global (total) score: a low global score representing low stigma experience, a high score indicating high stigma experience. The mean scores (and standard deviations) were calculated for felt and enacted stigma and across the domains. To compare the distribution of mean scores of stigma by gender, level of education and disease stage categories, we used the Independent-Samples T Test. The associations between age categories and mean stigma scores were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis 1 -way ANOVA (k samples) test. Significance level was determined at alpha level of 0.05 and below. Item-based descriptive analysis was conducted by transforming four response categories in the scale: ‘Yes’, ‘Possibly’, ‘Uncertain’ and ‘No’ into three taking ‘possibly’ as almost equivalent to ‘Yes’.|$|R

He further recalled that he applied to join the Royal Australian Navy at the same time, but was still waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response.</b> After completing flying training at Mascot and Richmond, New South Wales, and Point Cook, Victoria, Gibbes was commissioned a pilot officer on 28June 1940. His initial posting was to No.23 Squadron, which operated CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons out of Archerfield, Queensland. [...] He was promoted to flying officer on 26December 1940.|$|E

Walsh bought it for 1,000 French francs, the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction. On October5, 1925, the expanded edition of In Our Time (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York. The last story in the volume was the two-part [...] "Big Two-Hearted River". The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and [...] (1987).

Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people.

500|$|Watson's {{performance}} {{was characterized by}} some quirks. In one instance, Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings. (Jennings said [...] "What are the '20s?" [...] {{in reference to the}} 1920s. Then Watson said [...] "Whathe 1920s?") Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response. In another instance, Watson was initially given credit <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> of [...] "What is leg?" [...] after Jennings incorrectly responded [...] "What is: he only had one hand?" [...] to a clue about George Eyser (the correct response was, [...] "What is: he's missing a leg?"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect. The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek's original acceptance of Watson's response. Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles, with one bet at $6,435 and another at $1,246. Gerald Tesauro, one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson, explained that Watson's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator.|$|E
