5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} peak hours {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts at Aldwych required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This was not justifiable as only 450 passengers used the station each <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Liners House, the company's new {{headquarters}} in Salford Docks, was officially opened on 12 December 1969 by the High Commissioner for Canada. The design was advanced for its <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> remains basically unchanged today except for re-glazing. The unusual curved {{facade of the}} ten-storey building was designed to echo the bridge shape of the Manchester Miller. Later renamed Furness House, it {{was built on the}} former Manchester Ship Canal railway sidings between Nos. 8 and 9 Docks.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1914, near Givenchy, {{during a}} night attack, Lt. Bruce was {{in command of}} a small party which {{captured}} one of the enemy's trenches. In spite of being severely wounded in the neck, he {{walked up and down}} the trench, encouraging his men to hold on against several counter-attacks for some hours until killed. The fire from rifles and bombs was very heavy all <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was due to the skilful disposition made, and the example and encouragement shown by Lt. Bruce that his men were able to hold out until dusk, when the trench was finally captured by the enemy.|$|E

5|$|The {{demolition}} of the arcades of Freedom Square began in October 2010. Excavation {{works for the}} foundations of the Parliament House began soon after demolition was complete. In early 2011, the original plan was modified with the relocation of a staircase, the extension of one of the blocks, and changes {{in the design of the}} louvers on the facade. Construction started later that year, and the steel frame of the structure was complete by early 2012. At this point, it began to be covered in limestone which had been quarried in Gozo, and cut into specific shapes in Italy, before being sent back to Malta. Between 120 and 150 workers were on the construction site every <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> cost more than €90 million to build.|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson <b>Day</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> would be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 {{when it was}} only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
5|$|Max bumps into Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) in {{the village}} and tells him that his wedding with Steph is back on. Niall is devastated but tries to remain {{composed}} in front of Max. Steph has big plans for her wedding <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E

5|$|Minor actions {{continued}} into the night, with small groups of Viet Cong able to pop up undetected and then disappear at will from within the Australian defensive position. The searching units were unable to locate Viet Cong in large numbers but experienced {{a significant number of}} sudden engagements and ambushes throughout the <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> became clear that the communists were using tunnels for movement and concealment. Preece suspected that the area was honeycombed with tunnels and that the communist headquarters that he had been tasked to destroy was in fact located beneath the feet of the battalion. The Australians were the only battalion in the US 173rd Brigade to strike significant resistance, {{and by the end of}} the first day 1 RAR had suffered a total of three killed and 15 wounded, while the artillery Forward Observer from 105 Field Battery had also been killed. The battalion spent a sleepless night and in the early hours of the morning there were a number of short exchanges of fire as small groups of Viet Cong returned to the area. Not wanting to fire the machine-guns for fear of giving their positions away or hitting friendly troops, the Australians resorted to using grenades forward of the perimeter. Meanwhile, in the US 3rd Infantry Brigade area of operations contact had been light, with only six Viet Cong killed.|$|E
5|$|Table salt {{is made up}} of {{just under}} 40% sodium by weight, so a 6g serving (1teaspoon) {{contains}} about 2,300mg of sodium. Sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body: via its role as an electrolyte, it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly, and it is one factor involved in the osmotic regulation of water content in body organs (fluid balance). Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt. The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed. In the United States, 75% of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods, 11% from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs.|$|E

On October 27 of that same year, it was illuminated with pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. On December 11, the Port Authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season. On February 24, 2012, the building was lit up with red in honor of Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan, who became a cardinal on February 18. On June 14, 2012, it was illuminated with red, white, and blue to honor Flag Day. In August, it was illuminated with red in honor of the Armed Forces. On September 8, 2012, it was once again illuminated with red, white, and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. On June 24, 2013, the building was again illuminated with red, white, and blue to celebrate the Fourth of July. On November 12, 2013, three hundred red, white, and blue lights were lit up.|$|E
