I integrate a proportional corporation tax and a proportional wage tax into a binary principal-agent model. The wage tax increases the remuneration costs and makes the agent's employment less attractive. Thus, the principal tends to demand lower rather than higher effort or does not offer a contract at all. In contrast to the wage tax, the corporate tax is irrelevant for the optimal remuneration contract. Under asymmetric corporate taxation, the principal tends to offer contracts less frequently. <b>Fixed</b> <b>remuneration</b> contracts are penalized more heavily by asymmetric taxation than performance-based remuneration contracts. asymmetric taxation, loss-offset, principal-agent theory, corporate taxation, wage taxation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} decades, {{there has been}} a massive {{increase}} in the level of CEO remuneration, which has not been in line with the growth in company earnings and firm size. This massive increase in particularly variable remuneration {{was one of the main}} causes to the financial crisis during 2007 - 2008. As a result of the financial crisis, the issue of excessive CEO remuneration has become increasingly highlighted. Thus, the regulators have been striving to come up with new regulations to align the long-term interest of the banks with the variable remuneration. A regulation that has been implemented by the EU countries to combat this issue is the bonus cap that is an amendment to CRD IV. The bonus cap limits the variable remuneration to 100 % of the <b>fixed</b> <b>remuneration,</b> with the exception that it can be raised to 200 % if approved by shareholders. However, the bonus cap has not been as efficient as expected. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine how the bonus cap has affected the variable CEO remuneration. This will be done by analysing and comparing the total remuneration within the 20 largest banks in EU. The investigation is concentrated on the time period 2012 - 2015. Method:  A sample of 20 banks has been chosen based on three criterions, namely the banks with the largest amount of assets, banks with EU headquarters and banks that provide the information necessary for the research. When collecting the data needed to fulfil the purpose, quantitative data in form of numbers from the banks financial reports was retrieved from their respective website. Conclusion: The results show that the variable remuneration has increased since the implementation of the bonus cap. This increase is likely driven by the increase in <b>fixed</b> <b>remuneration.</b> Another consequence of the bonus cap is that the variable remuneration has become more constant in relation to the <b>fixed</b> <b>remuneration.</b> The last observed consequence is a diminished correlation between performance and pay, meaning that the variable remuneration has had a weakened dependence on the performance of the bank. The results of the development in variable remuneration provide an insight about the effectiveness of the bonus cap, what impact it has had and that an improvement of the bonus cap is desirable...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the financial elements of remuneration and its motivational features; to describe specific delimitations for the remuneration system in the public sector, and, on the basis of this information, to create a model for a possible remuneration package structure and to predict its future effect on the motivational level of public sector employees. This study provides an analysis of the existing remuneration package structure for public servants in Latvia and, based on a theoretical background, it offers proposals for the improvement of a remuneration package structure that aims to ensure its functionality and to provide possibilities to motivate employees. As a result of this analysis, the general and motivating parts of a remuneration package were defined, the last being divided into fixed and variable parts. An examination of the appropriate legislation has lead to the conclusion that the present combination of financial elements of remuneration has neither a clearly fixed, nor a clearly variable nature. Two alternative structures for a remuneration package have been proposed, namely, a <b>fixed</b> <b>remuneration</b> package structure and a remuneration package with a significant proportion of variable part. In the case of implementation of a <b>fixed</b> <b>remuneration</b> package structure it is forecast that all transparency and fairness (equality) principles will be met, stability of the remuneration system will be ensured, and, as well, a positive image of the public sector within the labour market will be sustained. The implementation of a remuneration package with significant variable part should ensure a stronger link between the level of remuneration and job output of employee, as well as to provide more flexible possibilities to stimulate employees for immediate actions. For the practical implementation of both proposed alternatives and for a revision of current remuneration levels in nominal terms, the authors propose the utilisation of an employee job output and remuneration level correlation matrix, thus ensuring an optimal equilibrium of output and remuneration and a targeted usage of remuneration funds...|$|E

40|$|Background: Optimal {{contracting}} {{continues to}} dominate boardroom and dinner discussions worldwide {{in light of}} the 2008 global financial crisis and especially in South Africa, due to the growing income gap. Increased scrutiny is being placed on South African state-owned entities (SOEs), {{as a result of the}} seemingly poor performance of SOEs. Some of the SOEs are reported to have received financial bailouts from taxpayers’ money, while executives are raking in millions of rands in remuneration, provoking some concerns on the alignment of executive pay to company performance in SOEs. Aim: The study will assist remuneration committees and policymakers in the structuring of executive pay in SOEs to ensure alignment to company performance. Setting: The study sought to assess, based on empirical evidence, if there is a positive relationship between Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) remuneration and company performance in South African SOEs in the period between 2010 and 2014. All 21 Schedule 2 SOEs were included in the study. Methods: The research was a quantitative archival research methodology. Correlation and multiple regression analysis were the main statistical techniques used in this study. Results: Contrary to popular media, a positive relationship between CEO and CFO <b>remuneration</b> (<b>fixed</b> pay and short-term incentives) and company performance in SOEs was observed. Company size appears to be the key determiner of fixed pay in SOEs. The positive relationship was mainly noted on absolute profitability measurements like EBITDA (earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortisation) and net profit. Conclusion: SOE remuneration committees and policymakers should maintain the positive relationship; however, more emphasis should be placed on financial efficiency measurements so as to enhance efficiencies in SOEs...|$|R
