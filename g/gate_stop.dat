25|$|When {{variable}} conditions {{meant that}} a higher water {{level in the}} new canal could not be guaranteed, then the older company would also build a stop lock (under its own control, with gates pointing towards its own canal) which could be closed when the new canal was low. This resulted in a sequential pair of locks, with gates pointing in opposite directions: one example was at Hall Green near Kidsgrove, where the southern terminus of the Macclesfield Canal joined the Hall Green Branch of the earlier Trent and Mersey Canal. The four <b>gate</b> <b>stop</b> lock near Kings Norton Junction, between the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal and the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was replaced in 1914 {{by a pair of}} guillotine lock gates which stopped the water flow regardless of which canal was higher. These gates have been permanently open since nationalisation.|$|E

A level crossing gate concrete post survived at Chanter's Lane. A bridge with brick sides and iron girders existed near Kenwith Castle, together with signs of a low embankment and a cutting running through solid rock.Along Cornborough Cliffs the embankments and trackbed were very clear, as was the course of the line running down to Westward Ho! A bridge to create an underpass or right of way substantially survived as abutments, without the iron bridge itself however. The station at Westward Ho! remained 'almost' unaltered, apart from the missing track. The signal box was a sweet shop or 'Snack Bar'. Almost all the railway buildings have now gone (2006), apart from the 'Station Hall'.Very little was visible between Westward Ho! and Appledore, however near the Anglican Church the back wall of the old station waiting rooms still stood with two chimney-breasts and fireplaces.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} 182 ramp operations incident {{reports from the}} Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) database, to determine which factors influence ramp operation incidents. It was found that incidents occurred more often during aircraft arrival operations than during departure operations; incidents occurred most often at the <b>gate</b> <b>stop</b> area, less so at the gate entry/exit areas, and least on the ramp fringe areas; and reporters cited fewer incidents when more ground crew were present. The authors offer suggestions for both airline management and flight crews to reduce the rate of ramp incidents...|$|E

25|$|There were {{a number}} of <b>stop</b> <b>gates</b> {{throughout}} the canal, e.g. between lock 16 and lock 17, on section 17. For some reason, the list Unrau has does not list that lock. The others are listed by section number along the canal, but he did not provide a list of where the section numbers correspond to mileage numbers along the canal. Note that the greatest number of <b>stop</b> <b>gates</b> were between Lock 50 and 51, that is the 14 mile level which includes Big Pool.

Among the wounded was Major General Jamal Tahir, the city's chief of police, who had survived a previous attack at almost the same spot two years earlier. Three additional attackers were killed after the initial blast, as they attempted to throw grenades at security forces. Several officers who survived the attack reported that the first bomber was driving a police car and wearing a uniform.

As a result of the problems experienced by Wadkin Limited, Leicester, with hydraulic feed control, it was decided to replace the original hydraulic feed actuator by a conventional 18 speed gearbox. Drill depth control is achieved by conventional <b>gate</b> <b>stops</b> employing pneumatic sensing elements to keep in line with the fluidic elements of the control system.
