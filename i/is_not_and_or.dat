40|$|Whole plant {{responses}} to salinity and their interaction to different conditions were evaluated for vegetative and productive traits of wheat. For this purpose salinity tolerance was examined for 75 families produced from crossing 25 F 2 plants from crosses between Siete Cerros (salt tolerant) and Axona (salt sensitive) spring bread wheats, {{to their parents}} and their F 1 progeny. The 75 families and their parents were grown under 0 (control) and 50 mM NaCl. Data for eleven metric traits, days to heading, days to maturity, final plant height, spike length, ear weight, straw weight, number of grains per ear, grain yield per plant, 000 grain weight, whole plant weight and harvest index was measured. Salinity reduced performance with regard to all the above traits. The genotype x concentration interaction was highly significant for yield components, indicating that plants responded differently in yield components when exposed to the different levels of salinity. In contrast, the genotype x concentration interactions for the vegetative traits, heading date, maturity date, final plant height, weight of straw and whole plant weight <b>were</b> <b>not</b> significant <b>and</b> <b>or</b> slightly significant indicating a lower differentiation response to salinity.
