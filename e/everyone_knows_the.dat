I couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with José Mourinho again. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> special relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me." [...] Mourinho also commented on the transfer, saying: [...] "He's coming because he's one of the best strikers in Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he's not protected by history or what he's done for this club previously. He is coming with the mentality to make more history." [...] On 28 July 2014, Chelsea announced that Drogba would wear the number 15 shirt which he wore when he first signed for the club in 2004. Mohamed Salah, who wore the number during the 2013–14 season, took over the number 17 shirt vacated by Eden Hazard. On 15 August, however, it was announced that Drogba had been given back the number 11 shirt he previously wore at the club, with its previous occupant Oscar taking over the number 8 jersey vacated by Frank Lampard.|$|E

Boston Mayor Tom Menino wrote that the cover [...] "rewards a terrorist with celebrity treatment". Massachusetts State Police sergeant Sean Murphy stated that [...] "glamorizing the face of terror is not just insulting to the family members of those killed in the line of duty, it also could be an incentive to those who may be unstable to do something to get their face on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine." [...] The New York Times used the same photo on their front page in May 2013, but did not draw criticism. Rolling Stone columnist Matt Taibbi criticized those who took offense at the cover, arguing that their offense-taking was the result of their associating Rolling Stone with glamor instead of news, stating that The New York Times did not draw the criticism that Rolling Stone did, [...] "because <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> Times is a news organization.
