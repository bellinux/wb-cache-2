50|$|One of {{the major}} {{disadvantages}} of the super singles {{is that they are}} currently not as widely available as a standard tire. In addition, if a tire should become deflated or be destroyed, there is not another tire attached to the same hub to maintain the dynamic stability of the vehicle, as would be the case with <b>dual</b> <b>wheels.</b> With <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> the remaining tire may be overloaded, but it will typically allow the vehicle to be safely stopped or driven to a repair facility.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> with three 8 t axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from single versus <b>dual</b> <b>wheels.</b> The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> and on single wheels, instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on single wheels.|$|R

This Archimedes' screw has an axle {{diameter}} of 400 mm and is 1.37 m diameter overall. It is inclined at an angle of 16°. Each revolution of the screw lifts 777 L of water.|$|R
50|$|In Europe usually both rear tractor axles have <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> while {{single or}} <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used for}} the cargo trailer. The most common {{combination}} used in Europe is a semi tractor with three axles, one a lift axle, and a cargo trailer with three axles, one also a lift axle, giving six axles and 22 wheels in total. This format is now common across Europe, due to reduced road-loading requirements, especially for bridges. The lift axles used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but reduce tyre scrub and wear while carrying lighter loads by raising an axle set off the roadway. For greater detail, see the United Kingdom section, below.|$|R
