50|$|The {{transmission}} {{processing of}} SC-FDMA {{is very similar}} to that of OFDMA. For each user, the sequence of bits transmitted is mapped to a complex constellation of symbols (BPSK, QPSK or M-Quadrature amplitude modulation). Then different transmitters (users) are assigned different Fourier coefficients. This assignment is carried out in the mapping and <b>demapping</b> blocks. The receiver side includes one <b>demapping</b> block, one IDFT block, and one detection block for each user signal to be received. Just like in OFDM, guard intervals (called cyclic prefixes) with cyclic repetition are introduced between blocks of symbols in view to efficiently eliminate inter-symbol interference from time spreading (caused by multi-path propagation) among the blocks.|$|E

30|$|The <b>demapping</b> task {{is often}} posed as a maximum {{likelihood}} problem [6]. Alternatively, prior information was incorporated for {{a posteriori probability}} (APP) <b>demapping</b> in [7, 8], which was applied to iterative <b>demapping</b> and decoding for bit interleaved coded modulation. Central to both maximum likelihood and APP <b>demapping</b> is the conditional distribution of the received signal given the transmitted signal. <b>Demapping</b> with a Rayleigh distribution from a fading channel for noncoherent orthogonal modulation was considered in [9]. A Poisson model is used for maximum likelihood detection in optical communications [10]. For amplitude and phase-shift keying (APSK) modulation, however, <b>demapping</b> algorithms to date have assumed additive white Gaussian noise, which has equal variance for in-phase and quadrature components and is independent of the transmitted signal [7, 11, 12]. Modern <b>demapping</b> algorithms for APSK modulation incorporate {{the mean of the}} noise distribution as a shift in the received symbol centroids, e.g., obtained by pilot symbols [13, 14]; however, these works retain the assumption of equal noise variance across the constellation.|$|E
