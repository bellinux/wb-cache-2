5|$|Banagher was {{extensively}} {{planted by}} the English, {{particularly during the}} periods 1621–1642 and 1650–1690. The plantations {{had a profound impact}} on Ireland in several ways. The first was the destruction of the native ruling classes and their replacement with the Protestant Ascendancy, of British-origin (mostly English) Protestant landowners. Their position was buttressed by the Penal Laws, which denied political and land-owning rights to Roman Catholics. The dominance of this class in Irish life persisted until the late 18th century, and it voted for the Act of Union with Britain in 1800. As a result, by the early 20th century, Banagher had a mix of Irish of native <b>descent</b> <b>and</b> Irish of English <b>descent</b> <b>and</b> supported two churches, one Catholic and one Protestant, both of which still exist.|$|E
5|$|He {{could not}} breathe {{for the first}} twenty minutes of his life.

He was of English <b>descent,</b> <b>and</b> his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E

40|$|The {{definitions}} of <b>descents</b> <b>and</b> excedances in {{the elements of}} the symmetric group S d are generalized in two different directions. First, <b>descents</b> <b>and</b> excedances are defined for indexed permutations, i. e. {{the elements of the}} group S n d = Z n o S d, where o is wreath product with respect to the usual action of S d by permutation of [d]. It is shown, bijectively, that excedances <b>and</b> <b>descents</b> are equidistributed, <b>and</b> the corresponding <b>descent</b> polynomials, analogous to the Eulerian polynomials, are computed as the feulerian polynomials of simple polynomials. The descent polynomial is shown to equal the h-polynomial (essentially the h-vector) of a certain triangulation of the unit d-cube. This is proved by a bijection which exploits the fact that the h-vector of the triangulation in question can be computed via a shelling of the simplicial complex arising from the triangulation. The h-vector, in turn, is computed via the Ehrhart polynomials of dilations of the unit d-cube. The famous [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} joint {{distribution}} of <b>descents</b> <b>and</b> inverse <b>descents</b> over {{the set of}} permutations of n letters. Gessel conjectured that the two-variable generating function of this distribution can be expanded in a given basis with nonnegative integer coefficients.

As a result we devise a recurrence for the coefficients but are unable to settle the conjecture. We examine generalizations of the conjecture and obtain a type B analog of the recurrence satisfied by the two-variable generating function. We also exhibit some connections to cyclic <b>descents</b> <b>and</b> cyclic inverse <b>descents.</b> Finally, we propose a combinatorial model in terms of statistics on inversion sequences...|$|R
