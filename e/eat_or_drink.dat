5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In early 2002, Ebert was {{diagnosed}} with papillary thyroid cancer which was successfully removed in February. In 2003, he underwent surgery for cancer in his salivary gland, which was followed up by radiation treatment. He was again afflicted with cancer in 2006. In June of that year, he had surgery to remove cancerous tissue near his right jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to bed rest {{and was unable to}} speak, <b>eat,</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> for a period of time, necessitating the use of a feeding tube.|$|E

25|$|In Israel {{and other}} {{temperate}} climates (such as Florida, Australia, Texas, and Southern California), observant Jews will often conduct all their eating, studying, and sleeping {{activities in the}} sukkah. Many Jews will not <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> anything outside the sukkah. Others will drink or eat fruit outside the sukkah.|$|E

25|$|Except in {{the most}} severe cases, ischemic colitis is treated with {{supportive}} care. IV fluids are given to treat dehydration, and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning nothing to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink)</b> until the symptoms resolve. If possible, cardiac function and oxygenation should be optimized to improve oxygen delivery to the ischemic bowel. A nasogastric tube may be inserted if an ileus is present.|$|E

50|$|In chapter 242 of {{the first}} book (verse 10 and 13) of the Great Gospel of John, it is preached that certain food should be avoided for health reasons.

25|$|Smoking has {{not been}} allowed in the chamber of the House of Commons since the 17th century. As a result, Members may take snuff instead and the doorkeepers still keep a snuff-box for this purpose. Despite {{persistent}} media rumours, it {{has not been}} permitted to smoke anywhere inside the Palace since 2005. Members may not <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> in the chamber; the exception to this rule is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who may have an alcoholic beverage while delivering the Budget statement.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Christians who are {{preparing}} to receive the Eucharist do not <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> at all from vespers (sunset) until after taking Holy Communion. A similar total fast {{is expected to be}} kept on the Eve of Nativity, the Eve of Theophany (Epiphany), Great Friday and Holy Saturday for those who can do so. There are other individual days observed as fasts (though not as days of total fasting) no matter what day of the week they fall on, such as the Beheading of St. John the Baptist on 29 August and the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on 14 September.|$|E
25|$|Electroconvulsive {{therapy is}} a {{controversial}} form of treatment which cannot be involuntarily applied in psychiatric emergency service settings. Instances wherein {{a patient is}} depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or herself or when a patient refuses to swallow, <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> medication, electroconvulsive therapy could be suggested as a therapeutic alternative. While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.|$|E

50|$|After Minot and Murphy's {{verification}} of Whipple's results in 1926, pernicious anemia victims <b>ate</b> <b>or</b> <b>drank</b> at least one-half pound of raw liver, <b>or</b> <b>drank</b> raw liver juice, every day. This continued for several years, until a concentrate of liver juice became available. In 1928, chemist Edwin Cohn prepared a liver extract that was 50 to 100 times more potent than the natural food (liver). The extract {{could even be}} injected into muscle, which meant patients no longer needed to eat large amounts of liver or juice. This also reduced the cost of treatment considerably.|$|R
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink,</b> the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
25|$|Thermal burns usually {{result from}} placing hot food or {{beverages}} in the mouth. This may occur {{in those who}} <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> before a local anesthetic has worn off. The normal painful sensation is absent and a burn may occur. Microwave ovens sometimes produce food which is cold externally and very hot internally, and {{this has led to}} a rise in the frequency of intra-oral thermal burns. Thermal food burns are usually on the palate or posterior buccal mucosa, and appear as zones of erythema and ulceration with necrotic epithelium peripherally. Electrical burns more commonly affect the oral commissure (corner of the mouth). The lesions are usually initially painless, charred and yellow with little bleeding. Swelling then develops and by the fourth day following the burn the area becomes necrotic and the epithelium sloughs off.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fourteenth}} century there were several visitations. There is no notice of any by Bishop Dalderby; but he {{commissioned}} the prior of Dunstable in 1315 to visit the nuns of St. Giles-in-the-Wood in his name. Bishop Burghersh in 1322 wrote to order the prior and convent to take back a brother {{who had been on}} a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and asserted that he did so with the permission of his superior; and a little later the prior was cited for refusing to obey this injunction. In 1359 Bishop Gynwell, passing by the priory, noticed 'certain insolences and unlawful wanderings' of the canons, and wrote to reinforce the rule that none should go beyond the precincts of the monastery without reasonable cause, nor without the permission of the prior; and ordered further that such permission should not be too frequently given. He also reminded them of the rule that none should <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> outside the monastery, or talk with seculars without permission.|$|E
50|$|Lactose {{intolerance}} is {{a condition}} in which people have symptoms due to the decreased ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk products. Those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. These typically start between one half and two hours after drinking milk <b>or</b> <b>eating</b> milk products. Severity depends on the amount a person <b>eats</b> <b>or</b> <b>drinks.</b> It does not cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract.|$|R
40|$|Animals {{that cat}} and/or drink in {{response}} to electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (ESLH-pos) are more responsive to both schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) tests {{and a series of}} amphetamine (AMPH) injections than animals that do not exhibit these behaviors (ESLH-neg). Moreover. prior exposure to the behaviorally activating SIP experience, or to AMPH, permanently trans-formed the ESLH-neg animals into animals that reliably <b>ate</b> <b>or</b> <b>drank</b> during ESLH. Prior treatment with AMPH also increases the water consumed uring subsequent SIP tests. Thus, initial of induced ifferences insensitivity to activating experiences can determine behavioral propensities...|$|R
5000|$|The {{same day}} as the battle {{in another part of}} Spain a {{fisherman}} was seen exclaiming, first in Arabic then in Spanish, [...] "In Calatañazor Almanzor lost the drum". Many Muslims came from Córdoba to see the fisherman, but every time they approached him he disappeared before their eyes only to reappear elsewhere repeating the same lament. Lucas of Tuy believed it was the devil lamenting the disaster of Calatañazor (el diablo que llorava la cayda de los moros). Almanzor never <b>ate</b> <b>or</b> <b>drank</b> after his defeat, and dying in Medinaceli he was buried there.|$|R
25|$|Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, {{abdominal}} cramps, and constipation {{are common}} side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells. Malnutrition and dehydration can result {{when the patient}} does not <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage. This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much {{in an effort to}} allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or ginger tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment. However, a high index of suspicion is appropriate, since diarrhea and bloating are also symptoms of typhlitis, a very serious and potentially life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.|$|E
25|$|In the Diaspora in Ashkenazic Orthodox communities, the Jewish {{ceremony}} is performed only on Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur. German communities perform it at both Shaharit and Musaf, while on Yom Kippur it is performed at Neilah as well. Eastern European congregations only perform it at Musaf. On Simchat Torah, some communities recite it during Musaf, and others during Shacharit, to enable Kohanim to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> during the Torah reading between Shacharit and Musaf. On weekdays and Shabbat, in Ashkenazic diaspora communities, the blessing is not recited by Kohanim. Instead, it is recited {{only by the}} shaliach tzibbur (prayer leader), or a hazzan (cantor), after the Modim prayer, {{towards the end of}} the Amidah, without any special chant or gestures. This Ashkenazic practice is based on a Rabbinic ruling of the Remoh, who argued that the Kohanim were commanded to bless the people with joy (besimcha) and that Kohanim in the diaspora could not be expected to feel joyful except on the above-mentioned holidays where all Jews are commanded to feel joy.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink.</b> Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began}} to shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

60|$|Elma {{heard no}} more of that pompous speech. Her knees shook under her. For she was aware only of Mrs. Clifford's eyes, fixed mildly and calmly upon her face, not in anger, as she feared, or reproach, but rather in {{infinite}} pity. For a second their glances met in mute intercourse of soul, then each dropped their eyelashes as suddenly as before. Through {{the rest of that}} lunch Elma sat as in a maze, hearing and seeing nothing. What she <b>ate,</b> <b>or</b> <b>drank,</b> <b>or</b> talked about, she knew not. Mr. Gildersleeve's pungent and embellished anecdotes of the Kelmscott family and their unneighbourly pride went in at one ear and out at the other. All she was conscious of was her mother's sympathetic yet unerring eye; she felt sure that at one glance that wonderful thought-reader had divined everything, and seen through and through their interview that morning.|$|R

500|$|The Protoss are humanoids, [...] {{with two}} {{luminous}} eyes, typically gold, green, or blue. With two fingers {{flanked by two}} opposable thumbs on each hand, two large toes on each foot (four small toes in earlier games), digitigrade legs, broad chests and shoulders with narrow waists, Protoss are very agile and physically strong. A bony crest extends back from the crown of the head, with long neural strands sprouting {{from the back of}} the head. These strands facilitate the basic psychic communal link all Protoss naturally share. Each Protoss has a different skin shade that corresponds to the tribe from which they are descended. The Protoss do not possess any visible ears (but they can hear, as when Terrans speak to them or hear what they are thinking), mouths or noses, but are able to communicate telepathically and possess strong olfactory sensitivities. Protoss do not need to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink,</b> but are shown in The Dark Templar Saga to instead absorb energy from a form of photosynthesis. The average life expectancy for a Protoss is about one thousand years. Little is known of the internal anatomy of the Protoss.|$|E
500|$|The Quakers {{emigrated to}} the New World from the {{northern}} English Midlands during the 17th century, and eventually settled primarily in the Delaware Valley. They were similar to the Puritans in the strictness that they applied to everyday life, though their religious teachings were far different. Their food was plain and simple. Excessive consumption was discouraged and failure to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> <b>drink</b> moderately was punished with public acts of criticism. William Penn was the founder of Pennsylvania and an important figure {{in the development of}} the Quaker movement, and he encouraged frugality in his followers with advice such as, [...] "If thou rise with an appetite thou are sure never to sit down without one". The Quakers, like the Puritans, encountered an abundance of food in the New World: forests rich with game and berries, streams teeming with fish, and abundant flocks of birds. Still the asceticism persevered. Many Quakers avoided eating butter as a form of self-mortification, and the most eccentric followers would avoid tea and meat. The idealist and pacifist ideas of the Quakers also encouraged many to boycott products that were considered to be tainted by sin. This included butter, due to its role in raising war taxes, and coffee, because it was produced by slave labor. Eating habits were more egalitarian than those of either the Puritans or the Virginian Anglicans. At meals, entire households would dine at the same table, including children and servants.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in May and June, and {{fighting}} among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season.
