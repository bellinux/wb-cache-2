5|$|Sanders {{says that}} Jesus' mission {{was not about}} repentance, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist's message, and that Jesus' ministry {{would not have been}} scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.|$|E

However, <b>he</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> {{most of the}} facts {{illustrated}} in the book were already known (although appearing in works in several languages).

25|$|Everything {{that the}} Meditator has {{accepted}} as most true {{he has come}} to learn from or through his senses. <b>He</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> sometimes the senses can deceive, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, and that our sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. The Meditator acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly not one of them and needn't worry himself about that.|$|E
25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. <b>He</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Renpō Niwa, {{a former}} abbot of Eihei-ji, divides the texts into five parts. The first {{part is the}} preface in which Dōgen {{emphasizes}} the importance of the work of the tenzo, or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with which it should be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of Dōgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. <b>He</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape Sōtō Zen in Japan. Next, Dōgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without any thought of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded with a discussion of the Three Minds (Sanshin, 三心), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.|$|E

500|$|Motohiro {{allowed his}} team to use very graphic elements, even though they could reduce female viewership. <b>He</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> the series may be too violent for a younger {{demographic}} {{and said that he}} would not want his son to watch it because of its psychological brutality. He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an [...] "artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it". About the amount of violence, Shiotani told Urobuchi, [...] "just let us deal with it". Some of these violent scenes occur off-camera, but whenever a protagonist was involved the moment was developed to be memorable. The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went [...] "overboard." ...|$|E
500|$|Cruachan {{were formed}} in 1992 in Dublin, Ireland. From the outset their {{intention}} was to mix the native Irish folk music of their home country with the more extreme side of metal music. Their debut album Tuatha Na Gael was released in 1995 and was a full folk metal album from start to finish. In the Italian book “FOLK METAL, Dalle Origini Al Ragnarok”, a comprehensive history of the genre, Author Fabrizio Giosue credits Cruachan as being the very first real Folk Metal band. <b>He</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> Skyclad did have some folk parts in some songs before Cruachan however {{he goes on to}} say Cruachan used folk music as much as they used heavy metal music. Cruachan also used arrangements of known folk songs and melodies, Skyclad wrote folk [...] "sounding" [...] parts.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{measures}} {{the consequences of}} his actions in terms of their karmic effect, a preoccupation he had first embraced in his songwriting over 1966–67 with songs such as [...] "Art of Dying". In the third verse, <b>he</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> all thoughts and deeds affect the world, since [...] "A pebble in the ocean must cause some kind of stir". Recognising his culpability, Harrison concludes: [...] "The action that I've started sometime I'll have to face / My influence in motion rebounding back through space." [...] In their respective commentaries on [...] "Simply Shady", Christian theologian Dale Allison cites Harrison's indictment of his behaviour in the context of karmic retribution as evidence of the composition offering [...] "religious interest", while Inglis highlights an important contrast between Harrison's lack of moralising in the song relative to the sermonising quality of his 1973 album Living in the Material World.|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Brynden [...] "Blackfish" [...] Tully in the series, {{spoke about}} his character's {{encounter}} with Brienne of Tarth, {{in an interview}} with IGN, noting [...] "Brienne represented for him his young self, a person of integrity, a soldier of integrity, {{trying to do the right}} thing. That added to the conflict he felt of what was the right thing to do: whether to send men to Sansa or not." [...] He continued by saying about their relationship to each other, [...] "She spoke very clearly to power. She was talking to an older man who's, initially, very irritated by her being there, but eventually takes her very, very seriously. There's a touching moment where <b>he</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> to her face. It's very touching and sad, and I think that's what it's about. He's really recognizing the next generation of what I once was." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{alternates}} between {{color and}} black and white sequences. Black and white usually denotes that the scene involves {{one or more of}} the hustlers engaged with a client, and indicates that {{one or more of the}} characters (not necessarily the client) is fantasizing. But the scheme is not always consistent: for example, when Dean has sex with the paralyzed client the scene is in color; and Harry also has an S/M scene that's all in color (although his client never appears on-screen). Equally, Harry's fantasies about [...] "Lovely Girl" [...] (who is apparently dead) are occasionally in color. In their final scene, Harry and Dean are in black and white, but when the client and Ghislaine are shown watching they're in color, raising the question of exactly who is having the fantasy. According to Lewis, the convention grew out of the fact that the initial improvised sequences were shot in black and white; <b>he</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> by the end the distinction had become [...] "very confused." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's script had to {{be reduced}} to one fourth of its {{original}} length due to cartridge storage limits, but Tokita made sure only [...] "unnecessary dialogue" [...] was cut, rather than actual story elements. As the graphical capacities of the Super Famicom allowed regular series character designer Yoshitaka Amano to make more elaborate character designs {{than in the previous}} installments, with the characters' personalities already evident from the images, Tokita felt the reduced script length improved the pacing of the game. Still, <b>he</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> some parts of the story were [...] "unclear" [...] or were not [...] "looked at in depth" [...] until later ports and remakes. One of the ideas not included, due to time and space constraints, was a dungeon {{near the end of the}} game where each character would have to progress on their own—this dungeon would only be included in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, as the Lunar Ruins.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{the music}} of Wu-Tang Clan and citing American singer Pharrell Williams as his [...] "musical hero", G-Dragon participated in the annual hip hop Flex album in 2001 {{at the age of}} 12, {{establishing}} his career as an artist. He has also listed Jinusean, Fabolous and Kanye West as his influences. During the early days of Big Bang's career, the band was marketed predominately as a hip-hop group, though they went on to experiment with electronic music and setting it as the new music trend in Korea. From previous exposure to a range of genres with Big Bang, G-Dragon incorporated a mix of dance, hip-hop, and R songs into Heartbreaker. During the production for the collaboration album GD & TOP, G-Dragon opted for a more hip-hop sound, though <b>he</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> R, acoustic, and electronic music heavily influenced it. His second album, Coup d'Etat, is noted for being an eclectic mix of hip-hop, dubstep, rock, electro, and pop.|$|E
500|$|No one professes to {{have seen}} Home carried from window to window. Home told the three men who were present {{that he was going}} to be wafted, and he thus set up a state of very nervous expectation... Both Lord Crawford and Lord Adare say that they were warned. Then Lord Crawford says that he saw the shadow on the wall of Home {{entering}} the room horizontally; and as the moon, by whose light he professes {{to have seen}} the shadow, was at the most only three days old, his testimony is absolutely worthless. Lord Adare claims only that he saw Home, in the dark, [...] "standing upright outside our window." [...] In the dark—it was an almost moonless December night—one could not, as a matter of fact, say very positively whether Home was outside or inside; but, in any case, <b>he</b> <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> there was a nineteen-inch window-sill outside the window, and Home could stand on that.|$|E
