40|$|The {{catalytic}} hydrodefluorination (HDF) of pentafluoropyridine in {{the presence}} of arylsilanes is catalyzed by the tungsten and molybdenum(IV) cluster hydrides of formula [M 3 S 4 H 3 (dmpe) 3]+, W- 1 + for M = W and Mo- 1 + for M = Mo (dmpe = 1, 2 -(bis) dimethylphosphinoethane). The reaction proceeds regioselectively at the 4 -position under microwave radiation to yield the 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrafluoropyridine. Catalytic activity is higher for the tungsten complexes with turnover numbers close to 100, while reactions catalyzed by molybdenum compounds are faster. A mechanism for the HDF reaction has been proposed that explains these differences based on DFT calculations. The mechanism involves partial decoordination of the diphosphine ligand that generates an empty position in the metal coordination sphere. This position together with its neighbor M−H site are used to activate the C−F bond of the pentafluoropyridine through a M−H/C−F σ-bond metathesis mechanism involving a four-center transition state to give 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrafluoropyridine. Subsequent coordination of the dangling diphosphine affords the para-substituted product and the [M 3 S 4 F 3 (dmpe) 3]+, W- 2 + for M = W and Mo- 2 + for M = Mo, cluster fluoride. The structure of W- 2 + has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. In the presence of silanes the calculated mechanism for the cluster <b>hydride</b> <b>regeneration</b> also implies three steps: (i) partial decoordination of the diphosphine, (ii) M−F/Si−H σ-bond metathesis, and (iii) coordination of the dangling diphosphine, to afford the cluster hydride...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of efficient and safe methods for hydrogen storage {{is a major}} hurdle that must be overcome to enable the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier. The objectives of this project in the DOE Center of Excellence in Chemical Hydride Storage were both to develop new methods for on-demand, low temperature hydrogen release from chemical hydrides and to design high-conversion off-board methods for chemical <b>hydride</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Because of their reactive protic (N-H) and hydridic (B-H) hydrogens and high hydrogen contents, amineboranes such as ammonia borane, NH 3 BH 3 (AB), 19. 6 -wt% H 2, and ammonia triborane NH 3 B 3 H 7 (AT), 17. 7 -wt% H 2, were initially identified by the Center as promising, high-capacity chemical hydrogen storage materials {{with the potential to}} store and deliver molecular hydrogen through dehydrogenation and hydrolysis reactions. In collaboration with other Center partners, the Penn project focused both on new methods to induce amineborane H 2 -release and on new strategies for the regeneration the amineborane spent-fuel materials. The Penn approach to improving amineborane H 2 -release focused on the use of ionic liquids, base additives and metal catalysts to activate AB dehydrogenation and these studies successfully demonstrated that in ionic liquids the AB induction period that had been observed in the solid-state was eliminated and both the rate and extent of AB H 2 -release were significantly increased. These results have clearly shown that, while improvements are still necessary, many of these systems have the potential to achieve DOE hydrogen-storage goals. The high extent of their H 2 ­-release, the tunability of both their H 2 materials weight-percents and release rates, and their product control that is attained by either trapping or suppressing unwanted volatile side products, such as borazine, continue to make AB/ionic­-liquid based systems attractive candidates for chemical hydrogen storage applications. These studies also demonstrated that H 2 -­release from chemical hydrides can occur by a number of different mechanistic pathways and strongly suggest that optimal chemical ­hydride based H 2 ­release systems may require the use of synergistic dehydrogenation methods to induce H 2 ­-loss from chemically different intermediates formed during release reactions. The efficient regeneration of ammonia borane from BNHx spent fuel {{is one of the most}} challenging problems that will have to be overcome in order to utilize AB-based hydrogen storage. Three Center partners, LANL, PNNL and Penn, each took different complimentary approaches to AB regeneration. The Penn approach focused on a strategy involving spent-fuel digestion with superacidic acids to produce boron-halides (BX 3) that could then be converted to AB by coordination/reduction/displacement processes. While the Penn boron-halide reduction studies successfully demonstrated that a dialkylsulfide-based coordination/reduction/displacement process gave quantitative conversions of BBr 3 to ammonia borane with efficient and safe product separations, the fact that AB spent-fuels could not be digested in good yields to BX 3 halides led to a No-Go decision on this overall AB-regeneration strategy...|$|E
