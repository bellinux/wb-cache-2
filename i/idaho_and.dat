5|$|River otters are {{renowned for}} {{their sense of}} play. Otter play mostly {{consists}} of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game.

5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared.

Soon, however, the Washington, <b>Idaho</b> <b>and</b> Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, <b>Idaho,</b> <b>and</b> Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border.
