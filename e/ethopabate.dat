40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of anti-coccidials on the field isolates and laboratory strain of E. maxima. The five drugs tested were mixed in the feed and the level used in parts per million (ppm) were: Salinomycin (66 pm), Monensin (121 pm), Nicarbazin (125 pm), <b>ethopabate</b> (40 pm), now called amprolium + Lasalocid Birds were raised in batteries with continuous lighting and were fed and libitum 3 times daily. Each bird was weighted individually at (D- 2, D, D+ 5, D+ 7 and D+ 14 (D=day of infection with sporulated oocysts). Of the five anticoccidial drugs studied, Amprolium plus <b>ethopabate</b> was found most efficacious. The least efficacious drugs were Nicarbazin and Lasalocid, whereas, Salinmycin and Monesin showed medium efficacy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{anticoccidial}} agent monensin {{has been}} tested in 5 floor-pen experi-ments and compared with unmedicated and with positive control treatments (amprolium + <b>ethopabate</b> in 4, clopidol in 2 and zoalene in 1 experiment). Severity of coccidiosis ex-posure was increased by an oocyst-seeding technique, increasing litter moisture content to 30 % or higher, and various attempts to prevent early development of immunity. Coccidio-sis-associated mortality occurred in only 0. 06 % of 1 SS 2 birds on monensin (with or with-out roxarsone), 1. 41 % of 1556 birds on amprolium + <b>ethopabate</b> (with or without roxar-sone), 0. 05 % of 200 birds on zoalene (with roxarsone), 0 % of 401 birds on clopidol (with roxarsone) and 6. 0 % of 1750 birds on unmedicated feed. Coccidiosis-associated mortality occurred in 1 / 31 pens on monensin (when fed at the recommended level), 15 / 31 pens on amprolium plus <b>ethopabate,</b> 1 / 4 on zoalene, 0 / 8 on clopidol and 33 / 45 pens on unmedi-cated feed. Weight gains of monensin-medicated treatments (with or without roxarsone) were significantly greater (P < 0. 05) in 16 / 17 possible treatment comparisons with un-medicated birds. Feed conversion was improved in 11 / 17 comparisons. Monensin and other anticoccidial agents partially or completely suppressed development of lesions and lesio...|$|E
40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of fourteen prohibited medicinal additives in pig and poultry compound feed. These compounds are prohibited for use as feed additives although some are still authorised for use in medicated feed. Feed samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of sodium sulphate. The extracts undergo a hexane wash to aid with sample purification. The extracts are then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. The samples undergo an ultracentrifugation step prior to injection onto the LC-MS/MS system and are analysed in a run time of 26 minutes. The LC-MS/MS system is run in MRM mode with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method was validated over three days and is capable of quantitatively analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, ipronidazole, chloramphenicol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, dinitolimide, <b>ethopabate,</b> carbadox and clopidol. The method is also capable of qualitatively analysing for tylosin, virginiamycin and avilamycin. A level of 100 Î¼g kg- 1 was used for validation purposes and the method is capable of analysing to this level for all the compounds. Validation criteria of trueness, precision, repeatability and reproducibility along with measurement uncertainty are calculated for all analytes...|$|E
40|$|Only 3 out of 8 South African {{isolates}} of Plasmodium durae used in 524 turkeys in 161 passages caused approximately 50 % mortality, {{a further}} 3 produced approximately 10 % mortality while 2 {{were found to}} be apathogenic. Exoerythrocytic schizonts were the main pathogenic stage. In most survivors the effect on mass gains was minimal. Twelve drugs currently available for use in poultry, as well as chloroquin phosphate, were tested for their activity against experimental infections with Plasmodium durae in domestic turkeys. While chloroquin phosphate showed a certain degree of effectivity, Amprolium, Amprolium + <b>Ethopabate,</b> Maduramycin, Toltrazuril, Metronidazole, Furazolidone, Enrofloxacin and Sulfamethoxypyridazine + Trimethoprim were ineffective. Halofuginone and Penta-Sulfa at a high dose had some protective effect. At high doses Sulfachloropyrazine protected from mortality without affecting the parasitaemia, while Sulfamonomethoxine suppressed parasitaemia without entirely protecting from mortality. From these data it is concluded that Halofuginone has a potential as possible chemoprophylactic. While a combination of Sulfamonomethoxine and Sulfachloropyrazine could be used in the treatment of outbreaks in the field. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.
