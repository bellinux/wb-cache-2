5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 October 1961, a {{group of}} campaigners {{including}} J. M. Richards, {{the editor of the}} Architectural Review, went to see Harold Macmillan, the Conservative Prime Minister, to plead for the preservation of the arch, arguing that if it really had to be moved, that it should be dismantled and re-erected elsewhere. As J. M. Richards recalled, [...] "Macmillan listened – or <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> listened [...] he sat without moving with his eyes apparently closed. He asked no questions; in fact he said nothing except that he would consider the matter." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{looked up}} and saw a Franciscan friar {{standing}} by my side. On his back he bore a sack; <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> was collecting food.|$|R
2500|$|The driving {{intellectual}} curiosity {{that was}} to distinguish Paul Wild was evident from an early age. He said, [...] " [...] showed great appreciation if ever I was successful in anything but she didn't push me." [...] He was interested in building things with model house kits, Meccano and cardboard; an early gift of a Hornby train from his mother started him on his lifelong love of trains. Then he [...] "read about the great man Isambard Kingdom Brunel and all his works, which were not only railways but the extraordinary ships that he built at the time. Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> was the first source of inspiration to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2002 {{review of}} NKS, the Nobel laureate and {{elementary}} particle physicist Steven Weinberg wrote, [...] "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> can't resist trying to apply {{his experience with}} digital computer programs {{to the laws of}} nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that {{this is the sort of}} system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> bribed her. She'd do {{anything}} for a hundred dollars.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody except your valet, sir--Parker. He said he {{had come}} to fetch some things away. <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> had come from you, sir, with instructions." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Milray gave a {{start of}} alarm. She said, to gain time: [...] "How did <b>he</b> get here? <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> was in Germany with his--" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS, crestfallen: 'I can't {{feel that}} Edward was to blame. Ed--Oh, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he's</b> {{gone off to}} make himself presentable. But Willis--Where's Willis, Aunt Mary?' ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. [To herself] Yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> {{has made}} her his superior.|$|E
60|$|LOMAX. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> hasn't seen Sarah {{since she}} was a little kid.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; not as yet. Your papa is {{very much}} troubled about it, and I fear he is not very well. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> must go to this electioneering dinner. When gentlemen take up that sort of thing, they must go on with it. And as they wish your father to preside over the petition, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> he can't very well help himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{coming over}} here," [...] said Richard. [...] "We'll {{get in this}} hallway and see him as <b>he</b> passes. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he's</b> a {{stranger}} to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{knew the}} little rascal was lying, but I didn't say anything. The second said, [...] "Why, that is amazing shooting; <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> couldn't hit a church." ...|$|R
6000|$|I wasn't frightened. He {{seemed quite}} respectable, I thought, and <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> was some {{intimate}} friend of Uncle Norman's. I rose politely and said, [...] "Good day." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> will. I wish he'd be quick. [Violently.] I {{must see}} George.|$|E
60|$|MORRIS. How do {{you know}} he's a wizard? <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> plays some tricks on you.|$|E
60|$|REV. S. Oh, in that case, {{of course}} we shall only be too happy. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> knows the Duke personally.|$|E
6000|$|Then, <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> {{had a fine}} business, and Wemmick said, [...] "Ca-pi-tal!" [...] Then I {{asked if}} there were many clerks? to which he replied,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{discarded}} mistress," [...] {{he muttered}} to himself. [...] "Just had another scene, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>He's</b> {{got tired of}} her, and she's given him away out of spite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} he is not," [...] said Arthur. [...] "I've no right to say a word against him. From what Wharton says <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he's</b> rich." ...|$|R
60|$|DOLLY. For fun, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>He</b> had {{to measure}} my finger for a ring. You'd {{have done the}} same thing yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> has--explained," [...] said Mr. Brumley {{slowly and}} with {{infinite}} distaste. [...] "Lady Harman, {{what has he}} explained?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Katherine, Jack Willoughby has {{developed}} into quite a passable-looking fellow, {{although he is}} rather shabby. But <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> is poor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poh! {{quarrel with}} him? whom did I ever quarrel with? If he barks, I'll stop {{his mouth with}} a good dinner. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he's</b> gentleman enough, to invite?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He put {{his name}} down for three dances, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he's</b> coming for them. What a bore!" [...] said Meg, {{assuming}} a languid air which amused Laurie immensely.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> {{had gone}} on ahead and hurried to catch him. But in this I was mistaken, for in no {{direction}} could I catch sight of the gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|His Majesty {{regarded}} the steed critically. [...] "He doesn't seem especially graceful!" [...] he remarked, musingly. [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> can run?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Looking {{after her}} grandfather, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>He</b> was {{imbecile}} all {{the latter part}} of his life. Poor John, they were both regularly sacrificed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Roger, he said--oh, I can't bear {{to think}} about it! <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he</b> blabs it to everybody, too, and they will think----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know as he does," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Bolton simply. [...] "He's rather of an absent-minded man, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he's</b> {{like other}} men {{when he gets}} talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still selling 'em fish, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>He's</b> a darling! But I wish I {{could get}} this filthy paint off my hands. Hallo! What the deuce is the Cryptic signalling?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose there's {{no chance}} of this Sleeper asserting himself. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>he's</b> certain to be a puppet--in Ostrog's hands or the Council's, {{as soon as the}} {{struggle}} is over." ...|$|R
