40|$|Rapid and {{quantitative}} sensing of aflatoxin B 1 with high {{sensitivity and specificity}} has drawn increased attention of studies investigating soybean sauce. A sensitive and rapid quantitative immunochromatographic sensing method was developed {{for the detection of}} aflatoxin B 1 based on time-resolved fluorescence. It combines the advantages of time-resolved fluorescent sensing and immunochromatography. The dynamic range of a competitive and portable immunoassay was 0. 3 – 10. 0 µg·kg− 1, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 1 µg·kg− 1 and recoveries of 87. 2 %– 114. 3 %, within 10 min. The results showed good correlation (R 2 > 0. 99) between time-resolved <b>fluorescent</b> immunochromatographic <b>strip</b> test and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Soybean sauce samples analyzed using time-resolved <b>fluorescent</b> immunochromatographic <b>strip</b> test revealed that 64. 2 % of samples contained aflatoxin B 1 at levels ranging from 0. 31 to 12. 5 µg·kg− 1. The strip test is a rapid, sensitive, quantitative, and cost-effective on-site screening technique in food safety analysis...|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, {{lateral flow}} immunochromatographic assays are {{increasingly}} popular as a diagnostic tool for point-of-care (POC) test {{based on their}} simplicity, specificity, and sensitivity. Hence, quantitative detection and pluralistic popular application are urgently needed in medical examination. In this study, a smartphone-based dual-modality imaging system was developed for quantitative detection of color or fluorescent lateral flow test strips, which can be operated anywhere at any time. In this system, the white and ultra-violet (UV) light of optical device was designed, which was tunable with different strips, and the Sobel operator algorithm {{was used in the}} software, which could enhance the identification ability to recognize the test area from the background boundary information. Moreover, this technology based on extraction of the components from RGB format (red, green, and blue) of color strips or only red format of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>strips</b> can obviously improve the high-signal intensity and sensitivity. Fifty samples were used to evaluate the accuracy of this system, and the ideal detection limit was calculated separately from detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The results indicated that smartphone-controlled dual-modality imaging system could provide various POC diagnoses, which becomes a potential technology for developing the next-generation of portable system in the near future.|$|R

30|$|Until now, {{the typical}} {{detection}} based on LFICS {{is through the}} naked eye, which was widely used in food safety, environment monitoring, and precision medicine. However, this detection can only provide qualitative test (positive or negative) or semi-quantitative information on analyte concentration, which the LFICS could not satisfy requirements for practical applications. Therefore, many devices providing quantitative analyte concentration for testing LFICS had been developed [9, 21]. Some strip readers were designed {{to work in the}} desktop computer or laptop, which possessed rapid processing speeds and stable performances. However, these bulky and heavy devices limited their wide application for the trend of family and personalize care. Mei’s group developed an embedded system based on the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM) processor, which applied for reading a test strip [22]. Marquina’s group designed a spin-valve giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor system to quantify the amount of analyte, which were not portable for outdoor detection [23]. Obviously, the strip reader based on mobile device could be satisfied with the requirement of high portability and feature-rich testing. As a matter fact, the mobile health market is rapidly developing and portable diagnostics tools provide an opportunity to increase the availability of healthcare and decrease costs [24]. Therefore, various strip readers based on mobile device have been developed. For example, Oncescu’s group developed a smartphone accessory and software application based on smartphone that allowed for the quantification of cholesterol levels in the blood [25] and Hyun Park’s group developed a kind of strip reader for quantitative measurements of H 5 N 1 using <b>fluorescent</b> <b>strips</b> [26]. Meanwhile, some other strip readers based on smartphone were obtained, such as testing thyroid-stimulating hormone, cholesterol, malaria, and tuberculosis [9, 27 – 32]. However, all the strip readers based on smartphone only can detect one type of strips from the color or fluorescence which limited their multifunctional applications [33 – 36].|$|R

Refurbishing of carriages for the Picton-Christchurch express meant that by late 1982 {{it was able}} to be operated by more comfortable AC cars. The northbound service left Wellington at 7:45am and reached Gisborne at 6:30pm, the southbound left Gisborne at 9:55am and reached Wellington at 8:40pm. As it lacked a buffet car, stops were made for refreshments in Napier and Palmerston North. Around this time, the train stopped carrying its distinctive headboard.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{study and}} our {{laboratory}} {{have reported that}} short-wavelength (blue and green) light and combination stimulate broiler growth. However, short-wavelength stimuli could have negative effects on poultry husbandry workers. The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of human-friendly yellow LED light, which is acceptable to humans and close to green light, on broiler growth. We also aimed to investigate the potential quantitative relationship between the wavelengths of light used for artificial illumination and growth parameters in broilers. After hatching, 360 female chicks ("Meihuang" were evenly divided into six lighting treatment groups: white LED strips (400 - 700 nm, WL); red LED strips (620 nm, RL); yellow LED strips (580 nm, YL); green LED strips (514 nm, GL); blue LED strips (455 nm, BL); and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>strips</b> (400 - 700 nm, FL). From 30 to 72 days of age, broilers reared under YL and GL were heavier than broilers treated with FL (P 0. 05). Moreover, YL significantly improved feeding efficiency when compared with GL and BL at 45 and 60 days of age (P < 0. 05). In addition, we found an age-dependent effect of light spectra on broiler growth and a quantitative relationship between LED light spectra (455 to 620 nm) and the live body weights of broilers. The wavelength of light (455 to 620 nm) was found to be negatively related (R 2 = 0. 876) to live body weight at an early stage of development, whereas the wavelength of light (455 to 620 nm) was found to be positively correlated with live body weight (R 2 = 0. 925) in older chickens. Our results demonstrated that human-friendly yellow LED light (YL), which is friendly to the human, {{can be applied to the}} broilers production...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{synthesis}} {{of a novel}} tetraphenylethene- 2 -pyrone (TPEP) conjugate exhibiting donor acceptor characteristics is reported. The localized frontier molecular orbitals (DFT studies) and the solvent polarity dependent photoluminescence characteristics directly corroborate the presence of intramolecular charge transfer character in TPEP. TPEP is poorly emissive in the solution state. In contrast; upon aggregation (THF/water mixtures), TPEP exhibits aggregation induced emission enhancement. Upon aggregation, dyad TPEP forms a fluorescent nanoaggregate which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy imaging studies. The luminescence nanoaggregates were elegantly exploited for selective detection of nitro aromatic compounds (NACs). It was found that nanoaggregates of TPEP were selectively sensing the picric acid over the other NACs. Efficiency of the quenching process was further evaluated by the Stern-Volmer equation. TPEP-based low-cost <b>fluorescent</b> test <b>strips</b> were developed for the selective detection of picric acid...|$|R
40|$|Fingerprints {{in blood}} {{indicate}} a threshold of violence has been surpassed in crime scenarios - making the crime resolution more urgent. There exist multiple processes that enhance a blood fingerprint {{in its original}} position, or in-situ, with reliability so that an image can be obtained. However, blood fingerprint evidence that cannot directly be transported to a laboratory for further analysis, due to the size or mobility of the substrate, calls for portability. In 2010 Zar-Pro <b>Fluorescent</b> Blood Lifting <b>Strips</b> were patented by Jessica Zarate as a "fluorogenic method for lifting, enhancing, and preserving blood impression evidence". The lifted prints are also inherently fluorescent to further increase enhancement and contrast of the print. There are currently no studies comparing Zar-Pro results {{with the results of}} other laboratory enhancement methods. This experiment compared Zar-Pro to other non-portable and frequently used alternatives - blood peak absorption and Hungarian Red enhancement to determine if Zar-Pro gives better blood fingerprint enhancement results than other non-portable alternatives - ALS visualization and Hungarian Red enhancement. In this study, Zar-Pro methods produced more reliable and reproducible results over the Hungarian Red and blood peak absorption methods on white and black ceramic tile. From this study, one can also conclude that ALS peak absorption is better suited for the location of blood prints on a light-colored item of evidence, rather than an enhancement method of blood prints...|$|R

30|$|The {{chromatic}} value L xy {{output from}} the iPhone 6 S {{was chosen as}} the parameter to compare to the L xy output of the X-Rite I 1 Pro, furthermore, the value of SQRY (x** 2  + y** 2) = Y can be used to evaluate a degree of yellowing (Y) from both instruments corresponding to a path of increasing yellowness in the CIE chromaticity two dimensional plot [14]. The measurement of identical proxy journal samples indicated that the light source, the AWB balance on the smartphone and sample to lens distance had the largest effect on L xy output. Trials were established for three archive samples exhibiting different degrees of yellowing. Both iPhones were held at distances between 7 and 1  cm at 1  cm intervals {{in a number of different}} lighting conditions as follows (1) natural sunlight indoors (2) <b>fluorescent</b> <b>strip</b> lighting of the archive (3) LED lamp at a distance of 10  cm (4) A second iPhone LED light held in a clamp allowed LED light to flood the axis of sample to lens. Results of the trial (not shown) indicated that the closest obtainable values to those of the X-Rite I 1 Pro, were obtained using illumination from a second iPhone at right angles to the detecting iPhone (at a distance 6  cm from sample) with a detecting camera lens to sample distance of 4  cm, irrespective of which iPhone was used as detector. This set up with AWB locked on the smartphone app was used in the subsequent sampling of the journal archive.|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} demand {{on the current}} highway system has caused transportation agencies to increase scheduling for nighttime work in order to alleviate daytime work zone congestion, especially during peak traffic hours. Although traffic congestion is reduced, safety in nighttime workzones remains a concern among both transportation agencies and contractors. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), approximately one-half of the fatalities that occurred in workzones nationwide occurred at night. These work zone statistics have received increased attention among agencies to evaluate planning and safety issues concerning the workers {{and the general public}} on nighttime workzones. Four separate, but interrelated research studies were conducted between September 2005 - May 2007 to address safety issues in nighttime construction and maintenance projects on highways in Indiana. The first study investigated owner and contractor safety management planning for nighttime construction and maintenance operations, while the second study investigated traffic control planning and implementation procedures for nighttime construction and maintenance operations. The third study investigated the effectiveness of speed control measures on nighttime construction and maintenance projects and the fourth study evaluated the effectiveness of high-visibility personal protective equipment practices. The safety management practices of the general contractor heavily influence the perception of safety of nighttime construction workers. Workers and general contractors have similar perceptions about the strategies necessary to improve safety on the nighttime construction jobsite. Frequently, the safety threat presented by the general public is cited by nighttime construction and maintenance workers as making them feel unsafe on the jobsite. Methods to raise the awareness of the general public about nighttime construction are needed in order to improve the safety of the nighttime construction and maintenance workers from the dangers imposed by the general public. Traffic control planning by highway agencies and contractors impact the supervisors’ and the workers’ perceptions of safety. The results from the formal interviews with Indiana contractors and Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) personnel indicated that contractors are becoming more involved in traffic control planning. Increased law enforcement and public awareness were among the most important traffic control strategies for improved nighttime safety indicated by the supervisors and the workers. The presence of police enforcement, a high percentage of semi trucks in the traffic, and a high flow rate – all reduced mean speed through nighttime workzones Changeable message signs, while more expensive than work zone speed limit signs, are already being used on many nighttime workzones but were not found to affect mean speeds. Police enforcement was found to reduce mean speeds, was the most expensive method of speed control in the study. The safety garment currently used by the workers of the Indiana Department of Transportation is a yellow-green safety vest with a four-inch wide <b>fluorescent</b> orange <b>strip</b> with two one-inch strips of reflective silver material. The visibility of the safety vest currently used by INDOT can be increased by adding a secondary high-visibility PPE such as safety pants and/or retroreflective bands. Current safety training in personal protective equipment (PPE) is focused on which PPE is applicable for a certain type of job and how to use the PPE. However, training workers how to maintain the PPE will increase its useful life, resulting in savings for the owner and/or the general contractor. In order to improve the visibility of current PPE garments there should be differences in the values of retroreflectivity between the primary and secondary high-visibility PPE and larger variance in the retroreflectivity values across the garment. In addition, the garments should be changed or rotated with other garments periodically to ensure that the attention of drivers is being captured...|$|R
40|$|In {{the mature}} ram pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH) are {{released}} from the anterior pituitary every few hours randomly throughout the day {{to appear in the}} peripheral circulation as transitory surges in the hormone concentration (Katongole, Naftolin & Short, 1974; Sanford, Winter, Palmer & Howland, 1974). Since the episodic secretory patterns recorded in the peripheral blood develop during puberty (Foster, 1974) and change in relation to the breeding season (Lincoln, 1976), they clearly have some bearing on the functional state of the testes. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the episodic nature of LH secretion in sheep exposed to different photoperiods. Rams of the Soay breed were selected since they have conspicuous seasonal changes in reproduc-tive physiology (Lincoln, 1976) and behaviour (Jewell, Milner & Morton Boyd, 1974).
