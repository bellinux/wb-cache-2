25|$|In the pietà the {{sculptor}} has added two angels at {{either side of}} the Virgin Mary. They appear to be tenderly lifting her veil <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> with one hand whilst the other hands rest on Jesus' head and knee.|$|E
2500|$|... wears a houppelande of {{dark blue}} figured fabric {{with a narrow}} belt. [...] Her hair is shaved back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> and she wears a blunt pointed cap (now over-restored), France or Flanders, c. 1410.|$|E
60|$|A little wearily {{she pushed}} back {{the masses of}} hair <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead.</b> Her head rested for a moment upon her fingers. Her eyes {{deliberately}} sought mine.|$|E
60|$|After a few minutes, Lucile made {{a violent}} effort to compose herself, wiped the {{moisture}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> pallid <b>forehead</b> and dried the tears which still hung upon her lashes. Then she rose <b>from</b> <b>her</b> chair and walked resolutely {{up to the}} desk.|$|R
60|$|The veil fell <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} <b>forehead.</b> She {{gazed into}} his eyes one moment {{with a look of}} terrified inquiry, and saw nothing there but love.... And clinging heart to heart, brother and sister mingled holy kisses, and strained nearer and nearer still, as if to satisfy their last lingering doubts of each other's kin.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a Hopi Indian woman {{mounting}} {{the ladder}} to her dwelling, ca. 1900. She carries a load (of clothing?) in a cloth hammock slung to <b>her</b> back <b>from</b> around <b>her</b> <b>forehead.</b> She is wearing a long print dress. She is barefoot. A stovepipe sticks out of the roof {{near the top of}} the ladder. A boy sits on the roof of one of the pueblo dwellings in the background at right...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} have," [...] he answered, gravely, {{and took her}} in his arms, and {{smoothed}} her hair <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> and very tenderly kissed her lips.|$|E
60|$|She drew {{away and}} {{smoothed}} her ruffled hair back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> looking ruefully {{in the glass}} at her tear-stained cheeks, and down at the crushed violets in her corsage.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{took one}} of her hands down <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> and held it in his,--which she allowed passively. She was thinking, no doubt, of {{something}} far different from that.|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{assertion}} and showiness in {{the expanse of}} white skin - <b>from</b> <b>her</b> high <b>forehead</b> down <b>her</b> graceful neck, shoulders, and arms. Although the black of her dress is bold, it is also deep, recessive and mysterious. She {{is surrounded by a}} rich brown which is at once luminous and dark enough to provide contrast to the skin tones. Most disconcerting is the whiteness of the skin, an overt contrivance of [...] "aristocratic pallor"; by contrast her red ear is a jarring reminder of the color of flesh unadorned.|$|R
5000|$|Clyde {{went off}} injured after scoring {{the first try}} and Laurie Daley knocked himself out in the in-goal just after half-time. Ben Elias {{returned}} in the second-half his face smeared with blood and a red-stained bandage around his head to take over as captain due to Daley's departure {{and to protect the}} Blues' lead. This led to one of Origin's enduring images when photographers and broadcast cameramen captured shots after the final siren of Elias' mother Barbara on the field and working around interviewers, mopping up the still flowing blood <b>from</b> <b>her</b> son's <b>forehead</b> as he spoke post-match.|$|R
6000|$|Enoch rose, [...] Cast {{his strong}} arms about his {{drooping}} wife, [...] And kiss'd his wonder-stricken little ones; [...] But for the third, sickly one, who slept [...] After {{a night of}} feverous wakefulness, [...] When Annie would have raised him Enoch said [...] 'Wake him not; let him sleep; how should this child [...] Remember this?' and kiss'ed him in his cot. [...] But Annie <b>from</b> <b>her</b> baby's <b>forehead</b> clipt [...] A tiny curl, and gave it: this he kept [...] Thro' all his future; but now hastily caught [...] His bundle, waved his hand, and went his way.|$|R
6000|$|... "My own darling," [...] said he, parting {{the hair}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> and {{gazing at the}} child with an {{expression}} of the deepest sadness, [...] "I fear we shall never quit this dreary spot." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed the}} tangled hair <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close {{up to the}} young Spaniard; {{she crossed her arms}} over her breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mildred {{looked at}} the letter lying open before her, and a terrible temptation took {{possession}} of her. She took it up and put it down again, and then again she took it up, wiping the cold perspiration <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lady Selina {{wiped her}} pen, in her scarlet {{embroidered}} pen-wiper, closed {{the lid of}} her patent inkstand, folded a piece of blotting-paper over the note she was writing, pushed back the ruddy ringlets <b>from</b> <b>her</b> contemplative <b>forehead,</b> gave a slight sigh, and turned herself towards her cousin, {{with the purpose of}} commencing a vigorous lecture and cross-examination, by which she hoped to exorcise the spirit of lamentation from Fanny's breast, and restore her to a healthful activity in the performance of this world's duties. Fanny felt what was coming; she could not fly; so she closed her book and her eyes, and prepared herself for endurance.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Coquette" by an unknown artist, showing a middle-aged woman, [s. d. ]. The woman is shown from the hips up, clothed in a billowing dress made of {{what appears to be}} satin. Her dark hair is pulled up away <b>from</b> <b>her</b> neck and <b>forehead,</b> blending in with the dark background. She holds her chin up, her head slightly turned to the right of her body...|$|R
6000|$|... 189. Thirdly. The Greek Aphrodite {{is entirely}} calm, and looks {{straight}} forward. Not one feature {{of her face}} is disturbed, or seems ever to {{have been subject to}} emotion. The Italian Aphrodite looks up, her face all quivering and burning with passion and wasting anxiety. The Greek one is quiet, self-possessed, and self-satisfied: the Italian incapable of rest; she has had no thought nor care for herself; her hair has been bound by a fillet like the Greek's; but it is now all fallen loose, and clotted with the sea, or clinging to her body; only the front tress of it is caught by the breeze <b>from</b> <b>her</b> raised <b>forehead,</b> and lifted, in the place where the tongues of fire rest on the brows, in the early Christian pictures of Pentecost, and the waving fires abide upon the heads of Angelico's seraphim.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Roxy {{came and}} {{arranged}} the pillows, {{and lifted the}} girl with her long, strong arms, then stooping over her a moment she finished her arrangements by softly smoothing the hair <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> with a caressing movement most unlike her usual precise business-like proceedings.|$|E
60|$|Françoise Cathelineau {{dropped from}} her hand the flax, which she had {{hitherto}} employed herself in preparing for the wheel, and pushing <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> her loose grey locks, and resting on her knees her two elbows, she gazed long and intently into Agatha's face.|$|E
60|$|The colour had deepened in her thin, oval face, {{with its}} {{straight}} brows, and large, grey eyes. Her hair, brushed in fine, high curves back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> was going grey, like his own, and this greyness made the sudden vivid colour {{in her cheeks}} painfully pathetic.|$|E
60|$|As he {{was talking}} to Mrs. Bolton he had {{observed}} the girl, who sat apart, with her fingers busy on her work, and who had hardly spoken a word since his entrance. She was, he thought, the most lovely human being that he had ever beheld; and yet she was hardly more than a child. But how different from those girls at Babington! Her bright brown hair was simply brushed <b>from</b> off <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> and tied in a knot behind her head. Her dress was as plain as a child's,--as though it was intended that she should still be regarded as a child. Her face was very fair, with large, grey, thoughtful eyes, and a mouth which, though as Caldigate watched her it was never opened, seemed always as if it was just about to pour forth words. And he could see that though her eyes were intent upon <b>her</b> work, <b>from</b> time to time she looked across at him; and he thought that if only they two were alone together, he could teach her to speak.|$|R
5000|$|The 2002 movie [...] "They" [...] {{includes}} {{a scene in}} which the main character pulls an implant (about {{the size and shape of}} a toothpick) from something resembling a scab she has found in <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> just a few centimeters <b>from</b> where <b>her</b> hairline meets <b>her</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said he; then {{he kissed}} <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> and escaped <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> and went his way, telling himself; as he went, {{that she was}} a fool.|$|R
60|$|She {{came and}} sat on the arm of his chair. Every year she grew less and less like her mother. Her hair was {{smoothly}} brushed back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> and her features were distinctly intellectual. She was by far the best secretary Mannering had ever had.|$|E
60|$|The {{daughter}} {{during this}} time was sitting intent on her work, not lifting her face from the shirt she was sewing. But an observer might have seen <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> and eye {{that she was not}} only listening to what was said, but thinking and meditating on the scene before her.|$|E
60|$|He {{might have}} added more than all, {{when he saw}} the face now looking at him. He did add it in effect, perhaps, as he softly moved her {{scattered}} hair <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> with his hand. Such little actions, slight in another man, were very noticeable in him; and his daughter received them {{as if they had been}} words of contrition.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} hear it," [...] said she, rising <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{seat on the}} sofa with her hands up to <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> but still coming nearer to him as she moved.|$|R
6000|$|Lucretia's {{face was}} one smile of {{innocent}} amusement <b>from</b> <b>her</b> white little <b>forehead</b> to <b>her</b> chiselled little chin. [...] "Why, yes," [...] she answered, laughing, [...] "of course I am. I always wait upon our guests when I'm at home. And I cooked these salmon cutlets, which I'm sure you'll find nice {{if you only}} try them while they're hot." [...] With which recommendation she uncovered all the dishes, and displayed a breakfast that might have tempted St. Anthony. Not being St. Anthony, I can do Lucretia's breakfast the justice to say that I ate it with unfeigned heartiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Selina," [...] and Fanny rose, {{and wiped}} her eyes, and {{somewhat}} composed her ruffled hair, which she shook back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face and <b>forehead,</b> as she endeavoured to repress the palpitation which had followed her tears; [...] "I have looked forward, and I have determined what I mean to do. It was your father who brought me to this, by forcing me into a childish quarrel with the man I love. I have implored him, almost on my knees, to invite Lord Ballindine again to Grey Abbey: he has refused to do so, at any rate for twelve months--" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} lifted his arm, and drew {{herself out of}} the chair. Siegmund looked at her from his tranquillity. She put the damp hair <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> breathed deep, almost panting. Then she glanced hauntingly at her flushed face in the mirror. With the same restlessness, she {{turned to look at the}} night. The cool, dark, watery sea called to her. She pushed back the curtain.|$|E
6000|$|He stopped suddenly, {{just as he}} {{was about}} to feel her pulse, and looked in the {{direction}} of the glass door--listened attentively--and said, as if to himself--"I thought I heard some one moving in that room, but I suppose I am mistaken; nobody can be up in the house yet." [...] With those words he looked down at Margaret, and gently parted back her hair <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|More {{than once}} {{he looked at}} her. Her oval face was almost devoid of color. There were rings {{underneath}} her large soft eyes. Her dark hair was brushed simply back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead.</b> Her travelling clothes were of the plainest. Yet she was always beautiful--more so than ever just now, perhaps, when the slight hardness had gone from her mouth, and the strain had passed from her features.|$|E
6000|$|She {{sat down}} on the window-seat, with her elbows on her knees and her hands {{grasping}} <b>her</b> <b>forehead.</b> A long moaning cry burst <b>from</b> <b>her.</b> She said to herself bitterly the one word--"Farewell!" ...|$|R
50|$|Special powers: This {{form of the}} Mother Goddess {{is ready}} for war with all her weapons, to protect the peace and welfare of Her devotees.It is {{believed}} that {{the sound of the}} moon-bell on <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> drives all types of spirits away <b>from</b> <b>Her</b> devotees.|$|R
60|$|Ann Veronica's first {{impression}} of Kitty Brett {{was that she}} was aggressive and disagreeable; her next that she was a person of amazing persuasive power. She was perhaps three-and-twenty, and very pink and healthy-looking, showing a great deal of white and rounded neck above her business-like but altogether feminine blouse, and a good deal of plump, gesticulating forearm out of her short sleeve. She had animated dark blue-gray eyes under her fine eyebrows, and dark brown hair that rolled back simply and effectively <b>from</b> <b>her</b> broad low <b>forehead.</b> And she was about as capable of intelligent argument as a runaway steam-roller. She was a trained being--trained by an implacable mother to one end.|$|R
