The main objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of (repeated) electronic outlining on the quality of students’ writing products and perceived mental effort. The study also investigated how students appropriate and appreciate the outline tool. Data were collected from 58 ninth-grade students who wrote two argumentative texts about a topic they had previously discussed during several class sessions, meaning that ideas were generated and clustered beforehand. Students’ writing products were scored for Total Text Structure, Structure Presentation, and Hierarchical Elaboration of Arguments. Results reveal that first-time tool-use had no significant effect on students’ writing products and perceived mental effort. However, repeated use positively affected Structure Presentation and led to decreased perceived mental effort, but no significant effect was found on Total Text Structure and Hierarchical Elaboration of Arguments. Answers to a retrospective questionnaire showed that students quickly appropriated the tool with tool appreciation increasing with repeated use. This study suggests that in order to profit from electronic outlining, it is important to practice using the outline tool and to use it for complex tasks, requiring idea generation and organization...|$|R

40|$|This chapter reports an {{exploratory}} {{study conducted by}} the authors on the role of note-taking, drafting, mapping, and outlining in learning strategies for argumentative writing and speaking. Previous research has highlighted the epistemic function of <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> in content learning. Further investigation is needed, however, in order to explore the role of writing in supporting strategic learning in argumentative discourse. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the positive influence on the quality of written and oral argumentation of an intervention about strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation. In particular, we expected that students who attended four workshops on <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> would show greater improvement in their argumentative performances than students who were involved in curricular activities about written and oral argumentation. The participants were 124 secondary students attending either 11 th or 12 th grade, and were assigned either to the writing to argue group or to the argumentative discourse group. Participants were administered pre- and post-intervention tests to analyze their performances in argumentative speaking and writing, using several indices of quality. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed a significant effect of the intervention about <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation on the quality of persuasive essay writing, and a moderate effect on the quality of debate speaking. Instruction in <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation thus has the potential to influence the learning of strategies for argumentative writing and speaking, especially when strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> support the use of cognitive and metacognitive strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{three years}} of Doctoral Program were devoted to the {{exploration}} of the role of note-taking, drafting, mapping, and outlining in learning strategies for argumentative writing and speaking in secondary school students. The successful performance in argumentative discourse tasks is expected {{at the end of the}} secondary school all over the world. In spite of these expectations, though, what researchers have been observing for decades are the difficulties encountered by students in performing academic writing and speaking tasks. Moreover, further investigation is needed in order to explore the role of writing in supporting strategic learning in argumentative discourse. Therefore, under the supervision of professor Lerida Cisotto, the doctoral student designed a series of exploratory studies and developed an intervention about writing strategies for argumentation, with the aim to improve the argumentative discourse processes and products of the students involved. The aim of the two studies reported here was to investigate the positive influence on the quality of written and oral argumentation of an intervention about strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation. In particular, students who attended four workshops on <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> were expected to show greater improvement in their argumentative performances than students who were involved in curricular activities about written and oral argumentation. The participants were 124 secondary students attending either 11 th or 12 th grade, and were assigned either to the Writing for argumentative discourse group or to the Practising for argumentative discourse group. Participants were administered pre- and post-intervention tests to analyze their performances in argumentative speaking and writing, using several indices of quality. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed a significant effect of the intervention about <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation on the quality of persuasive essay writing, and a moderate effect on the quality of debate speaking. The actual use of strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> during argumentative <b>writing</b> and speaking has also been explored.

Through interviews and questionnaires, this study explores engineering academics 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of writing to better understand how online <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> may be integrated into their teaching. Results suggest that writing is viewed positively in the discipline, but it is not believed to be essential to success in engineering.
