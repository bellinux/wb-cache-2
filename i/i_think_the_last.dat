500|$|Due to {{the album}} Untouchables leaking onto the Internet, Take a Look in the Mirror was {{released}} on a Friday, November 21, 2003 – four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, {{which resulted in a}} poor showing on the Billboard 200. During its first full week, Take a Look in the Mirror soared ten places from number nineteen to number nine, increasing the album's total sales to 179,000. It is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to hear the music as it should be. The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: [...] "The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally {{got to the point where}} I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now. It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album." [...] MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they [...] "will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, 'Break Some Off,' which he called 'brutal'." [...] Korn released the single [...] "Did My Time" [...] on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film but did not appear on the soundtrack to [...] due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number thirty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Korn's first and only top-forty hit in the United States. [...] "Did My Time" [...] gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{opted to}} remain at Accrington ahead of the 2007–08 season, signing a {{contract}} extension in May 2007. He played his {{first game of the}} campaign in late August 2007, a 2–0 defeat at Lincoln City. Following Accrington's 4–1 home win against Grimsby Town in September 2007, a game in which Edwards appeared as a 90th-minute substitute, he did not feature in the first-team for two months. He returned to first-team action on 17 November 2007, playing in the club's 1–0 home defeat to Rotherham United. Following a spate of late substitute appearances, Edwards was ever present in the first-team from December 2007 onwards. He scored his first goal of the 2007–08 season on 4 April 2008, scoring the winner in a 1–0 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. The goal all but guaranteed League Two survival for Accrington. It was Edwards' only goal of the season, playing 32 games in all competitions. Edwards started in Accrington's first game of the 2008–09 season, a 1–0 home loss to newly promoted Aldershot Town. In October 2008, Accrington manager John Coleman praised Edwards for his form during the start of the season, [...] "I couldn't pay him enough compliments. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> six months he has been absolutely magnificent. I am convinced if he was three inches bigger he would be playing in the Premier League. He is our best defender and hopefully he'll continue to be a great player for us for a long time". Edwards remained ever present in the Accrington first-team, but was taken off after 17 minutes in Accrington's 2–1 win against Shrewsbury Town. Despite needing eight stitches in his knee, Edwards played in Accrington's following league match four days later, a 1–0 home defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. He provided the assist for Paul Mullin's goal in a defeat at Wycombe Wanderers, as well as assisting Jamie Clarke's second goal in a 3–1 home win over Grimsby Town. Edwards played in every one of Accrington's 50 games during the 2008–09 season, with the club finishing 16th in the league table.|$|E

I examined the case laboriously, and, though I think his facts could not be denied, I undertook (myself out of office) to answer him on behalf of the government. This I did, and Peel, who was the most conscientious man I ever knew in spareness of eulogium, said to me when I sat down, [...] "That was a wonderful speech, Gladstone."' The speech took four hours, and was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> that he made in parliament for two years and a half, for reasons that we shall presently discover.|$|E

60|$|As to the Bible Society, {{my view of}} {{the subject}} is as follows:--1st. Distributing Bibles is a good thing. 2ndly. More Bibles will be {{distributed}} in consequence {{of the existence of}} the Bible Society; therefore, so far as that goes, the existence of the Bible Society is good. But, 3rdly, as to the indirect benefits expected from it, as producing a golden age of unanimity among Christians, all that I think fume and emptiness; nay, far worse. So deeply am I persuaded that discord and artifice, and pride and ambition, would be fostered by such an approximation and unnatural alliance of sects, that I am inclined to think the evil thus produced would more than outweigh the good done by dispersing the Bibles. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> fifty or sixty pages of my brother's pamphlet[66] merit the serious consideration of all persons of the Established Church who have connected themselves with the sectaries for this purpose....|$|E
60|$|The {{loss of the}} whale-boat {{occurred}} when we were about two thousand miles from the western coast of South America. We had a long road before us, consequently; and, as I had doubted whether the ship we had seen was the Crisis, {{it was necessary to}} be in motion, if anything was to be effected with our old enemies. The reader may feel some desire to know in what manner my succession to the command was received by the people. No man could have been more implicitly obeyed. I was now six feet and an inch in height, of a powerful and active frame, a good seaman, and had the habit of command, through a twelvemonth's experience. The crew knew me, having seen me tried, from the weather-earings down; and it is very likely I possessed more of their confidence than I deserved. At all events, I was as implicitly obeyed as if I had sailed from New York at their head. Everybody regretted Marble; more, I think, than we regretted poor Captain Williams, though it must have been on account of the manner we saw him disappear, as it might be, from before our eyes; since, of the two, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> was the most estimable man. Nevertheless, Marble had his strong points, and they were points likely to take with seamen; and they had particularly taken with us. As for the four Sandwich Islanders, I do not know that they occupied any of our minds at all. We had been accustomed to regard them as strange beings, who came from that ocean to which they had thus suddenly returned.|$|E
60|$|It is {{some time}} since I made any {{reference}} to M. Pelet. The moonlight walk is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> incident recorded in this narrative where that gentleman cuts any conspicuous figure: the fact is, since that event, a change had come over the spirit of our intercourse. He, indeed, ignorant that the still hour, a cloudless moon, and an open lattice, had revealed to me the secret of his selfish love and false friendship, would have continued smooth and complaisant as ever; but I grew spiny as a porcupine, and inflexible as a blackthorn cudgel; I never had a smile for his raillery, never a moment for his society; his invitations to take coffee {{with him in his}} parlour were invariably rejected, and very stiffly and sternly rejected too; his jesting allusions to the directress (which he still continued) were heard with a grim calm very different from the petulant pleasure they were formerly wont to excite. For a long time Pelet bore with my frigid demeanour very patiently; he even increased his attentions; but finding that even a cringing politeness failed to thaw or move me, he at last altered too; in his turn he cooled; his invitations ceased; his countenance became suspicious and overcast, and I read in the perplexed yet brooding aspect of his brow, a constant examination and comparison of premises, and an anxious endeavour to draw thence some explanatory inference. Ere long, I fancy, he succeeded, for he was not without penetration; perhaps, too, Mdlle. Zoraide might have aided him in the solution of the enigma; at any rate I soon found that the uncertainty of doubt had vanished from his manner; renouncing all pretence of friendship and cordiality, he adopted a reserved, formal, but still scrupulously polite deportment. This was the point to which I had wished to bring him, and I was now again comparatively at my ease. I did not, it is true, like my position in his house; but being freed from the annoyance of false professions and double-dealing I could endure it, especially as no heroic sentiment of hatred or jealousy of the director distracted my philosophical soul; he had not, I found, wounded me in a very tender point, the wound was so soon and so radically healed, leaving only a sense of contempt for the treacherous fashion in which it had been inflicted, and a lasting mistrust of the hand which I had detected attempting to stab in the dark.|$|E
