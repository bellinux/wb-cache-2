He has a cruel manager named Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion) who is constantly taunting and demeaning Locke. At one point Locke tells Randy off and feels <b>great</b> <b>about</b> it.

Locke reveals to Helen that he is going on a walkabout and would like for Helen to go with him; she tells him that she can't meet customers in person and that his paid hour on the phone with her is up.|$|E

25|$|Among the few recent discoveries {{relating}} to this period are {{the graves of}} five young Viking warriors, {{one of which was}} found at Ship Street <b>Great</b> <b>about</b> 100 metres to the southwest of the Black Pool, the other four being clustered together on the southeastern shore near South Great George's Street. Radiocarbon analysis suggests that all five died in the 9th century, possibly before the establishment of a Viking longphort at Dublin. Oxygen isotope analysis has revealed that two of these warriors were from Scandinavia and two from somewhere in the British Isles, possibly the western coast of Scotland. In total, about one hundred Viking burials from this period have been unearthed in the Dublin region, but most of these discoveries were made serendipitously in the 19th century and few were properly excavated. Most of these burials were accompanied by typical Viking grave goods – swords, spear-heads, shields, daggers, penannular brooches and various decorative items – including hacksilver (i.e. small pieces of silver cut from coins or jewellery and used as currency).|$|E

40|$|Assuming a {{standard}} black hole accretion model for quasars, we estimate the present total mass density, rho sub BH, of quasar remnants using recent observations of quasar populations and of typical quasar spectra {{over a wide}} wavelength range. We find rho sub BH of <b>greater</b> than <b>about</b> (1. 4 - 2. 2) x 10 exp 5 solar masses/cu Mpc for a quasar radiative efficiency of 0. 1. This is an upward revision {{by a factor of}} 3. 0 - 4. 6 from a decade-old estimate by Soltan (1982). A typical bright galaxy is thus expected to contain a central black hole of <b>greater</b> than <b>about</b> 10 exp 7 /cu h solar masses. Furthermore, we expect that <b>greater</b> than <b>about</b> 50 percent of rho sub BH is contributed by objects of mass <b>greater</b> than <b>about</b> 10 exp 8 /sq h solar masses and <b>greater</b> than <b>about</b> 10 percent by those more massive than about 6 x 10 exp 8 /sq h solar masses...|$|R

Executive producer and co-creator of the show, David Kohan said: [...] "There's something <b>great</b> <b>about</b> playing on a person's iconic status.

The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying [...] "The boys I recorded completely separate.
