60|$|Of a truth this calm {{seemed even}} more awe-inspiring than the snarls and cries of a while ago. Caius Nepos' sallow cheeks became still more ashen in colour as he cast {{a quick glance}} round the room, feeling perhaps {{for the first time}} to-day how {{completely}} he was at the mercy of a raving lunatic if the latter should turn against him. But the Cæsar sat there for some time, ruminating, with great hollow eyes fixed on one spot on the <b>ground</b> and <b>gusts</b> of stertorous breathing escaped from his chest.|$|R
50|$|As the mesocyclone {{approaches}} the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend {{from the base}} of the storm, often from a rotating wall cloud. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the <b>ground,</b> creating a <b>gust</b> front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|R
50|$|A {{gust lock}} on an {{aircraft}} is a mechanism that locks control surfaces and keeps open aircraft doors in place while the aircraft is {{parked on the}} <b>ground</b> and non-operational. <b>Gust</b> locks prevent wind from causing unexpected movements of the control surfaces and their linked controls inside the aircraft, as well as aircraft doors on some aircraft. Otherwise wind gusts could cause possible damage to the control surfaces and systems, or nearby people, cargo, or machinery. Some gust locks are external devices attached directly to the aircraft's control surfaces, while others {{are attached to the}} flight controls inside the cockpit.|$|R

40|$|The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center {{conducted}} {{flight tests}} of a propulsion-controlled aircraft system on an F- 15 airplane. This system {{was designed to}} explore the feasibility of providing safe emergency landing capability using only the engines to provide flight control {{in the event of}} a catastrophic loss of conventional flight controls. Control laws were designed to control the flightpath and bank angle using only commands to the throttles. Although the program was highly successful, this paper highlights some of the challenges associated with using engine thrust as a control effector. These challenges include slow engine response time, poorly modeled nonlinear engine dynamics, unmodeled inlet-airframe interactions, and difficulties with <b>ground</b> effect and <b>gust</b> rejection. Flight and simulation data illustrate these difficulties...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{mathematical model}} of the UR- 60 A Black Hawk helicopter was developed. This mathematical model, {{which was based on}} the Sikorsky General Helicopter (Gen Hel) Flight Dynamics Simulation, provides NASA with an engineering simulation for performance and handling qualities evaluations. This mathematical model is total systems definition of the Black Hawk helicopter represented at a uniform level of sophistication considered necessary for handling qualities evaluations. The model is a total force, large angle representation in six rigid body degrees of freedom. Rotor blade flapping, lagging, and hub rotational degrees of freedom are also represented. In addition to the basic helicopter modules, supportive modules were defined for the landing interface, power unit, <b>ground</b> effects, and <b>gust</b> penetration. Information defining the cockpit environment relevant to pilot in the loop simulation is presented...|$|R

50|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. This convergence of warm air in the updraft, and this cool air, causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to siphon air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the <b>ground,</b> creating a <b>gust</b> front that can cause severe damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{aerodynamic}} forces on {{an array of}} flat plates near the <b>ground.</b> Discrete wind <b>gusts</b> overlap a constant free-stream velocity, and the behaviour of the forces acting on both plates are analyzed, emphasizing {{the influence of the}} trailing wakes on the system. The simulation employs a program based on unsteady two-dimensional potential ow, discretizing the airfoils into vortex elements. The program has been developed specifically as part of this thesis. All the work performed is thoroughly presented in this document. The results of the analysis provide an insight into the in uence of different parameters on the forces acting on the plates. The trailing plate is particularly affected by the strong vorticity of the first plate's wake, creating a visible interaction. Computational parameters have been chosen carefully via validation against analytical solutions. Lastly, an application of the results on solar panel design is proposed. Essentially, the problem has been positively analyzed with the proposed method. The findings attained open the door for future development of the method, for either this particular scenario or a different one. Ingeniería Aeroespacia...|$|R

500|$|A {{meeting was}} held over the Easter weekend in 1928 by the Cinque Ports Flying Club. Pleasure flights were given for {{a cost of}} 5/-. An unverified report stated that one person was {{dissatisfied}} with two circuits of the airfield. The pilot {{is said to have}} offered to take him up again, which was accepted. On this second flight various aerobatics were flown and the hapless passenger was said to have been left incapable of expressing himself coherently. Among the pilots attending were Geoffrey de Havilland and his son. Other activities included some air racing and a guess the altitude competition. In May a Notice to Airmen said that the scheme for aircraft reporting that they were crossing the Channel was being extended. Lympne was to remain the reporting place on the English side but, in Belgium and France, the Ostend and St Inglevert airfields were joined by semaphore stations at Village de Baracques, Calais and Cap d’Alprech, Boulogne. On 17 May, Lady Heath landed at Lympne after crossing the Channel during her [...] flight to Croydon from Cape Town, South Africa. She was flying an Avro Avian III which had been taken out to South Africa by ship. In August, the AuxAF held their annual Air Defence Exercises. Both 600 (City of London) and 601 (County of London) Squadrons AuxAF were based a Lympne {{for the duration of the}} exercise. They were operating Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. Towards the end of the camp Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill and Under Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Sassoon inspected both squadrons and were entertained at a dinner. On 18 September, Juan de la Cierva departed from Lympne in an Autogyro, making the first flight between London and Paris in this type of aircraft and the first flight across the Channel by autogyro in the process. In November, a Handley Page W.10 of Imperial Airways diverted to Lympne in a gale with three passengers suffering from airsickness. Once landed the aircraft was briefly lifted from the <b>ground</b> in a <b>gust</b> whilst <b>ground</b> handling staff were taking it to a hangar. Winds of [...] were recorded.|$|R
60|$|He {{judged the}} {{quantity}} as small because it WAS small, {{and all the}} more egregiously since it couldn't, as he saw the case, so much as thinkably have been larger. He hadn't had the gift of {{making the most of}} what he tried, and if he had tried and tried again--no one but himself knew how often--it appeared to have been that he might demonstrate what else, in default of that, COULD be made. Old ghosts of experiments came back to him, old drudgeries and delusions, and disgusts, old recoveries with their relapses, old fevers with their chills, broken moments of good faith, others of still better doubt; adventures, for the most part, of the sort qualified as lessons. The special spring that had constantly played for him the day before was the recognition--frequent enough to surprise him--of the promises to himself that he had after his other visit never kept. The reminiscence to-day most quickened for him was that of the vow taken {{in the course of the}} pilgrimage that, newly-married, with the War just over, and helplessly young in spite of it, he had recklessly made with the creature who was so much younger still. It had been a bold dash, for which they had taken money set apart for necessities, but kept sacred at the moment in a hundred ways, and in none more so than by this private pledge of his own to treat the occasion as a relation formed with the higher culture and see that, as they said at Woollett, it should bear a good harvest. He had believed, sailing home again, that he had gained something great, and his theory--with an elaborate innocent plan of reading, digesting, coming back even, every few years--had then been to preserve, cherish and extend it. As such plans as these had come to nothing, however, in respect to acquisitions still more precious, it was doubtless little enough of a marvel that he should have lost account of that handful of seed. Buried for long years in dark corners at any rate these few germs had sprouted again under forty-eight hours of Paris. The process of yesterday had really been the process of feeling the general stirred life of connexions long since individually dropped. Strether had become acquainted even on this <b>ground</b> with short <b>gusts</b> of speculation--sudden flights of fancy in Louvre galleries, hungry gazes through clear plates behind which lemon-coloured volumes were as fresh as fruit on the tree.|$|R
