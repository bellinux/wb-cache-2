40|$|Abstract. Software {{development}} {{based on}} the classical software life-cycle proves inadequate for many ambitious projects. <b>Exploratory</b> software <b>development</b> is an alternative way of building software systems by eliminating deficiencies of the conventional software life cycle. Instead of exactly defining the various phases of the life cycle, <b>exploratory</b> software <b>development</b> takes small development steps, whereby a single step results in an extension or an improvement of the existing system. The object-oriented programming paradigm has resulted in increased reuse of existing software components. Therefore, class libraries will become very important in the near future. <b>Exploratory</b> software <b>development</b> is very well suited to this situation and thus provides {{a major step forward}} in economically developing software systems.

We found that integrated optical receivers made in the past decade are much noisier than hybrid receivers. When the accepted receiver model of Smith and Personick was examined for the cause of this discrepancy, we quickly discovered that the model was missing an important noise source. Is this source, 1 /f noise, neglected by Smith and Personick? With funding from the NRaD independent <b>exploratory</b> <b>development</b> (IED) program, this question was investigated during FY 91. The goal of the project, given the designa-tion ZF 04, was to examine indium-phosphide junction field-effect transistors for 1 /...|$|R
