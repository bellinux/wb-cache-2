5|$|P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk at all {{species of the}} ant-mimic jumping spider genus Myrmarachne, and uses cryptic {{stalking}} only about 20% of the time against other ant-mimicking salticids and against beetle-mimicking salticids. P. fimbriata also sometimes does not use cryptic stalking against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually translucent, and the translucent cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show light and dark regions that flicker in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not translucent and do not produce this <b>flickering,</b> and P. fimbriata uses cryptic stalking consistently against the males. This suggests that the <b>flickering</b> anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E

The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was <b>flickering</b> the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the <b>flickering</b> lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E

40|$|Industries {{that produce}} <b>flicker</b> are often placed {{close to each}} other and {{connected}} to the same power grid system. This implies that the measured <b>flicker</b> level at the point of common coupling (PCC) is a result of contribution from a number of different <b>flicker</b> sources. In a mitigation process it is essential to know which one of the <b>flicker</b> sources is the dominant one. We propose a method to determine the <b>flicker</b> propagations and trace the <b>flicker</b> sources by using <b>flicker</b> power measurements. <b>Flicker</b> power is considered as a quantity containing both sign and magnitude. The sign determines if a <b>flicker</b> source is placed downstream or upstream with respect to a given monitoring point and the magnitude is used to determine the propagation of <b>flicker</b> power throughout the power network and to trace the dominant <b>flicker</b> source. This paper covers the theoretical background of <b>flicker</b> power and describes a novel method for calculation of <b>flicker</b> power that can be implemented in a power network analyzer. Also conducted simulations and a field test based on the proposed method will be described in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Flicker</b> {{envelope}} tracking {{is the key}} {{of analyzing}} voltage <b>flicker</b> signal. A novel method, i. e., cubic spline interpolation method is applied in the detection of the voltage <b>flicker</b> envelope. The typical <b>flicker</b> signals, such as one or multi-frequencies and frequency time-varying <b>flicker</b> signal are selected and analyzed by this method. Simulation results indicate that this method is effective in the detection of the envelope of voltage <b>flicker</b> signal. Results of one or multi-frequencies <b>flicker</b> signal simulation show that, when <b>flicker</b> frequency is less than 15 Hz, the error of this method is quite tiny. The detection precision of this method is higher, especially in the scope of low frequencies of <b>flicker</b> and this method makes up for the disadvantage of square demodulation. Furthermore, results of frequency time-varying <b>flicker</b> signal simulation show that, the occurrence and recover time of voltage <b>flicker</b> signal can be accurately detected by cubic spline interpolation method...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new and}} highly efficient measurement method (algorithm) that determines how <b>flicker</b> propagates throughout the network and also traces the dominant <b>flicker</b> source. The fundamental principle of the method {{is to use the}} fact that a <b>flicker</b> source produces an amplitude modulation in the voltage and current waveforms. The low frequency variations in voltage and current that cause <b>flicker</b> are retrieved in a demodulation and filtering process. By first multiplying the low frequency variations in voltage and current and then integrate, a new quantity, <b>flicker</b> power, is achieved. The sign and the magnitude of <b>flicker</b> power give the direction to the <b>flicker</b> source as well as tracing the dominating <b>flicker</b> source. Godkänd; 2005; 20081020 (ysko...|$|R

High amplitude luminance pedestals were found to elevate <b>flicker</b> thresholds, but low amplitude luminance pedestals were unable to reduce <b>flicker</b> thresholds. Luminance pedestals elevated <b>flicker</b> thresholds more at low temporal frequencies. A simple model based on local light adaptation was able to capture the general form of the TvC functions. Our results suggest that <b>flicker</b> thresholds derived {{in the presence of}} a luminance pedestal (luminance-pedestal <b>flicker)</b> may vary from those obtained by modulating about a mean luminance (mean-modulated <b>flicker)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Voltage {{fluctuation}} and <b>flicker</b> {{are among}} the most serious impacts of wind power generation on power quality. To assess and suppress voltage fluctuation and <b>flicker,</b> an accurate detection method is necessary. According to characteristics of <b>flicker</b> caused by wind farm, a systematic, accurate and fast <b>flicker</b> detection method was introduced. First, with Mathematical Morphology (MM) filter, noises contained in <b>flicker</b> signal were filtered out. Then to the filtered <b>flicker</b> curves, a track method based on Hilbert transform was adopted to pick out the <b>flicker’s</b> envelope which is the base of attaining relevant parameters of <b>flicker.</b> At last, the envelope was simultaneously analyzed in both time-domain and frequency-domain by a novel non-stationary signal processing method, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Simulations show that with this method, time, frequency and amplitude information of non-stationary <b>flicker</b> signals can be accurately detected and the proposed method is effective in the analysis of <b>flickers</b> caused by wind farm...|$|R

5|$|After co-authoring Volume 17, John Button, with Volume 18, The Twisted Claw (1939), {{took over}} the series {{full-time}} until 1942; McFarlane resumed with Volume 22, The <b>Flickering</b> Torch Mystery (1943). McFarlane's last contribution was Volume 24, The Short-Wave Mystery (1945); his wife, Amy, authored Volume 26, The Phantom Freighter (1947). Over the next several decades, other volumes were written by Adams, Svenson, Lawrence, Buranelli, William Dougherty, and James Buechler.

5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as <b>flickering,</b> slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|E
40|$|Voltage <b>flicker</b> is an irritating problem {{especially}} for the low voltage (LV) customers. It is mainly caused by the loads having repetitive cycle of operation. During the past years, the network operators {{around the world have}} registered many complaints from the customers about <b>flicker</b> related problems. Presently, there is no common standard value for the <b>flicker</b> planning level available globally. Moreover, in some countries (for example, in the Netherlands), the existing networks are not even based on a specific planning level value for <b>flicker.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the <b>flicker</b> planning level values in different voltage levels to overcome <b>flicker</b> related problems. In this paper a typical LV network is simulated to analyze the <b>flicker</b> propagation behavior in the network. The effects of switching LV disturbing loads (such as elevator, welding machine, etc.) on <b>flicker</b> generation at different customer's installations are studied by using synchronized measurement technique. Also, the impacts of the background <b>flicker</b> pollution transferred from the upstream to the downstream networks are analyzed. The simulation results give an overview of the <b>flicker</b> pollution levels at the LV customer's installations in the presence of background <b>flicker.</b> This paper estimates the maximum value of <b>flicker</b> emission share at different customer's point of connections (POC), considering the impact of background <b>flicker</b> pollution. Finally, planning level values of <b>flicker</b> in different voltage levels are suggested that can be useful for the network operators in designing their future networks...|$|R

5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, <b>flickering</b> motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

By changing {{the velocity of}} motion of the stripe system different <b>flicker</b> frequencies can be produced and thus the relation of <b>flicker</b> frequency to critical intensity of illumination can be studied. Threshold illumination varies with <b>flicker</b> frequency {{in such a way}} that with increasing <b>flicker</b> frequency the intensity of illumination must be increased to produce a threshold response in the fish. The curve of critical illumination as a function of frequency is made up of two distinct parts.

For higher intensities and <b>flicker</b> frequencies above 10, the cones come into play. The maximum frequency of <b>flicker</b> which can be perceived by the fish's eye is slightly above 50 per second. The <b>flicker</b> curve for the eye of Lepomis can easily be compared with that for the human eye.

The prime time series starred Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy as Frank and Joe Hardy; Pamela Sue Martin and later Janet Louise Johnson played Nancy Drew. During the first season, the series alternated between episodes {{featuring the}} Hardy Boys one week and Nancy Drew the next. The Hardy Boys were cast as young adults (Stevenson and Cassidy were twenty-four and eighteen respectively {{during the filming}} of the first episodes) {{to appeal to a}} prime time television audience.
