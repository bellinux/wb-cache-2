Everybody must be won over by now." [...] Since then, the group's [...] "saccharine" [...] image has softened and musicians have cited the Carpenters as a key influence. In 1995, Rolling Stones Sue Cummings wrote that the 1990's acceptance of the duo's work was [...] "a renewed ironic appreciation", adding that listeners [...] "had loved the veneer, then hated it, then found it even more compelling, on a second look, for the complexity in {{the places where the}} darkness cracked through".|$|E

5000|$|A 2010 {{article in}} Scientific American quotes Barrett {{summarizing}} {{a few of}} the incubations techniques from The Committee of Sleep as follows: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to problem-solve in a dream, you should first of all think of the problem before bed, and if it lends itself to an image, hold it in your mind and let it be the last thing in your mind before falling asleep. For extra credit, assemble something on your bedside table that makes an image of the problem. If it's a personal problem, it might be the person you have the conflict with. If you're an artist, it might be a blank canvas. If you're a scientist, the device you're working on that's half assembled or a mathematical proof you've been writing through versions of.Equally important, don't jump out of bed when you wake up—almost half of dream content is lost <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get distracted. Lie there, don't do anything else. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>recall</b> a dream immediately, see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> feel a particular emotion—the whole dream would come flooding back.If you're just trying to dream about an issue or you want to dream of a person who's deceased or you haven't seen in a long time, you'd use very similar bedtime incubation suggestions as you would for problem solving: a concise verbal statement of what you want to dream about or a visual image of it to look at. Very often it's a person someone wants to dream of, and just a simple photo is an ideal trigger. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> used to have flying dreams and you haven't had one in a long time and you miss them, find a photo of a human flying.|$|R

[...] Taylor also noted that [...] "the track also ably walks the line between R&B and pop: For listeners who may have lost the faith with Carey's ventures into hip-hop, this will reel {{them back into the}} fold. But it's also no step backward. Newer fans will love the less-glossy production and the soulful grip that Carey puts around this song of yearning and ache." [...] Devon Powers of PopMatters called it [...] "a noteworthy cover even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can’t <b>recall</b> who did it first." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic picked the track {{as one of the best}} on her compilation The Ballads (2008), calling it a [...] "mammoth hit." [...] Meanwhile, Jose F.

This identification and shared passion is effectively the same as the experience of the event; the audience experiences katharsis or [...] "purification" [...] in correspondence with the actors. Shakespeare and Jonson, among others, used alchemical imagery and themes because they understood that the work of the theater in human transformation was parallel if not identical to the work of alchemy in that same transformation. The alchemical work was claimed to be greater than an imaginative experience in the theater, but the idea of purification by identification or correspondence with an object and its transformations was the same in both.|$|E

In The Corsicana Daily Sun, McWade is quoted as saying about playing the Pixilated Sisters in the movie, “...it’s a one chance in a million, {{like something out of a}} book.

5000|$|Sometimes Levin {{wrote about}} frivolous, even farcical matters, {{such as a}} series of mock-indignant {{articles}} about the sex-lives of mosquitoes. At other times he wrote about matters of grave moral importance, unfailingly denouncing authoritarian regimes whether of the left or the right. He observed, [...] "I am barred by the governments concerned from entering the Soviet Union and the lands of her empire {{on the one hand and}} South Africa on the other. These decrees constitute a pair of campaign medals that I wear with considerable pleasure and I have a profound suspicion of those who rebuke me for partisanship while wearing only one". He wrote regularly about the arts. Music was a recurrent theme; he was notorious for his addiction to Wagner, and other favourite composers included Schubert and Mozart. He wrote about performers he admired, including Otto Klemperer, Alfred Brendel, and Kiri Te Kanawa. He turned less regularly to the visual arts, but when he did his views were clear-cut and trenchantly expressed. He wrote of a Pre-Raphaelite exhibition in 1984, [...] "Never, in all my life, not even at the exclusively Millais exhibition in 1967, have I seen so much sickening rubbish in one place at one time". His knowledge and love of literature were reflected in many of his writings; among his best-known pieces is a long paragraph about the influence of Shakespeare on everyday discourse. It begins: If you cannot understand my argument, and declare 'It's Greek to me', you are quoting Shakespeare; if you claim to be more sinned against than sinning, you are quoting Shakespeare; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> your salad days, you are quoting Shakespeare; if you act more in sorrow than in anger, if your wish is father to the thought, if your lost property has vanished into thin air, you are quoting Shakespeare".|$|E
