It presents a brief historical analysis of artificial lighting sources, to understand its evolution, and identify the main characteristics of the lamps that were maintained over time. It presents information about the history and the technical characteristics of the electroluminescence technology and about the other sources of artificial lighting normally applied in interiors spaces, to confront and understand {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each in relation to electroluminescent lamps. We conclude that the electroluminescent lamps due to low light intensity cannot be used to illuminate a workspace. We developed an experimental table lamp that emits an ambient light with a decorative nature. The results show that the large size of the transformer and low intensity of the light are disadvantages that can be overcome in the future. In the future, reducing the size of the transformer and increase the intensity of light emitted by <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>lamp</b> will permit to be used in more applications. Currently electroluminescent lamps differ from other artificial light sources due to its thinness and malleability, and because they consume less electricity than others artificial light source...|$|E

(MRE) {{received}} a DOE cooperative agreement award in March of 2002 to develop Qualification and Demonstration Program for SSCL Lighting Systems in Parks and Highway Applications. (The SSCL lighting {{technology is the}} same technology that was developed under a DOE cooperative agreement DE-FC 26 - 99 FT 40631.) This project spanned a period of 39 months and ended in June of 2005. Participates in the funding of this project included the US Department of Energy, Rahall Transportation Institute, West Virginia State Parks System, and Meadow River Enterprises, Inc. The total program costs totaled $ 850, 000. The federal contribution to the program totaled $ 150, 000 which represented 17. 6 % of the total costs. The SSCL is a rugged <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>lamp</b> and was designed for outdoor applications. However, {{since this is a}} new technology, there have never been any housing or solar packages assemble for its use in these outdoor applications. The purpose of this program was to develop several types of encasements and solar packages, then evaluate their performances over time. At the end of observations, a conclusion would be reached as to the methodology of encasement and solar package requirements. In addition this project was to evaluate the viability of this application for the SSCL product. In addition this project was to evaluate the feasibility of etching the top conductive layer of the SSCL panel to permit only the needed area to be illuminated; this would reduce the power requirements of a sign. All primary development objectives have been achieved...|$|E
40|$|Meadow River Enterprises, Inc. (MRE) and the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University (NYSCC) {{received}} a DOE cooperative agreement award in September 1999 {{to develop an}} energy-efficient Solid-State Ceramic Lamp (SSCL). The program spanned a nominal two(2) year period ending in February of 2002. The federal contribution to the program totaled $ 1. 6 million supporting approximately 78 % of the program costs. The SSCL is a rugged <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>lamp</b> designed for outdoor applications. MRE has filed a provisional patent for this ''second generation'' technology and currently produces and markets blue-green phosphor SSCL devices. White phosphor SSCL devices are also available in prototype quantities. In addition to reducing energy consumption, the ceramic EL lamp offers several economic and societal advantages including lower lifecycle costs and reduced ''light pollution''. Significant further performance improvements are possible but will require {{a dramatic change in}} device physical construction related to the use of micro-powder materials and processes. The subject ''second-generation'' program spans a 27 month period and combines the materials and processing expertise of NYSCC, the manufacturing expertise of Meadow River Enterprises, and the phosphor development expertise of OSRAM Sylvania to develop an improved SSCL system. The development plan also includes important contributions by Marshall University (a part of the West Virginia University system). All primary development objectives have been achieved with the exception of improved phosphor powders. The performance characteristics of the first generation SSCL devices were carefully analyzed in year 1 and a second generation lamp was defined and optimized in year 2. The provisional patent was ''perfected'' through a comprehensive patent application filed in November 2002. Lamp efficiency was improved more than 2 : 1...|$|E

In the first experiment, white electroluminescent, green electroluminescent, and red incandescent lighting were compared for {{their effects on}} dark-crdapted. scotopic absolute and acuity thresholds. using a simulated T- 38 instrument panel for light exposure. I n the second experiment, white, green, and yellow electroluminescent and red incandescent light were compared in terms of legibility of a transillumi-wted lettermuity chart. Exposure to red incandescent lighting at 0. 05 f t. 4 produced the lowest absolutq and acuity thresholds, with white and green electroluminescent producing higher thresholds in that order. Although threshold differences between lighting colors were statistically significant. the absolute differences in visual sensitivity were small for practical purposes. Luminances required for equal legibility of transilluminated letters o f various sizes were about the same for red incandescent, and white, green, and yellow <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> <b>Electroluminescent</b> lighting of aircraj? instruments is discussed. 1 NTRODUCTlON The purpose {{of this investigation was}} {{to determine the effects of}} exposure to an electro-luminescent-lighted aircraft instrument panel on human dark-adapted vision, The research was prompted by concern with the color and type of aircraft instrument lighting that best ‘enables a pilot to detect dimly illuminated targets outside his aircraft at night.

The EL lamp consists of six printed layers and has been produced in colours: light blue, dark blue, and orange.

40|$|Among various backlights for liquid cr ystal {{televisions}} (LC-TVs) including cold cathodefluorescent lamps (CCFLs) {{and organic}} <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs) have features that cannot be attained by other backlight technologies. LC-TVs suffer from blurringand color separation of images when expressing moving objects. These artifacts can be reduced byhigh speed and precise on-off control of light which can be performed by LEDs without difficulty. To reduce power consumption, local dimming operation as well as independent luminance controlof red, green, and blue LEDs are required. This can never be realized with white CCFLs. Eleven-bit gray levels can be expressed with a precise control of LEDs at low luminance levels. This allows to design arbitrary gamma characteristics of displayed images, and also to enhancecontrast. LEDs’ narrow emission spectra yield wider color gamut compared to other technologies. Another important feature of LEDs {{is that they do}} not contain mercury, unlike CCFLs, andtherefore there is no environmental concern. One of the negative features is high cost. The cost ofa CCFL is typically 7 yens per lumen. That of LED, however, is about 20 times higher. Also about 2, 000 LEDs have to be arranged at the back of an LC panel having a 40 -inch-diagonal screen,whereas only 20 lamps are necessary for CCFLs. A keyword to the future backlight would be “anintelligent backlight. ” The backlight is no more a simple light source, but it is controlled by TVsignal for achieving better picture quality and lower power consumption...|$|R
50|$|The third {{standard}} {{option is to}} use <b>electroluminescent</b> (EL) <b>lamps.</b> They are lower priced compared to fiber optics and offer additional design flexibility. The color of light emitted from an EL lamp can {{vary depending on the}} phosphors that are used. Some common colors are blue/green and yellow/green, white, blue and orange. EL lamps have a half-life of approximately 3000-8000 hours depending upon the quality of the phosphor. Once they reach their half-life, the brightness starts to fade rapidly. EL lamps are thus not a good choice if the lamp is on {{for an extended period of}} time. Fading or flashing could double the life of the lamp.|$|R
40|$|Inorganic–organic {{composite}} and hybrid ﬁlms ﬁnd widespread {{applications for}} the development of functional materials. Polymer matrices with embedded inorganic ﬁllers, nanoparticles or clusters are particularly appealing for optical, electronic, dielectric and magnetic applications. In particular, the development of hybrid layers with tailored dielectric properties represents a key issue in many technological ﬁelds. In this framework, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), due to its outstanding chemico-physical properties, represents a particularly suitable polymer component for the embedding of both microscopic and nanoscopic functional inorganic ﬁllers. The wide use of such a matrix has to {{be traced back to the}} favourable combination of chemical and physical properties and easy processing. In this review, the main features and properties of PMMA, with a particular focus on dielectric ones, are ﬁrstly brieﬂy described. Selected examples to illustrate the state-of-the art of its corresponding use as dielectric matrix are given and several examples are provided and surveyed. Finally, three case studies concerning PMMA-based hybrid ﬁlms, produced for very diﬀerent application ﬁelds, are described and discussed. The ﬁrst example deals with the entrapment of micrometric zinc sulphide powders in PMMA, which acts as a host matrix for the electroluminescent particles in thick ﬁlm-based Alternate Current Powder <b>Electroluminescent</b> <b>Lamps</b> (ACPELs). The second example describes the preparation of low-j inorganic–organic hybrid dielectric ﬁlms based on a PMMA–polyvinylchloride(PVC) blend and a hydrophobic silica powder functionalised on the surface with trimethylsiloxane groups (m-SiO 2).

Die Herstellung der elektronischen Bauelemente erfolgte mittels verschiedener Druckverfahren mit elektrisch leitfähigen und dielektrischen Materialien auf Polycarbonatfolien. Im Fokus standen zum einen kapazitiv auslesbare Speicherstrukturen und zum anderen Elektrolumineszenzleuchten. Nach dem Druck wurden die bedruckten Folien z. T. verformt und hinterspritzt. In der Arbeit wird auf die Auswirkungen der Verform- und Hinterspritzprozesse eingegangen. Schwerpunktmäßig wird die elektronische bzw. optische Funktionalität der Bauelemente, die Beeinflussung durch Klimaveränderungen und die Haftfestigkeit der Folien betrachtet. Im Ergebnis konnten erstmals die Realisierbarkeit hinterspritzter elektronischer Bauelemente nachgewiesen sowie verschiedene Einflussfaktoren auf deren Funktionalität identifiziert werden.

500|$|The skintight suits worn by {{the actors}} were {{reminiscent}} of the outfits {{worn by the}} actors in the original film. Kosinski believed that the costumes {{could be made to}} be practical due to the computerized nature of the film, as physically illuminating each costume would be costly to the budget. Christine Bieselin Clark worked with Michael Wilkinson in designing the lighted costumes, which used <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>lamps</b> derived from a flexible polymer film and featured hexagonal patterns. The lights passed through the suit via Light Tape, a substance composed of Honeywell lamination and Sylvania phosphors. To concoct a color, a transparent 3M Vinyl film was applied onto the phosphor prior to lamination. While most of the suits were made out of foam latex, others derived from spandex, which was sprayed with balloon rubber, ultimately giving the illusion of a lean shape. The actors had to be compressed to compensate for the bulk of the electronics. In addition, Clark and Wilkinson designed over 140 background costumes. The two sought influence from various fashion and shoe designers in building the costumes. On the back of the suit was an illuminated disc, which consisted of 134 LED lights. It was attached to the suit via a magnet, and was radio-controlled. All the costumes had to be sewn {{in such a way that}} the stitches did not appear, as the design team figured that in a virtual environment the clothes would just materialize, with no need for buttons, zippers or enclosures. According to Neville Page, the lead designer for the helmets, [...] "The art departments communicated very well with each other to realise Joe’s [...] vision. We would look over each other’s shoulders to find inspiration from one another. The development of the costumes came from trying to develop the form language which came from within the film." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} ZnS {{phosphor}} powders, both commercial and experimental, have {{been characterized by}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The microstructure of the phosphors has been compared with the light output (intensity and spectra) obtained when incorporated into an ac-driven <b>electroluminescent</b> test <b>lamp.</b> No evidence {{has been found in}} any samples examined by TEM of Cu 2 S precipitates. It was also found that the brightest emission is obtained when the phosphor particles have a very heavily multiply twinned structure together with a rough profile, and least output when they show the cubic phase. Examination of the electroluminescence output of individual phosphor grains indicates that emission is mostly from material close to the surface and suggests that field emission occurs from the surface which is aided by a marked surface roughness. Finally, the microstructure of a commercial ac powder phosphor sheet device was examined and also found to contain ZnS in the same heavily twinned form...|$|R

2500|$|The Ninety-Eight was restyled for 1980, {{along with}} the Delta 88. That year, it gained a new 307 cid (5.0 L) V8 as an option. The 403 was dropped completely. The 1980 models {{received}} new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing {{the look of the}} car. To improve aerodynamics and fuel economy the hood was sloped downward, while the trunk area was higher. This also gave all models a heavier, more substantial appearance, while even slightly increasing interior and trunk space. 1981 saw the introduction of Buick's 252in³ V6 as standard, as well as a new 4-speed THM200-4R automatic transmission. The gas 350 engine was dropped that same year, completely replaced by the smaller 307. The new Regency Brougham model was introduced for 1982.
