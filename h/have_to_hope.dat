500|$|On January 15, 2015, Carey {{appeared}} on The Ellen DeGeneres Show {{to announce that}} she signed a contract to take up residency at The Colosseum at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas in May and July 2015; it is called #1 to Infinity. During the interview, Carey confirmed [...] "I'm {{going to do my}} first ever residency in Vegas at Caesars." [...] "This is a special event for me. And again, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> that the fans will enjoy this cause I'm gonna be performing, which was kind of inspired by my album #1's, and this is now the updated version with eighteen of them. Hopefully other people will enjoy this. I've never done this before." [...] The confirmation of Carey's residency came after Canadian megastar Celine Dion announced that she had postponed dates of her residency at Caesars Palace to care for her husband, René Angélil, who was suffering from cancer. Aside from singing [...] "Infinity" [...] at her residency, Carey performed a medley of her 1990 debut single [...] "Vision of Love" [...] followed by [...] "Infinity" [...] at the Billboard Music Awards on May 17, 2015; it was her first performance at the ceremony in seventeen years. Andrew Hampp for Billboard described the performance as [...] "octave-leaping" [...] {{and one of the most}} memorable of the night. Other promotional appearances included Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Live! with Kelly and Michael. For the latter, Carey wore an Aurora-inspired dress from the Disney film Sleeping Beauty and performed on Main Street, U.S.A. in Disney World.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the casting}} process, DeKnight stated that [...] "You just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> {{you find the}} right way. Luckily our cast came together, and I couldn't have been happier. No one will ever {{perfectly}} fit what's in your head. For me, the more important thing is not {{whether or not they}} look the part, but if they feel the part." [...] Laray Mayfield and Julie Schubert served as casting directors on the series.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Joe Klein of Time magazine in October 2008, Barack Obama expressed his intention {{to try to work}} with India and Pakistan to resolve the crisis. He said he had talked to Bill Clinton about it, as Clinton has experience as a mediator. In an editorial in The Washington Times, Selig S Harrison, director of the Asia Programme at the Center for International Policy and a senior scholar of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars called it Obama's first foreign policy mistake. In an editorial, The Australian called Obama's idea to appoint a presidential negotiator [...] "a very stupid and dangerous move indeed". In an editorial in Forbes, Reihan Salam, associate editor for The Atlantic, noted [...] "The smartest thing President Obama could do on Kashmir is probably nothing. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> that India and Pakistan can work out their differences on Kashmir on their own". The Boston Globe called the idea of appointing Bill Clinton as an envoy to Kashmir [...] "a mistake". President Obama subsequently appointed Richard Holbrooke as special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan. President Asif Ali Zardari hoped that Holbrooke would help mediate to resolve the Kashmir issue. Kashmir was later removed from Holbrooke's mandate. [...] "Eliminating ... Kashmir from his job description ... is seen as a significant diplomatic concession to India that reflects increasingly warm ties between the country and the United States," [...] The Washington Post noted in a report. Brajesh Mishra, India's former national security adviser, was quoted in the same report as saying that [...] "No matter what government is in place, India is not going to relinquish control of Jammu and Kashmir". [...] "That is written in stone and cannot be changed." [...] According to The Financial Times, India has warned Obama that he risks [...] "barking up the wrong tree" [...] if he seeks to broker a settlement between Pakistan and India over Kashmir.|$|E

60|$|In {{this manner}} did the night pass, in weariness and anxiety. Little was said, and for hours scarce a limb was moved, {{in the group}} that {{clustered}} around the mess-chest.

6000|$|But {{that bit}} of talk had done Paul great good, by rousing him to the thought of what he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> for. There was the Confirmation nigh at hand, and then on beyond there was rest; and the words came into his mind, 'There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Twice {{in writing}} her letter Rachel cut out this latter assertion, but at last, sobbing in despair, she {{restored}} the words.

6000|$|... 'I {{will not}} say,' cried Mr Pecksniff, {{shedding}} tears, 'what a blow this is. I {{will not say}} how much it tries me; how it works upon my nature; how it grates upon my feelings. I do not care for that. I can endure as well as another man. But what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope,</b> and what you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope,</b> Mr Pinch (otherwise a great responsibility rests upon you), is, that this deception may not alter my ideas of humanity; {{that it may not}} impair my freshness, or contract, if I may use the expression, my Pinions. I hope it will not; I don't think it will. It may be a comfort to you, if not now, at some future time, to know that I shall endeavour not to think the worse of my fellow-creatures in general, for what has passed between us. Farewell!' ...|$|E

"Good God, {{how much}} more happily would those learned men then live, than now they do! with {{how much more}} {{assurance}} of their salvation! and, in the hour of death, when {{they are ready to}} stand forth before the dreadful judgment-seat, how much greater reason would they <b>have,</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> well of God's eternal mercy, because they might say, O Lord, thou hast given me five talents, and behold I have added other five.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do no good {{by exposing}} yourself," [...] said Belmont, drawing Colonel Cochrane behind a large jagged boulder, which already {{furnished}} {{a shelter for}} three of the Soudanese. [...] "A bullet is the best we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> for," [...] said Cochrane grimly.

It sailed nearly six weeks ago from Calcutta, and was to have been joined by one from Madras and, {{allowing}} for delays, it ought to have been at Rangoon a fortnight since, and would certainly capture the place without any difficulty. So possibly by the time we reach Ava we shall find that peace has been made.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing,--no secrets but my own," [...] {{answered}} Holgrave. [...] "I can perceive, indeed, that Judge Pyncheon still {{keeps his}} eye on Clifford, in whose ruin he had so large a share. His motives and intentions, however are a mystery to me. He is a determined and relentless man, with the genuine character of an inquisitor; and had he any object to gain by putting Clifford to the rack, I verily believe that he would wrench his joints from their sockets, {{in order to accomplish}} it. But, so wealthy and eminent as he is,--so powerful in his own strength, and in the support of society on all sides,--what can Judge Pyncheon <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> or fear from the imbecile, branded, half-torpid Clifford?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{her wings}} are clipped for the present," [...] Captain Chambers replied. [...] "Of course those rascals carried off the pick of their booty with them; {{but we may}} be well content with what they left behind. It {{will be the best}} haul that we have made for some years. As a rule, the most we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> for is the money fetched by the sale of any {{privateer}} we may catch, and they generally go for next to nothing. I retract what I said--that I would give my share of the prize-money {{to come up with the}} privateers. I certainly never calculated on such a haul as this. I suppose they intend to have gone on storing away their booty till the war came to an end, and then to have chartered a dozen ships to carry it away." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{tried to}} be with Noel as much as possible; and in the evenings they {{sometimes}} went walks together, without ever talking of what was always in their minds. Between six and eight the girl was giving sittings to Lavendie in the drawing-room, and sometimes Pierson would come there and play to them. He was always possessed now {{by a sense of}} the danger Noel ran from companionship with any man. On three occasions, Jimmy Fort made his appearance after dinner. He had so little {{to say that it was}} difficult to understand why he came; but, sharpened by this new dread for his daughter, Pierson noticed his eyes always following her. 'He admires her,' he thought; and often he would try his utmost to grasp the character of this man, who had lived such a roving life. 'Is he--can he be the sort of man I would trust Nollie to?' he would think. 'Oh, that I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> like this that some good man would marry her--my little Nollie, a child only the other day!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{hope for}} a better fate," [...] said the doctor. [...] "Our {{opportunity}} may come if the Master Power is ever involved in an unsuccessful naval war with some other nation, or perhaps in some time of European crisis, when everything hung in the balance, our latent hostility {{might have to be}} squared by a concession of independence. That is what we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> for and watch for. On the other hand, the conquerors have to count on time and tact to weaken and finally obliterate the old feelings of nationality; the middle-aged of to-day will grow old and acquiescent in the changed state of things; the young generations will grow up never having known anything different. It's a far cry to Delhi, as the old Indian proverb says, and the strange half-European, half-Asiatic Court out there will seem more and more a thing exotic and unreal. 'The King across the water' was a rallying-cry once upon a time in our history, but a king on the further side of the Indian Ocean is a shadowy competitor for one who alternates between Potsdam and Windsor." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Mr. Pleydell had {{sufficiently}} {{enjoyed the}} surprise of his guest, he called his attention to Miss Bertram's affairs. 'I was in hopes,' he said, 'though but faint, to have discovered some means of ascertaining her indefeasible right to this property of Singleside; but my researches have been in vain. The old lady was certainly absolute fiar, and might dispose of it in full right of property. All that we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> is, that the devil may not have tempted her to alter this very proper settlement. You must attend the old girl's funeral to-morrow, to which you will receive an invitation, for I have acquainted her agent with your being here on Miss Bertram's part; and I will meet you afterwards at the house she inhabited, and be present to see fair play {{at the opening of}} the settlement. The old cat had a little girl, the orphan of some relation, who lived with her as a kind of slavish companion. I hope she has had the conscience to make her independent, in consideration of the peine forte et dure to which she subjected her during her lifetime.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{no wonder}} the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not {{hesitate}} to adopt it.

6000|$|... "So you {{are going}} back," [...] she said softly. [...] "I wonder {{why so many people}} seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken it for granted that you would settle down here. Even I <b>had</b> begun <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> so." ...|$|R
60|$|A thrill {{passed over}} Mr. Winkle's frame as the {{conviction}} that he <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>hope</b> from his friend's fears, {{and that he was}} destined to become an animated target, rushed forcibly upon him.|$|R
