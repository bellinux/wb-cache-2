[54] In April, 1919, the British Ministry of Munitions {{despatched}} {{an expert}} Commission {{to examine the}} conditions of the iron and steel works in Lorraine and the occupied areas of Germany. The Report states that the iron and steel works in Lorraine, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the Saar Valley, are dependent on supplies of coal and coke from Westphalia. It is necessary to mix Westphalian coal with Saar coal to obtain a good <b>furnace</b> <b>coke.</b> The entire dependence of all the Lorraine iron and steel works upon Germany for fuel supplies [...] "places them," [...] says the Report, [...] "in a very unenviable position." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{maximum demand}} for the steel plant has been {{estimated}} at about 300 MW and the other units of NMDC, namely mines, pellet plant and slurry pumping system etc. require around 120 MW of power. Thus, the total requirement of power would be around 420 MW, out of which about 70 MW would be generated in the steel plant itself based on blast <b>furnace,</b> <b>coke</b> oven and LD gases.|$|E
50|$|Until the mid-1980s, SYSCO {{along with}} its predecessors, Hawker-Siddley, DOSCO, BESCO, and DOMCO/DISCO, was a user of coke as a fuel for the mill's blast <b>furnaces.</b> <b>Coke</b> is {{produced}} by slowly baking coal, evaporating or leaching out various liquids in the process.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} company were not only mining coal and {{ironstone}} but building blast <b>furnaces,</b> <b>coke</b> ovens and chemical plant. Heavy section iron, cast in the foundry was used in two iconic structures: Tower Bridge, crossing the river Thames in London, and the Eddystone Lighthouse.|$|R
50|$|Incorporation {{took place}} in 1922 and was named as the M.A. Hanna Company. In 1929 the Hanna Company {{transferred}} its blast <b>furnaces,</b> <b>coke</b> ovens, and other materials to National Steel Corporation for stock in NSC. Hanna's bituminous coal properties were put into the newly formed Consolidation Coal Company in 1945 in return for CCC stock.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{impetus for}} the {{establishment}} of the Vítkovice ironworks came Dec. 9, 1828 by Olomouc Archbishop Rudolf. Rudolph's Smelter operation was then launched in mid-September 1830. A year later there was a coke plant. The first blast <b>furnace</b> <b>coke</b> was ignited in 1836, the second two years later. In 1852, it was near the smelter based mine depths. As time was running six blast furnaces which were gradually shut down until September 27, 1998, when the last tapping.|$|E
50|$|The {{iron-making}} department {{incorporates the}} blast <b>furnace,</b> <b>coke</b> ovens {{and the power}} and services departments of the Whyalla steelworks. Molten iron is supplied from here to the BOS for manufacture into steel. Coke is produced on site from coal supplied to the plant from Newcastle or Port Kembla and ships are loaded with iron ore for shipment from Whyalla's port. Finished steel products are distributed by sea, road and rail. As of 2014, the steelworks is {{owned and operated by}} Arrium. Previously known as OneSteel, the company was spun out from BHP in 2000.|$|E
50|$|The {{imported}} limestone {{was essential}} as a blast furnace flux. The local coal measures contained two very notable seams. The low sulphur better bed coal {{was used to}} make a blast <b>furnace</b> <b>coke</b> of very high quality. The black bed coal, 130 feet above it, was a good general purpose coal overlain with seams of ironstone with a 32% iron content. The seat earths of the seams yielded ganister (needed for furnace linings) and fire clay. There were intermediate seams of good brick making clay and building stone.|$|E

50|$|The town traces {{its roots}} back to 1858 {{when it was}} known as Broad Fording. Cokeville was served by the Pennsylvania Mainline Canal until the Pennsylvania Railroad located its tracks along the canals towpath around 1864. The name was changed in the early 1870s to Coketown, Coketon, and finally Cokeville after The Isabella <b>Furnace</b> <b>Coke</b> Company erected a 200 oven coke plant on the {{hillside}} above the town. The town was incorporated in 1887. The coke produced here was shipped to the Isabella Blast Furnace in Etna, PA on the Allegheny River. The H.C. Frick Coke Company took over the operation around 1901 and the ovens went out permanently in 1903.|$|E
50|$|The {{thriving}} railroad attracted {{thousands of}} workers and their families to the town and surrounding area. In its heyday Saxton had a bowling alley, a toy factory, a candy factory, a coal power plant, dozens of shops and businesses, and even a 7 Up bottling plant. Saxton {{and the surrounding area}} were full of industry and other businesses. These included a pig iron <b>furnace,</b> <b>coke</b> ovens, a tannery, brickyards, dairies, and others. However, the prosperity would not last, as the mines began to become exhausted of coal after World War Two. This in conjunction with the recession of 1949 caused the railroad to shut down in 1955. Most of the buildings and infrastructure owned by the railroad were abandoned, and has subsequently been salvaged or left to erode away.|$|E
30|$|Based on above considerations, the {{reactive}} {{behavior of}} the blast <b>furnace</b> <b>coke</b> under CO 2 as reaction atmosphere was investigated with and without sodium carbonate as a catalyst in the temperature range of 1073 – 1623  K. Then, two classical kinetic models were employed to describe the kinetics of coke solution loss reaction. Furthermore, kinetics parameters were estimated using the GA method combined with LS.|$|E
50|$|Starting about 1820, coke {{from coal}} {{replaced}} charcoal as the fuel and reducing agent in iron <b>furnaces.</b> <b>Coke</b> {{has a higher}} crushing strength than charcoal, allowing larger smelting furnaces. Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills {{moved closer to the}} coal mines to minimize transportation costs. Although later overshadowed by production from the Lake Superior mines, iron ore mining in New Jersey and New York continued until the 1960s. Iron mining in Pennsylvania ended in 1973.|$|R

Scanning electron microscopy, petrographic and Raman Spectrometric investigations demonstrate the change of structural properties. The mechanism of catalysis has been postulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{modeling of}} the <b>coke</b> <b>furnace</b> in industrial <b>coke</b> equipment {{is not very}} easy due to disturbances, nonlinearity, and switches of coke towers. For characterizing the temperature dynamics in a <b>coke</b> <b>furnace,</b> a more comprehensive RBF modeling method is presented focusing on improving the modeling precision and simplifying the model structure simultaneously. An improved RNA-GA is then utilized to optimize both the structure and parameters of the RBF neural network. RNA encoding and evolution operations, particularly pruning operation and enumerative method, are introduced, and fitness function is designed to obtain the satisfactory modeling performances. The industrial data is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed modeling strategy...|$|R
30|$|The {{raw coke}} {{material}} was the blast <b>furnace</b> <b>coke,</b> {{which came from}} Ma-steel Coking Plant. The catalyst was the reagent grade (> 99.8 %) sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3) from Shanghai Hongguang Chemical Plant. A Cahn Thermax 700 thermogravimetric analyzer was used to conduct the coke solution loss reaction experiments. The protective atmosphere and the reactive atmosphere were provided with a purity > 99.999 % nitrogen gas and a purity > 99.99 % carbon dioxide, respectively, from Ma-steel Coking Plant.|$|E
40|$|Although drum {{strength}} {{has historically}} been the coke quality parameter, more recently, coke reactivity and strength after reaction with C 02 have become the principal criteria by which coals are selected to make blast <b>furnace</b> <b>coke.</b> Typical western Canadian medium volatile, Inertinite-rich coking coals produce cokes that are among the world's best in this test. Vitrinite reflectances of 1. 0 to 1. 6 %, inertinite contents of> 30 %, alkalinity indices of 2700 'F, 1500 'C, and low fluidity, all appear to be contributing agents.

40|$|Coke plays vital {{roles in}} the {{ironmaking}} blast furnace process. It is the furnace fuel for the high temperature process and {{the primary source of}} CO gas for the reduction of iron oxide to metal. It is also an important material in maintaining the furnace permeability required for the high production rates 1. The behavior of coke in the blast furnace is related to its hot strength and reactivity 2.

40|$|Production {{levels on}} each furnace {{exceeded}} 7000 NTHM/day during July. The combined production of 14, 326 {{was a result}} of lower coke rates and below average delay rates on both furnaces, The combined production was at its highest level since September 1997. In August, the combined productivity declined to less than 13, 500 NTHM/day. Although D furnace maintained a production rate in excess of 7000 NTHM/day, C furnace was lower because of a castfloor breakout and subsequent five day repair from August 26 - 30. Despite the lower productivity in August, injected coal and <b>furnace</b> <b>coke</b> rates were very good during the month. During September, the operation was difficult as a result of higher delays on both furnaces. The combined average monthly delay rate was considerably above the twenty-month average of 113 minutes per day and the combined average monthly production was less than 14, 000 NTHM/day. Higher <b>furnace</b> <b>coke</b> rates at lower coal injection levels also contributed to the decrease. Additionally, the coke rate on both furnaces was increased substantially and the injected coal rate was decreased in preparation for the high volatile Colorado coal trial that started on September 28. The furnace process results for this quarter are shown in Tables 1 A and 1 B. In addition, the last twelve months of injected coal and coke rates for each furnace are shown in Figures 1 and 2...|$|E

A catalytic effect showed itself at the oxidation in the air, especially with PbO and K 2 CO 3. These compounds bring the oxidation starting temperature and activation energy down and increase the reaction rate constant most distinctly. The PbO and K 2 CO 3 actions differ in their mechanisms. K 2 CO 3 accelerates particularly the amorphous coke fractions oxidation. In the CO 2 atmosphere an important catalytic effect occurred only with K 2 CO 3. The PbO catalytic influence is less distinct...|$|E

40|$|Steelmaking is {{a highly}} carbon {{intensive}} process. Most of the CO 2 emissions in steelmaking are from the blast <b>furnace.</b> <b>Coke</b> has been the major reductant used in a blast furnace since 1750.
