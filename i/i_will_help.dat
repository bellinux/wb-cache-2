500|$|Renault {{driver and}} two-time Championship winner Fernando Alonso created {{controversy}} {{when he said}} [...] "if I can help, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> Massa." [...] Alonso's departure from McLaren after driving for the British team in 2007 had been acrimonious, and Alonso's dislike for the rookie Hamilton was well documented. Talking about Hamilton's penalty in Japan, Alonso said [...] "I don't know what he did, but it's good he's punished anyway." [...] Hamilton refused {{to be drawn into}} the controversy: [...] "I don't particularly have an opinion on it," [...] he said, adding that he was interested only in his own race.|$|E
500|$|After the {{distress}} of 1897, Victoria sought {{to reassure the}} Munshi. [...] "I have in my Testamentary arrangements secured your comfort," [...] she wrote to him, [...] "and have constantly thought of you well. The long letter I enclose which was written nearly a month ago is entirely and solely my own idea, not a human being will ever know of it or what you answer me. If you can't read it <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> you and then burn it at once." [...] She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain, which he replied was unlikely in the latter's case [...] "judging from his robust appearance and undiminished stoutness". Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too, and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were [...] "the only form of excitement she can have".|$|E
2500|$|The formal beatification of Faustina {{involved}} {{the case of}} Maureen Digan of Massachusetts. In March 1981 Digan reported a healing, while praying at the tomb of Faustina. Digan had suffered from Lymphedema (a disease which causes significant swelling due to fluid retention) for decades, and had undergone ten operations, including a leg amputation. Digan reported that while praying at Faustina's tomb, she heard a voice saying [...] "ask for my help and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> you" [...] and her constant pain stopped. After two days, Digan reported that her foot - which had previously been too large for her shoe due to her body's liquid retention, was healed. Upon her return to the United States, five Boston area physicians stated that she was healed (with no medical explanation) and the case was declared miraculous by the Vatican in 1992 based on the additional testimony of over 20 witnesses about her prior condition.|$|E
