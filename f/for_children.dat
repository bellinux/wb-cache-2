Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: Lessons <b>for</b> <b>Children</b> of two to three (1778); Lessons <b>for</b> <b>Children</b> of three, part I (1778); Lessons <b>for</b> <b>Children</b> of three, part II (1778); and Lessons <b>for</b> <b>Children</b> of three to four (1779). After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the progressivity of tax benefits <b>for</b> <b>child</b> care over time.

However, total tax benefits <b>for</b> <b>child</b> care, which include the employer exclusion <b>for</b> <b>child</b> care, were less progressive than the CDCTC alone and became less progressive over time. In simple simulations using 1998 data as the base, {{we find that the}} Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) increases the progressivity of the CDCTC and total tax benefits <b>for</b> <b>child</b> care. ...|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} concerning {{the effects of}} child support. Many earlier studies have assumed full employment. However, in the real economy, there is unemployment. The relation {{between the number of}} children in the economy and unemployment was investigated. The overlapping generation model with involuntary unemployment was used because wages were set by labor unions. First, in the analytical research, {{it was found that the}} wage tax <b>for</b> <b>child</b> support and unemployment insurance both increased unemployment and that the wage tax <b>for</b> <b>child</b> support decreased equilibrium capital stock. Also, the wage tax for unemployment insurance reduced the number of the children in the economy. Second, a simulation {{was conducted}}, which revealed that there is a tax rate at which the number of the children is maximized. At tax rates <b>for</b> <b>child</b> support higher than this maximum, any increase in the tax rate <b>for</b> <b>child</b> support decreases the number of the children! The conclusion showed that tax rates <b>for</b> <b>child</b> support that are too high have a diminishing effect and policy makers should consider the effects of the wage tax <b>for</b> <b>child</b> support and unemployment. overlapping generation model, involuntary unemployment, child support...|$|R
