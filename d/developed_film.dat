5|$|Copies of the <b>developed</b> <b>film</b> or {{summaries}} {{prepared by}} Moyzisch were promptly {{passed on to}} senior German leaders. Ribbentrop showed the initial set of photographs to Hitler immediately upon receipt. Hitler entered a conference with some Cicero materials in December 1943 and declared that the invasion in the west would come in spring 1944. He concluded, though, that there would also be attacks in other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Despite the War Ministry's {{position}} {{immediately after}} the First World War, in 1932 {{it was reported that}} the German army was training pigeons for photography, and that the German pigeon cameras were capable of 200 exposures per flight. In the same year, the French claimed that they had <b>developed</b> <b>film</b> cameras for pigeons as well as a method for having the birds released behind enemy lines by trained dogs.|$|E
5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly <b>developed</b> <b>film</b> projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, Cartier-Bresson {{married a}} Javanese dancer, Ratna Mohini. They {{lived in a}} fourth-floor servants' flat in Paris at 19, rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs (now rue Danielle Casanova), a large studio with a small bedroom, kitchen, and {{bathroom}} where Cartier-Bresson <b>developed</b> <b>film.</b> Between 1937 and 1939 Cartier-Bresson worked as a photographer for the French Communists' evening paper, Ce Soir. With Chim and Capa, Cartier-Bresson was a leftist, {{but he did not}} join the French Communist party.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} after the test, Rossi went into the {{darkroom}} with Fermi, and before the newly <b>developed</b> <b>film</b> was dry, they were able to compute the initial growth rate of nuclear activity, which was crucial information for future weapons development. [...] Of three attempts to measure this rate at Trinity, Rossi's {{was the only one that}} was fully successful.|$|E
500|$|At Judith's {{insistence that}} Briscoe is not helping her husband, Quatermass agrees to have Carroon {{transferred}} to a regular hospital, under guard. Meanwhile, Marsh has <b>developed</b> <b>film</b> from a camera that was aboard the rocket, and Quatermass, Lomax and Briscoe have a viewing. The crew is seen for a time pleasantly at their duties; then suddenly, something seems to jar the ship. After that, there is a nightmarish wavering in the air inside the rocket, and the men react as if something frightening, yet not manifestly visible, is there in the cabin with them. [...] One by one they fall, Carroon the last to go.|$|E

500|$|Editing on {{location}} led to additional complications in post-production. The production {{was unwilling to}} risk sending undeveloped film through high-security airports where the cans could be opened, X-rayed, or damaged. Accordingly, film was hand-carried on a flight by a production assistant from Amman to London. After the Super 16mm film was transferred to DVcam at a lab in London, the video dailies were transported by plane back to the Middle East to be imported into the editing system. The whole journey would take anywhere from three days to a week and was described by Innis as the [...] "modern-day equivalent of shipping via donkey cart". The low production budget {{and the lack of}} a <b>developed</b> <b>film</b> infrastructure in the area hampered the process, according to Innis. [...] "We were working with grainy Super 16mm film, editing in standard definition. We tried doing FTP downloads, but at the time the facilities in Jordan simply couldn't handle it." [...] The producer Tony Mark later negotiated the use of a local radio station late at night to receive low-grade QuickTime clips over the Internet so the crew would not be shooting blindly.|$|E
500|$|Rossen {{was one of}} the {{directors}} who <b>developed</b> <b>film</b> gris (French for [...] "grey film"). In his films for Warner Brothers' between 1937 and 1944, consistent themes were the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. After Dust Be My Destiny, written by Rossen and released in 1939, Frank Nugent, who regularly reviewed for The New York Times, complained about Warner Brothers' long line of melodramas about boys from poor neighbourhoods. Unlike filmmakers such as John Ford and Howard Hawks, Rossen was willing to explain his aims as a director: [...] "The element common to many of my films is the desire for success, ambition, which is an important element in American life. It is an important element, and has become increasingly more important in what is known as Western Civilization." [...] Polonsky commented that [...] "Rossen's talent is force applied everywhere without let-up." [...] Neve acknowledged that social concerns were central in most of Rossen's works, but commented that Lilith was different from Rossen's earlier films as it emphasized mood rather than narrative and examined through pictures and silences the nature of maladjustment and madness.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 Discovery Communications {{produced}} a documentary, Loch Ness Discovered, {{with a digital}} enhancement of the Dinsdale film. A person who enhanced the film noticed a shadow in the negative which was not obvious in the <b>developed</b> <b>film.</b> By enhancing and overlaying frames, he found {{what appeared to be}} the rear body of a creature underwater: [...] "Before I saw the film, I thought the Loch Ness Monster was a load of rubbish. Having done the enhancement, I'm not so sure".|$|E

5000|$|Howe's {{earliest}} {{discovery was}} the use of black velvet to make blue eyes show up better on the orthochromatic film stock in use until the early 1920s. Orthochromatic film was [...] "blue blind"; it was sensitive to blue and green light, which showed as white on the <b>developed</b> <b>film.</b> Reds and yellows were darkened. Faced with the problem of actors' eyes appearing washed out or even stark white on film, Howe developed a technique of mounting a frame swathed with black velvet around his camera so that the reflections darkened the actors' eyes enough for them to appear more natural in the <b>developed</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E
