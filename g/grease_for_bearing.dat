50|$|<b>For</b> <b>greased</b> <b>bearings,</b> the low {{pressures}} of lubrication before the grease fitting could often {{result in a}} failure of the grease to travel all the way down into all the voids of the bearing.

40|$|The {{operational}} life of bearings is often {{determined by the}} performance of the lubricating grease. The consistency of the grease prevents it from leaking out of the bearing and provides good sealing properties. The possible ingress of water into the bearing will have a considerable impact not only on this consistency but also on the lubricating ability of the grease. There are numerous applications where water ingress may occur, such as in the steel, food, pulp, and paper industries. Some greases are less sensitive to water than others. No specific guidelines are available to select the proper <b>grease</b> <b>for</b> <b>bearings</b> subjected to water ingress. The goal of the article is to {{contribute to the development of}} such guidelines <b>for</b> <b>greases</b> subjected to water ingress by studying the impact of water on grease rheology. Fully formulated, commercially available greases with the most common thickeners and base oils are used as model greases. It will be shown that water strongly influences rheological properties such as zero-shear viscosity, yield stress, and storage modulus. Calcium sulfonate greases were found to become stiffer after absorbing a considerable amount of water, leading to an increase in zero-shear viscosity and yield stress. However, lithium, lithium complex, and polyurea greases were found to soften, with appreciable changes in measured rheological propertie...|$|R
40|$|Lubricating grease {{is one of}} {{important}} operational parameter in the rolling bearing applications. Specially, {{the selection of the}} lubricating <b>grease</b> <b>for</b> the precision <b>bearing</b> applications is very risky due to many other factors unique to any specific precision <b>bearing</b> environments. <b>For</b> this reason, ASTM F- 34 Tribology Subcommittee did a study to develop a Precision Bearing Grease Selection Guide in joint effort with the Department of Defense (DoD). The {{purpose of this study was}} to take a broad spectrum of lubricating greases used in precision bearings, including instrument bearings, and do a comprehensive series of tests so their properties could be compared. This study is also meant to be a design guide <b>for</b> choosing lubricating <b>greases</b> <b>for</b> future precision <b>bearing</b> applications. As a part of this study, thirty-eight lubricating greases, currently used in the precision bearings, were evaluated in comprehensive series of laboratory tests. Vital recommendations were then made based on a collective effort by members of this community, who span the spectrum from bearing manufacturers, original equipment manufactures (OEMs), grease manufacturers and suppliers, procurement specialists, quality assurance representatives (QARs) from DoD, and end users both inside and outside DoD. This study has been completed within ASTM F- 34 Tribology Subcommittee and published as a new ASTM Standard Guide, F- 2489.

40|$|Grease {{is one of}} {{the major}} bearing {{components}} and the performance of a grease lubricated bearing is strongly determined by the performance of the grease. This paper describes how grease knowledge is linked to improved rolling bearing performance. First the various performance indicators will be described such as rolling bearing life, sealing performance, bearing friction, bearing noise and grease life. Next, the dominating grease parameters and specifications on these aspects will be given. It will also be shown how re-lubrication will enhance the bearing performance. There is synergy between grease formulation and bearing design. In the last years new generation grease lubricated bearings have been developed where grease technology was used to provide significantly lower friction and longer grease life. This was achieved by developing better greases but also by improving the internal bearing design, which could be done by using modern advancements in understanding the lubrication mechanisms. Finally, an outlook will be given on future developments in lubricating <b>greases</b> <b>for</b> rolling <b>bearings.</b> The various test methods are not described in this paper.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the surface quality pointing out the influence of relative sliding on the topography parameters. Traditional roughness parameters as Ra and Rq, deal only with relative high of the asperities to the mean line and they give no information on shape, slope and asperities magnitude, on their appearance frequency on the profile length. The authors analysed a set of 3 D parameters including the amplitude ones (Sa, Sku, Ssk and St) and functional parameters as Svk, Sk and Spk as calculated with a dedicated soft from the bearing area. Tests were done on roller-roller tribotester lubricated with the grease grade UM 185 Li 2 EP (general purpose <b>grease</b> <b>for</b> rolling <b>bearings),</b> the temperature of the environment being kept at 80 °C. There was studied the influence of relative sliding speed on the skewness and the kurtosis of the surface topography, but also on common parameters as Sa and St. Such a study may be used for selecting a suitable surface quality and to evaluate the surface topography degradation in time, after tests under severe conditions, very close to the actual ones...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of base oil type and viscosity on the frictional behaviour of lithium-thickened bearing greases. A series of model lithium greases were manufactured by systematically varying viscosity and type of base oil, so that {{the influence of}} a single base oil property could be studied in isolation. In addition, selected greases were blended with oleic acid, with the purpose of evaluating its effectiveness in further reducing grease friction. Friction coefficient and film thickness were measured in laboratory ball-on-disc tribometers over a range of speeds and temperatures. For a specific oil type, the influence of base oil viscosity on friction was found to be closely related to its effect on film thickness: greases formulated with PAO oils covering a wide range of viscosities gave very similar friction at the same nominal film thickness. For a given base oil viscosity, base oil type was found to have a strong influence on grease friction under all test conditions. PAO-based greases generally produced lower friction than mineral- and ester-based greases. Addition of oleic acid to the test greases did not significantly affect friction within the range of test conditions employed in this study. The results provide new insight into the frictional behaviour of greases, which may be used to help inform new low-friction <b>grease</b> formulations <b>for</b> rolling <b>bearing</b> applications...|$|R

5000|$|Typical {{frequencies}} for oiling {{were one}} oil squirt (to every <b>bearing)</b> <b>for</b> {{each day of}} use, {{or in some cases}} each week. Grease is essentially oil held in a viscous gel or cream whose viscosity is used to hold the oil over time in places where oil alone cannot be supplied constantly enough, and would quickly drip away without the viscous suspension. This trait makes it better <b>for</b> <b>bearings</b> that cannot practically receive new oil on a near-constant basis.
