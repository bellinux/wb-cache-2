6000|$|The {{eye with}} which Mr. Marksman now {{regarded}} {{the picture was}} certainly {{the eye of a}} barbarian; but the eye with which he afterwards examined the supports by which it was suspended, was the eye of a sailor, and of a good practical carpenter to boot. He saw directly, that one of the two iron clamps to which the <b>frame-lines</b> of [...] "Columbus" [...] were attached, had been carelessly driven into a part of the wall that was not strong enough to hold it against the downward stress of the heavy frame. Little warning driblets of loosened plaster had been trickling down rapidly behind the canvas; but nobody heard them fall in the general buzz of talking; and nobody noticed the thin, fine crack above the iron clamp, which was now lengthening stealthily minute by minute.|$|E
50|$|The earlier Leica CL 40 mm and 90 mm lenses had single coatings, {{and later}} Minolta CL-E {{versions}} {{of these two}} lenses, plus a 28 mm, were multi-coated, with the same optical scheme. The earlier Leica CLs did not have 28 mm <b>frame-lines.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 2012. The Fujifilm X-Pro1, {{announced}} in January 2012, {{was the first}} non-rangefinder mirrorless with a built-in optical viewfinder. Its hybrid viewfinder overlaid electronic information, including shifting <b>frame-lines,</b> {{to compensate for the}} parallax effect. Its 2016 successor, the X-Pro2, features an updated version of this viewfinder.|$|E
50|$|The Leica M-E {{camera body}} was {{announced}} in September 2012. It {{is similar to the}} M9 and M9-P cameras, but is missing the <b>frame-line</b> selection lever (a mechanism which allows the photographer to assess the field of view of lenses with different focal lengths without having to mount them), and the USB port. This is the cheapest model in the Leica M range.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon S4 was a {{rangefinder}} camera {{produced by}} Nikon {{that was very}} similar to the Nikon S3 but had a slightly lower price. This was because it used a cloth shutter curtain (rather than titanium foil curtains) and it lacked the self-timer and motor drive lug of the S3. The viewfinder <b>frame-line</b> for 35mm lenses was also omitted. In all other respects, the cameras were identical.|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve {{selection}} and engineering efficiency in an Australian penaeid fishery, the mesh size and side taper of a generic trawl design were reduced (from 41 to 35. mm) and increased (from 1 N 3 B to 1 N 5 B), respectively and, within the revised design, the independent and combined utility of (i) increasing the <b>frame-line</b> hanging ratio, and (ii) replacing the diamond-orientated wing/side panel with square-orientated mesh were investigated. Compared to the 41 -mm mesh conventional trawl, all of four smaller-meshed designs (comprising either loose or tight hanging ratios, and with diamond- or square-mesh wing/side panels) had lower drag (9 - 12 %) and required less fuel (up to 4 - 12 %). Some of the small-meshed trawls caught fewer unwanted fish-attributed to the steeper side panels allowing individuals to swim forward and escape. Within the small-mesh trawls, there were incremental improvements in size selectivity for the targeted school prawns, Metapenaeus macleayi associated with both modifications. But the square-mesh wing/side panels were {{by far the most}} effective, reducing the catches of sub-commercial school prawns by up to 72 %. The results support simple, retrospectively fitted alterations to existing penaeid-trawl bodies to improve selection and efficiency...|$|R
50|$|Cultural {{differences}} {{exist in the}} ventral visual cortex and many studies have shown this. In a study conducted in 2005 they found that East Asians {{were more likely to}} keep their eyes focused on background scenes than westerners who would instead focus more on the central object such as a giraffe in a savanna. In a similar 2006 study it showed that in congruence to the difference in society structure westerners showed more activation in object processing regions, including the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus, although no activation differences were observed in context-processing regions such as the hippocampus. However, there has been some research contradicting cultural bias in the oculomotor control such as one conducted in 2007 by Rayner, Li, Williams, Cave, and well who failed to find evidence that East Asians focus more on context although they did find evidence that {{they are more likely to}} focus less on central objects. In a different study they focused more on difference in attention towards faces. They proved that Americans focus more broadly on the entire face such as both the eyes and mouth while Asians focus more on a single part, such as the mouth. The authors point out that this happens due to gaze avoidance in east Asian culture as a way of politeness. In 2008, another study focusing on context showed that East Asians were more likely to include greater details and background when taking photographs of a model when they were free to set the zoom function of the camera as they saw fit. In 2003, a group of researchers used the <b>Frame-Line</b> Test and asked the participants to draw a line of either the exact same length as the one showed or one that was proportional in size. Americans were more accurate in the absolute task, suggesting better memory for the exact or absolute size of the focal object, but East Asians were more accurate in the relative (proportional) task, suggesting better memory for contextual relationships. In a later study conducted by the same group they found a pattern within the cultures when processing emotions. East Asians were less likely to know the difference between fear and disgust than Americans when sampling faces.|$|R
