5|$|Background {{selection}} {{is the opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{molecule}} does not form a permanent dipole, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> {{be influenced by}} an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While {{not as strong as}} permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.|$|E

50|$|The branch {{was taken}} out of use in 1916. <b>Its</b> {{trackbed}} <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be clearly traced, and many of the wooden sleepers are still in situ.|$|R
5|$|In 1842, Tonbridge Priory was {{demolished}} to {{make way}} for the building of the first railway station. A stone coffin from the priory was bought by Alexander and taken to Somerhill, where <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be seen. In 1849, Somerhill was bought by Sir Isaac Goldsmid, who passed it on to his son Frederick in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place {{during the early years of}} Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be seen in the north wall– when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E
5|$|The cap {{badge of}} the RWY is the Prince of Wales's {{feathers}} is {{a slightly different}} design to other regiments wearing the same symbol, such as the Royal Regiment of Wales. It is worn on the brown beret with a red baize and a black baize backing. During the First World War, men from the RWY carved their cap badge into the chalk hillside above the village of Fovant where <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be seen today, alongside those of other units.|$|E
50|$|Also, Maltese crown {{served as}} heraldic until 1803. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> be <b>still</b> found in {{coat of arms}} of the Russian town of Gatchina.|$|R
50|$|A {{wilderness}} hut {{was built}} in 1933 in the saddle between the two summits but collapsed {{after only a few}} years. <b>Its</b> remains <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be seen.|$|R
50|$|The ViviCam 7122 is a {{consumer}} point-and-shoot camera made by Vivitar. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> shoot <b>still</b> images and videos with sound. It has a flash.|$|R
5|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of IIH is {{the prevention of}} visual loss and blindness, as well as symptom control. IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and, where applicable, weight loss. IIH may resolve after initial treatment, may go into spontaneous remission (although <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> relapse at a later stage), or may continue chronically.|$|E
5|$|Thus, in the {{presence}} of the inhibitor, the enzyme's effective Km and Vmax become (α/α')Km and (1/α')Vmax, respectively. However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may be a very slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar dissociation constants. In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be possible to estimate Ki' kinetically if Ki is measured independently.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's The Battle of Anghiara was a fresco {{commissioned}} in 1505 for the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Its central scene depicted {{four men}} riding raging war horses {{engaged in a}} battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440. At the same time his rival Michelangelo, who had just finished his David, was assigned the opposite wall. All that remains of Leonardo's work is a copy by Rubens, but Maurizio Seracini is convinced <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be found and has spent a lifetime searching for it. He was allowed to drill some pilot holes in a mural in the Salone dei Cinquecento, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, and his team did find evidence of an oil painting underneath.|$|E
50|$|The pBuffer {{functionality}} {{has been}} later superseded by {{the usage of}} FBOs (Framebuffer Objects). However, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be <b>still</b> used on modern OpenGL drivers.|$|R

6000|$|... '"Oh, cruel, wicked Thor!" [...] {{cried the}} Lady Esclairmonde. [...] "Ah, look see, all of you! The catch is still open! He hasn't locked <b>it.</b> He <b>can</b> <b>still</b> take <b>it</b> off. He <b>can</b> <b>still</b> come back. Come back!" [...] She went {{as near as}} she dared, {{but she could not}} lay hands on Cold Iron. The Boy could have taken it off, yes. We waited to see if he would, but he put up his hand, and the snap locked home.|$|R
5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from this era could travel freely, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> {{be seen in the}} Universe as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Most often, of course, the {{predicate}} {{consists of}} a verb. However, there are several types of nominal predicative constructions, {{with or without a}} copula. Auxiliaries that express direction and aktionsart (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position, e.g. uuž orhison drink- leave- 'drank up'. The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, baj- 'to be', e.g. ter güjž bajna s/he run- be- 'she is running'. Suffixes occupying this position express grammatical aspect, e.g., progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by baj- may follow, e.g., ter irsen bajna s/he come- be- 'he has come'. Here, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single predication, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.|$|E

25|$|Reclaiming {{water for}} reuse {{applications}} {{instead of using}} freshwater supplies can be a water-saving measure.
