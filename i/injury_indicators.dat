40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to test whether high-altitude {{exposure}} (HAE: 0. 9 % O 2 at 0. 47 ATA for 24 hours) was capable of increasing the systemic inflammatory markers as well as the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> in rats, with a secondary goal to test whether preinduction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 by hypobaric hypoxia preconditioning (HHP: 18. 3 % O 2 at 0. 66 ATA for 5 h/day on 5 days consecutively for 2 weeks) attenuated the proposed increased serum levels of both the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators.</b> MethodsRats were assigned to: (1) non-HHP (21 % O 2 at 1. 0 ATA) +non-HAE (21 % O 2 at 1. 0 ATA) group; (2) non-HHP+HAE group; (3) HHP+non-HAE group; (4) HHP+HAE group; and (5) HHP+HSP 70 antibodies (Ab) +HAE group. For the HSP 70 Ab group, a neutralizing HSP 70 Ab was injected intravenously at 24 hours prior to HAE. All the physiological and biochemical parameters were obtained at the end of HAE or the equivalent time period of non-HAE. Blood samples were obtained for determination of both the systemic inflammatory markers (e. g., serum tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 1 β, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and liver myeloperoxidase activity) and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> (e. g., nitric oxide metabolites, 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase). ResultsHHP, in addition to inducing overexpression of tissue HSP 70, significantly attenuated the HAE-induced hypotension, bradycardia, hypoxia, acidosis, and increased tissue levels of both the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators.</b> The beneficial effects of HHP in inducing tissue overexpression of HSP 70 as well as in preventing the HAE-induced increased levels of the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> could be significantly reduced by HSP 70 Ab preconditioning. ConclusionThese results suggest that HHP may downgrade both the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> in HAE by upregulating tissue HSP 70...|$|E
40|$|Background/aims: This paper {{focuses on}} the methods used to develop {{indicators}} for "all injury" incidence for the New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy (NZIPS), launched in June 2003. Existing and previously proposed New Zealand national non-fatal <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> exhibited threats to validity. Population/setting: The total population of New Zealand. Methods: The authors proposed fatal and new non-fatal <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> for "all injury" based on national mortality and hospitalizations data. All of the candidate indicators were subjected to a systematic assessment of validity, using the International Collaborative Effort on Injury Statistics (ICE) criteria. Based {{on the results of}} that validation, the authors identified four proposed NZIPS indicators. Results: The proposed "all injury" indicators were as follows: age standardized injury mortality rate per 100 000 person-years at risk; number of injury deaths; age standardized serious non-fatal injury rate per 100 000 person-years at risk; and number of cases of serious non-fatal injury. The authors identified no threat-to-validity when assessed against the ICE criteria. The estimated numbers and rates of serious non-fatal injury increased over the period, in contrast to the numbers and rates of fatal injury. Conclusion: The authors have proposed serious non-fatal <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> that they judge suffer substantially less bias than traditional non-fatal <b>injury</b> <b>indicators.</b> This approach to indicator development is consistent with the view that before newly proposed indicators are promulgated, they should be subjected to formal validation. The authors are encouraged that the New Zealand Government has accepted these arguments and proposed indicators, and are starting to act on some of their recommendations, including the development of complementary indicators...|$|E

40|$|PurposeAcute work-related {{trauma is}} {{a leading cause of}} death and {{disability}} among U. S. workers. Existing methods to estimate injury severity have important limitations. This study assessed a severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> constructed from a list of severe traumatic injury diagnosis codes previously developed for surveillance purposes. Study objectives were to: (1) describe {{the degree to which the}} severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> predicts work disability and medical cost outcomes; (2) assess whether this indicator adequately substitutes for estimating Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) -based injury severity from workers' compensation (WC) billing data; and (3) assess concordance between indicators constructed from Washington State Trauma Registry (WTR) and WC data. MethodsWC claims for workers injured in Washington State from 1998 - 2008 were linked to WTR records. Competing risks survival analysis was used to model work disability outcomes. Adjusted total medical costs were modeled using linear regression. Information content of the severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> and AIS-based <b>injury</b> severity measures were compared using Akaike Information Criterion and R 2. ResultsOf 208, 522 eligible WC claims, 5 % were classified as severe. Among WC claims linked to the WTR, there was substantial agreement between WC-based and WTR-based indicators (kappa= 0. 75). Information content of the severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> was similar to some AIS-based measures. The severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> was a significant predictor of WTR inclusion, early hospitalization, compensated time loss, total permanent disability, and total medical costs. ConclusionsSevere traumatic injuries can be directly identified when diagnosis codes are available. This method provides a simple and transparent alternative to AIS-based injury severity estimation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze the effect of angular kinematics on head injury in pedestrian head-to-windshield impacts. Three cases of pedestrian head impacts were simulated with FE head and windshield models. The initial impact conditions were obtained from pedestrian accident reconstructions carried out using multi-body pedestrian and car models. The results from the FE head model were compared with injuries reported in the database. Maximum principal strain was chosen as the <b>injury</b> <b>indicator.</b> After successful head injury predictions, the initial velocities were varied and as a result different peak angular velocities and accelerations were simulated. The results showed that increased peak change in angular velocity caused higher maximal principal strain in the brain and in consequence higher probability of Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI), and Acute Subdural Haematoma (ASDH). A dramatic, three-fold increase in the strain levels in the brain was found when doubling the impact velocity.

A greenhouse experiment was conducted in order to evaluate the effects of Zn nutrition and salinity stress and their interaction on agronomical traits, chlorophyll and proline content of rice plant. Eight local and improved low land rice genotypes were grown at 0, 10 and 20 mg Zn kg - 1 soil under saline (6 dS m - 1) or non-saline condition at tillering stage. Results showed that interaction between Zn x salinity effects on filled grains, 100 grain weight and chlorophyll content were widely varied in rice plant genotypes. Only 100 grain weight was significantly differ at Zn x salinity x genotype interaction levels. Free proline content was significantly lower in Zn-efficient genotypes (Shafagh, Pokkali, IR 9764 and IR 9884) in comparison with Zn-inefficient genotypes (Hashemi, Domsiah, Kados and IR 26).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the possible effects of age-related intracranial changes on the potential outcome of diffuse axonal injuries and acute subdural hematoma under rotational head loading. Methods: A simulation-based parametric study was conducted using an updated and validated finite element model of a rat head. The validation included a comparison of predicted brain cortex sliding with respect to the skull. Further, model material properties were modified to account for aging; predicted tissue strains were compared with experimental data in which groups of rats in 2 different lifecycle stages, young adult and mature adult, were subjected to rotational trauma. For the parameter study, 2 age-dependent factors-brain volume and region-specific brain material properties-were implemented into the model. The models young adult and old age were subjected to several injurious and subinjurious sagittal plane rotational acceleration levels. Results: Sequential analysis of the simulated trauma progression indicates that an increase in acute subdural hematoma <b>injury</b> risk <b>indicator</b> occurs at an early stage of the trauma, whereas an increase in diffuse axonal <b>injury</b> risk <b>indicators</b> occurs at a later stage. Tissue stiffening from young adult to mature adult rats produced an increase in strain-based thresholds accompanied by a wider spread of strain distribution toward the rear part of the brain, consistent with rotational trauma experiments with young adult and mature adult rats. Young adult to old age brain tissue softening and brain atrophy resulted in an increase in diffuse axonal injuries and acute subdural hematoma <b>injury</b> risk <b>indicators,</b> respectively. Conclusions: The findings presented in this study suggest that age-specific injury thresholds should be developed to enable the development of superior restraint systems for the elderly.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} alcohol dose, duration of drinking and obesity with abnormal alcohol-related liver <b>injury</b> <b>indicators,</b> the prevalence of alcohol-related liver injury in the island population of China. METHODS: Randomized multistage stratified cluster sampling from the island population of China {{was used in the}} population-based case-control study. Then interview, physical examination, laboratory assessments and ultrasonography were done. RESULTS: Daily alcohol intake ≥ 20 g, duration of drinking ≥ 5 years and obesity were closely related to alcohol-related liver injury (P < 0. 05). The odds-ratio (OR) (95 % CI) was 1. 965 (1. 122 - 3. 442), 3. 412 (1. 789 - 6. 507) and 1. 887 (1. 261 - 2. 824), respectively. The prevalence rate of alcohol-related liver injury in ≥ 20 g daily alcohol intake group and < 20 g daily alcohol intake group was 37. 14 % and 12. 06 %, respectively. The prevalence rate of alcohol-related liver injury in ≥ 5 years drinking group and < 5 years drinking group was 34. 44 % and 8. 53 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: Researchers have {{previously}} {{expressed concern about}} some national indicators of injury incidence and have argued that indicators should be validated before their introduction. Aims: To develop a tool to assess the validity of indicators of injury incidence and to carry out initial testing of the tool to explore consistency on application. Methods: Previously proposed criteria were shared for comment {{with members of the}} International Collaborative Effort on Injury Statistics (ICE) <b>Injury</b> <b>Indicators</b> Group over a period of six months. Immediately after, at a meeting of Injury ICE in Washington, DC in April 2001, revised criteria were agreed over two days of meetings. The criteria were applied, by three raters, to six non-fatal indicators that underpin the national road safety targets for Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Consistency of ratings were judged. Consensus outcome: The development process resulted in a validation tool that comprised criteria relating to: (1) case definition, (2) a focus on serious injury, (3) unbiased case ascertainment, (4) source data for the indicator being representative of the target population, (5) availability of data to generate the indicator, and (6) the existence of a full written specification for the indicator. On application of these criteria to the six road safety indicators, some problems of agreement between raters were identified.

Method: The International Collaborative Effort on Injury Statistics (ICE) Criteria were used for investigating the validity of indicators. Examples of indicators that {{have been found to be}} valid using these criteria are presented. In contrast, examples of national road safety indicators are also presented, whose validity is questionable. Trends in road safety indicators with and without threats to validity are contrasted. Results: The New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy (NZIPS) serious <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> are presented as indicators with no identifiable threats to validity. National road safety indicators from Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, with identifiable threats to validity, are also presented. When trends for the valid NZIPS motor vehicle traffic crash indicators are compared with the New Zealand national road safety indicators, which have identifiable threats to validity, they show contrasting trends. This raises concerns that the current national indicators are potentially misleading. Conclusion: Validation does matter. For any indicator, it is important that it is clearly defined and specified. The specification should make it clear what parameter the indicator aims to reflect. Before use, the indicator should be validated against this target parameter. That parameter, and the indicators aimed to estimate it, should focus attention on important injuries, ie. injuries that are associated with significant mortality, threat-to-life, threat-of-disablement, loss of quality of life, or increased cost...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Cold {{storage is}} {{needed in order to}} delay {{senescence}} &# 13; and achieve a longer commercial life of tropical fruits like mamey sapote (Pouteria &# 13; sapota), therefore, the physiological and biochemical responses of this fruit &# 13; to cold storage were evaluated. Approach: Samples from different &# 13; storage temperature (20, 10 and 2 °C) were taken at five-day intervals and &# 13; Chilling Injury Index (CII), decay (%), pulp firmness, weight loss (%), sucrose, &# 13; fructose and glucose contents, electrolyte leakage (%), ethylene and carbon dioxide &# 13; production rates and the activities of Peroxidase (POD), Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) &# 13; and Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyasa (PAL), were evaluated. Results: &# 13; CII of fruit stored at 2 and 10 °C was similar and symptoms included abnormal &# 13; ripening into trimming zones close to the skin and pulp. Development of CI symptoms &# 13; was more evident after 10 days of storage at 2 and 10 °C. This trend may be &# 13; associated with decrease of sucrose content but not with fructose that increased &# 13; on fruits stored at 2 °C (p Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the sensitivity to mamey &# 13; sapote fruits to low storage temperatures (2 and 10 °C). Symptoms developed &# 13; by fruit include abnormal ripening into trimming zones close to skin, as well &# 13; as darkened zones into middle pulp.

40|$|Abstract: Biomechanical {{abnormalities}} of pronated feet accompanied by functional leg length disparity {{may increase the}} risk of skeletal muscle injury. Objective of the study is to prove that correction of pronated feet by the foot orthoses will reduce the creatine kinase-MM (CK-MM) concentrations as the muscle <b>injury</b> <b>indicator.</b> The design study was double blind randomized clinical trials with control. Research subjects were divided into two groups, group 1 used the foot orthoses while group 2 did not used the foot orthoses. The whole subject examined the concentrations of the CK-MM enzyme before, and 24 – 72 hours after the walking test. The walking test was conducted 15 minutes with maximum speed. The concentration of the CK-MM enzyme before walking test on treatment group was 70. 07 ± 15. 33 International Unit (IU), similar with the control group was 69. 85 ± 17. 03 IU (P= 0. 971). The increased in CK-MM enzyme concentrations 45 hours after the walking test was lower in the treatment group (7. 8 ± 9 IU) than the control group (22. 0 ± 11. 5 IU) (P= 0. 001). The CK-MM enzyme concentrations continued to decline in the treatment group after the second walking test (77. 21 ± 17. 47 IU), and after the third walking test (69. 86 ± 11. 88 IU) (P= 0. 018). The foot orthoses for correcting the pronated feet on the young women with biomechanical abnormalities is able to reduce the degree of the skeletal muscle injury after walking activity...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{confusion about the}} nature of indicators, their use in the injury field and surprisingly little discussion about these important tools. To date discussions of <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> have focused on the content and presentation of health outcome measures and on the dearth of data on exposure measures. Whereas these are valuable measures and assessing the optimal use of available routinely collected data in forming indicators is important, they do not provide sufficient information to support comprehensive prevention efforts, nor do they harness the full potential of indicators as tools to support prevention efforts. This paper provides an overview of the characteristics and uses of indicators for the field of injury prevention {{in order to make the}} case for action indicators and provide a framework for their appropriate use.

40|$|This is {{the first}} study to assess sport {{concussion}} knowledge {{and the effect of}} sport concussion self-report on knowledge in the UK general public. In the online survey, participants (n = 227) stated personal sport concussion history, <b>injury</b> <b>indicators,</b> and rated 26 injury statements for truthfulness using definite (true, false) or non-definite (probably true, probably false) response options. As anticipated, knowledge was limited. Few statement ratings were definite, and misconceptions prevailed. The injury's seriousness was systematically underestimated, suggesting that knowledge may not be sufficient for injury self-diagnosis and self-recovery measures. Sport concussion self-report was associated with more definite than non-definite statement ratings. However, response accuracy did not differ. This suggested that personal injury experience may yield a false sense of security. The use of accessible, easy-to-use tools needs to be promoted to improve sport practice safety...|$|E
40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the association between psychological damage caused by common occupational trauma and metabolic syndrome (MES). Method 571 workers from 20 small Italian companies were invited to fill in the Psychological <b>Injury</b> Risk <b>Indicator</b> (PIRI) during their routine medical examination at the workplace. Results Compared to workers with no psychological injury, workers with a high PIRI score had a sig-nificantly increased risk of having at least one metabolic syndrome component (adjusted hazards ratio, 1. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 to 2. 6). There was a significant increase in the risk of hypertriglyceridemia in male workers (OR 2. 53 CI 95 % 1. 03 - 6. 22), and of hyper-tension in female workers (OR 2. 45 CI 95 % 1. 29 - 4. 66).

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} self-report measure of work-related {{psychological}} injury, the Psychological <b>Injury</b> Risk <b>Indicator</b> (PIRI), with a comparable level of {{accuracy and reliability}} to individual clinical assessment by a skilled clinical psychologist. Method: Two pilot studies investigated the responses of a) 34 frontline police officers completing the PIRI measure who were also examined by a highly experienced clinical psychologist and b) 217 officers who completed the PIRI measure and also the General Health Questionnaire 12 measure. Results: The PIRI scale identified both the presence {{and the level of}} psychological injury in the clinical group with a remarkably high level of correspondence to concurrent clinical assessment (r = 0. 80). Significance: The PIRI scale can be used both for the individual assessment of psychological injury and as a potential online screening tool. Its latter use is that it could enable the early identification of evolving psychological injury among workers, facilitating timely and career-preserving intervention. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} that the trends published in the New Zealand (NZ) Government's 2006 Suicide Trends document for hospitalised self-harm are misleading. Methods: Analysis of incident self-harm events resulting in hospitalisation and reference to published material on <b>injury</b> outcome <b>indicators</b> for the NZ Injury Prevention Strategy (NZIPS). Results: The significant increase in rates of self-harm hospitalisation presented in Suicide Trends from 1989 to a large extent reflect changes in recording practice rather than any change in self-harm in the community. Indicators with significantly fewer threats to validity suggest there has been little, if any, increase in the incidence of self-harm. The authors of Suicide Trends did not adequately specify how they defined a case and, moreover, their methods were not consistent with those used for the NZIPS indicators. Conclusions and Implications: The methodological challenges to producing valid indicators for the purposes of measuring trends in important non-fatal injury are substantial. Unless we accept that the usual methods of measuring trends in non-fatal injury are misleading and commit to taking up the challenge to produce and use better indicators, we will continue to run the risk of misleading ourselves and the public...|$|R
