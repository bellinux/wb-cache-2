5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on <b>functional</b> <b>disability</b> to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.|$|E

It {{is the major}} source of late treatment-related complications, although it less often results in death. In addition to inflammation, chronic graft-versus-host disease may lead to the development of fibrosis, or scar tissue, similar to scleroderma; it may cause <b>functional</b> <b>disability</b> and require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.|$|E

The classes are prefixed with [...] "S" [...] for freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events, [...] "SB" [...] for breaststroke and [...] "SM" [...] for individual medley events. Swimmers with physical disabilities are divided into ten classes based on their degree of <b>functional</b> <b>disability.</b> Those with visual impairments are placed in three additional classes. A final class, S14, is reserved for swimmers with intellectual disabilities.|$|E

500|$|All {{disability}} types {{were eligible}} to participate at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC oversaw classification based on <b>functional</b> <b>disability.</b> General and functional classification {{took place in}} the Paralympic Village, with functional swimming classification taking place on the same dates at the Piscines Bernat Picronell. The process became a contentious issue at the Paralympics because of on-the-spot reclassifications that resulted in changes to the competition schedule. On-the-spot classification or re-classification was viewed as a negative aspect of the 1996 Summer Paralympics, and the Paralympic movement overall. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 54 assessments were conducted, resulting in 13 class changes. There was one Paralympic New Status (PNS) protest and two Paralympic Permanent Status (PPS) protests by a national Paralympic committee, with one classification upheld and two denied. Six classification appeals were lodged for swimming at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving four athletes, resulting in two class changes. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. [...] This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. [...] In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, swimming classification was scheduled to take place at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, with visually impaired swimmers getting classified from September 4 to 6 and all other swimmers being classified from September 3 to 5. [...] For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through [...] classification or reclassification in Rio, their in-competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.|$|E
2500|$|The IBSA {{classification}} system has largely remained unchanged {{since it was}} put in place, even as the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) attempted to move towards a more <b>functional</b> <b>disability</b> and evidence based system that does not rely on medical based classification. In 2003, the IPC made an attempt to address [...] "the overall objective to support and co-ordinate the ongoing development of accurate, reliable, consistent and credible sport focused {{classification system}}s and their implementation." [...] It approved the classification at the IPC General Assembly in 2007 {{as part of the}} overall blind class group, but was still medically based despite changes in other disability types. IBSA was not prepared at the time to move towards a more functional classification system similar to that utilized by other disability groups and sports.|$|E
50|$|There are {{fourteen}} classifications {{based on}} <b>functional</b> <b>disability</b> type. The blind classifications {{are based on}} medical classification, no functional mobility classification.|$|E

This technique was shown to reduce pain and <b>functional</b> <b>disability</b> {{when compared to other}} conservative treatments. These results also had a long- term effect in reducing levels of pain and <b>functional</b> <b>disability.</b> This is because motor programming eventually became automatic, and conscious control was no longer needed to contract the deep abdominal muscles during activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} what strategies people with severe <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities</b> who receive personal assistance in their homes use in their daily life to achieve autonomy, integrity, influence and participation. Qualitative interviews were carried out and subjected to qualitative latent content analysis. The main finding was expressed in terms of six subthemes: trying to keep a private sphere; striving to communicate; searching for possibilities; taking the initiative; striving to gain insight; and using one’s temperament. These generated the overall theme: maintaining dignity in close relationships. This study contributes an understanding of the strategies used by people who are dependent on personal assistance. Future efforts in nursing must focus on supporting personal assistants with ethical knowledge and guidance in order that people with severe <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities</b> are empowered to achieve autonomy, integrity, influence and participation in their daily lives...|$|R

40|$|Bullying {{in schools}} {{is a big}} social problem in today’s society and it affects the {{children}} exposed in a very negative way. The aim of my paper {{is to find out}} if there is a group of students who gets bullied by other students more often than others. I want to study if children with <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities</b> get more bullied than children without <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities</b> and,if this is the case – why is it so? My questions are: Are children with <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities</b> particularly exposed to bullying? How is bullying prevented? In order to get my results I have made three qualitative interviews and analyzed two debate articles concerning bullying of the disabled. My theoretical approach emanates from social constructivism where relations between people are built on lingual interaction. Furthermore, I have raised the topic of social development. In order to achieve a healthy social development it is important that children feel that they belong to a group. In my paper, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that children with functional disorders probably are bullied more often than other children, especially those with a mental disability. A child with a social divergent behaviour is often considered strange among other children, and this may be a reason for bullying. School staff must prioritize their efforts to actively prevent bullying in their daily work. According to my opinion they must pay special attention to those who bullies when they carry out this preventive work...|$|R

50|$|Physiological {{functional}} capacity (PFC) is {{the ability}} to perform the physical tasks of daily life and the ease with which these tasks can be performed. PFC declines at some point with advancing age even in healthy adults, resulting in a reduced capacity to perform certain physical tasks.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{classification}} {{to identify the}} level of <b>functional</b> <b>disability</b> of a rider, completely independent of their skill level. This is because demonstration of skill {{is the purpose of}} competition. Steps are taken before and during the classification process to avoid this. Part of the process involves observing the competitor riding and doing a bench press. For this reason, classifiers do not observe a rider on their horse prior to the bench press to avoid assessing skill at functionality.|$|E

Fractured facial bones, if not properly treated, may cause irreversible esthetic disturbances and <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Early treatment might result in a complete, long-term recovery and might reduce the incidence of complications. 1 We congratulate Okoje et al for their important research. This prospective research examined the frequency and the causes of mouth and jaw injuries among children 0 – 16 years of age between 2002 and 2006. They found that face and mouth injuries are common among patients suffering from multiple injuries and that the frequency of these injuries has increased during the last decade. The three main causes for mouth and jaw fractures are traffic accidents...|$|R
40|$|This is {{in closed}} access {{until it is}} published. Background: Volunteering {{has been linked to}} reduced {{mortality}} in older adults but the mechanisms explaining this effect remain unclear. Objectives: To determine whether volunteering is associated with increased survival in participants of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and to examine whether differences in survival are modified by <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Methods: A multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model was used to estimate the association of volunteering with survival over a period of 10. 9 years in 10, 324 participants, whilst controlling for selected confounders. To investigate effect modification by disability, the analyses were repeated in participants with and without self-reported <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Results: Volunteering was associated with a reduced probability of death from all-causes in univariate analyses (HR = 0. 65, CI 0. 58 - 0. 73, P < 0. 0001), but adjustment for covariates rendered this association non-significant (HR = 0. 90, CI 0. 79 – 1. 01, P = 0. 07).

40|$|Background and Purpose. Shoulder {{dysfunction}} {{is common}} in various patient populations. This investigation was performed to assess shoul-der dysfunction with self-report and performance-based functional measures. Subjects. Fifty men (25 with shoulder dysfunction and 25 without shoulder dysfunction) participated in this study. Methods. Self-report <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities</b> were assessed with the Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF), and electromagnetic tracking sen-sors were used to monitor 3 -dimensional scapular movements during 4 functional tasks. Results. Relative to the control group, the group with shoulder dysfunction showed significant alterations in scapular move-ments (averages of 6. 9 ° less posterior tipping, 5. 7 ° less upward rotation, and 2. 3 cm more elevation). Scapular kinematics correlated signifi-cantly (r) with the Self-report FLEX-SF measure during functional tasks (posterior tipping. 454 to. 712, upward rotation. 296 and. 317, and elevation. 310). Discussion and Conclusion. <b>Functional</b> <b>disabilities</b> were identified with self-report and performance-based functional measures. The inadequate scapular posterior tipping and scapular upward rotation {{as well as the}} excessive elevation may have implica-tions in planning intervention strategies for people with shoulder dysfunction.

40|$|The present review {{examines}} the literature regarding {{the efficacy of}} cognitive-behavioral and other self-control interventions in helping arthritis patients reduce their pain and <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The evidence indicates that self-control interventions have produced significant and positive changes in the pain and <b>functional</b> <b>disabilities</b> of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and arthritis secondary to hemophilia. However, the literature suffers from deficiencies {{with regard to the}} use of small subject samples; inadequate control procedures and follow-up assessments; failure to demonstrate that positive outcomes are related to changes in subjects' covert experiences or control of physiological variables; and reliance upon self-report measures of outcome. The review is followed by a description of a multidisciplinary study of the efficacy of a biofeedback-assisted, cognitive-behavioral group therapy program for rheumatoid arthritis patients that features several methodological improvements relative to previous investigations. The preliminary outcome data show that the cognitive-behavioral intervention is associated with reductions in pain behavior and self-reports of pain and disability. It is concluded that, although the self-control interventions have shown promising results, psychologists must demonstrate positive and reliable outcomes among large numbers of arthritis patients over extended periods of time if the interventions are to be viewed as credible by rheumatologists. ...|$|R
