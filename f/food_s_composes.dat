After assigning the next set to the variable Z, the algorithm determines if the set is partially labeled to be considered for training/updating (i.e. if the set has enough labeled patterns, e.g., at least 5  %) through the function isPartiallyLabeled(Z) which returns “true” if Z is partially labeled and “false” otherwise.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the summer}} of 2007, U. <b>S.</b> <b>food</b> price has {{increased}} dramatically. Given public anxiety over fast-rising food prices in recent years, this paper attempts to analyze the effects of market factors ─ prices of energy and agricultural commodities and exchange rate ─ on U. <b>S.</b> <b>food</b> prices using a co-integration analysis. Results show that the agricultural commodity price and exchange rate play key roles in determining the short- and long-run movement of U. <b>S.</b> <b>food</b> prices. It is also found that in recent years, the energy price {{has been a significant}} factor affecting U. <b>S.</b> <b>food</b> prices in the long-run, but has little effect in the short-run. This implies the strong long-run linkage between energy and agricultural markets has emerged through production of commodity-based ethanol in the recent years.
