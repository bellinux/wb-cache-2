40|$|Background: Shift work {{research}} has shown that the relationship between exposure to irregular working times and sickness absence may differ between working populations. Not much is known about the prevalence of sickness absence in flight crews or about the relationship between exposure to different flight schedules and sickness absence in this population. Aims: To examine the association between cumulative exposure to different <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence in flight crew members. Methods: The study population consisted of flight crew members from a 5 year historic cohort. Flight schedule and sickness absence data were obtained from company records. The association between the cumulative exposure to different <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence episodes of > 7 days was determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Adjusted models were obtained by adding potential confounders. Previous sickness absence was added to compose the fully adjusted models. Results: The records of 8228 employees were analysed. The fully adjusted univariate analyses showed that the numbers of medium-haul flights and flights with time zone crossings were associated with an increase in the odds for sickness absence. The fully adjusted multivariate analyses showed no significant associations between <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence. Conclusions: Cumulative exposure to <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> was not independently associated with sickness absence in flight crew members when previous sickness absence was taken into account. Because sickness absence in the past can predict future absence, preventive strategies targeted at flight crew members with a history of high sickness absence may be effective...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Dynamic sensor network(DSN) {{technology}} {{which is}} based on swarming <b>flight</b> <b>type</b> air node offers analyzed and acquired information on target data gathered by air nodes in rotation flight or 3 dimension array flight. Efficient operation of dynamic sensor network based on air node is possible when problems of processing time, data transmission reliability, power consumption and intermittent connectivity are solved. Delay tolerant network (DTN) can be a desirable alternative to solve those problems. DTN using store-and-forward message switching technology is a solution to intermittent network connectivity, long and variable delay time, asymmetric data rates, and high error rates. However, all processes are performed at the bundle layer, so high power consumption, long processing time, and repeated reliability technique occur. DSN based on swarming <b>flight</b> <b>type</b> air node need to adopt store-and-forward message switching technique of DTN, the cancelation scheme of repeated reliability technique, fast processing time with simplified layer composition...|$|R

40|$|Background: Accelerometry {{has been}} used to {{identify}} behaviours through the quantification of body posture and motion for a range of species moving in different media. This technique has not been applied to flight behaviours to the same degree, having only been used to distinguish flapping from soaring flight, even though identifying the <b>type</b> of soaring <b>flight</b> could provide important insights into the factors underlying movement paths in soaring birds. This {{may be due to the}} complexities of interpreting acceleration data, as movement in the aerial environment may be influenced by phenomena such as centripetal acceleration (pulling-g). This study used high-resolution movement data on the flight of free-living Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and a captive Eurasian griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) to examine the influence of gravitational, dynamic and centripetal acceleration in different <b>flight</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Flight</b> behaviour was categorised as thermal soaring, slope soaring, gliding and flapping, using changes in altitude and heading from magnetometry data. We examined the ability of the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm to distinguish between these behaviours using acceleration data alone. 							Results: Values of the vectorial static body acceleration (VeSBA) suggest that these birds experience relatively little centripetal acceleration in flight, though this varies between <b>flight</b> <b>types.</b> Centripetal acceleration appears to be of most influence during thermal soaring; consequently, it is not possible to derive bank angle from smoothed values of lateral acceleration. In contrast, the smoothed acceleration values in the dorso-ventral axis provide insight into body pitch, which varied linearly with airspeed. Classification of passive <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> via KNN was limited, with low accuracy and precision for soaring and gliding. 							Conclusion: The importance of soaring was evident in the high proportion of time each bird spent in this flight mode (52. 17 – 84. 00 %). Accelerometry alone was limited in its ability to distinguish between passive <b>flight</b> <b>types,</b> though smoothed values in the dorso-ventral axis did vary with airspeed. Other sensors, in particular the magnetometer, provided powerful methods of identifying flight behaviour and these data may be better suited for automated behavioural identification. This should provide further insight into the type and strength of updraughts available to soaring birds. Fil: Williams, H. J [...] Swansea University; Reino UnidoFil: Shepard, E. L.

40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} phenomenal growth of many {{low-cost}} airlines, competitiveness has increased significantly. Within this competition, {{to achieve an}} on-time departure performance is a momentous factor; thus providing those airlines with on-time departure performance with a foremost competitive advantage. On-time departure performance is important for airlines to satisfy passengers by departing on adequate {{scheduled time of departure}} (STD). The main component of achieving on time departure is being able to complete the turnaround time of an aircraft within its scheduled time. By considering this problem, optimally scheduling of turnaround time was studied in this thesis as a real case of a low-cost company. One of the Turkish airline companies was facing many delays occurring because of subjective scheduling of turnaround operations. In order to solve this problem a number of on-site visits were conducted and data was collected from the turnaround operations of Boeing 737 - 800 type of aircrafts from the hub airport of the company. A mathematical model is then developed to find an optimal schedule of operations for four different <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> considering arrival from a domestic or international port and departing to a domestic or international port. The objective of the modelling is to minimise the completion time of the last operation. There are other studies in the literature which were interested to schedule turnaround operations with heuristic approaches and simulation. This study fills the gap of optimisation with integer linear programming (ILP) since there is no other papers used ILP to schedule turnaround operations. The problem was solved using mathematical modelling approach and an optimisation solver (IBM ILOG OPL) to get the results for different scenarios. The results of the model are then interpreted and Gantt charts of schedules for different <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> are generated. In addition to these, models were also run for different disembarking/boarding styles and the fastest completion time of turnaround time was determined. It was concluded that the minimum time of turnaround operations are in domestic-domestic <b>flight</b> <b>type</b> with using passenger stair for disembarking and airbridge for boarding. Finally, critical path in each schedule were listed to indicate the critical operations needed to be focused...|$|R
