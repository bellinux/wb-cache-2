40|$|In neutrophils, as in {{most other}} cell types, Ca 2 + {{signalling}} is important {{for a number of}} cellular activities. Although inositol(1, 4, 5) trisphosphate-mediated release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores is a necessary prelude, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + influx that is responsible for many of the neutrophil responses. We report here that although elevations of cytosolic Ca 2 + do not accompany Fas-mediated apoptosis in neutrophils, the Ca 2 + influx component of the response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) becomes selectively inactived as the neutrophils progress towards accelerated apoptosis induced by Fas (CD 95) cross-linking. After 4 hr incubation at 37 °, untreated neutrophils display an exaggerated Ca 2 + influx phase in response to FMLP. This was absent in neutrophils that had been Fas-activated at the same time. No Ca 2 + influx component was demonstrable by the removal of extracellular Ca 2 + or by Ca 2 + channel blockade with Ni 2 + and no Mn 2 + influx was detectable. The defect could not be attributed to a decrease in receptor sensitivity, receptor coupling or receptor number because the release of stored Ca 2 + remained constant during incubation and was unaffected by Fas activation. Ca 2 + influx became uncoupled from store release before detectable gross morphological changes or phosphatidyl serine externalization and was also insensitive to caspase 3 and 8 inhibitors. These results suggest a mechanism other than caspase-mediated proteolytic damage to components important for Ca 2 + influx...|$|E
40|$|Troponin plays {{a central}} role in {{regulation}} of muscle contraction. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + switch of striated muscles including the heart and in the cardiac muscle is physiologically modulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation at Ser 22 and 23. Many cardiomyopathy-related mutations affect Ca 2 + regulation and/or disrupt the relationship between Ca 2 + binding and phosphorylation. Unlike the mechanism of heart activation, the modulation of Ca 2 +-sensitivity by phosphorylation of the cardiac specific N-terminal segment of TnI (1 - 30) is structurally subtle and has proven hard to investigate. The crystal structure of cardiac troponin describes only the relatively stable core of the molecule and the crucial mobile parts of the molecule are missing including TnI C terminal region, TnI (1 - 30), TnI (134 - 149) (‘inhibitory’ peptide) and the C-terminal 28 amino acids of TnT that are intrinsically disordered. Recent studies over the years have been performed to answer this matter by building structural models of cardiac troponin in phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states based on peptide NMR studies. Now these have been updated by more recent concepts derived from molecular dynamic simulations treating troponin as a dynamic structure. The emerging model confirms the stable core structure of troponin and the mobile structure of the intrinsically disordered segments. We will discuss how we can describe these segments in terms of dynamic transitions between a small number of states with the probability distributions being altered by phosphorylation and by HCM or DCM-related mutations that can explain how Ca 2 +-sensitivity is modulated by phosphorylation and the effects of mutations...|$|E

40|$|Holistic {{approaches}} {{for the analysis}} of physical systems often require more than just a calculation in time domain. Therefore the complete spectrum of computation methods available in SimulationX can be applied to all kinds of Modelica models. The Linear Model Analysis offers many possibilities to examine the behavior of simulation models, e. g. the computation of natural frequencies and damping time constants for arbitrary systems in the operating point. The energy distribution and power dissipation in vibration modes do not only show the effects of changes in the system concerning unwanted vibration modes or frequencies but also provide valuable information for the systematic model reduction and optimization. The module Transfer Functions/Input Output Analysis allows determining the transfer behavior of a system from user-defined inputand excitation quantities to arbitrary output- or result quantities. The Input Output Analysis is applicable to models corresponding to differential algebraic equation systems.

MethodsPre-treatment CA 19 - 9 levels (with concomitant normal bilirubin level) in patients with localized PC were categorized as normal (≤ 35), low (36 – 200), moderate (201 – 1000), or high (> 1000). Post-treatment CA 19 - 9 was measured after neoadjuvant therapy, prior to surgery. ResultsPre-treatment CA 19 - 9 levels were evaluable in 235 patients, levels were normal in 60 (25 %) patients, low in 78 (33 %) patients, moderate in 69 (29 %) and high in 28 (12 %). After neoadjuvant therapy, post-treatment CA 19 - 9 normalized (≤  35) in 40 (51 %) of the patients in the low group, 14 (21 %) of the moderate and 5 (19 %) of the high group (P <  0. 001).

40|$|The {{effect of}} synexin (an adrenal {{medullary}} protein) on <b>the</b> kinetics of <b>Ca</b> 2 +- and Mg 2 +-mediated membrane fusion was examined. Membrane fusion was studied by monitoring intermixing of the aqueous contents of phospholipid vesicles. Synexin facilitated Ca 2 +-mediated, but not Mg 2 +-mediated, fusion of phosphatidate/phosphatidylethanolamine (1 : 3) and phosphatidate/phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylethanolamine/cholesterol (1 : 2 : 3 : 2) vesicles. The threshold concentration of Ca 2 + for fusion was decreased to approximately equal to 10 microM {{in the presence}} of synexin at 6 micrograms/ml and 1. 5 mM Mg 2 + in vesicle suspensions containing 50 microM lipid. This effect of synexin was drastically inhibited by including 25 % phosphatidylcholine (mol/mol) in <b>the</b> vesicle membrane. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> proposed that <b>the</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 +-dependent lipid-specific enhancement of membrane fusion by synexin contributes to an increase in the sensitivity of specific intracellular membranes to Ca 2 + with respect to fusion...|$|R

A critical examination <b>was</b> made for <b>the</b> apparent activation energy {{by means of}} non-isothermal kinetic methods employing multiple heating rates. A systematic and comparative study of thermal decomposition was carried out at different heating rates i. e., 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C min- 1 for various trichloroacetates synthesized. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> observed that <b>the</b> <b>Ca,</b> Sr, and Ba trichloroacetates decompose preferentially to respective metal halides while Be and Mg compounds decompose to metal and metal oxide, respectively. The composition of <b>the</b> ﬁnal residues <b>was</b> also conﬁrmed using FT-IR spectroscopy. The activation energy follows the order: Mg> Ca> Sr> Ba, <b>Be</b> being <b>the</b> exception.

Fusion evaporation (FE), fusion fission (FF), and deep inelastic (DIC) events were identified, also through the {{comparison with the}} prediction of a transport model (stochastic mean field, SMF), coupled to GEMINI++ as an afterburner. This work mainly deals with the study of isospin transport phenomena in DIC events.

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{the preparation of}} the first crystalline compounds based on arylboronate ligands PhB(OH) 3 - coordinated to metal cations: [Ca(PhB(OH) 3) 2], [Sr(PhB(OH) 3) 2]*H 2 O, and [Ba(PhB(OH) 3) 2]. The calcium and strontium structures were solved using powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, respectively. In both cases, <b>the</b> structures <b>are</b> composed of chains of cations connected through phenylboronate ligands, which interact one with each other to form a 2 D lamellar structure. The temperature and pH conditions necessary for the formation of phase-pure compounds were investigated: changes in temperature were found to mainly affect the morphology of the crystallites, whereas strong variations in pH were found to affect the formation of pure phases. All three compounds were characterized using a wide range of analytical techniques (TGA, IR, Raman, XRD, and high resolution 1 H, 11 B, and 13 C solid-state NMR), and the different coordination modes of phenylboronate ligands were analyzed. Two different kinds of hydroxyl groups <b>were</b> identified in <b>the</b> structures: those involved in hydrogen bonds, and those that are effectively "free" and not involved in hydrogen bonds of any significant strength. To position precisely the OH protons within the structures, an NMR-crystallography approach <b>was</b> used: <b>the</b> comparison of experimental and calculated NMR parameters (determined using the Gauge Including Projector Augmented Wave method, GIPAW) allowed the most accurate positions to <b>be</b> identified. In <b>the</b> case of <b>the</b> calcium compound, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> found that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 43 <b>Ca</b> NMR data that are critical to help identify the best model of the structure...|$|R
