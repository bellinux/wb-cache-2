5|$|Austrian {{troops were}} also promised, to be {{dispatched}} from the Austrian Army fighting the French in Northern Italy. These troops could only reach Toulon by sea, scheduled to embark {{from the city}} port of <b>Genoa,</b> capital of the Italian state of the Republic of <b>Genoa,</b> which {{at this stage of}} the war was officially neutral. <b>Genoa</b> was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, in a state of political upheaval. The French Revolution had inspired similarly-minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause. Food supplies were regularly shipped from <b>Genoa</b> to the Republican armies in Southern France, and the demands of Francis Drake, Ambassador to <b>Genoa,</b> that this trade cease went unheeded.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to operate out of <b>Genoa,</b> intercepting and inspecting merchantmen and cutting-out suspicious vessels in both enemy and neutral harbours. Nelson formulated ambitious plans for amphibious landings and naval assaults to frustrate {{the progress of}} the French Army of Italy that was now advancing on <b>Genoa,</b> but could excite little interest in Hotham. In November Hotham was replaced by Sir Hyde Parker but the situation in Italy was rapidly deteriorating: the French were raiding around <b>Genoa</b> and strong Jacobin sentiment was rife within the city itself. A large French assault at the end of November broke the allied lines, forcing a general retreat towards <b>Genoa.</b> Nelson's forces were able to cover the withdrawing army and prevent them from being surrounded, but he had too few ships and men to materially alter the strategic situation, and the British were forced to withdraw from the Italian ports. Nelson {{returned to}} Corsica on 30 November, angry and depressed at the British failure and questioning his future in the navy.|$|E

5|$|The Raid on <b>Genoa</b> {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the harbour of the Italian city of <b>Genoa</b> {{during the first year}} of the French Revolutionary Wars. French Republican forces in the Mediterranean, under pressure from Austrian and Spanish armies, Royalist uprisings and British blockade had suffered the loss of their principal naval base and the fleet stationed there when British forces under Lord Hood seized Toulon at the invitation of the city's Royalist faction. The survivors of the French fleet were scattered across the Mediterranean, several sheltering in neutral Italian harbours, including the frigates Modeste at <b>Genoa</b> and Impérieuse at Leghorn.|$|E

5|$|The key to Ferdinand was {{the threat}} to <b>Genoa.</b> Intelligence {{intercepts}} showed that the Abwehr (German military intelligence) listed {{it as one of}} the main areas they expected an Allied attack. It was not possible to hide the buildup of naval and amphibious forces in the region, which were easily accessible to German aerial reconnaissance. German commanders identified both <b>Genoa</b> and southern France as the only logical targets, so the task for Allied double agents was to convince them that the former was the true goal. The deception was maintained on the invasion date itself, with a tactical deception. The Dragoon fleet travelled on a course toward <b>Genoa</b> until late at night on 14 August, when they turned west toward their real target.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian {{surrender}} to the Allies in September 1943, Premuda was still docked in <b>Genoa,</b> and was seized by Germany. Plans to convert her into a radar picket for night fighters were abandoned. In August 1944, following the replacement of her armament, she was commissioned into the German Navy as a Torpedoboot Ausland (foreign torpedo boat) with the designation TA32. The ship saw action shelling Allied positions on the Italian coast and laying naval mines. In March 1945, she took part in the Battle of the Ligurian Sea against two Royal Navy destroyers, during which she was lightly damaged. She was scuttled the following month as the Germans retreated from <b>Genoa.</b>|$|E

Ocampos made his debut for the club on 5 February, coming on as a late second-half substitute for Andrea Bertolacci in a 1–0 defeat to Sampdoria. He featured sporadically for the club, however, and at the end of the season returned to Marseille having played 29 matches and scored 3 goals across all competitions during his stints with <b>Genoa</b> and Milan.|$|E

At her launching, she was christened Impero, after Italy's empire in Africa. With <b>Genoa</b> being in bombing range of France, and war now a definite possibility, Impero was moved to Brindisi on 8 June 1940 due to fears of French attack. Trieste was considered a better location, but Roma was fitting out there and the shipyard could not handle two battleships at one time. While at Brindisi, some of her machinery was installed, along with parts of her smaller caliber weaponry. Despite the intent to move Impero to a safer location, Brindisi was still hit by Allied bombers, though Impero was not damaged. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to shift production priorities to desperately needed escorts for merchant convoys. As a result, construction of Impero was delayed to expedite those ships. The only work done was the fitting of the engines and some gun mountings.|$|E
