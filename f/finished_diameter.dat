A cube of PPUF having the size of 21 mm was transformed into a roundshape using a vertical wheel grinding with the circular groove pad developed.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) balls have become an {{important}} component for advanced bearings. They are currently finished in industry by V-groove lapping. Their manufacturing costs are high due to longer processing time (6 - 16 weeks) and use of expensive diamond abrasive.

These surface defects can act as nucleation sites for cracks resulting in catastrophic failure by large brittle fracture.

It is still unclear whether NO mediates the effect of sevoflurane on cerebral circulation. We therefore examined this question by measuring the diameter of pial arteries with or without exposure to NO synthase inhibitor, N ω-nitro-L -arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Methods The cranial window technique was employed in experiments using seven cats that received fentanyl and midazolam under mechanical ventilation. Diameters of cerebral pial arteries were observed through the cranial windows using an incident-light fluorescence microscope and video-recorded with a silicon-intensified target tube video camera system. Changes in arterial diameter were measured with an image analyzer after the experiments were <b>finished.</b> The <b>diameters</b> of pial arteries were measured under four conditions follow- ing the protocol below : 1) intravenous anesthesia; 2) intravenous plus sevoflurane anesthe- sia; then after L-NAME infusion, 3) intravenous anesthesia; and 4) intravenous plus sevoflurane anesthesia. Changes in vessel diameter were analyzed. Results The arteries larger than 100 μm were significantly constricted (p< 0. 05) under sevoflurane inhalation; in contrast, after the administration of L-NAME, the arteries were not significantly affected by sevoflurane inhalation. Conclusion L-NAME inhibited the vasoconstriction due to sevoflurane inhalation in cere- bral pial arteries larger than 100 μm.

40|$|In Hong Kong, the {{vibration}} effect of blasting from construction of rock tunnels is often {{limited to a}} defined peak particle velocity (PPV) value for each sensitive receiver affected by the blasting. Slope is considered as a sensitive receiver in Hong Kong whereby the PPV limits {{will continue to be}} the default-controlling factor over explosive charge weight and thus rates of tunnel advancement. The blast-induced vibration limits generally used in Hong Kong or issued by facility owners are prescriptive only. The adopted empirical attenuation equation was based on surface blast vibration monitoring data collected territory wide by the Mines and Quarries Division of the Hong Kong Government. It is unduly overly conservative in many cases as observed in the industry. The Department of Civil Engineering of The University of Hong Kong has collected and analyzed the blasting data from the construction of the Eagle’s Nest Tunnel, which is 2. 1 km long connecting traffic between Sha Tin and the Kowloon area. The tunnel has an arch-shaped profile with a <b>finished</b> internal <b>diameter</b> of 15 m in span and 10 m in height. Assessment has been made on {{the vibration}} effects to nearby slope stability with the use of an advance finite element program that considers the dynamic properties of the soil material and the propagation of dynamic waves. Attenuation constants derived from the blasts in certain sections of the tunnel are reviewed, using square root scaling, along with the statistical goodness of fit tests, to determine the reliability of empirical predictor equations. From the basis of the field data and numerical simulation, it is found that vibration data from blasting must be scrutinized {{to take into account the}} geology, and the free surfaces between the source and the receivers. The attenuation law changes rapidly when data is recorded close to the source and therefore monitoring of vibration close to the blasting source is needed to better define the attenuation constants. With proper calibration of field data, a very good match can be found between the measured attenuation constant and that generated by the finite element program. Using the dynamic stresses generated by blasting at each stage of tunnel advances; finite element analysis on slope stability has been carried out using the stability factor approach. The reduction of factor of safety for slope due to tunnel blasting is small when compared to the analysis assumed in simple closed form solution that is based on greatly simplified boundary condition and elastic theory. There is a great potential to relax the vibration limits currently adopted for slope in Hong Kong, thus improving the efficiency of blasting and shortening the construction time...|$|R
