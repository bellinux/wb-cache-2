5|$|Orientalism {{proposed}} that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, {{meant for the}} self-affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies functioned as a practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination—that is to say, the Western Orientalist <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> about the Orient than do the Orientals.|$|E

Meanwhile, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) has agreed to be a surrogate mother for her brother Frank (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp), but is concerned that they are paying $16,000 for the IVF procedure which only has a 25% chance of success, and is helpless to influence the results.|$|E

40|$|With {{incidents}} of domestic abuse increasing and funding {{to battle the}} problem dwindling, peer-education projects like <b>kNOw</b> <b>More</b> (<b>Know</b> Your Limits _ No Abuse) have become increasingly important. The <b>kNOw</b> <b>More</b> program trains {{high school students to}} deliver emotional presentations about teen relationship abuse to their classmates. This study evaluates how effectively this program educates teenagers about relationship abuse and how to get help. Pre- and post-presentation data were collected from 301 teenagers who received the <b>kNOw</b> <b>More</b> presentation at schools. It was hypothesized that the <b>kNOw</b> <b>More</b> program would (a) increase understanding of relationship abuse and (b) increase understanding of how to seek help for relationship abuse. A series of dependent- samples t-tests indicated that the <b>kNOw</b> <b>More</b> presentation did indeed increase teenagers?? understanding of relationship abuse and understanding of how to seek help, although effect sizes were small. Open-ended questions also indicated that participants absorbed the information presented by the <b>kNOw</b> <b>More</b> peer educators...|$|R
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E

When he does, Johnston learns about the machines that allow a type of time travel and insists on experiencing it himself.

25|$|His {{other groups}} {{would include the}} Adrian Rollini Quintette, The Adrian Rollini Trio (primarily late 1930s), and Adrian and his Tap Room Gang based in the Hotel President at 234 West 48th Street in New York City. He managed Adrian's Tap Room, inside the hotel during the early swing era {{starting}} in 1935, as well as leading the small band of 6–8 players. He had the Whitby Grill on West 45th Street. Both of these were indicative of his inseparability of professional and social life. His clientele in each club were {{for the most part}} musicians on a holiday. Rollini could be found on the radio working with artists like Kate Smith. As if he didn't have enough going for him he turned once again to another phase of musical venture, and opened a store for sale and repair of musical instruments, known as White Way Musical Products which was located at 1587 Broadway. It had long been his belief that the artist playing the instrument <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> about it than the maker concerned only with the mechanics. The shop was a hot spot for autograph hounds who trolled the shop in search of famous band leaders. He was also making excursions between the Georgian Room and the Piccadilly Circus Bar, both in the Piccadilly Hotel. He also began recording for Master and Muzak.|$|E

Evangelist Billy Graham once said, [...] "This country <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> about Jayne Mansfield's statistics than the Second Commandment."

500|$|On 18 November 1763 the Mozart family {{arrived in}} Paris, {{one of the}} most {{important}} musical centres of Europe, and also a city of great power, wealth, and intellectual activity. Leopold hoped to be received by the court of Louis XV at nearby Versailles. However, a recent death in the royal family prevented any immediate invitation, so Leopold arranged other engagements. One person who took particular note of the children was the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior von Grimm, whose journal records Wolfgang's feats in glowing terms: [...] "the most consummate Kapellmeister could not be more profound in the science of harmony and modulation". Leopold's own assessment, written a few months later, was similarly effusive: [...] "My little girl, although only 12 years old, is {{one of the most}} skilful players in Europe and, in a word, my boy <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> in his eighth year than one would expect for a man of forty".|$|E

500|$|Insurance is a {{contract}} based upon speculation. The special facts, {{upon which the}} contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in {{the knowledge of the}} insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation and proceeds upon the confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque as if it did not exist. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law, and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use uberrima fides), it is still used in insurance contracts. In insurance agreements, the insuree inevitably <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> about the risk involved than the insurer; without the requirement for pre-contractual [...] "good faith," [...] the insuree would have no reason to tell the truth, and insurance companies would be loath to make contracts.|$|E
500|$|Author Bob Perelman {{takes the}} {{suspicion}} of empiricism {{one step further}} in his 1994 The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky. Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in ABC of Reading that frame Pound's discussion of Chinese ideograms. The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts: one of Debussy and another of Ravel. Pound states {{that a person who}} attended both concerts <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> about the composers than someone who has only read [...] "ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both". Perelman considers the contradiction between [...] "everyone" [...] and [...] "knowledge" [...] to be the key to Pound's thinking: only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth (whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen); the rest can only make do with [...] "a fog of clichés, received ideas, second-hand and second-rate opinions, written darkness." [...] With regard to the parable, Perelman observes the lack of [...] "scientific institutions, pedagogic procedures, or communicable terminologies" [...] where any mediating written descriptions ("sunfish", [...] "diplodokus") only serve to obscure knowledge. Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world, and [...] "hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism." ...|$|E
