5000|$|... "Kim & Jessie" [...] ranked {{number five}} on Pitchfork Media's {{list of the}} top 100 songs of 2008. Pitchfork's Mark Pytlik said that [...] "with its apocalyptic <b>electric</b> <b>drum</b> hits, keening synths, icily {{detached}} vocals, and volcanic chorus, 'Kim & Jessie' not only ranked as the album's best song, but also combined with the similarly convincing [...] "Graveyard Girl" [...] to make one of the year's most potent 1-2 punches." [...] Paste's Jeff Leven called it the album's [...] "clear standout" [...] and [...] "one of the best songs of 2008." [...] James Gwyther of Drowned in Sound wrote that [...] "the processed vocals from Gonzalez and an overall air of nostalgia ... combine to craft a delicious electro number." [...] Glide Magazine's Chuck Myers explained that the song is [...] "like hearing an alternate-universe version of The Psychedelic Furs, one where Richard Butler couldn't write memorable songs." ...|$|E

It's the first song we've had where I don't play guitar or piano." [...] NME added, on the topic of the lack of guitar and piano, that [...] "the song is built around <b>electric</b> <b>drum</b> patterns and some slap bass from Chris Wolstenholme." [...] Speaking about his slap bass contribution, Wolstenholme joked that [...] "it's probably not ever been cool to play slap bass, ... but on that song it just seemed to work so we kept it in." [...] When played live, Bellamy plays a keytar. Music magazine Q describe the song as having a [...] "minimal and dance-y feel." [...] In the interview with Q, Bellamy also revealed the inspiration behind the song's lyrics, explaining that [...] "it's actually quite a personal song about me and my girlfriend. I'm thinking people have had enough of geo-political stuff {{by the end of the}} album." [...] The style of the song has been compared to that of new wave band Depeche Mode, including their song [...] "New Life".|$|E
