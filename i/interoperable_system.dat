Northrop Grumman's LLDR, using an eye-safe laser wavelength, recognizes targets, finds the range to a target, and fixes target locations for laser-guided, GPS-guided, and conventional munitions. This lightweight, <b>interoperable</b> <b>system</b> uniquely provides range finding and targeting information to other digital battlefield systems allowing the system to provide targeting information for non-guided munitions, or when laser designation is unreliable due to battlefield conditions.

5000|$|The {{notion of}} {{electronic}} tolling {{had been considered}} {{as early as the}} 1980s, particularly in the New York metropolitan area. The tolling agencies of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania—which constitute two-thirds of the United States' $3 billion-a-year toll industry—sought to create a compatible electronic-tolling technology that could be used on the toll roads and bridges of the three states, in an effort to reduce congestion on some of the busiest roadways and toll plazas in the United States. In 1991, the E‑ZPass IAG was created to develop an <b>interoperable</b> <b>system,</b> and involved the participation and cooperation of seven independent toll agencies—the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the New Jersey Highway Authority (which, at the time, operated the Garden State Parkway), the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the New York State Thruway Authority, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, and the South Jersey Transportation Authority (operator of the Atlantic City Expressway). The E‑ZPass trademark, however, belongs to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority has been aggressive at protecting its trademark, including forcing the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to rename the [...] "EZ Pass" [...] regional transit pass to [...] "EZ transit pass" [...] to protect its rights.|$|E

40|$|This short chapter {{introduces}} <b>interoperable</b> <b>systems</b> {{and attempts}} to distinguish the principal research strands in this area. It is not intended as a review. Significant review material is integrated {{with each of the}} succeeding chapters. It is rather intended to whet the appetite for what follows and to provide some initial conceptual orientation. This book concerns the architecture, modelling and management of <b>interoperable</b> computing <b>systems.</b> Our collective research agenda addresses all aspects of <b>interoperable</b> <b>systems</b> development, including the business and industry requirements and environments for distributed information services. Our definition of interoperability is a broad one (it can be usefully contrasted with the rather narrow definition implicit in Wegner, 1996). <b>Interoperable</b> <b>systems</b> are systems composed from autonomous, locally managed, heterogeneous components, which are required to cooperate to provide complex services. Such systems are generally distributed and have significant non-functional constraints on their operation. The systems are open and are subject to continuing change. Interoperability is that property of components and of the means by which the components are composed which ensures that they jointly meet the service requirement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Interoperability {{is a key}} {{property}} of enterprise applications, which is hard to achieve due to {{the large number of}} interoperating components and semantic heterogeneity. Platform-based approaches such as service-oriented architectures address the technical integration of systems. However, a deep integration needs to cover the whole lifecycle of the <b>interoperable</b> <b>system.</b> We propose method engineering as a means for encoding situated knowledge about achieving interoperability in the form of method chunks. We analysed the field of interoperability for enterprise applications and propose that a tool modelling the business- and ICT-related choices in the form of method chunks is needed for a knowledge-based solution of interoperability problems. An industrial case is included to back our claims. ...|$|E
