2500|$|A Royal North-West Mounted Police {{investigation}} {{began after}} word reached Fort Norman that Inuit {{had been seen}} wearing the priests' clothing, {{and the two men}} surrendered themselves without incident in May 1916. Part of Uloqsaq's police statement read, [...] "I wanted to speak; Ilogoak [...] put his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth... Ilogoak pointed the gun at us. I was afraid and I was crying... Sinnisiak said to me 'We ought to kill these white men before they kill us.'" [...] Partly due to a previous incident with similar circumstances following which no action was taken, the authorities wished to make an example out of the two Inuit men, and Sinnisiak was tried in Edmonton for the murder of Rouvière, largely because it was thought that Sinnisiak had been the 'ringleader'. He was found not guilty because the jury thought that the Inuit man had cause to kill the priest.|$|E
2500|$|June Juanico [...] "recalls a {{time when}} she stood up to Elvis in front of his band of hangers-on, who even then were {{beginning}} to accompany him everywhere. He grabbed her arm, took her into the bathroom and declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried me into his trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The next day ... we had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. At least, I {{mean that}} I don't think that I should care to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> {{engagement}} ring so easily. It might be misapplied, you know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “If you’ve done {{making an}} old fool of yourself, sir,” said the major severely, “you’ll oblige me by <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> niece.” ...|$|R
60|$|He placed {{one of his}} brawny <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth, thus endeavoring {{to silence}} me, but with an effort I cast the hand aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} thinking, Giuliana," [...] I {{answered}} wearily, and I passed a <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> brow {{to find it}} moist and clammy. [...] "To-morrow I go hence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Saul! Saul! It's Pierre and Fitz!" [...] I cried, {{no longer}} able to {{restrain}} myself, and little Frenchie clapped his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth on the instant, saying angrily: ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{again he}} placed his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth, and this time, {{in spite of my}} struggles, he managed to keep it there. Then he {{gradually}} forced me close to the rail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow, I {{think it}} is well, Dias, that I took your advice, and <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> gold to Señor Pasquez, for if we do {{fall into the hands}} of any of these gentry, we can lose {{practically}} nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a gruesome}} sight, from which I turned with <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> ears that I might neither see nor hear, and {{trembling}} in every limb with sheer pity though these {{who had been}} thus suddenly hurled into eternity would have killed me without wincing.|$|R
60|$|I {{slid down}} the rubbish, {{struggled}} to my feet, clapped <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching silently with {{his arms over his}} head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then give me mine," [...] cries the critic, {{stretching}} out his palm. [...] "I said that your exhibition would prove a humbug, {{and so it}} has turned out. So, <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> quarter!" ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a second}} titter behind him, whereat he swung round quickly, and the crimson veins in his face {{looked as if they}} must burst. He saw me with my <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth.|$|E
60|$|How long we {{were thus}} {{unconscious}} I {{am unable to}} say; {{but it seemed to}} me as if I had no more than crossed the borders of dreamland before I was awakened by the pressure of a heavy <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth.|$|E
60|$|The emptiness! Ah, it {{was from}} that I shrank. I could have faced pain and anxiety and heartbreak undauntedly, but I could not face that terrible, yawning, barren emptiness. I put <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> eyes to shut it out, but it pressed in upon my {{consciousness}} insistently, {{and would not be}} ignored longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "As we are here," [...] said Sir Piercie Shafton, [...] "unaccompanied by any patrons or seconds, it {{were well}} you should pass your <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> sides, as I shall over yours; not that I suspect {{you to use}} any quaint device of privy armour, {{but in order to}} comply with the ancient and laudable custom practised on all such occasions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} has been talked about a little," [...] said the squire, with a chuckle. [...] "My object has been to prevent the law from <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> {{property}} to the fraudulent claims which my son's creditors were enabled to make, and I have succeeded fairly well. On that head I have nothing to regret. Now your uncle {{is going to take}} other means." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is that?" [...] he asked. [...] "Duke of Reist, I have spared you {{the indignity}} of filling your house with police, but I must call upon you at once to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> prisoner. If not I shall summon my men. I have only to----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is important," [...] Dick replied. [...] "The {{thing has}} weighed {{on me for}} some time. In fact, the load is too heavy and I feel I must get rid of it. I want to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> responsibility, {{and you are the}} head of the house, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{they drew}} nearer I tried to move, but was powerless, {{although}} I {{could see and}} hear all that went on around me. Two or three of the soldiers jumped from their horses and knelt beside me. One of them raised my head, and placed his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> heart.|$|E
60|$|A <b>hand</b> is <b>over</b> <b>my</b> face, A cold hand. I peep {{between the}} fingers To watch {{the world that}} lingers Behind, yet keeps pace.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{said that}} if the man was within his duty the {{accident}} was only one of those which so singular a misfortune brings with it. I would stay while Mr. Macrae wanted me. I <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> keys, and insisted that all my luggage and drawers and things should be examined. But Mr. Macrae would not listen to me, and forbade the fellow to enter any of--the bedrooms.' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were all}} huddled {{together}} {{close to the}} trembling horses, with the thunder clattering overhead, and the lightning spurting like water from a sluice, all ways at once. There was no danger, of course, unless the horses broke loose. I was standing with my head downward and <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth, hearing the trees thrashing each other. I could not see who was next me till the flashes came.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very pleased, madam," [...] {{the captain}} said, bowing to the countess, [...] "to receive you, and beg to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> cabin for your use. The name you bear {{is known to}} all Dutchmen; and even were it not so, anyone {{introduced}} {{to me by my}} good friend Captain Martin would be heartily welcome.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I screamed,' {{said the}} Little Nugget. 'You bet I screamed! What {{would you do}} if you woke up in the dark and found a strong-armed {{roughneck}} prising you out of bed as if you were a clam? He tried to get his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> mouth, but he only connected with my forehead, and I'd got going before he could switch. I guess I threw a scare into that gink!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] said I; and I {{could hardly}} help smiling, the flattery was so piquant, so finely seasoned. She caught the {{prohibited}} smile, though I passed my <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> month to conceal it; and again she made room {{for me to}} sit beside her. I shook my head, though temptation penetrated to my senses at the moment, and once more I told her to go on.|$|E
60|$|It {{comes back}} to me that on the {{following}} day my successor in the governorship of the jail, who he was I know not now, arrived, and that to him in due form I <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> offices and duties. Before I did so, however, I made it my care to release Barnabas, I think on the previous evening. In his cell I read the Augusta's warrant to the old bishop.|$|R
60|$|Hardly had I {{crossed the}} {{threshold}} of the mudhouse when such a sickness came over me that I could not have looked up, though Nanny's voice had suddenly changed to Margaret's. Vaguely I knew that Nanny had put the kettle on the fire--a woman's first thought when there is illness in the house--and as I sat with <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> face I heard the water dripping from my clothes to the floor.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt his}} strong <b>hands</b> close <b>over</b> <b>my</b> fingers and remove {{them one by}} one. His head was quite close to mine, and {{suddenly}} I felt his mustache brush my cheek.|$|R
6000|$|... "I forbade Dr. Barry {{to take it}} off, Richard, {{when you}} lay so white and still. I knew then that you had been true to me, despite what I had heard. And {{if you were to}} die--" [...] her voice broke a little as she passed her <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> brow, [...] "if you were to die, my single comfort would have been that you wore it then." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{gave him}} my hand. He said to himself, 'Aye, aye, here are fingers that have seen canny service.' Then running his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> hair, my face, and my dress, he went on with his soliloquy; 'Aye, aye, muisted hair, braidclaith o' the best, and seenteen hundred linen on his back, at the least o' it. And how do you think, my braw birkie, that you are to pass for a {{tramping}} fiddler?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{passed a}} <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> brow, for {{whenever}} this subject is alluded to between us, I invariably {{feel that there}} is a species of mistiness, in and about the region of thought. I was not displeased, however, for I knew that a heart which loved so truly would not willingly cause me pain, nor would one habitually so gentle and considerate, utter a syllable that she might have reason to think would seriously displease.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Wadham is my legal advisor--or {{rather a}} junior {{representative}} of the firm who conduct my affairs," [...] the Marquis explained. [...] "I have just <b>handed</b> him <b>over</b> <b>my</b> shares in the Pluto Oil Company, for safe keeping." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's little enough," [...] said Alan, {{putting the}} purse in his pocket, [...] "but it'll do my business. And now, John Breck, if ye will <b>hand</b> me <b>over</b> <b>my</b> button, this gentleman and me {{will be for}} taking the road." ...|$|R
5000|$|For Michael, the 788T-SSD's {{ability to}} swap out {{removable}} storage was an advantage, due to himself simply supplying his CompactFlash to the post-production company Light Iron, {{in order for}} them to process the raw unedited footage on the set. Michael stated, [...] "I was basically <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> sound every time a camera roll changed, to a person who was literally five feet away from me" [...] adding that, [...] "They then took my material and synced it with what was coming off the cameras, on the spot. We would rotate CF cards throughout the course of the day." ...|$|R
