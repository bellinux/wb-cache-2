5|$|Another USCGA {{graduate}} was Lieutenant John Gazzo Martinez, who {{was born}} in New Orleans and entered the service during World War II. He received an Academy appointment in 1946, and in 1951 was commissioned an ensign in the Coast Guard. From 1954 to 1956 LTjg. Martinez served as commanding officer at the LORAN Transmitting Station in Yonago, Japan. Martinez prepared and delivered classes in LORAN (Long Range Aids to Navigation) procedures at the U.S. Air Force 34th Bombardment Squadron which was stationed nearby. He was later assigned as advisor in the U.S. Naval Mission to the Haitian Garde-Cotes d'Haiti. He taught classes for the <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> leadership and later oversaw the overhaul of Garde-Cotes patrol vessels.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E

Macaya {{was one of}} {{the first}} black rebel leaders in Saint-Domingue to ally himself with the French Republican commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel.

25|$|Political {{leaders in}} the United States, which was a new {{republic}} itself, reacted with ambivalence, at times providing aid to enable planters {{to put down the}} revolt. Later in the revolution, the US provided support to black <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> forces, with the goal of reducing French influence in North America and the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|The {{unstable}} {{situation in}} Haiti, where elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide had been ousted from office {{by the military}} in September 1991, presented another regional problem. The United States pressured the military government to restore Aristide. In July 1993, the <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> regime agreed to reinstate Aristide by October 30, 1993, but then refused to step down. In October, in an effort Clinton approved even though Aspin opposed it, the United States sent the USS Harlan County carrying 200 troops to Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. Met by a hostile mob of armed Haitians, the ship turned away without attempting to undertake its mission, which the Pentagon described {{as an effort to}} professionalize the <b>Haitian</b> <b>military</b> and undertake civil assistance projects. Some observers attacked Aspin for not taking a harder stand in the administration against an action he opposed and then aborting the effort in the face of local opposition.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this trade with the US, the coup regime was supported by massive profits from the drug trade thanks to the <b>Haitian</b> <b>military's</b> affiliation with the Cali Cartel; Aristide publicly stated that his own pursuit of arresting drug dealers was one event that prompted the coup by drug-affiliated military officials Raul Cedras and Michel Francois (a claim echoed by his former secretary of State Patrick Elie). Representative John Conyers (D-Michigan) {{expressed concern that the}} only US government agency to publicly recognize the Haitian junta's role in drug trafficking was the DEA, and that, despite a wealth of evidence provided by the DEA proving the junta's drug connections, the Clinton administration downplayed this factor rather than use it as a hedge against the junta (as the US government had done against Manuel Noriega). Nairn in particular alleged that the CIA's connections to these drug traffickers in the junta not only dated to the creation of SIN, but were ongoing during and after the coup. Nairn's claims are confirmed in part by revelations of Emmanuel Constant regarding the ties of his FRAPH organization to the CIA before and during the coup government.|$|R

50|$|He {{then spent}} a short stay on Saint-Domingue in 1798, {{where he had}} been sent to be {{governor}} during Sonthonax's second commission. He encouraged the dissension between André Rigaud and Toussaint Louverture which helped to fuel the <b>Haitian</b> Revolution.Toussaint's <b>military</b> leadership during the Haitian Revolution enabled the rebellious slaves to gain the upper hand and to restore most of Saint-Domingue to France. Now that he ruled the island, Toussaint did not wish to surrender power to France and continued to effectively rule the country autonomously. Hédouville was one of the rivals to power Toussaint had to overcome. Hédouville was eventually forced to flee. However, before he left he released André Rigaud from Toussaint's leadership.|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} Haiti {{had been more}} {{economically}} and militarily powerful and had a population 8 to 10 {{times larger than the}} former Spanish colony, having been the richest colony in the western hemisphere before the <b>Haitian</b> Revolution. Dominican <b>military</b> officers agreed to merge the newly independent nation with Haiti, as they sought for political stability under the Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer, and were attracted to Haiti's perceived wealth and power at the time.

5000|$|François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture ( [...] 20 May 1743 - 7 April 1803), {{also known}} as Toussaint L'Ouverture or Toussaint Bréda, was the best-known leader of the <b>Haitian</b> Revolution. His <b>military</b> and {{political}} acumen saved the gains of the first Black insurrection in November 1791. He first fought for the Spanish against the French; then for France against Spain and Great Britain; and finally, for Saint-Domingue against Napoleonic France.

50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 28 July 1958 the insurgents' yacht arrived off Montrouis, in an area known as Déluge, about forty-five miles north of Port-au-Prince. The three <b>Haitians,</b> in <b>military</b> uniform, and the five Americans, dressed as tourists, began transferring weapons and supplies from the Molly C to a small beach cabin. They were observed by local peasants, who alerted {{the headquarters of the}} St. Marc's military district. That evening, a Haitian officer and three soldiers who arrived in a jeep to investigate were fired on by the rebels; one soldier was killed on the spot, and the other three wounded, all later dying. One of the Americans, Arthur Payne, a former Miami-Dade County sheriff's deputy, was wounded in the leg. Taking the jeep, Pasquet and his men began driving to Port-au-Prince.En route to the capital the rebels flagged down and commandeered a passing tap tap, one of the brightly decorated mini-bus taxis common in Haiti. Arriving at the Dessalines barracks about 10 p.m., Pasquet bluffed his way past sentries, saying he was delivering prisoners. Before long, however, the tap tap and its occupants attracted the attention of the garrison, and firing broke out. Three Haitian soldiers were shot, and about 50 more - most of whom had been sleeping - were placed under guard, with officers tied to chairs.|$|R
50|$|Zanmi Lasante faced Haitian {{opposition}} {{during its}} initial stages. The hospital outwardly supported the democratically elected president Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1990. When Aristide {{was removed from}} power by the <b>Haitian</b> Junta, or <b>military,</b> Farmer spoke out against them; thus Zanmi Lasante became {{at odds with the}} military. On multiple occasions, the military investigated the medical complex, threatening to shut it down, or to attack the staff. Only the threat that Zanmi Lasante was the best chance at healing a Haitian soldier when he inevitably became ill was enough to deter them. The clinic saw three years of hardship, with patients afraid to seek medical treatment for fear of getting attacked by Haitian Junta, and Farmer forbidden from entering the country. Fortunately, Aristide was reinstated as president in 1994, and Partners in Health was able to continue improving upon Zanmi Lasante.|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, in 1793, France {{declared}} war on Great Britain. The white planters in Saint Domingue, unhappy with Sonthonax made agreements with Great Britain to declare British sovereignty over the colony, believing that the British would maintain slavery. The British Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger believed {{that the success of}} the slave revolt in Saint Domigue would inspire slave revolts in the British Caribbean colonies and that taking Saint Domingue, the richest of the French colonies would be a most useful bargaining chip to have when the peace negotiations began to end the war, and the interim, occupying Saint Domingue would mean bringing all of its great wealth into the British treasury. The American journalist James Perry noted that the great irony of the British campaign in Haiti was instead of being the great money-spinner as expected, the campaign ended in a complete debacle that cost the British treasury millions of pounds and the British military thousands upon thousands of dead, all for nothing. Spain, who controlled the rest of the island of Hispaniola, would also join the conflict and fight with Great Britain against France. The Spanish forces invaded Saint Domingue and were joined by the slave forces.
