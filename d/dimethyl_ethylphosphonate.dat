40|$|Reviews {{are given}} on the {{preparation}} and properties of arylphosphorus compounds and aliphatic phosphorus compounds containing silicon; on the cleavage of the aryl-silicon bond in acid media; {{and on the}} cleavage of the benzyl-silicon bond in alkaline media. Detailed information has been obtained {{on the effect of}} a variety of phosphorus-containing nuclear substituents on the rates of cleavage of the aryl-silicon bond in concentrated sulphuric acid-glacial acetic acid, and of the benzyl-silicon bond in aqueous methanolic-sodium hydroxide solution. The substituents were found, in most cases, to be strongly electron-withdrawing and the results clearly indicate that the electrons of the benzene ring can enter the d-orbitals of phosphorus. The protonation, in strongly acidic media, of the phosphoryl-oxygen, in triphenylphosphine oxide, was studied spectrophotometrically. It is apparent that triphenylphosphine oxide does not behave as a true Hammett base. Several silicon-substituted derivatives of ethylphosphonic acid and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ethylphosphonate</b> were prepared and the properties of these investigated, with special reference to pyrolytic and solvolytic reactions...|$|E

The addition of the second gate allows selection of individual ion mobility peaks for m/z analysis in the ITMS. This was demonstrated with the organophosphorus ester ions (CWA nerve gas simulants). The ITMS was used to perform isolation and fragmentation of the CWA simulants ions produced in the IMS. For the organophosphates dimethyl methylphosphonate, diethyl methylphosphonate and diisopropyl methylphosphonate, two ion mobility peaks were observed, which are shown to be the ammoniated monomer and ammoniated dimer ions. Using an ElectroSpray Ionisation (ESI) - ITMS, the fragmentation pathway of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ethylphosphonate</b> (DMEP) is investigated. The isotopomers of DMEP have unusual fragmentations, and density functional theory calculations are used to aid in the interpretation of the mechanisms involved in these fragmentations. Of note, it is shown that entropy must be taken into consideration, and hence the free energy of the final transition involved in the mechanism, so that the true rate-limiting steps can be determined. Preliminary fragmentations using ESI-ITMS of eighteen other organophosphorus esters have been undertaken. These give an insight as to which fragmentations will require further investigations involving Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and deuterated isotopomers to fully understand the mechanisms involved.
