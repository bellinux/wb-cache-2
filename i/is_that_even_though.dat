25|$|Being {{the last}} sura of the Quran, it {{is a kind}} of final {{response}} to the invocation that the reader of the Quran made to God in Al-Fatihah, the first sura of the Quran. The response <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> God has provided detailed guidance, the seeker of guidance must also pray to God that he remains free from the waswāsa of the Satan.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} in fielding {{in the two}} sports <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> a cricket ball is harder and heavier than a baseball, the fielders in cricket are more restricted {{in the use of}} protection for the hands. The only fielders who can wear protective gear are the wicket-keeper, who is allowed to wear padded gloves as well as leg guards and a box; and fielders in potentially dangerous close-in positions such as silly point and short leg, who may wear shinpads, boxes and helmets but are not allowed any gloves. In baseball, catchers and first basemen normally wear mitts, which have no fingers and are specially designed for each respective position. The other fielders wear gloves with fingers. (Early baseball was also played bare-handed; gloves were adopted in the later 19th century.) This means that the risk of hand injury due to the impact of the ball is far higher in cricket. Also, especially in Test cricket, it is common for several fielders to be stationed close to the bat (slips, short leg, silly point and similar positions) since the likelihood and value of dismissing a batsman by a catch in a close fielding position is higher. Catching at these positions require exceptional reflexes, skill and courage, associated with bare-handed catching of a hard ball travelling at up to , with reaction times of the order of 0.2 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} fact <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> he had defeated Garrincha {{in league}} games, {{he was so}} afraid of him during the 1962 World Cup he constantly asked where the attacker was.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 {{there was}} over 100 games played under the City Board but {{the cause of}} {{widespread}} regret <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> they had the site, Canon Punch Park was still not ready for matches. The Championships were played in time but the secondary competitions like the leagues were still being played in the winter months.|$|R
50|$|Historically, one of {{the criticisms}} of the H-1B regime had <b>been</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> {{applicants}} <b>were</b> required to make particular attestations in their Labor Condition Applications, {{there were very few}} penalties for those who lied or misrepresented facts in their attestations. ACWIA sought to correct their perceived problem by laying out explicit penalties, in addition to the extra attestations required by Section 412.|$|R
25|$|Even {{with the}} UK's non-frustration {{principle}} directors always {{still have the}} option to persuade their shareholders through informed and reasoned argument that the share price offer is too low, or that the bidder may have ulterior motives that are bad for the company's employees, or for its ethical image. Under common law and the Takeover Code, directors must give out information to shareholders relevant to the bid, but not merely recommend the highest offer. The overriding common law rule, however, is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, which precludes using management powers for the purpose of frustrating takeovers. In Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd the director, purportedly concerned that a takeover bidder would make many workers redundant, issued a block of company shares to a trust, thus ensuring the bidder would remain outvoted. Buckley J held the power to issue shares creates fiduciary duty to only do so for the purpose of raising capital. Directors cannot plead they acted in good faith if a court determines their interests may possibly conflict. The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> directors may wish to protect employees and stakeholders from ominous bidders, the law responds in other ways. UK workers have a minimal measure of job security, with very limited rights to be consulted, and no formal rights outside collective bargaining to participate in elections for the board or codetermine dismissal issues in works councils. Employees do have rights before dismissal or redundancies to reasonable notice, dismissal only for a fair reason, and a redundancy payment, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Moreover, any changes to workers terms and conditions, or redundancies, following a restructuring through an asset (as opposed to share) sale triggers protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 meaning good economic, technical or organisational reasons must be given.|$|E
500|$|Plantinga's {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> God is omnipotent, it {{is possible}} that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil; therefore, there is no logical inconsistency involved when God, although wholly good, creates a world of free creatures who chose to do evil.

2500|$|Further {{criticism}} has been leveled by Brody (2004), {{who claimed that}} unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT [...] "tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks {{that are related to}} the knowledge that is assessed". The main argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> someone knows how he should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.|$|E

2500|$|Reforms continued, and in {{the early}} 2000s {{students}} and faculty at the Pace Law School's Securities Arbitration Clinic wrote about the long-term effects. In 2003, Professor Barbara Black reviewed cases and found that increasingly it was the brokerage firms trying to use the courts to break arbitration clauses. The clinic's associate director, Jill Gross, reviewed the reforms 20 years after the case and concluded that the process was fairer to investors. While she noted some unresolved issues, such as the [...] "paradox" [...] created by McMahon under which investors {{would have a hard time}} proving that securities arbitration procedures did not meet FAA standards if those same standards had been approved by the SEC, she noted that the McMahons would probably turn to arbitration anyway were their case heard today since changes to the 1934 Act had shortened the statute of limitations and made it harder to prove scienter. [...] "Instead, most customer arbitrations today are predicated on state securities acts and common law claims such as breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation and fraud, and draw heavily on principles of equity" [...] she wrote. [...] "The ultimate irony <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the Supreme Court opened the door to securities arbitration, even without the McMahon decision, today’s customers would continue to pursue their claims in arbitration." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment" [...] Bradstreet {{writes a}} letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to {{describe}} her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer {{can be seen as}} a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and warm from the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. [...] "Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn." [...] She wants her husband to know that she needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can't be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband's job is important. He can't be there always and he must go away at times. [...] "Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence." [...] One thing that keeps her going <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> they are far away from each other, they are one with each other.|$|E
2500|$|Asemic writing {{exists in}} many {{different}} forms. It is often created with a pen or brush, but can range from being hand drawn in the sand with a stick and documented by photography, or to works on canvas, paper, computer images, and animations. The key to asemic writing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> it is traditionally [...] "unreadable" [...] it still maintains a strong attractive appeal to the reader's eye. Various asemic writing includes pictograms, or ideograms the meanings of which are sometimes suggested by their shapes, though it may also flow as an abstract expressionist scribble which resembles writing but avoids words. Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader hover in a state between reading and looking. Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense. Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a type of document and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often calligraphic in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense, or can be understood through aesthetic intuition. True asemic writing occurs when {{the creator of the}} asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. ciphers, wildstyle, etc). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes. Influences on asemic writing are illegible, invented, or primal scripts (cave paintings, doodles, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global postliterate style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are alien languages in science fiction, artistic languages, sigils (magick), undeciphered scripts, and graffiti. Uses for asemic writing include mental and creative idea stimulation, non-verbal communication, hoaxes, and general authorial self expression.|$|E

2500|$|Even though Muslim {{women are}} {{forbidden}} to marry non-Muslims in Islamic law, from 1880 to 1949 it was frequently violated in Xinjiang when Chinese men married Muslim Uyghur women. A reason for this, suggested by foreigners, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Uyghur women who married Chinese men were labelled as whores by the Uyghur community, the women obtained benefits from marrying Chinese men as the Chinese protected them from Islamic authorities, meaning that the women were not subjected to the tax on prostitution {{and were able to}} save their incomes for themselves. Chinese men gave their Uyghur wives privileges which Uyghur men's wives did not have, e.g. the wives of Chinese men did not have to wear a veil and a Chinese man in Kashgar once beat a mullah who tried to force his Uyghur wife to veil. The Uyghur women also were not subjected to any legal binding to their Chinese husbands. This meant that they could force their Chinese husbands provide them with as much money as they wanted for their families by threatening to leave them. Additionally, the property of Chinese men was left to their Uyghur wives after they died. Uyghur women considered Uyghur men to be inferior husbands to Chinese and Hindus. Because they were viewed as [...] "impure", Islamic cemeteries banned the Uyghur wives of Chinese men from being buried within them. Uyghur women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns. Besides Chinese men, other men such as Hindus, Armenians, Jews, Russians, and Badakhshanis (Pamiris) intermarried with local Uyghur women. The local society accepted the Uyghur women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law. Uyghur women also conducted temporary marriages with Chinese soldiers temporarily stationed in the area for tours of duty. Once the soldiers' tours of duties ended, they returned to their own cities and often sold their mixed daughters with Uyghur women to their comrades. If they could afford it, the soldiers would take their mixed sons back to their own cities but would leave them behind if they couldn't. The soldiers typically sold their temporary Uyghur wives to comrades or simply left them behind.|$|E
