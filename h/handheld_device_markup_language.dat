30|$|GSDML (Generic Station Description <b>Markup</b> <b>Language)</b> and FDCML (Field <b>Device</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language)</b> [5] on the {{contrary}} are device description languages based on XML. GSDML is primarily established in the Profinet I/O domain and is again used for the configuration and commissioning of systems by engineering tools. FDCML {{on the other hand}} is a metalanguage for describing automation devices from different views, such as communication, functionality, diagnosis and mechanics. Its primary usage is to provide (human-readable) product data sheets and to enable a tool-based commissioning. Its application mainly focuses on INTERBUS components. FDCML is flexible for extensions such as manufacturer-specific attributes, but which on {{the contrary}} inhibits the comparability of devices due to a nonuniform vocabulary.|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{the theory}} of fuzzy logic has been {{strongly}} used for enabling designers of industrial controllers and intelligent decision making frameworks to model complex systems by expressing their expertise through simple linguistic rules. Nevertheless, the design activity of a fuzzy system may be affected by strong difficulties related {{to the implementation of}} a same system on different hardware architectures, each one characterized by a proper set of electrical/electronic/ programming constraints. These difficulties could become very critical when a fuzzy system needs to be deployed in distributed environments populated by a collection of interacting and heterogeneous hardware <b>devices.</b> Fuzzy <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (FML) is a XML-based language whose main aim is to bridge the aforementioned implementation gaps by introducing an abstract and unified approach for designing fuzzy systems in hardware independent way. In details, FML is a novel specific-purpose computer language that defines a detailed structure of fuzzy control independent from its legacy representation and improve systems’ designers capabilities by providing them with a collection of facilities speeding up the whole development process of a centralized or distributed fuzzy system. This chapter is devoted to introduce FML details, an application sample, and it will provided some initial aspects about FML-II, a FML grammar extension aimed at modeling Type-II fuzzy system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Governmental <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (GovML) {{has been}} {{proposed}} by the IST eGOV project to define structures (or vocabularies) for governmental data and metadata. In this paper, the GovML data vocabularies for describing public services and life events are presented. Technically, GovML is a proposed format for XML documents. Its adoption by public authorities will allow users (citizens, businesses) of public services to exploit the potential of XML technology. For example, users {{will be able to}} access governmental information in a unified presentation style through multiple communication channels (web browsers, mobile phones, <b>handheld</b> <b>devices</b> etc). ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{consumer}} electronics devices do not interoperate and {{are hard to}} use. Devices use proprietary, device-specific and inflexible protocols. Resources across device classes, such as personal computers and home appliances cannot be taken advantage of. Even recent efforts to connect sensors into networks concentrate on new, ad-hoc protocols that segregate the low-cost devices into their own little world. If all classes of devices could speak the same language, they could talk directly {{to each other in}} ways natural to the application without artificial technical barriers. This would allow easily creating seamless applications that aggregate the capabilities of all the electronics. The interoperation adds value to all the <b>devices.</b> Extensible <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (XML) Web Services were conceived to solve the e-business interoperation problem. After decades of failed attempts with EDI, SNA, DCOM, CORBA, and other similar technologies, XML and its communication specification SOAP has proven itself to be a viable technology. If XML is good for e-business, could it also be good for embedded systems communication? This paper argues that XML and SOAP indeed can be useful in small devices. Solutions to performance questions are available and techniques are outlined here. New unique challenges, such as heterogeneous configuration, privacy and security issues, and real-time requirements (e. g. for gaming) are identified and solutions outlined. A prototype implementation for low-cost microcontrollers is described with numbers included.

40|$|Abstract – Wireless mobile {{access to}} the Internet is an {{indispensable}} tool for private and corporate users alike; but both industry and academia {{recognize the need for}} better service. Improvements to commercial clipping software are biased toward the needs of the service provider in the form of better billing, dynamic provisioning, etc. Improvements to academic clipping servers focus on exploiting inherent parallelism on a variety of levels but seem to have missed one that our early investigations uncovered. The syntax of the <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> that describes a typical Web page has a tree-like structure, which suggests inherent parallelism, provided the data in one branch of the syntax tree can be processed independently of the others. This research examines the potential for improved quality of service to a <b>handheld</b> <b>device</b> on a wireless link by using a parallel cluster computing architecture as an in-stream proxy server, exploiting parallelism during the <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> transcoding process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Whereas HTML is {{commonly}} used for creating graphical web applications, VoiceXML is used for voice-enabled web applications. But those applications that contain a big data or interaction a single-modality are not suited for small and mobile <b>devices.</b> The multimodal <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> like the XHTML plus Voice(X+V) is used for multimodal applications that are composed of VoiceXML-based voice applications and XHTML-based visual applications. It can overcome the limitations of current voice browser and mobile devices by the efficiency of visual display and ease of speech input. And work to maintain different application documents that are formatted to specific devices on the same web service is not economic. Therefore effort to reuse exiting application documents is necessary. In this paper, we propose a new transcoder with an efficient algorithm to convert exiting VoiceXML-based applications into corresponding multimodal applications. The transcoder consists of the voiceXML parser module for fetching VoiceXML documents, the VoiceXML-to-X+V converter module for transforming a VoiceXML tree into a X+V tree on various rules, and the X+V generator module for editing X+V documents about the X+V tree. As a result, {{all the people who}} uses telephone and the X+V Browser can access VoiceXML-based services. A service provider can reduce cost and time that are in production and maintenance...|$|R
