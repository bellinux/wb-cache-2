30|$|It is {{difficult}} to write some complex characters in a small limited area for <b>stroke</b> recognition; similarly, <b>our</b> <b>stroke</b> recording area should be as large as possible.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a common gestural interface to mobile and pervasive computing devices. We report our {{development of a}} novel technique for recognizing input strokes {{on a range of}} mobile and pervasive devices, ranging from small devices with low processing capabilities and limited input area to computers with wall-sized displays and an input area as large as can be accommodated by motion-sensing technologies such as cameras. Recent work has included implementing and testing <b>our</b> <b>stroke</b> recognition technique and associated object-tracking by camera. Ongoing and future work includes optimizing <b>our</b> <b>stroke</b> recognition and camera-based objecttracking techniques, developing input based on human body tracking and running extended usability evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Notably {{absent from}} current {{practice}} guidelines for common neurologic diseases as stroke and seizure is the revised Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendation for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) testing of all clinical encounters. During a 9 -month period 2 patients with treatable stroke mimics related to HIV type 1 infection were misdiagnosed resulting in delay in beginning antiretroviral therapy and increased cost and morbidity. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the frequency of HIV- 1 screening in <b>our</b> <b>stroke</b> center population and consider the implications of such testing on neurologic disease. We surveyed <b>our</b> <b>stroke</b> center database to determine the frequency of HIV screening in ischemic strokes from January 2005 through May 2011. Of 2806 ischemic strokes, 27 (0. 96 %) patients were HIV-tested during the 6. 5 -year study period. We suggest that incorporating the CDC recommendations for HIV screening into neurology practice guidelines can impact diagnosis and treatment of unsuspected HIV-related neurologic disease with reduction in cost of care and morbidity...|$|R

40|$|We here {{report on}} a 43 -year-old man who was {{repeatedly}} admitted to <b>our</b> <b>stroke</b> unit with acute onset of sensorimotor hemisyndrome of acute onset. In most cases symptoms ceased shortly after admission, but twice when symptoms persisted thrombolytic therapy was applied. This case demonstrates that in emergency situations a rare differential diagnosis like conversion disorder with sensorimotor deficits {{may be hard to}} establish even if the patient presents to the same emergency unit...|$|R
