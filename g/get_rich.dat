5|$|In late 2003, {{following}} the commercial success achieved by 50 Cent's debut studio album <b>Get</b> <b>Rich</b> or Die Tryin, Interscope Records head Jimmy Iovine asserted that 50 Cent {{had a high}} enough profile to move into making films. Plans for a film were revealed the following year, when 50 Cent revealed {{that he would be}} writing and directing his first motion picture, a semi-autobiographical work based on his difficult childhood experiences, with the Oscar-nominated director Jim Sheridan assisting in the production of the film. The film was originally known under the title Locked and Loaded, although this later became <b>Get</b> <b>Rich</b> or Die Tryin. <b>Get</b> <b>Rich</b> or Die Tryin was released to cinemas in 2005, and received generally mixed reviews from contemporary film critics.|$|E
5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to <b>get</b> <b>rich,</b> but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the general preferential attachment function and author fitness, which describe the <b>rich</b> <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> and fit <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> phenomena, in the co-authorship and citation networks of the strategic management scientific community. This has been done by means of the PAFit method using the community's flagship journal, namely Strategic Management Journal. The results suggest the co-authorship and citation temporal networks are governed by both the fit <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> and the <b>rich</b> <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> processes. The average of the attachment exponents in the co-author network is 0. 3 while it is 0. 29 in the citation network, which suggests the <b>rich</b> <b>get</b> <b>richer</b> phenomenon is similarly weak in both networks. On the other hand, the distributions of author fitness in both networks have long right tail, which implies that the intrinsic scientific quality of each author plays a crucial role in getting new citations and new co-authorships. Furthermore, author fitness in both co-authorship and citation networks are found to be consistent with the history of the strategic management scientific community. Comment: 21 Page...|$|R

5|$|The Tramp Dentists is a 1913 American silent short comedy film {{released}} by the newly formed Joker productions by the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. Directed by Allen Curtis, the film's cast includes Max Asher, Lee Morris, Eddie Boland Joseph Singleton and Bobby Vernon. The film is centered on two tramps, Dusty and Weary, who take over a dentist shop and <b>get</b> <b>rich</b> through their untrained dentistry, extracting teeth with pincers and ice tongs. After earning {{a large amount of}} money, the tramps return to their old way of life. Released on October 29, 1913, this film was the second Joker comedy. The film received some criticism for its vulgar humor. The film had a wide national release in the United States, but the film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} {{animation}} and includes several in-jokes about The Simpsons and the animation industry in general. In a scene depicting the Itchy & Scratchy writer's lounge, {{each of the}} writers shown is a caricature of someone working on The Simpsons at the time. The joke was conceived by the show's animators. Later in the episode, Roger Meyers fires a Harvard alumnus who resembles Simpsons writer Jon Vitti. At the awards ceremony, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{is shown in the}} audience. Lisa is also seen reading a book titled How to <b>Get</b> <b>Rich</b> Writing Cartoons by John Swartzwelder, a Simpsons writer credited with nearly sixty episodes of the show. The credits at the end of Bart and Lisa's Itchy & Scratchy episode (shown in very small print) are a copy of the credits at the end of The Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to <b>get</b> <b>rich</b> by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E

5|$|Brannan {{was born}} in Saco, Maine, to Thomas and Sarah Emery Brannan. Because of {{problems}} with his abusive father, when he was fourteen years old Brannan moved with his sister (Mary Ann) and her husband (Alexander) to Painesville, Ohio. It was there that Brannan learned the printer's trade. During their journey to Ohio, the trio found themselves listening to two men whom they would later know as Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball. Brannan's brother-in-law bought {{a copy of the}} Book of Mormon from these street corner missionaries. In the neighboring town of Kirtland, Ohio, Brannan, Alexander, and Mary Ann all joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1842. After his father's death, Brannan inherited a decent sum of money, bought himself out of his last year of his apprenticeship, and invested the rest in a patch of land near Cleveland. Soon after making his investment and hoping to <b>get</b> <b>rich</b> because of said investment, the market crashed and his land was worthless. He made a quick visit to Maine in order to see his ailing mother and then made his way to New Orleans where his brother Thomas was living. The Brannan brothers bought a press and type with what little money they had, but Thomas was taken by yellow fever shortly thereafter. After this tragedy, Brannan made {{his way back to the}} North, stopping in Indianapolis to promote a paper which ultimately failed, before he returned to Painesville.|$|E

25|$|Since {{many banks}} had also {{invested}} their clients' savings {{in the stock}} market, these banks were forced to close {{when the stock market}} crashed.

Thousands of individual investors who believed they could <b>get</b> <b>rich</b> by investing on margin lost everything they had. The stock market crash severely impacted American economy.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, other singers such as Joan Baez have sung {{it during}} their tours.

After {{performing}} at a few folk festivals, he came to the attention of Columbia Records representative John H. Hammond, who signed Cohen to a record deal.

25|$|Although Maynard was {{originally}} {{one of the}} city's largest landholders and strongest boosters, he is considered not to have prospered {{as well as his}} contemporaries. Among the reasons given for this are that his friendly relations with Chief Seattle and other natives made him suspect to his fellow settlers. The surviving city fathers minimized his role in their reminiscences in response to Maynard's autocratic rule of early Seattle. At any rate, he died in a mansion furnished with every comfort. It {{is important to note that}} Maynard's stated purpose was not to <b>get</b> <b>rich</b> but rather to build the greatest city in the world.|$|E
25|$|Top of the Heap was {{a sitcom}} {{starring}} Matt LeBlanc.

The Verduccis were introduced in an earlier episode where Vinnie dated Kelly Bundy, and Charlie was introduced as {{an old friend of}} Al Bundy's. The end of the pilot episode shows Al breaking into their apartment and stealing their TV to replace the one he lost betting on Vinnie in a boxing match. However, the show didn't last long and was ultimately cancelled. It had its own spin-off/sequel called Vinnie & Bobby a year later, which was also cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The third {{release from}} Shady Records was 50 Cent's <b>Get</b> <b>Rich</b> or Die Tryin', in February 2003. The album became the fastest selling debut in U.S. history. Next to be {{released}} from Shady Records was Obie Trice's debut album, Cheers, six months later. Despite having been a commercial success, the album was considered overshadowed by 50 Cent's music at the time. In 2002 and 2003, Shady Records was involved in several controversies with the likes of the inherited Murder Inc. feud that 50 Cent and G-Unit were involved in, on-going problems with the previous co-owners of The Source magazine, namely Benzino, as well as escalating issues with rapper Royce da 5'9", who was previously a friend of Eminem and D12.|$|E

25|$|Between Broadway musicals, Porter {{continued}} {{to write for}} Hollywood. His film scores of this period were You'll Never <b>Get</b> <b>Rich</b> (1941) with Astaire and Rita Hayworth, Something to Shout About (1943) with Don Ameche, Janet Blair and William Gaxton, and Mississippi Belle (1943–44), which was abandoned before filming began. He also cooperated {{in the making of}} the film Night and Day (1946), a largely fictional biography of Porter, with Cary Grant implausibly cast in the lead. The critics scoffed, but the film was a huge success, chiefly because of the wealth of vintage Porter numbers in it. The success of the biopic contrasted severely with the failure of Vincente Minnelli's film The Pirate (1948), with Judy Garland and Gene Kelly, in which five new Porter songs received little attention.|$|E
25|$|Cohan wrote {{numerous}} Broadway musicals {{and straight}} plays {{in addition to}} contributing material to shows written by othersmore than 50 in all.

25|$|Around 1770, a {{small group}} {{consisting}} of Spanish explorers decided that the Cosumnes River Preserve and other places within the Central Valley was a perfect pasture for grazing animals. Trappers came into {{the area around the}} preserve in the early 1800s but found that there was no place to settle and the fur trapping was not worth it. The Mexican government started issuing land grants in 1844 and John Sutter who was a European immigrant {{was one of the first}} to colonize the Cosumnes River area. John Sutter founded the colony New Helvetia and soon some of his assistants moved out to the Cosumnes River Preserve area. Once the California gold rush started in 1848, many miners settled in along the Cosumnes River hoping to find gold and <b>get</b> <b>rich.</b> Once realizing that there wasn't very much gold in the region, they dammed the river and changed the landscape to grow hay, wheat, and various types of fruit. The Miwok people lost sources of food that they relied on and soon after villages and burial grounds were destroyed. Shortly after, the Miwok moved out of the region where the Cosumnes River Preserve is and in 1999, the last person to spoke Plains Miwuk died.|$|E
