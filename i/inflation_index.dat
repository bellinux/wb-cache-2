40|$|In recent years, {{monetary}} policymakers have monitored several {{measures of}} market expectations of future inflation. One {{of these measures}} {{is based on the}} yield differential between nominal and <b>inflation</b> <b>indexed</b> Treasury securities. This yield spread is also called the “breakeven inflation rate. ” An increase in the breakeven rate is sometimes viewed as a sign that market inflation expectations may be on the rise. For example, the FOMC frequently refers to the yield spread as a measure of “inflation compensation” and considers the yield spread an indicator of inflation expectations in policy deliberations.; Accurately inferring market expectations of inflation from yield spreads is difficult. The difficulty lies in the differences in market liquidity conditions between nominal and <b>inflation</b> <b>indexed</b> Treasury securities.; Shen presents evidence that liquidity differences between nominal and <b>inflation</b> <b>indexed</b> Treasuries have been nontrivial. Consequently, simply attributing changes in yield spreads to changes in market inflation expectations and ignoring the liquidity risk premium could lead to inaccurate inflation expectations.
