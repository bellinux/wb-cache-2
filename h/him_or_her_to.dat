5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> deal with intense {{stress in the}} current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that {{can result in a}} wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Yumemi is very {{adamant about}} {{protecting}} humans and is happiest {{when she is}} helping those she serves. When she is unable to help someone, she gets terribly worried that she is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> someone who can. Protecting humans is her top priority and will even ignore previous orders {{to make sure no}} human is harmed when in her care.|$|E

5|$|Gray's Inn and {{the other}} three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a {{barrister}} to the Bar, allowing <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council of the Bar) acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (chambers), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Pilotwings 64 is a 3D flight {{simulator}} {{in which the}} player must complete a variety of missions involving different airborne vehicles and air sports. Before each mission, the player must choose one of six character pilots, each with their own advantages and disadvantages based on factors such as weight. The tests presented to the player require <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> complete an objective in order to earn a license for the given event. Depending on the mission, points are awarded or deducted based on time, damage, fuel usage, accuracy, softness of landing, and similar criteria.

5|$|The Steam client {{includes}} a digital storefront called the Steam Store through which users can purchase computer games. Once {{the game is}} bought, a software license is permanently attached to the user's Steam account, allowing <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> download the software on any compatible device. Game licenses can be given to other accounts under certain conditions. Content is delivered from an international network of servers using a proprietary file transfer protocol. Steam sells its products in US and Canadian dollars, euros, pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, Russian rubles, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupees depending on the user's location. From December 2010, the client supports the Webmoney payment system, which is popular in many European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. Starting in April 2016, Steam began accepting payments in Bitcoin, valued based on the user's geolocation, with transactions handled by BitPay. The Steam storefront validates the user's region; the purchase of titles may be restricted to specific regions because of release dates, game classification, or agreements with publishers. Since 2010, the Steam Translation Server project offers Steam users {{to assist with the}} translation of the Steam client, storefront, and a selected library of Steam games for twenty-seven languages. Steam also allows users to purchase downloadable content for games, and for some specific game titles such as Team Fortress 2, the ability to purchase in-game inventory items. In February 2015, Steam began to open similar options for in-game item purchases for third-party games.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{encounters}} the antagonistic team, Team Galactic, {{early in}} the game, {{when he or she}} must save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, their motives are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh's three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League's Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.|$|E
25|$|Undue influence. When {{a person}} {{makes use of}} or threatens {{to make use of}} force, {{violence}} or restraint, or inflicts or threatens to inflict temporal or spiritual injury, damage, harm or loss on a person to induce <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> vote or refrain from voting, or to punish him or her for having done so; or uses abduction, duress or some fraudulent scheme to impede or prevent a person's free exercise of his or her vote, or to compel or induce <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> vote or refrain from voting, this amounts to the offence of undue influence.|$|E
50|$|Whenever {{a person}} suffers from any {{disadvantages}} that make <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> inferior <b>to</b> others, his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> main aim becomes {{to bring those}} disadvantages to an end.

25|$|Because of the {{two levels}} being {{separate}} on most cars, there is a physical limitation on the conductor, as {{it is difficult for}} <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> verify, collect payment and sell tickets to such a large concentration of passengers in one car on each level, owing to the sometimes short distance between stops.|$|E

25|$|Facebook and Twitter are {{not immune}} to {{messages}} containing spam links. Most insidiously, spammers hack into accounts and send false links {{under the guise of}} a user's trusted contacts such as friends and family.

25|$|A {{series of}} potions, brewed by Snape. A logical riddle, not magic, {{has to be}} solved. There are two doors, blocked by fire.

25|$|Dispositional {{traits and}} inner feeling on the job; such as employee's {{emotional}} expressiveness, {{which refers to}} the capability to use facial expressions, voice, gestures, and body movements to transmit emotions; or the employee's level of career identity (the importance of the career role to one's self-identity), which allows <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> express the organizationally-desired emotions more easily, (because there is less discrepancy between his or her expressed behavior and emotional experience when engaged in their work).|$|E
25|$|In {{a police}} photo lineup, an officer shows {{a group of}} photos to a witness or crime victim and asks <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> pick out the suspect. This is {{basically}} a single-blind test of the witness's memory, and {{may be subject to}} subtle or overt influence by the officer. There is a growing movement in law enforcement to move to a double-blind procedure in which the officer who shows the photos to the witness does not know which photo is of the suspect.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{signature}} symptoms of mania (and to a lesser extent, hypomania) is what many have described as racing thoughts. These are usually instances in which the manic person is excessively distracted by objectively unimportant stimuli. This experience creates an absent-mindedness where the manic individual's thoughts totally preoccupy <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her,</b> making <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> unable <b>to</b> keep track of time, or be aware of anything besides the flow of thoughts. Racing thoughts also interfere {{with the ability to}} fall asleep.|$|R
