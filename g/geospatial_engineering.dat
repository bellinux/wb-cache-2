40|$|Many {{universities}} {{around the}} world are experiencing a {{decline in the number of}} students entering programs in surveying and <b>geospatial</b> <b>engineering,</b> including some institutions with prestigious pasts. For Australia, this raises the question of whether there will be adequate graduates in the future to replace the current cohort of surveying and geospatial professionals when they retire. It is not clear why it has not been possible to attract more school leavers into the surveying and geospatial programs, but it may be because the community at large is unaware of the many career opportunities. Several surveys have been carried out in Australia to determine the status of graduates entering the profession and the impact that shortages of graduates in the surveying and geospatial professions in the future. These shortages could seriously limit the development of infrastructure and housing if they are not overcome. Another issue is whether the demand for graduates is changing due to developments in technology that allow surveying and mapping to be undertaken more quickly and efficiently than in the past. Marketing of education programs into schools and the general population is essential. A solution maybe for a concerted global effort to encourage more school leavers to enrol in surveying and <b>geospatial</b> <b>engineering</b> programs and hence improve the viability of the profession for the future. The paper will review the impacts of shortages in graduates entering the profession and approaches to improve the marketing of the surveying and geospatial professions...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11, 12, and 13, 2011, Athens, Georgia. As a {{follow up}} to the 2007 drought and water {{scarcity}} in Georgia and especially in North Georgia, {{there is a greater}} need of creating new water reservoirs. The main goal {{of this study is to}} use <b>geospatial</b> technology, <b>engineering</b> and environmental knowhow to find suitable locations in North GA for building a reservoir to serve primarily for drinking water supply and irrigation. Another objective is to design the reservoir with proper engineering applications and conduct an environmental impact analysis due to its construction. In order to determine reservoir suitable sites in North Georgia, a geospatial model was created with ArcGIS 9. 3 Model Builder based on land use, DEM (Digital Elevation Model), Census Data, and orthoimagery. Buffers of different distances were created based on airport sites, population density, landfill and industrial waste sites, U. S forestry and national parks, railroads, and major roadways of North Georgia, which were designated as unsuitable areas for probable reservoir locations for environmental concerns. Peck’s Mill Watershed, located in Lumpkin County was chosen as the most suitable location for building the reservoir. Then the suitable areas were surveyed using a DEM to find the best location to build a dam for the reservoir. The dam height was determined based on the amount of direct runoff coming from the above catchment area to the dam location and keeping in prospective to have the reservoir filled in four years maximum. A geospatial model was developed to calculate the runoff using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) method (average intensity of rainfall and Curve Number). Based on the dam height, the reservoir impounding volume was calculated. The total runoff was divided with the proposed impounding volume to determine the years it will take to fill in the reservoir. Annual stream discharge of the Chestatee River (One mile downstream of the proposed dam) was also calculated to pump water from the river to fill the reservoir. The reservoir pool line of 405 meter was chosen with a probable filling time of 2. 14 years by watershed runoff and water pumped from Chestatee River. After the reservoir design, flood pool line was calculated based on 100 -year flood to find the environmental impact due to the reservoir. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the serial, Journal of <b>Geospatial</b> <b>Engineering</b> [© The Hong Kong Institution of Engineering Surveyors]. This paper develops two integrated positioning algorithms for transport telematics applications and services. The first is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm for the integration of GPS and low cost DR sensors to provide continuous positioning in built-up areas. The second takes this further by integrating the GPS/DR output with map data in a novel a map-matching process to both identify the physical location of a vehicle on the road network and improve positioning capability. The proposed MM algorithm is validated using a higher accuracy reference (truth) of the vehicle trajectory as determined by high precision positioning achieved by the carrier phase observable from GP...|$|E

40|$|This is a pre-print of {{an article}} {{published}} in the Journal of <b>Geospatial</b> <b>Engineering</b> 2004 published by Hong Kong Institution of Engineering Surveyors. This version is reproduced with permission from Hong Kong Institution of Engineering Surveyors. [URL] role of spatial data and related technologies in disaster management has been well-known worldwide. One of the challenges concerned with such a role is access to and usage of reliable, accurate and up-to-date spatial data for disaster management. This is a very important aspect to disaster response as timely, up-to-date and accurate spatial data describing the current situation is paramount to successfully responding to an emergency. This includes information about available resources, access to roads and damaged areas, required resources, and required disaster response operations that should be available and accessible for use {{in a short period of}} time. Sharing this information between involved parties in disaster management is a challenge to facilitate coordinated disaster response operations. This paper aims to address the role of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) as a framework for facilitating disaster management. It is argued that the design and implementation of an SDI model as a framework and consideration of SDI development factors and issues can assist disaster management agencies to improve the quality of their decision-making and increase efficiency and effectiveness in all levels of disaster management activities. The paper is based on an ongoing research project on the development of an SDI conceptual model for disaster management in Iran. This includes the development of a prototype web-based system which can facilitate sharing, access and use of data in disaster management and particularly disaster response. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Building {{information}} modelling is currently an emerging technology within the building {{industry in the}} UK and in China as well as throughout t he world. The departments of Civil Engineering and Architecture and Built Environment at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China have been gradually introducing Building Information Modelling content into their courses {{over the last few}} years and have pl ans to further increase this area by introducing Building Information Modelling teaching at Master’s level in its <b>Geospatial</b> <b>Engineering</b> courses. The introduction of the teaching of Building Information Modelling has been seen as a priority by the Faculty of Science and Engineering and has been introduced to 1 st year students as part of existing modules that traditionally teach Computer Aided Design and also by the introduction of two new optional modules in the final year of undergraduate study. The teachi ng of Building Information Modelling focuses on three main areas, management for architecture and civil engineering, Modelling using BIM modelling software from design plans, and data collection and processing for As - Built BIM model creation from laser sca nning. Teaching takes the form of standard lectures and tutorial classes but focuses more on using hands on teaching methods and group work using both equipment for data collection and software for modelling testing. To aid this teaching the University o f Nottingham will establish a BIM teaching and research lab at their campus in Ningbo. This lab will be equipped with extensive BIM software and other modelling tools and facilities that will complement the already extensive surveying and mapping equipment and software available at the Ningbo campus. This paper will outline the teaching content used and give examples of student work on the newly developed modules as well as describing planned future developments in BIM teaching at the University of Nottingh am. It also provides an example and initial analysis of these new teaching methods and how they contribute to current industry requirements. Building Information Management and Mod...|$|E
