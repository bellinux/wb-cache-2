40|$|Children’s <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> {{is rapidly}} growing. Several studies have {{suggested}} children using computers {{may be at risk}} of developing musculoskeletal symptoms. General models and theories relating to the causality of negative musculoskeletal outcomes in adult workers demonstrated relationships between workplace factors and musculoskeletal outcomes. When examining children’s <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> it is evident that their use is different. Even though risk factors may be similar, {{due to the nature of}} children and their computer environments, the potential risk factors and thus a proposed model of causal relationships between exposure and outcomes may differ. Objective: To develop a model of factors influencing <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and musculoskeletal symptoms in children. Methods: 1351 children (or their parents for Year 1 children) in school Years 1, 6, 9 and 11 (ages ~ 6, 11, 14, 16 years) from 10 schools in Western Australia were surveyed on a range of user characteristics, <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and musculoskeletal symptoms. Results: Potential risk factors for childrens’ <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and musculoskeletal outcomes were multivariable. Factors such as age, gender, somatic complaints, flow, computer anxiety, computer, TV and physical activity exposure, and SES were related to <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and children’s reports of musculoskeletal symptoms. Significance: Developing a child-related <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> model to understand relationships between potential risk factors and musculoskeletal symptoms will assist academics, teachers and parents to develop a better understanding of the risk factors for children’s <b>computer</b> <b>exposure...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{etiology}} of musculoskeletal outcomes {{associated with the}} use of information technology (IT) has predominately been defined by studies of adults in their work environments. Theories explaining the causation of work related musculoskeletal disorders have identified individual user (biomechanical, physiological and psychosocial), task demand, work organization and environmental risk factors. Models based on these theories have subsequently been developed to investigate the causal relationship between IT exposure and outcomes experienced by the user. Computers are an important IT type used by children, and computer use by children is rapidly growing in both school and home environments. Recent literature demonstrates an increase in children’s reports of computer related musculoskeletal outcomes. Children’s computer use appears to be different to adult’s work related computer use. Thus, although many potential risk factors for children may be similar to those for adults, it is proposed that risk factors and models of causal relationships between computer use and musculoskeletal outcomes may vary for children. The main aims of this study were: (1) to investigate children’s <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> in their usual occupational environments of school and home; and (2) to develop and test a multivariable model that would assist in understanding relationships between child user correlates, <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and <b>computer</b> related musculoskeletal outcomes. 1351 students (792 boys and 559 girls) from eight primary and five secondary schools in Perth, Australia, participated in the study in 2006. Convenience sampling was undertaken within stratified groups, to ensure the sample had the required range of participants from different socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, both genders and school Years 1, 6, 9 and 11 (approximate ages 6, 9, 14 and 16 years). The study design was cross sectional involving the completion of a questionnaire survey by participants, and for younger participants their parents. Questionnaires contained items relating to the participant and their activity exposure as an individual, within a family context, and within their neighbourhood. Physical measures of height and weight were also collected. The results showed that 100 % of children had access to computers at school, and at home 98. 9 % of children had access to computers, with 95. 9 % reporting home internet access. The use of different exposure measures demonstrated that at school 97. 8 % of children had used a computer in the last month, for an average of 2. 4 hours per week, commonly for 30 - 60 minutes in one sitting. At home 95. 7 % of children had used a computer in the last month, for an average of 7. 2 hours per week, commonly for 60 - 120 minutes in one sitting. Computer activities performed more frequently at school were surfing the internet, learning programs and multimedia. At home the most frequent computer activities were surfing the internet and email. Children with bedroom computer access were found to have nearly 50 % greater mean weekly hours of use. The use of a range of <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> measures (frequency, usual and longest duration, mean weekly hours and frequency of computer activities) provided better characterization of the amount and nature of children’s school and home <b>computer</b> <b>exposure.</b> Age and gender were associated with children’s school and home computer use. Computer use was greater with age for both boys and girls, and boys had greater use than girls across all Year levels for all exposure measures except school usual duration. Children with greater <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> were shown to experience less computer anxiety; reported more somatic complaints; had used a broader range of computer activities; had greater exposure to other IT activities (electronic games, TV, mobile phone) and moderate vigorous physical activity. SES was associated with <b>computer</b> <b>exposure,</b> with children from low SES backgrounds having greater home <b>computer</b> <b>exposure,</b> and children from high SES backgrounds having greater school <b>computer</b> <b>exposure.</b> <b>Computer</b> related musculoskeletal outcomes were reported by 10 % of children for school computer use and 20 % for home computers. The most commonly affected body locations were the neck and back, and 30 % of those children reporting outcomes limited their activity participation, 10 % took medication and 7 % consulted a treating health professional. The use of a range of outcome measures allowed for a better understanding of the impact of children’s computer related musculoskeletal outcomes. Given the significant findings of different relationships between children’s <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> patterns at school and home, two models were developed and tested, with one model for school <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and one model for home <b>computer</b> <b>exposure.</b> Path analysis modeling, accounting for user correlates, tested direct relationships and indirect relationships via <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> for a range of user correlates. The final school <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> model showed direct relationships between gender, somatic complaints, <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and musculoskeletal soreness; and indirect relationships, via <b>computer</b> <b>exposure,</b> between age, <b>computer</b> flow, TV <b>exposure,</b> SES and musculoskeletal soreness. The final home <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> model showed direct relationships between gender, age, somatic complaints, <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and musculoskeletal soreness; and indirect relationships, via <b>computer</b> <b>exposure,</b> between age, <b>computer</b> flow, <b>computer</b> anxiety, TV <b>exposure,</b> SES and musculoskeletal soreness. In conclusion, the child specific model tested within this study demonstrated direct relationships between children’s <b>computer</b> <b>exposure</b> and musculoskeletal outcomes. Additionally, direct and indirect relationships were also shown between a range of user correlates, the environment and musculoskeletal outcomes. These findings will assist researchers, teachers and parents to understand the range of potential risk factors for computer related musculoskeletal outcomes. This will also allow researchers to target interventions to child users and their computer environments to ensure children’s computer use is performed in a safe and productive manner...|$|R
