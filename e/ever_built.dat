5|$|August 27–28, 1878 – Streets are {{clogged with}} fallen trees as a {{hurricane}} passes to the north. At {{the height of}} a storm, a floating dry dock—the largest <b>ever</b> <b>built</b> at the time—is damaged after breaking from its moorings at HM Dockyard, crushing wharves and a mooring bridge. The dock came to rest on a breakwater.|$|E

5|$|Spain {{commissioned}} three {{ships of}} the , {{with the first}} laid down in 1909. The three ships were the smallest dreadnoughts <b>ever</b> <b>built.</b> They were built in Spain, with assistance; construction on the third ship, , took nine years from its laying down date to completion because of non-delivery of critical material, especially armament, from the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The SS Christopher Columbus was an American {{excursion}} liner on the Great Lakes, {{in service}} between 1893 and 1933. She {{was the only}} whaleback ship <b>ever</b> <b>built</b> for passenger service. The ship was designed by Alexander McDougall, the developer and promoter of the whaleback design.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{relatively}} large, seating 850. It is {{built in the}} Venetian Gothic style, and divided into a five-bay nave, transepts, chancel, morning chapel and organ chamber. Although Plumbe's original design envisaged a tower, none was <b>ever</b> <b>built.</b> By 1900, St Mark's was reported as having a congregation twice {{that of any other}} church in Wood Green.|$|E

5|$|Triton was {{the second}} {{submarine}} and the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Greek god Triton. At {{the time of her}} commissioning in 1959, Triton was the largest, most powerful, and most expensive submarine <b>ever</b> <b>built,</b> at $109million excluding the cost of nuclear fuel and reactors ($ in present-day terms).|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, none {{of these}} designs were <b>ever</b> <b>built,</b> much like other late-war German warship designs, such as the L 20 α-type battleships and the s. The German {{shipbuilding}} effort largely abandoned surface warship construction and instead focused on U-boat construction in {{the final years of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Although {{none were}} <b>ever</b> <b>built,</b> several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E

5|$|At , {{the ship}} was the longest {{whaleback}} <b>ever</b> <b>built,</b> and reportedly also the largest vessel on the Great Lakes when she was launched. Columbus {{is said to have}} carried more passengers during her career than any other vessel on the Great Lakes. After a career lasting four decades, she was retired during the Great Depression and scrapped in 1936 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Croton Expressway, {{the only}} {{piece of the}} failed Hudson River Expressway project that was <b>ever</b> <b>built,</b> began in the mid-1960s. It became part of a realigned US9 when it was {{completed}} by 1967. The former surface routing of US9 along Albany Post Road between Croton-on-Hudson and Buchanan became a northward extension of NY9A, which reached the old alignment by way of an overlap with US9 from {{the north end of}} the Briarcliff–Peekskill Parkway to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{on the new}} ten-floor, $150 million {{building}} {{located in}} Lower Manhattan began in 1989. The new building was designed by the architectural firms of Gruzen Samton Steinglass and Cooper, Robertson & Partners. When it opened in 1992, the building was New York City's first new high school building in ten years and, at the time, was the costliest high school building <b>ever</b> <b>built</b> in the city.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, the Army Air Corps {{found the}} {{performance}} of the XB-21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre-production aircraft, to be designated YB-21. However, soon after this contract was awarded, it was cancelled, and none of the YB-21s were <b>ever</b> <b>built,</b> leaving the XB-21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed. Operated by North American Aviation, the XB-21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, Jodrell Bank {{was named}} as the {{location}} of the control centre for the planned Square Kilometre Array, or SKA Project Office (SPO). The SKA is being planned by a collaboration of 20 countries and when completed it is intended to be the most powerful radio telescope <b>ever</b> <b>built.</b> In April 2015 it was further announced that Jodrell Bank would be the permanent home of the SKA headquarters for the period of operation expected for the telescope (over 50 years).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area {{inhabited}} predominantly {{by people of}} African descent, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), {{to make room for}} a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961. Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were <b>ever</b> <b>built.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the short}} time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford {{engineers}} produced many significant technological advances. As no one had <b>ever</b> <b>built</b> an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, DuPont engineers installed ammonia-based refrigeration systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge, {{built from}} 1959 to 1964, had been {{proposed}} {{to serve as}} the rail link. The 95th Street station was slated to be connected to the bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, because it followed the route of the planned tunnel. However, no space for any tracks was <b>ever</b> <b>built</b> because of Moses's opposition to the expansion of New York City public transportation.|$|E
5|$|SheiKra {{was also}} the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop. In 2005, only two other Dive Coasters in the world had either an 87- or 87.5-degree drop. When SheiKra first opened, it was the tallest, fastest, and longest Dive Coaster <b>ever</b> <b>built,</b> and was the first Dive Coaster in North America. However, in 2007 when Griffon opened at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, SheiKra lost the height and speed records. When Dive Coaster opened at Chime-Long Paradise in 2008, it took the length record.|$|E
