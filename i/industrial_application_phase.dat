40|$|Displacement {{measurement}} methods based on optical image recording and its digital correlation entered their <b>industrial</b> <b>application</b> <b>phase</b> {{thanks to the}} constant computer development. Nowadays, in laboratory conditions especially, they supplant such techniques as moiré method, photo-stress method and electric strain gages in certain examples. Nonetheless, application in the field conditions, such as inflight tests, is still restricted by the operational and accuracy demands. The AIM and AIM 2 consortia have developed one of the methods based on photogrammetry combined with digital image correlation, which was originally invented in DLR and named IPCT, for wing deformation measurements. The aim in this field was to develop IPCT to the TRL 9 for the in-flight test application by industry which was demonstrated by several reference missions...|$|E

40|$|In 2010, {{the global}} {{capacity}} for production of carbon nanotubes was conservatively estimated at 350 tonnes/year. (1) With {{a substantial increase}} in manufacture, handling, use and disposal forecast, increasing human and environmental exposure is inevitable, and, as a result, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in their many forms are beginning to increasingly come under toxicological scrutiny. The enormous number of permutations and combinations of CNTs being handled in the materials 2 ̆ 7 discovery, production and biomedical or <b>industrial</b> <b>application</b> <b>phases</b> has led to a daunting bottleneck in relation to ensuring human and environmental safety. After a brief discussion of public perceptions and risk, this chapter summarizes many of the current CNT toxicity studies and provides a breakdown of the various CNT parameters thought to influence their toxicological properties. Subsequent sections give perspectives on potential future biological applications of CNTs, and on the shifting trends in regulatory frameworks and knowledge gaps which need to be addressed in order to ensure the safe and sustainable utility of CNTs in a range of important applications...|$|R

40|$|Single phase {{switched}} reluctance machines (SRMs) have {{a special}} place in the emerging high-volume, low-cost and low-performance applications in appliances and also in high-speed low-power motor drives in various <b>industrial</b> <b>applications.</b> Single <b>phase</b> SRMs have a number of drawbacks: low power density as they have only 50 % utilization of windings, lack of self-starting feature unless otherwise built in to the machine, most of the times with permanent magnets or sometimes with distinct and special machine rotor configurations or additional mechanisms. Many of these approaches are expensive or make the manufacturing process more difficult. In order to overcome such disadvantages a method involving interpoles and windings is discussed in this research. Also, a new and novel converter topology requiring only a single switch and a single diode is realized. This research tests the concepts and feasibility of this new single-phase SRM motor topology and converter in one quadrant operation. The converter electronics and a simple minimum component, minimum cost analog converter are designed and implemented. The entire system is simulated and evaluated on its advantages and disadvantages. Simple testing without load is performed...|$|R

The project aimed at not only creating a large annotated database but also to organize a set of evaluation campaigns covering a variety of document recognition tasks which could eventually fit in different <b>industrial</b> <b>applications.</b> The first <b>phase</b> of the evaluation campaign [63] comprised tasks including document (letters and fax) layout analysis, handwriting recognition (isolated characters, words and blocks of text), writer identification (on words and paragraphs), writer verification, logo recognition and identification of scenario from letters. The {{second phase of the}} campaign [214] focused on three themes, document layout analysis, handwriting recognition and writer identification and a total of seven tasks. Five French research labs participated in this second phase of evaluations. After two successful phases of evaluations, the database was employed in a number of International competitions, discussed later in this paper.|$|R
40|$|A clamp-on, sonar-based flow {{measurement}} technology for simultaneously measuring {{volumetric flow rate}} and process fluid sound speed is described. The technology utilizes sonar array processing techniques to perform two independent measurements to characterize the process fluid, each well-suited for single and multiphase flows. Firstly, the meter provides mixture volumetric flow by tracking {{the speed at which}} naturally occurring flow-generated pressure fields convect past an array of strain-based sensors clamped-on to existing process pipe. Secondly, the meter provides compositional information by measuring the speed at which naturally occurring sound waves propagate through the process fluid using the same clamp-on sensors. Measuring the speed of sound of a process fluid utilizing this sonar technique is analogous to measuring process fluid density and has many compositional based applications. A primary example of this is using process sound speed to accurately measure the amount of entrained gases in liquid–continuous mixtures. The ability to measure volumetric flow and process sound speed reliably and accurately in single and multiphase applications with a non-intrusive, clamp-on device significantly enhances the observability of the many industrial processes. Data is presented from sonar-based volumetric flow and sound speed-based compositional measurements {{for a wide range of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>applications,</b> encompassing single <b>phase</b> liquid <b>applications</b> to large diameter, abrasive multiphase applications, widely-recognized as difficult, long-standing {{flow measurement}} challenges. ...|$|R

40|$|Disordered {{structures}} of boron nitride (BN), graphite, boron carbide (BC), and boron carbon nitride (BCN) systems are considered important precursor materials for synthesis of superhard phases in these systems. However, phase transformation of such materials {{can be achieved}} only at extreme pressure–temperature conditions, which is irrelevant to <b>industrial</b> <b>applications.</b> Here, the <b>phase</b> transition from disordered nanocrystalline hexagonal (h) BN to superhard wurtzitic (w) BN was found at room temperature under a pressure of 6. 7 GPa after applying large plastic shear in a rotational diamond anvil cell (RDAC) monitored by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. However, under hydrostatic compression to 52. 8 GPa, the same hBN sample did not transform to wBN but probably underwent a reversible transformation to a high-pressure disordered phase with closed-packed buckled layers. The current phase-transition pressure is the lowest among all reported direct-phase transitions from hBN to wBN at room temperature. Usually, large plastic straining leads to disordering and amorphization; here, in contrast, highly disordered hBN transformed to crystalline wBN. The mechanisms of strain-induced phase transformation {{and the reasons for}} such a low transformation pressure are discussed. Our results demonstrate a potential of low pressure–room temperature synthesis of superhard materials under plastic shear from disordered or amorphous precursors. They also open a pathway of phase transformation of nanocrystalline materials and materials with disordered and amorphous structures under extensive shear...|$|R
