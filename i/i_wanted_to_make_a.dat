5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> Flash Gordon movie, {{with all}} the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain {{the rights to the}} characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E

25|$|Talk a Good Game was {{inspired}} by R artists New Edition, Pebbles, and Babyface, Rowland spoke on the album's musical direction saying “ feels like everything <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> as far as music and R, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure my roots were really pronounced on this album.” Rowland cited Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder as the album's inspirations.|$|R
500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} intended Doomsday as {{a tribute}} to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, [...] "Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> movie {{for a new generation of}} audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema—hadn't seen them at all maybe—and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them. But kind of contemporise it, pump up the action and the blood and guts." [...] Cinematic influences on Doomsday include: ...|$|E
500|$|Carpenter {{originally}} {{wrote the}} screenplay for Escape from New York in 1976, {{in the aftermath}} of the Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, [...] "The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President. I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it" [...] because, according to Carpenter, [...] "it was too violent, too scary, too weird." [...] He had been inspired by the film Death Wish, which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy but liked how it conveyed [...] "the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> science fiction film along these lines".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News in August 2002, Maroon 5 vocalist Adam Levine, when asked behind the development of [...] "Harder to Breathe", admitted that the song describes the band's frustration with their label, Octone Records, during the making of their debut album, Songs About Jane. The band thought they had enough material for a release, but when the label told them to keep writing, Levine wrote this song in frustration at the pressure. [...] "That song comes sheerly from wanting to throw something. It was the 11th hour, and the label wanted more songs. It was the last crack. I was just pissed. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> record and the label was applying a lot of pressure, but I'm glad they did." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Tubman became heavily {{involved}} with the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Auburn. In 1903, she donated a parcel of real estate she owned to the church, under the instruction that it be made into a home for [...] "aged and indigent colored people". The home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100 entrance fee. She said: [...] "hey make a rule that nobody should come in without they have a hundred dollars. Now <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> rule that nobody should come in unless they didn't have no money at all." [...] She was frustrated by the new rule but was the guest of honor nonetheless when the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged celebrated its opening on June 23, 1908.|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E
50|$|The film {{changed my}} identity. I {{realized}} that what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was <b>make</b> films. Not only that, but I realized what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> films about: my own life, to some extent.|$|R

500|$|In 2009, Eminem {{planned to}} release a sequel of his sixth studio album Relapse titled Relapse 2, but {{cancelled}} the project and released a completely different studio release titled Recovery. He said, [...] "as I kept recording and working with new producers, {{the idea of a}} sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> completely new album." [...] "Not Afraid" [...] was primarily produced by the Canadian hip hop musician Boi-1da. According to Mike Strange, who recorded [...] "Not Afraid", he wanted to work with Boi-1da after listening to his [...] "Forever", which he had produced for the rapper Drake. Boi-1da sent Strange many tracks, to some of which Eminem wrote lyrics. These tracks were opened in Pro Tools, as Strange proceeded to record Eminem's vocals. Recording sessions took place at Effigy Studios, in Ferndale, Michigan but Boi-1da was absent during the sessions.|$|E
500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them is my best friend. That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. I want it to really reflect the song. So <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Janet Jackson {{was born}} in Gary, Indiana, the {{youngest}} of ten children. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and released her self-titled debut album in 1982. She stated, [...] "On my first album the songs were sort of teenage like. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> change for my second album. The first album indroduces you. The second one sets your image. I couldn't stay like that. People would still look at me as a little girl and I'd never grow". [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was written by Jackson, her brother Marlon Jackson and musician John Barnes. Marlon Jackson also produced the single and provided backing vocals along with his brothers Michael, Tito, and Jackie. Although it was slated for a mid-July release, [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was released on August 13, 1984.|$|E

500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So I was living in Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They convinced me to come to church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldn’t clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. Someone said, ‘What happened to Jesus? I saw you dancing last night and you were totally fine.’ They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a radio microphone), composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E
