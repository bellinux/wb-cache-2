60|$|Frankly to {{recognise}} {{these various}} foreshadowings of the distinctive Darwinian theory {{of natural selection}} is {{not in any way}} to undermine the foundations of Charles Darwin's own real and exceptional greatness. On the contrary, the mere fact that his views were so far anticipated by Wells, Matthew, Spencer, and others, and were simultaneously arrived at across half the globe by the independent intellect of Alfred Russel Wallace, is in itself the very best proof and finest criterion of Charles Darwin's genuine apostleship. No truly grand and fruitful idea was ever yet the sole property of a single originator. Great discoveries, says an acute critic, must always be concerned with some problem of the time which many of the world's foremost minds are just then cudgelling their active brains about. It was so with the discovery of the differential calculus, and of the planet Neptune; with the interpretation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, and of the cuneiform inscriptions; with the undulatory theory of light, with the mechanical equivalent of heat, with the doctrine of the correlation and conservation of energies, with the invention of the steam engine, the locomotive, the telegraph and the telephone; with the nebular hypothesis, and with spectrum analysis. It was so, too, with the evolutionary movement. The fertile upturning of virgin sod <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biological</b> <b>field</b> which produced Darwin's forerunners, as regards the idea of descent with modification, in the persons of Buffon, Lamarck, and Erasmus Darwin, necessarily produced a little later, under the fresh impetus of the Malthusian conception, his forerunners or coadjutors, as regards the idea of natural selection, in the persons of Wells, Matthew, and Wallace. It was Darwin's task to recognise the universal, where Wells and Spencer had seen only the particular; to build up a vast and irresistible inductive system, where Matthew and Wallace had but thrown out a pregnant hint of wonderful a priori interest and suggestiveness. It is one thing to draw out the idea of a campaign, another thing to carry it to a successful conclusion; one thing rudely to sketch a ground-plan, another thing finally to pile aloft to the sky the front of an august and imposing fabric.|$|E
60|$|In {{the year}} 1884 I {{was invited to}} give tuition by correspondence, in Biology. Although {{disposed}} {{at the time to}} ridicule the idea of imparting instruction in natural science by letter, I gladly accepted the opportunity thus afforded me of ascertaining for myself what could and could not be accomplished in that direction. Anyone familiar with the scope of biological enquiry, and the methods of biological instruction, will not need to be reminded that it is only by the most rigorous employment of precise directions for observation, that any good results are to be looked for at the hand of the elementary student. True to this principle, I determined to issue to my correspondence pupils rigid instructions, and to demand in return faithful annotated drawings of facts observed in their usage. In the case of two among the few students who passed through my hands, the result far exceeded my most sanguine anticipations. The notes sent in by one of them-- a man working at a distance, alone and unaided-- far excelled those wrung from many a student placed under the most favourable surroundings; and their promise for the future has been fulfilled to the utmost, the individual in question being now a recognised investigator. It thus became clear that, not-with-standing the complex conditions of work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biological</b> <b>field,</b> tuition by correspondence would suffice to awaken the latent abilities of a naturally qualified enquirer. The average members of a University Correspondence Class will be found neither better nor worse than those of any other, and they may therefore pass unnoticed; if however, the correspondence system of tuition may furnish the means of arousing a latent aptitude, when the possibilities of other methods of approach are excluded-- and in so doing, of elevating the individual to that position for which he was by nature qualified, ensuring him the introduction to the one sphere of labour for which he was born-- it will have created its own defence, and have merited the confidence of all right-thinking people. The plucking of one such brand from the burning is ample compensation for the energy expended on any number of average dullards, who but require to be left alone to find their natural level.|$|E

Micro-nanorobotic manipulation is an advance method by integrating the traditional robotic technique and micro-nanotechnology together. Generally, the micro-nanorobotic manipulation system allows precise positioning ranged from several nanometers to micrometers and provides flexible movement ability with multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) in three-dimensional space. In addition, it has high controllability that can automatically perform some tasks based on computer programming. Moreover, the micro-nanorobotic manipulation can integrate with various commercial microscopes, such as OM, SEM, and AFM, to solve different biological problems effectively. Owing to these advantages, micro-nanorobotic manipulation has been widely used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biological</b> <b>fields.</b> <b>In</b> this section, we will focus on some key applications of the micro-nanorobotic manipulation system in single cell analysis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Functional {{diversity}} is increasingly pointed {{as a useful}} approach to reach Biological Conservation goals. Here, we {{provide an overview of}} the functional diversity approach status <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biological</b> Conservation <b>field.</b> We sought for peer-reviewed papers published over a period of twenty years (from 1994 to 2014). First we used the general topic “functional diversity” and then refined our search using the key-word “conservation”. We have identified the conservation strategies addressed, the organism studied, and the continent of study site in each paper. Thirteen classes of conservation strategies were identified. Plants were the most commonly studied organism group and most study-sites were located <b>in</b> Europe. <b>The</b> functional diversity approach was introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biological</b> Conservation <b>field</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 2000 ’s and its inclusion in conservation strategies is broadly advised. However, the number of papers that operationalise such inclusion by developing models and systems is still low. Functional diversity responds differently and eventually better than other measures to changes in land use and management, which suggests that this approach can potentially better predict the impacts. More studies are needed to corroborate this hypothesis. We pointed out knowledge gaps regarding identification of the responses for functional diversity about urban impacts and <b>in</b> research on <b>the</b> level of management intensity of land needed to maintain functional diversity. We recommend the use of functional diversity measures to find ecological indicators. Future studies should focus on the development of functional diversity measures of other taxa beyond plants as well as test hypothesis in tropical ecosystems...|$|R

FIB can also be incorporated in a system with both electron and ion beam columns, allowing the same feature to be investigated using either of the beams. FIB {{should not be confused}} with using a beam of focused ions for direct write lithography (such as in proton beam writing).

Also, under the relatively low-power density, the slopes of the linear plots of log(I) vs. log(P) for red and green emissions are 2.5 and 2.1, implying the existence of three-photon processes.
