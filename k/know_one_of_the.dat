In his speech he said [...] "some of the worst governments that we've ever had, do you <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first things they did? They went after unions. Hitler didn't want unions, Stalin didn't want unions, Mubarak didn't want independent unions". Brown, however, added {{that he was not}} comparing the two situations. He later apologized for his speech.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{hypothesize that}} {{all or part}} of Groats-Worth was written shortly after Greene's death by one of his fellow writers. Henry Chettle has been the favoured candidate, and was suspected at the time, since the manuscript from which it was printed was prepared by him and was in his handwriting. The publication offended at least two contemporary writers. Chettle responded to the complaints in the preface to his Kind Heart's Dream, published later that year. He denied writing the work, stating that he had only transcribed it from Greene's original manuscript into his own hand before publication. He added that he had no wish to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complainants, but wished he had edited out some of the offensive material about the second. It is widely believed that the two authors he comments on are Christopher Marlowe and Shakespeare, though this is far from certain. Chettle wrote, ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was originally created purely for {{the plot of}} [...] "Silence in the Library". Moffat knew that the team of archaeologists would have to trust the Doctor, but the Doctor's psychic paper could not explain and convince the team why he had appeared in a sealed-off library. Therefore, Moffat intended for the Doctor to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archaeologists, but decided that idea was [...] "dull" [...] and instead decided {{to have one of}} them know him. When Kingston returned to the show, Moffat explained to her some details about her character's back-story, knowledge which Smith, Gillan and Darvill did not receive until later. Kingston relates that she knows her character cannot be killed off because we saw her death in her introductory episode; each subsequent appearance is set at a different point in her character's personal history. Moffat had planned out that River was Amy and Rory's daughter for [...] "a long time" [...] and used [...] "Pond" [...] as Amy's last name to create a link between the two. For the filming of the sixth series, Kingston was aware of River Song's relationship to Amy and Rory, while the other cast only found out upon reading of the mid-season cliffhanger script for [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E

Kilian proposes a method that allows Bob to make sure that Alice indeed <b>knows</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors <b>of</b> n, and moreover allows Bob to make sure that each individual bit of q has been correctly informed by Alice. The proposed scheme not only allows <b>the</b> disclosure <b>of</b> only some bits of q but also uses schemes of commitment of individual bits of q to ensure that those bits will not be disclosed without <b>the</b> consent <b>of</b> Alice. Finally, it allows for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> oblivious transfer {{in such a way that}} Alice is unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bits that get actually disclosed to Bob.|$|R
