The problem of Southern Dobruja differed from the one of other provinces which Romania had gained after World War II as it had not been decided in the Peace Treaties of Trianon, Saint-Germain-en- Laye sau Neuilly-sur-Seine. Therefore, such negotiations were not viewed as a revisionism of the peace treaties of 1919. Even in Romania, the issue of Southern Dobruja had been controversial. In 1913, King Carol I and many other politicians had disagreed with the territorial <b>extension</b> <b>requested</b> by Titu Maiorescu on a territory which did not have a Romanian population, arguing that this extension was contrary to the aspirations of creating a Romanian national state.|$|E

5000|$|In February 2015, {{both girls}} {{accused of the}} {{stabbing}} were interrogated by local police. Each girl claimed that the other {{had come up with}} the plan to murder their friend. One of the two also reiterated the belief that the Slender Man would harm her and her family if they did not carry out the attack. Later that month, Anthony Cotton, an attorney for one of the two girls, filed a brief contending that his client should not have been charged with attempted first-degree homicide. The brief claims that the correct charge should be attempted second-degree homicide because the girl believed the Slender Man would have hurt her and her family if she hadn't killed on his behalf. In March 2015, the judge disagreed with this argument and ruled to keep the two in adult court. Their cases could still have been moved to juvenile court for other reasons during hearings in May and June 2015, but on August 10, a judge ruled that both teenagers would be tried in adult court. On August 21, Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Michael Bohren entered a [...] "not guilty" [...] plea on behalf of both girls after their attorneys declined to enter pleas. On September 30, 2015, Judge Bohren stayed the case against the two girls so that a state appeal court could determine whether they should be tried in adult or juvenile court. The decision was initially scheduled to be made in January 2016, but was pushed back until April of that year due to an <b>extension</b> <b>requested</b> by the state of Wisconsin and the attorney of one of the accused.|$|E
40|$|Language {{provides}} an interesting lens {{to look at}} state-building processes because of its cross-cutting nature. For example, {{in addition to its}} symbolic value and appeal, a national language has other roles in the process, including: (a) becoming the primary medium of communication which permits the nation to function efficiently in its political and economic life, (b) promoting social cohesion, allowing the nation to develop a common culture, and (c) forming a primordial basis for self-determination. Moreover, because of its cross-cutting nature, language interventions are rarely isolated activities. Languages are adopted by speakers, taking root in and spreading between communities because they are legitimated by legislation, and then reproduced through institutions like the education and military systems. Pádraig Ó’ Riagáin (1997) makes a case for this observing that “Language policy is formulated, implemented, and accomplishes its results within a complex interrelated set of economic, social, and political processes which include, inter alia, the operation of other non-language state policies” (p. 45). In the Turkish case, its foundational role {{in the formation of the}} Turkish nation-state but its linkages to human rights issues raises interesting issues about how socio-cultural practices become reproduced through institutional infrastructure formation. This dissertation is a country-level case study looking at Turkey’s nation-state building process through the lens of its language and education policy development processes with a focus on the early years of the Republic between 1927 and 1970. This project examines how different groups self-identified or were self-identified (as the case may be) in official Turkish statistical publications (e. g., the Turkish annual statistical yearbooks and the population censuses) during that time period when language and ethnicity data was made publicly available. The overarching questions this dissertation explores include: 1. What were the geo-political conditions surrounding the development and influencing the Turkish government’s language and education policies? 2. Are there any observable patterns in the geo-spatial distribution of language, literacy, and education participation rates over time? In what ways, are these traditionally linked variables (language, literacy, education participation) problematic? 3. What do changes in population identifiers, e. g., language and ethnicity, suggest about the government’s approach towards nation-state building through the construction of a civic Turkish identity and institution building? Archival secondary source data was digitized, aggregated by categories relevant to this project at national and provincial levels and over the course of time (primarily between 1927 and 2000). The data was then re-aggregated into values that could be longitudinally compared and then layered on aspatial administrative maps. This dissertation contributes to existing body of social policy literature by taking an interdisciplinary approach in looking at the larger socio-economic contexts in which language and education policies are produced.

40|$|Aim: In Switzerland, {{rehabilitation}} stays {{are covered}} by personal insurances; before any admission, the insurance provides approval {{and a number of}} days (WD) they will reimburse. When WD is too short, an <b>extension</b> is <b>requested,</b> which results in administrative costs. Thisprocess might be improved if insurances based the WD estimation on the patient’s health status. The {{purpose of this study was}} to a) study the association between WD and patient’s characteristics; b) estimate the overall administrative costs caused by extensions requests; c) develop and test a model of WD estimation based on patient’s functional status. Methods: Correlations between functional status, effective LOS, and WD were tested in a sample of 208 representative rehabilitation stays. Fictive WD were defined as the median LOS of 2 335 reference stays, in three groups, according to the functional level patients belonged to. These fictive WD were then compared to LOS and WD, and their impact was estimated. Résults: No significant correlation was found between patients’ functional status and WD. Overall, 69 % of rehabilitation stays required at least one extension. The corresponding administrative took up to 2. 6 FTE as estimated for the canton. Applying our model would result in a 28 % reduction in <b>extensions</b> <b>requests,</b> and would only marginally increase the risk of an increase of rehabilitation stays. Conclusion: A systematic application of a model based on the patients’ functional status proved adequate to define WD. It would likely reduce the administrative costs associated with <b>extension</b> <b>requests</b> without inducing additional financial risk for insurance companies.

40|$|Use case driven {{approach}} is a method of object oriented software engineering (OOSE) developed by Jacobson et al (1992). The requirement model of the use case driven approach software system is defined by a collection of use cases, problem domain descriptions and user interfaces. Extension is an important type of association between use cases. Extension means that a use case that represents the major or basic course of events can be naturally extended with one or several other use cases that represent rare or exceptional courses of events. A difficulty for OOSE to transform the use cases with extension associations into the design and implementation model {{of the system is}} that most programming Languages, such as C++, Smalltalk and Java, do not have features to support the extension association. The current implementation of an extension association still relies on the basic course use case to initiate the extension use cases. This thesis presents a programming technique to overcome the difficulty described above. It supports the integration of a major course use case and its extension use cases. Based on this technique, a mechanism extension construct invocation is proposed to directly support the extension association between use cases. The extension statement and probing clause allow an extension use case to automatically respond to any <b>extension</b> <b>request</b> from a basic course use case. This mechanism reduces the responsibility of a method that represents a basic course use case with extension statements. The probing clause added to a method that represents an extension use case can automatically respond to any <b>extension</b> <b>request</b> from a basic course use case.
