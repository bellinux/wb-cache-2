5|$|Later American explorers {{traveled}} {{throughout the}} Snake River area and up its major tributaries beginning in 1806, just after Lewis and Clark had returned. The first was John Ordway in 1806, who also explored the lower Salmon River. John Colter in 1808 {{was the first}} to sight the upper <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Snake River, including the Jackson Hole area.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of Pushkar Lake, as an artificial lake, is also credited to the 12th century when a dam was built across the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luni River. The 10th Sikh guru, Guru Govind Singh (1666–1708), {{is said to}} have recited the Sikh sacred text Guru Granth Sahib {{on the banks of the}} lake.|$|E
50|$|At the confluence, the Schwarzbach carries {{twice as}} much water as the Blies (10.4 m³/s versus 5 m³/s). It is also some 10 percent longer. Since the Blies in turn carries {{slightly}} more water than the Saar, {{it could be argued}} that hydrologically speaking, the Schwarzbach is <b>the</b> main <b>headwater</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saar river system.|$|R

5|$|The main rock {{formations}} in {{and near the}} watershed of Nanticoke Creek include the Mauch Chunk Formation (which dates to Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian times), the Pottsville Group (from Pennsylvanian times), and the Llewellyn Formation (also from Pennsylvanian times). The Lower Red Ash coal seam is present near the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek.|$|E
5|$|The surface rock in Catawissa Creek largely {{consists}} of sedimentary rock, such as sandstone and shale. However, {{there is also}} coal in the watershed. Major soils in the creek's watershed include the Leck Kill soil and the Albrights series. Most of the steeper hills in the watershed are situated near the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek.|$|E
5|$|About a month later, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike left St. Louis with an American {{party of}} 23 men, and orders to {{negotiate}} peace between the Kanzas and Osages, {{to contact the}} Comanches of the high plains, and to explore the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red and Arkansas Rivers. For guides and interpreters to the Comanches, Pike turned to the Pawnees; his Osage and Pawnee guides led him northwest through present-day Kansas toward the Kitkehahki village on the Republican.|$|E

The name seems {{to derive from}} Old English Āna-bēam, a One-Beam bridge, probably <b>the</b> hamlet’s means <b>of</b> crossing <b>the</b> stream towards Market Bosworth. It is claimed as <b>the</b> traditional site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Bosworth.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in North Bay near Lake Nipissing, {{the source}} of the French River which flows down to Georgian Bay, Highway63 travels east through suburbs. It exits the city and travels along the {{northern}} shores of Trout Lake, which serves as the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mattawa River, which flows into the Ottawa River and eventually the St. Lawrence River. The portion of Highway63 west of Trout Lake travels between these water systems.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery's {{plan was}} for the 1st Canadian Division to attack across the Moro in the coastal {{lowlands}} to take Ortona first and then Pescara. Inland, in the jagged hills above the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moro, the relatively fresh 2nd New Zealand Division would attack toward Orsogna, while between these two the 8th Indian Infantry Division would hold {{the centre of the}} front in a relatively static role.|$|E
5|$|On both {{approach}}es, the dropoff is steep {{enough for}} Highway 82 {{to require a}} 6% grade and switchbacks: one on the west and three on the east. The former approach uses the narrow valley of the Roaring Fork River, {{a tributary of the}} Colorado, which rises from Independence Lake west of the pass. Its walls are steeper but shallower than those of the North Fork of Lake Creek, which drains into Twin Lakes Reservoir and the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas River, on the east.|$|E
2500|$|Paudash Lake is a <b>headwater</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crowe Valley Watershed. It is a {{cold water}} lake {{supporting}} a healthy population of lake trout and small mouth bass.

5|$|Pike {{had planned}} for the Pawnees to guide him to the Comanches. However, upon his arrival at the village, he was {{informed}} that the two tribes were at war. When Pike expressed his intention of continuing inland toward the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas, Sharitarish urged him to turn back: he had prevented the Spanish from going further into American territory, and would likewise resist an American movement toward Spanish land.|$|E
5|$|Rugged {{mountains}} {{divided by}} rolling plains characterize the physiographically diverse watershed of the Snake River. The Snake River Plain {{was created by}} a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, where the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Snake River arise. Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes {{that occurred during the}} previous Ice Age carved out many topographical features, including various canyons and ridges along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events significantly affected the river and its surrounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{rock in the}} {{southern}} part of the watershed of West Creek is of the Trimmers Rock Formation. This consists of siltstone and shale and comes from the Devonian period. The northern part of the watershed has rock belonging to the Catskill Formation, which consists of sandstone and siltstone and also comes from the Devonian. The Huntley Mountain Formation can be found at the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek. This formation consists of sandstone and siltstone and comes from the Mississippian and Devonian periods.|$|E

5|$|Blythburgh, a {{mile from}} Bulcamp and {{situated}} near the fordable <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blyth estuary, was afterwards {{believed to be the}} location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.|$|E
5|$|In 631 Anna was {{probably}} at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, {{according to the}} Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth {{is said to have}} been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and the <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.|$|E
50|$|Hanzhong {{is located}} at <b>the</b> {{nowadays}} <b>headwater</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Han River, <b>the</b> largest tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yangtze River. However some modern historians suggested that the nearby Xihan River, a major tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring Jialing River to the west, historically drained into the Han River instead, and was later rerouted by a large earthquake at the Wudu Commandery (武都郡, in modern-day eastern Longnan) in 186 BC, possible due to landslide damming. This might explain the city's name, since its location was historically once <b>the</b> middle point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Han River.|$|R
