500|$|As {{leader of}} the Alberta Liberals, Boyle corresponded {{extensively}} with Liberal Party of Canada leader (and Prime Minister of Canada) William Lyon Mackenzie King; according to Foster, Boyle's letters to King were [...] "a mixture of useless information and pleas to be rescued by an appointment to the bench." [...] It is possible {{that one of his}} letters had some impact on history, however: in 1924, while Greenfield was attempting to negotiate control of Alberta's natural resources from King's federal government, Boyle sent King a letter warning him that the UFA was doomed in the next election unless [...] "something extraordinary happens. That extraordinary thing which Greenfield wants to <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." [...] King drew out negotiations until Greenfield returned to Alberta empty-handed; soon after, Greenfield was forced from office by his own backbenchers, and replaced by Brownlee.|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Jack's {{secretary}} tells Liz that Jack {{wants her}} to apologize, but {{that she has to}} pretend that it was her idea. Liz goes to Jack's office and apologizes, and they forgive each other. While the staff eats their lunch, Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests. The writers mention to Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show, and Liz tells them that she can make it <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> that she and Jack are friends. Liz asks Jack, but he denies the request. He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE, and then criticizes Liz and her staff. He apologizes to Liz, but she says that their friendship is over. Having settled the situation with Jack, Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire, which seems to distract the writers. Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative, but Cerie tells Liz that she would look great in something sexy herself, and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads [...] "Dirty Diva".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{praised the}} clip's simplicity, the visuals, {{and the choice}} of outfits. A reviewer from Rap-Up said, [...] "Kelly Rowland turns her tears into art in the eye-popping video for 'Rose Colored Glasses'..." [...] They focused on the choice of visuals, saying that [...] "the clip shows the Destiny's Child alum struggling with a relationship, while numerous wardrobe changes, vivid colors, doves, and stunning shots of Kelly burst onto the screen." [...] Liz Goodwin of Gather.com agreed with the visuals, saying, [...] "In the music video, Kelly Rowland's body is looking fantastic. (Though she could switch up the weave for another hairstyle.) The outfits are hot– she’s looking fit! Kudos to Kelly for pulling off the very, very low-cut corset without falling out of it! She can be grateful to gravity for still being on her side...and for double-sided tape." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator said, [...] "We hope two things <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> that Kelly Rowland’s Rankin-directed 'Rose Colored Glasses' music video has premiered: 1.) you like it and show Miss Kelly some love on iTunes, and 2.) radio programmers in this fine country open their ears and show Miss Kelly major love on the airwaves...Kelly looks truly stunning in this video, from the opening shot of her wearing a dress shirt and tie to the couture dresses she vamps in expertly." ...|$|E

500|$|Brownlee {{became the}} province's chief {{negotiator}} on resource questions in October 1921. [...] Though early attempts at reaching agreement were {{hampered by the}} unwillingness of the Maritime provinces {{to agree to the}} necessary constitutional amendments unless their own annual subsidies were increased, negotiations between the provincial and federal government continued intermittently throughout the 1920s. [...] Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King occasionally appeared receptive to Alberta's demands, but never fully agreed to them. A possible explanation for this is found in a 1924 letter from Alberta Liberal Party leader John R. Boyle to King, explaining that the UFA was likely to lose the next provincial election to Boyle's Liberals [...] "unless something extraordinary happens. That extraordinary thing which Greenfield wants to <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." [...] Despite this letter, the sides seemed close to agreement in early 1925: at a January conference Alberta accepted in principle a federal offer of three years of continuing subsidy after the transfer of resource rights. [...] After an exhaustive series of meetings between Brownlee and the federal counsel, the agreement went back to the governments for approval. [...] As Greenfield and Brownlee expressed their impatience with federal inaction, an intergovernmental meeting was convened in May. The meeting proceeded at a leisurely pace into June, after which King announced that his cabinet would like the summer to consider the agreement in greater detail. The Albertans returned home in disgust.|$|E
2500|$|In North American Major League Baseball, a game may {{end in a}} tie only due {{to weather}} or, historically, {{darkness}} (a called game due to darkness is unlikely to <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> that all Major League parks have floodlights; darkness also means reaching the curfew prohibiting innings from starting after 1am local time). Before 2007, tie games ended by weather were replayed from the start, but since 2007, the games are continued from where they left off. [...] A tie game may also be declared if a game is tied, the two teams are not scheduled to play again {{for the remainder of}} the year, and the game does not affect playoff implications.|$|E
2500|$|Sympathy for the Devil is {{also the}} title of a producer's edit of a 1968 film by Jean-Luc Godard whose own {{original}} version is called One Plus One. [...] The film, a depiction of the late 1960s American counterculture, also featured the Rolling Stones in the process of recording the song in the studio. On the filming, Jagger said in Rolling Stone: [...] " [...] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a film of us in the studio. I mean, it would never <b>happen</b> <b>now,</b> to get someone as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. We could have been recording 'My Obsession.' But it was 'Sympathy for the Devil', and it became the track that we used." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Starke, {{the judge}} at Ryan's trial and a {{committed}} abolitionist, was convinced of Ryan's guilt {{but did not}} personally think that he should hang. Until his death in 1992, Starke remained troubled about Ryan's hanging and would often ask his colleagues if they thought he did the right thing. Philip Opas' junior in the trial, Brian Bourke, was filmed in 2005 saying ″One {{of the problems of}} Ryan's trial was an alleged admission that he made on the plane back to the homicide fellows. That sort of thing can't <b>happen</b> <b>now,</b> because they've got to be recorded on tape, but whether he made the admission or was verballed, I don't know. He was a pretty talkative fellow, he might have. I didn't have much doubt about his guilt.″ ...|$|E
2500|$|Expressing some {{sympathy for}} 'the weeping Lunacharsky' (the only Bolshevik leader to express {{at least some}} regret {{concerning}} the cruelties of the repressive organs), Gippius wrote: [...] "The things that <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> {{have nothing to do}} with Russian history. They will be forgotten, like the atrocities of some savages on a faraway island; will vanish without a trace." [...] Last Poems (1914–1918), published in 1918, presented a stark and gloomy picture of revolutionary Russia as Gippius saw it. After the defeats of Alexander Kolchak in Siberia and Anton Denikin in Southern Russia, respectively, the Merezhkovskys moved to Petrograd. In late 1919, invited to join a group of 'red professors' in Crimea, Gippius chose not to, having heard of massacres orchestrated by local chiefs Bela Kun and Rosalia Zemlyachka. Having obtained permission to leave the city (the pretext being that they would head for the frontlines, with lectures on Ancient Egypt for Red Army fighters), Merezhkovsky and Gippius, as well as her secretary Vladimir Zlobin and Dmitry Filosofov, departed to Poland by train.|$|E
