25|$|Soap operas were {{originally}} broadcast {{live from the}} studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling {{similar to that of}} a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as General <b>Hospital,</b> <b>Days</b> of our Lives and The Young and the Restless were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. As the World Turns and The Edge of Night were the last to make the switch, in 1975.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a renewed}} push for health {{insurance}} reform in 1974. In January, representatives Martha Griffiths and James C.

The following month Nixon again proposed the Comprehensive Health Insurance Actan employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on <b>hospital</b> <b>days,</b> added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage.

25|$|Soap opera {{ratings have}} {{significantly}} fallen in the U.S. since the 2000s. No new major daytime soap opera {{has been created}} since Passions in 1999, while many have been cancelled. Since January 2012, four daytime soap operas – General <b>Hospital,</b> <b>Days</b> of Our Lives, The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful – continue to air on the three major networks, down from a total of 12 during the 1990–91 season and a high of 19 in the 1969–70 season. This {{marks the first time}} since 1953 that there have been only four soap operas airing on broadcast television. The Young and the Restless, the highest-rated soap opera from 1988 to the present, had fewer than 5 million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as Judge Judy. Circulations of soap opera magazines have decreased and some have even ceased publication. SOAPnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 and fully ceased operations the following year. The Daytime Emmy Awards, which honor soap operas and other daytime shows, moved from primetime network television to smaller cable channels in 2012, then failed to get any TV broadcast at all in 2014, 2016, and 2017.|$|E

As SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) on admission was only 7 points, the activity of SLE was not considered to be developed.

The third case was a 63 -year-old woman who was diagnosed as bladder tumor with left supraclavicular lymph node and right femur metastases. She was treated with irradiation (Liniac: 6, 000 rads), total cystectomy and bilateral ureterocutaneostomy. From the 14 th <b>hospital</b> <b>day,</b> serum Ca level increased progressively.

2500|$|One {{proposed}} learning {{mechanism is}} through the increased excitation, and as a consequence, strengthening of neuronal connections. This process is known as long-term potentiation (LTP). Another purpose of art therapy is determining existing disorders. Trauma, depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD {{are just a few}} mental illnesses that can be detected through art therapy. [...] "Sixty-four renal transplant recipients, 6-21 yr of age, were evaluated using self-report measures (CDI and Davidson) and art-based assessments. Subject art was analyzed by art therapists using seven of the 14 elements of the (FEATS), to assess depression. Unlike CDI and Davidson self-report testing, all patients were able to complete the art-based directives. When self-report measures and art-based assessments were combined, 36% of the study population had testing results consistent with depression and/or post-traumatic stress. The FEATS assessments identified a subset of patients who were not identified using the self-report measures. There was a correlation between CDI and Davidson scores (p < 0.0001), Davidson scores correlated with <b>hospital</b> <b>days</b> (p = 0.05), and FEATS correlated with height Z score (p = 0.04) and donor type (p = 0.01). Patients who required psychological interventions including antidepressant therapy, psychological counseling and psychiatric hospitalization during the year after the study were identified as depressed." [...] As art therapy grows in popularity and gains recognition, the purpose will become more clear and branch out to different patients. The purpose of art therapy is to provide a new healing opportunity to those who will benefit most from alternative therapy methods. In conclusion, art therapy is one of multiple medicines to create peace in the patience's mind.|$|E
