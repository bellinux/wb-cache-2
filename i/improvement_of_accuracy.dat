A neutral surface defined using [...] differs only slightly from an ideal neutral surface.

If potential density surfaces are used, the difference can be hundreds of meters, a far larger error.|$|E

50|$|Song {{repertoire}} can {{be attributed}} to male songbirds as {{it is one of the}} main mechanisms of courtship. Song repertoires differ from male individual to male individual and species to species. Some species may typically have large repertoires while others may have significantly smaller ones. Mate choice in female songbirds is a significant realm of study as song abilities are continuously evolving. Currently there have been numerous studies involving songbird repertoires, unfortunately, there has yet been concrete evidence to confirm that every songbird species prefers larger repertoires. A conclusion can be made that it can vary between specific species on whether a larger repertoire is connected to better fitness. With this conclusion, it can be inferred that evolution via natural selection, or sexual selection, favors the ability to retain larger repertoires for these certain species as it leads to higher reproductive success. During times of courtship, it is said that male songbirds increase their repertoire by mimicking other species songs. The better the mimicking ability, retaining ability, and the quantity of other species mimicked has been proven to have a positive relationship with mating success. Female preferences cause the constant <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> and presentation of the copied songs.|$|E

It was hypothesized that by exercising through a full range of motion with maximum speed in simulated body position, the use of an isokinetic training instrument would result in <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> and increased velocity in kicking a soccer ball. All of the subjects were given a pre-test to determine their beginning ability for speed and accuracy in kicking a soccer ball. The subjects were also retested at the middle and end of the study to determine if any significant results developed. The subjects were placed in one of the following three groups based upon matched groupings of z scores; isokinetic group G 1, isokinetic and goal shooting group G 2, and goal shooting group G 3. The study lasted for six weeks. The hypothesis, which stated that there would be <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> and increased velocity in kicking a soccer ball, while training with an isokinetic training device, was accepted at significant levels with the right foot for accuracy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} development and utilization of numerical and experimental approaches {{to improve the}} CFD modeling of fluidization flow of cohesive micron size particles. The specific objectives of this research were: (1) Developing a cluster prediction mechanism applicable to Two-Fluid Modeling (TFM) of gas-solid systems (2) Developing more accurate drag models for Two-Fluid Modeling (TFM) of gas-solid fluidization flow {{with the presence of}} cohesive interparticle forces (3) using the developed model to explore the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> of TFM in simulation of fluidization flow of cohesive powders (4) Understanding the causes and influential factor which led to improvements and quantification of improvements (5) Gathering data from a fast fluidization flow and use these data for benchmark validations. Simulation results with two developed cluster-aware drag models showed that cluster prediction could effectively influence the results in both the first and second cluster-aware models. It was proven that <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> of TFM modeling using three versions of the first hybrid model was significant and the best improvements were obtained by using the smallest values of the switch parameter which led to capturing the smallest chances of cluster prediction. In the case of the second hybrid model, dependence of critical model parameter on only Reynolds number led to the fact that <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> was significant only in dense section of the fluidized bed. This finding may suggest that a more sophisticated particle resolved DNS model, which can span wide range of solid volume fraction, can be used in the formulation of the cluster-aware drag model. The results of experiment suing high speed imaging indicated the presence of particle clusters in the fluidization flow of FCC inside the riser of FIU-CFB facility. In addition, pressure data was successfully captured along the fluidization column of the facility and used as benchmark validation data for the second hybrid model developed in the present dissertation. It was shown the second hybrid model could predict the pressure data in the dense section of the fluidization column with better accuracy. ...|$|E
