5|$|The largest {{denomination}} {{within the}} contemporary movement is the LDS Church (colloquially, the Mormon Church) with approximately 16 million members. It is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, {{and uses the}} term Latter-day Saints to describe itself and its members (note the <b>hyphenation</b> and variation in capitalization usage).|$|E
25|$|In contrast, a hyphen that {{is always}} {{displayed}} and printed is called a hard hyphen (although some use this term {{to refer to a}} non-breaking hyphen; see below). Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where <b>hyphenation</b> may occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using <b>hyphenation</b> algorithms are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard provide language-specific <b>hyphenation</b> dictionaries.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{decreased}} use, <b>hyphenation</b> {{remains the}} norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see below). <b>Hyphenation</b> is also routinely used as part of syllabification in justified texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in columns with narrow measure, as when used with newspapers).|$|E
5000|$|Historically, medieval Catalan {{also used}} the symbol [...] as a marker for certain elisions, much like the modern {{apostrophe}} (see Occitan below), and <b>hyphenations.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the {{abstract}} several <b>hyphenations</b> {{can be found}} which are not correct in these places, i.e. logi-cal (row 2 in the PDF), unam-biguous (row 13 in the PDF) and Re-garding (row 15 in the PDF).|$|R
50|$|The dicML markup {{languages}} serve {{a similar}} purpose. Currently, neither concept is specified completely. For example, XDXF lacks elements to annotate possible <b>hyphenations,</b> while the recent working draft of dicML {{does not include}} elements to describe the etymology of words.|$|R
25|$|Tries {{are also}} {{well suited for}} {{implementing}} approximate matching algorithms, including those used in spell checking and <b>hyphenation</b> software.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>hyphenation</b> based on pronunciation, foreign {{compounds}} may be hyphenated at their boundary, if the prefix or suffix is widely recognized, e.g. fotog-ráfia (by syllables) or foto-gráfia (by elements). The elements are also {{taken into consideration}} in compound names (e.g. Pálffy , hyphenated as Pál-ffy, rather than *Pálf-fy). Sometimes different ways of <b>hyphenation</b> reflect different words (e.g. me-gint ‘again,’ a single word hyphenated by syllables, cf. meg-int ‘admonish,’ a compound with a verbal prefix, hyphenated by elements). Hyphens {{are not to be}} repeated {{at the beginning of the}} next line, except in specialized textbooks, as a way of warning for the correct form.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{documentation}} of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of Dionysius Thrax. At the time <b>hyphenation</b> was joining two words {{that would otherwise be}} read separately by a low tie mark between the two words. In Greek these marks were known as enotikon, officially romanized as a hyphen.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his conservative list, Kaufman list several larger [...] "stocks" [...] which he evaluates. The names of the stocks are often obvious <b>hyphenations</b> of two members; for instance, the Páes-Barbakóa stock consists of the Páesan and Barbakóan families. If the composition is not obvious, it is indicated parenthetically. Kaufman puts question marks by Kechumara and Mosetén-Chon stocks.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that using}} {{opposing}} <b>hyphenations</b> (i.e. Szendrey-Petőfi Sándor and Petőfi-Szendrey Júlia) and exchanging names (i.e. Petőfi Sándor and Szendrey Júlia become Szendrey Sándor and Petőfi Júlia) are not allowed. Also, one {{can have a}} maximum of two last names. If one or both partners-to-be come to the marriage {{with more than one}} surname, they will have to agree which ones to keep.|$|R
5000|$|The Postmodern Techno-Industrial Megastate {{is a term}} {{occasionally}} used {{to denote}} either the Military-Industrial Complex or a superset thereof, particularly {{in the context of}} economic and political globalisation. Some variants, as well as spellings using different <b>hyphenations,</b> are occasionally seen. [...] The term has been used by journalists, historians, and political scientists as well as commentators, polemicists, and others of the political Right, Left, and Third Position.|$|R
25|$|In Austria (§ 93 ABGB), {{a couple}} can choose either of their {{surnames}} as married name. In the default case, {{this is the}} surname of the groom. The partner who is changing surnames (usually the bride) has the possibility to use their unmarried name alongside the married name with <b>hyphenation.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyphenation</b> {{at the end}} of a line {{depends on}} whether there is an easily {{recognizable}} word boundary there. If the word is not a compound (or it is, but the boundary is not nearby) the word is hyphenated by syllables, otherwise by word elements (e.g. vas-út ‘railway’, lit. ‘iron-road,’ instead of *va-sút).|$|E
25|$|Connecting hyphens {{are used}} in {{a large number of}} {{miscellaneous}} compounds, other than modifiers, such as in lily-of-the-valley, cock-a-hoop, clever-clever, tittle-tattle and orang-utan. Use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules, and <b>hyphenation</b> styles may vary between authors; for example, orang-utan is also written as orangutan or orang utan, and lily-of-the-valley {{may or may not be}} hyphenated.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 1,000,000 {{different}} family names in German. German family names most often derive from given names, geographical names, occupational designations, bodily attributes or even traits of character. <b>Hyphenations</b> notwithstanding, they mostly {{consist of a}} single word; in those rare cases where the family name {{is linked to the}} given names by particles such as von or zu, they usually indicate noble ancestry. Not all noble families used these names (see Riedesel), while some farm families, particularly in Westphalia, used the particle von or zu followed by their farm or former farm's name as a family name (see Meyer zu Erpen).|$|R
5000|$|The {{content was}} well {{received}} but critics felt the DS {{was not a}} suitable platform. Prior to the advent of Kindle, The Guardian newspaper reviewed the game {{as part of the}} [...] "minority fad" [...] of e-readers, declaring it bland and impersonal but good value for money. Eurogamer magazine criticised Nintendo for only using texts that were out of copyright and for not spending the extra for modern classics. It also found the text difficult to read due {{to the size of the}} screen, with unhelpful <b>hyphenations,</b> a low word number per page and distracting animations. The Telegraph newspaper agreed that the game offered good value for money but also criticised the size of the screen.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{described}} for efficient isolation of compounds having an antibacterial effect. Two thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oils, {{obtained from the}} market, were chosen as prospective materials likely to feature several bioactive components when examined by thin layer chromatography coupled with direct bioautography as a screening method. The newly developed infusion overpressured layer chromatographic separation method coupled with direct bioautography assured that only the active components were isolated by means of overrun overpressured layer chromatography with online detection and fractionation. Each of the 5 collected fractions represented {{one of the five}} antimicrobial essential oil components designated at the screening. The purity and the activity of the fractions were confirmed with chromatography coupled various detection methods (UV, vanillin-sulphuric acid reagent, direct bioautography). The antibacterial components were identified with GC-MS as thymol, carvacrol, linalool, diethylphthalate, and alpha-terpineol. The oil component diethyl-phthalate is an artificial compound, used as plasticizer or detergent bases in the industry. Our results support that exploiting its flexibility and the possible <b>hyphenations,</b> overpressured layer chromatography is especially attractive for isolation of antimicrobial components from various matrixes...|$|R

25|$|Many Shilha {{texts from}} the oral {{tradition}} have been published since the 19th century, transcribed in Latin script. Early publications display {{a wide variety of}} transcription systems. Stumme (1899) and Destaing (1920, 1940) use an elaborate phonetic transcription, while Justinard (1914) and Laoust (1936) employ a transcription based on French orthographical conventions. A new standard was set by Aspinion (1953) who uses a simple but accurate, largely phonemic transcription with <b>hyphenation.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{volume of}} text {{is currently in}} the process of being digitized from paper, or converted to plaintext from paper-centric file formats. Since these kinds of documents have typically been typeset for a two-dimensional printing surface, words are commonly hyphenated across lines. These <b>hyphenations</b> can cause noise in a corpus by either splitting words or running them together, resulting in omissions when the text is indexed. Longer content-words are affected disproportionately by this; for search applications especially, there's also potential for disrupting longer exact-phrase queries in particular. The task of dehyphenation involves detecting and removing only those hyphens that were inserted for typographical reasons at the time of typesetting, producing a text which should lie closer to the original. In this thesis, several empirical methods for dehyphenation are described, prototyped, and then evaluated on a heterogenous sample of English/Norwegian academic texts from the Norwegian Open Research Archive (NORA). Most of the methods investigated are intended to be applicable across many different alphabetic languages without requiring close supervision or previously-compiled dictionaries. Recommendations and suggestions for future work are given...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the {{applications}} of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in natural product analysis have been dramatically growing because of the increasingly improved separation and detection capabilities of LC-MS instruments. In particular, novel high-resolution hybrid instruments linked to ultra-high-performance LC and the <b>hyphenations</b> of LC-MS with other separation or analytical techniques greatly aid unequivocal identification and highly sensitive quantification of natural products at trace concentrations in complex matrices. With the aim of providing an up-to-date overview of LC-MS applications on the analysis of plant-derived compounds, papers published within the latest years (2007 - 2012) involving qualitative and quantitative analysis of phytochemical constituents and their metabolites are summarized in the present review. After briefly describing the general characteristics of natural products analysis, the most remarkable features of LC-MS and sample preparation techniques, the present paper mainly focuses on screening and characterization of phenols (including flavonoids), alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, coumarins, lignans, and miscellaneous compounds in respective herbs and biological samples, as well as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions using tandem mass spectrometer. Chemical fingerprinting analysis using LC-MS is also described. Meanwhile, instrumental peculiarities and methodological details are accentuated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we will briefly {{describe}} the approaches {{taken by the}} Cheshire (Berkeley) Group for the CLEF Adhoc-TEL 2009 tasks (Mono and Bilingual retrieval). Recog-nizing that many potentially relevant documents {{in each of the}} TEL sub-collections are in other languages, we tried to use multiple translations of the topics for searching each subcollection, combined into a single query. Overall this strategy performed very poorly compared to the the basic monolingual approach used last year (and repeated for one run in each language this year). We haven’t yet completed our analysis of the reasons for this (we suspect that results were evaluated expecting the retrieved items to also be in the same language as the topic). Once again this year we used probabilistic text retrieval based on logistic regression and incorporating blind relevance feedback for all of the runs. All translation for bilingual tasks was performed using the LEC Power Translator PC-based MT system. Our results this year, however, were surprising poor compared to last year’s results. Some testing has shown that, for some cases, unexpected <b>hyphenations</b> in the machine translation and untranslated words were to blame. It may also be the case that others have significantly improved their approaches for this task...|$|R
25|$|Word {{processing}} {{added to}} the text editor {{the ability to control}} type style and size, to manage lines (word wrap), to format documents into pages, and to number pages. Functions now taken for granted were added incrementally, sometimes by purchase of independent providers of add-on programs. Spell checking, grammar checking and mail merge were {{some of the most popular}} add-ons for early word processors. Word processors are also capable of <b>hyphenation,</b> and the management and correct positioning of footnotes and endnotes.|$|E
25|$|Major style guides advise {{consulting}} {{a dictionary}} {{to determine whether}} a compound modifier should be hyphenated; the dictionary's <b>hyphenation</b> should be followed even when the compound modifier follows a noun (that is, regardless of whether in attributive or predicative position), because they are permanent compounds (whereas the general rule with temporary compounds is that hyphens are omitted in the predicative position because they are used only when necessary to prevent misreading, which is usually only in the attributive position, and even there, only on a case-by-case basis).|$|E
25|$|Before Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, {{the program}} was unable to {{correctly}} handle ligatures defined in TrueType fonts. Those ligature glyphs with Unicode codepoints may be inserted manually, but are not recognized by Word for what they are, breaking spell checking, while custom ligatures present in the font are not accessible at all. Since Word 2010, the program now has advanced typesetting features which can be enabled: OpenType ligatures, kerning, and <b>hyphenation.</b> Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set crop marks or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{line length}} research, limited to print based text, {{resulted}} {{in a variety of}} results but generally for printed text it is widely accepted that line length fall between 45-75 characters per line (cpl), though the ideal is 66 cpl (including letters and spaces). For conventional books line lengths tend to be 30 {{times the size of the}} type, but between 20 and 40 times is considered acceptable (i.e. 30 x 10pt font = 300 pt line). Early studies considered line lengths between 59-97 mm (about 57 cpl) is optimum for 10 point font. For printed works with multiple columns 40-50 cpl is often better. For justified, English language text the minimum number of characters per line is 40 characters; anything less than 38-40 characters often results in splotches of white spaces (or rivers) or too many <b>hyphenations</b> in the block of text. Longer lines (between 85-90 cpl) may be acceptable for discontinuous text such as in bibliographies or footnotes, but for continuous text lines with more than 80 characters may be too long. Short text, such as ragged marginal notes, may be as little as 12-15 characters per line. Studies have shown that short lines are often preferred over long lines by study participants, likely because they feel more at ease with format, which contradicts research suggesting longer lines are best for quick reading.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEight heart {{specimens}} {{were examined}} that had concordant connections of the cardiac segments and exhibited Ebstein's malformation. The {{displacement of the}} leaflets of the tricuspid valve from the atrioventricular junction varied from minimal and isolated involvement of the septal leaflet to involvement of the mural and anterosuperior leaflets as well. This resulted {{in a wide range}} of physiologic “atriallzation” of the right ventricle. The distal insertion of the valve leaflets also exhibited a spectrum of malformation. At one end the insertion was the normal focal variety, allowing free communication between the atrialized and functional parts of the right ventricle. At the other end there was abnormal linear attachment of the anterosuperior and mural leaflets to an anomalous muscular shelf at the junction between the inlet and apical trabecular portions of the right ventricle. The anteromedial commissure between the anterosuperior and the displaced septal leaflets provided a “keyhole” communication between the two ventricular compartments. Between these extremes were cases in which <b>hyphenations</b> along a locus of linear attachment allowed additional communications between the ventricular compartments. In light of these anatomic observations, cineangiograms of 26 patients with Ebstein's malformation were reviewed retrospectively. It was possible to classify the patients into three groups with focal, hyphenated and linear attachment, respectively. Size, ejection and displacement indexes of the functional right ventricle measured from the angiograms suggested that the severity of the malformation increased from focal attachment through hyphenated to linear attachment. Clinical observations relative to symptoms (cyanosis at rest, reduced exercise tolerance) and outcome supported this morphologic-angiographic grading...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{serialization}} of Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 7 s Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe {{was completed}} in the National Era, the first edition in book form was published by Jewett. The two versions differ. By collating and ordering these two texts and the applicable manuscript leaves in Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s hand, {{it is possible to}} make reasonable assumptions regarding the transmission of the text. A textual editor preparing a critical edition should find this parallel text and the additional information very helpful. ^ The initial chapters discuss Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s literary life with an emphasis on the development of Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 7 s Cabin. Included are chapters on the publishing history and a review of the criticism of the novel. The main importance, however, lies with the textual information which includes a description of the manuscript leaves and a discussion of substantive variants, accidentals, and the differences in house rules between the National Era and Jewett. Lists of the substantive variants and recommended end-line <b>hyphenations</b> are included. ^ Finally, recommendations for a critical text are included showing that for the first thirty-one chapters Jewett was setting from the National Era text which should be used as the base text with consideration given to corrections and obvious authorial changes made in that section. After chapter 31, sections are examined independently and recommendations are made for each section as to what should be used as the base text. Included also is a photocopy of the National Era text. ...|$|R
25|$|Surnames {{and given}} names are capitalized.

They may consist of two or more elements, and they may be given as one word or in several words, but today <b>hyphenation</b> is the most common method.

25|$|Although {{software}} (<b>hyphenation</b> algorithms) {{can often}} automatically {{make decisions on}} when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user {{to be able to}} insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a soft hyphen (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is allowed but not forced. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, a three digit code is {{attached}} to the recipe number by <b>hyphenation.</b> The first digit of this code represents the year the cake was produced, and the other two numbers indicate the production number within that year. For instance, the seven digit sequence 8653-602, would indicate the second production in 2006 of factory recipe 8653. Some productions of cakes are valued over others because production numbers can indicate if a tea was produced earlier or later in a season/year. This information allows one to be able to single out tea cakes produced using a better batch of máochá.|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we present}} an ESI-UHR-Q-TOF based {{analysis}} of myxobacterial secondary metabolites, which permits to solve several challenges frequently encountered in metabolite profiling studies. Myxobacteria are promising producers of natural products exhibiting potent biological activities, and several myxobacterial metabolites are currently under investigation as potential leads for novel drugs. However, the myxobacteria {{are also a}} striking example for the divergence between the genetic capacity {{for the production of}} secondary metabolites and the number of compounds that could be characterised to date. Wild type and mutant strains were analyzed concerning the production patterns of known metabolites and with regard to the discovery of new metabolites. Sample throughput: Since mass accuracy and resolution of TOF instruments are independent of the acquisition rate, they are perfectly suited for a coupling to UHPLC separations. These <b>hyphenations</b> enable a reduction of analysis time in combination with a high chromatographic resolution and therefore permit an increased sample throughput. The UHR-TOF analysis revealed that an acquisition rate of up to 20 Hz did not compromise the achieved mass accuracy or resolution. Targeted and untargeted metabolite profiling: Acquisition of full scan accurate mass spectra enable the targeted screening for known compounds e. g. from the class of DKxanthenes based on very selective high resolution EIC (hrEIC) traces with small mass windows of 1. 0 – 0. 5 mDa. A comparison of several datasets following a “comprehensive feature extraction” combined with a statistical analysis permits an untargeted discovery of novel biomarkers using the same data files as for the targeted analysis. Identification: Even a mass accuracy of 0. 1 ppm is not sufficient for an unambiguous formula identification for m/z values above 500. A combination of accurate mass data and isotopic pattern information in MS and MS/MS spectra can extend this m/z range for reliable formula suggestions. Examples for novel metabolites from Myxobacteria will be shown...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} {{performances of}} analytical techniques, especially two-dimensional liquid chromatography hyphenated with highly sensitive detectors, allow discovery of new targeted compounds in highly complex samples, whether biomarkers in environmental effluents, natural metabolomes in natural products or unknown impurities in synthetic chemical process. While structural identification {{can usually be}} achieved through mass spectrometry and databases, it can be useful to confirm the potential structure via NMR analysis and/or to obtain standard reference material for quantitative purposes, incentive {{for the production of}} μg to mg of new target compounds. Hence, preparative chromatography, which was initially run for large-scale production, is now facing new challenges, with small volumes of highly complex samples to deal with. Unfortunately, one dimensional chromatographic methods exhibit limited performances when targets are minor compounds in a complex matrix. Moreover, for process intensification or limited amount of sample, it is now a priority to be able to isolate multiple components with the largest yield possible using as few purification steps as possible. With these specifications in mind, a comprehensive multidimensional chromatographic method for preparative purposes is becoming appealing. Liquid-liquid chromatography, also known as countercurrent chromatography or centrifugal partition chromatography, is a technique with a proven high loading capacity, working with multiple choice of solvent systems thus a large range of polarity and selectivity. The liquid nature of the stationary phase prevents sample denaturation, irreversible adsorption resulting in high sample recovery. All these qualities make the LLC technique highly receivable as a first dimension in a 2 D strategy, whether combined with another LLC method or with a more conventional LC method. In this review, both <b>hyphenations</b> are investigated from an instrumentation point of view, detailing systems selection methodology and two dimensional development strategy. Preliminarily, the specific LLC instrumentation is briefly summarized in this review and the nomenclature of two dimensional separation as well as the associated criteria are clearly explained and defined...|$|R
25|$|A {{new version}} of TeX, rewritten from scratch and called TeX82, was {{published}} in 1982. Among other changes, the original <b>hyphenation</b> algorithm {{was replaced by a}} new algorithm written by Frank Liang. TeX82 also uses fixed-point arithmetic instead of floating-point, to ensure reproducibility of the results across different computer hardware, and includes a real, Turing-complete programming language, following intense lobbying by Guy Steele. In 1989, Donald Knuth released new versions of TeX and METAFONT. Despite his desire to keep the program stable, Knuth realised that 128different characters for the text input were not enough to accommodate foreign languages; the main change in version 3.0 of TeX is thus the ability to work with 8-bit inputs, allowing 256 different characters in the text input.|$|E
