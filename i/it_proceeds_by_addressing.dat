These two algorithms have different and complementary features. One is fast, and sequential: <b>it</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>by</b> running a population of targets and by dropping and activating a new sensor (or re-activating a sensor already available) where and when this action seems appropriate. The other is slow, iterative, and non-sequential: <b>it</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>by</b> updating a population of deployment plans with guaranteed and increasing criterion value at each iteration, and for each given deployment plan, there is a population of targets running to evaluate the criterion. Finally, the two algorithms can cooperate in many different ways, {{to try and get}} the best of both approaches. A simple and efficient way is to use the deployment plans provided by the sequential algorithm as the initial population for the iterative algorithm...|$|R

A proof in Euler's style is based on a central lemma related to properties of the quadratic form x^ 2 + 3 y^ 2, then <b>it</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>by</b> descent by considering Two main cases.

40|$|A common {{method of}} {{improving}} how well understood a theory is, is by {{comparing it to}} another theory which has been better developed. Radical interpretation is a theory which attempts to explain how communication has meaning. Radical interpretation is treated as another time dependent theory and compared to the time dependent theory of biological evolution. Several similarities and differences are uncovered. Biological evolution can be gradual or punctuated. Whether radical interpretation is gradual or punctuated depends on how the question is framed: on the coarse-grained time scale <b>it</b> <b>proceeds</b> gradually, but on the fine-grained time scale <b>it</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>by</b> punctuated equilibria.
