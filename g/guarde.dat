2500|$|The term 'jolly boat' {{has several}} {{potential}} origins. It may {{originate in the}} Dutch or Swedish jolle, a term meaning a small bark or boat. Other possibilities include the English term yawl, or the 'gelle-watte', the latter being a term in use in the 16th century {{to refer to the}} boat used by the captain for trips to and from shore. The term appears in Chamber's Encyclopedia between 1727 and 1741, and as 'jolly' in the works of Frederick Marryat, though it may have been in use considerably earlier, as the record of the voyages of Francis Drake and John Hawkins has 'That day the Pegasus jolly was going on shore for water, carying no <b>guarde.</b> The Spaniards perceiving it came downe upon them.'

50|$|On March 7, Lewis Ayers brought Fannin {{news from}} Refugio, a town 25 mi south of Goliad.

6000|$|This {{official}} understood no English, but he glowered {{and frowned}} fiercely when the American was brought before him. The <b>guarde</b> and the cabman stood with bared bowed heads and in low tones preferred {{the charge against}} the prisoner; but Uncle John swaggered up to the desk and pounded his clinched fist upon it while he roared a defiance of Italian injustice and threatened to [...] "bring over a few war-ships and blow Naples into kingdom come!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{magistrate}} was frightened. The guarde's eyes bulged {{with horror}} and he trembled visibly.

The cabman, the magistrate, the <b>guarde</b> and the interpreter put their heads together and chattered voluble Italian--all speaking at once in excited tones--while Uncle John continued to warn them {{at the top of}} his lungs that their country was doomed to sudden annihilation and they were the culprits responsible for the coming calamity.|$|E

In total, [...] "approximatively 12,000 police men found themselves concentrated in Marseille.". On 22 January 1943 the Old Port was completely locked-out.

500|$|On March 11, Fannin sent Captain Amon B. King to help {{evacuate}} settlers {{from the}} mission in Refugio.

Unwilling to leave any of his men behind, Fannin sent William Ward with 120 men to help King's company. [...] Ward's men drove off the troops besieging the church, but rather than return to Goliad, they delayed a day to conduct further raids on local ranches.|$|R

50|$|Many in {{the area}} wanted retaliation, {{subsequently}} organizing the Victoriana <b>Guardes</b> as a coalition of Tejanos and Karankawa Indians, employing the fighting skills of Spanish lancers. Garza was chosen as leader. As scouts for José de Urrea at the Battle of Coleto, they ran guerilla tactics against Fannin. The Texian surrender at Coleto Creek led to the Goliad massacre of prisoners. Garza successfully pleaded {{on behalf of his}} Anglo neighbors who fought with Fannin in the skirmish; their lives were spared by the Mexican troops. The spirit of his defense was returned in kind by his neighbors after the Texian victory at Battle of San Jacinto. When Republic of Texas Secretary of War Thomas Jefferson Rusk began reprisals against Mexican sympathizers, he ordered Garza deported. The order was never successfully carried out due to a defense mounted by Garza's neighbors.|$|R
50|$|The 108th Field Artillery {{was formed}} on December 11, 1840, {{at a time}} when many militia units were forming across the country. It was {{established}} as an infantry company in the 1st Volunteer Infantry Regiment by CPT Thomas Tustin, and was called The National Guards after the Marquis de Lafayette's unit Les <b>Guardes</b> de Nationale, one of several in the state to use this name. It recruited for the Mexican War and volunteered for service but it was not needed since Pennsylvania had already supplied its required quota of troops. In 1856 the unit incorporated itself as the Infantry Corps of National Guards of the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The unit eventually expanded from a company to a battalion and by 1860 it expanded into a regiment, the 2d Infantry Regiment, and paraded as such on December 11, 1860. It was part of the Reserve Brigade Militia and was known as the First Blue Reserves. On February 22, 1861, the Regiment was in Harrisburg to receive President-elect Abraham Lincoln.|$|R
40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis, I {{tried to}} answered {{to the two}} main questions. At the first time I wanted to reconstruct the organization of border guard and history of it, from 1948 till the year 1989. I had to start before the year 1948, {{to get in the}} situation that had led to a communist coup, and changed border guard systém for a long time. I used archive files from Ministry of the interior and Ministry of Security Forces. To unterstand the low system of the Czechoslovak republic, I used the book of statutes especialy from the late 40 s and early 50 s. Because that was the main times for forming the guards. I wanted to describe technical side of a border system to. I also described border guard ranks and classification, that was deferent from the system that Czechoslovak army those times used. The system of border watch was very massive and contained many forms of passive and active defense systems. From the mines to an electric fence. I tried to figure out, how was it build and how much time did it cost. The second point of my thesis was to find out, If there was a political pressure in the work of border guards and to its members. In my thesis I also used a methods of oral history to find it out. I asked many people, specialy the exborder <b>guardes</b> and I wanted to interview them. But i found it very difficult. Most of them did not want to speak with me about this historical period. I try to find the answer also to a question of a basic daily life system of every person (not only guards) near the border line. This topic is even nowdays still very contorversial. Not only in society of exguards, but also in some part od todays czech society. There was some studies before the year 1989, but most of them was just the relicts of its own time. There were mostly secret and not so much of them were contained true information. Nowdays The Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes starts to descover this topic very extensively. They uses new technology in history science and methodes of oral history to find the true about border guard system in the times of socialist regime. The main source of information comes from military chronicles. They are mostly unprocessed, so it takes many time to work with them. The chronicle of znojmo brigade was processed in 2009. The Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes also working on the stories of victims of czech socialist regime. In this studies we can see also books about victimes on border line. The process that mapping this part of history is still running...|$|R
