5000|$|Before the 1840s simple surface <b>drains</b> or covered <b>drains</b> {{were used}} in towns. Surface <b>drains</b> carried off surface water by making the road section higher in the centre than at the sides. The {{simplest}} form of covered <b>drain</b> was the box <b>drain</b> that had a broad flat bottom. These <b>drains</b> caused problems because it was common for the entire volume of the <b>drain</b> to be completely filled and blocked. Another type of covered <b>drain</b> was the circular or barrel <b>drain.</b> They were rarely used, as they were more expensive and less effective than box <b>drains.</b> With {{the development of the}} ovoid or [...] "egg-shaped" [...] <b>drains</b> there was a dramatic improvement in the effectiveness of drainage systems. John Phillips designed the first ovoid <b>drain</b> in the 1840s and advocated that in order to have proper drainage of towns, separate drainage systems should be used for stormwater and sewage. The ovoid <b>drains</b> concentrated the flow of the water {{to the bottom of the}} <b>drain</b> and therefore decreased the likelihood of silting and blockage.

40|$|Vertical <b>drains</b> and {{preloading}} {{are very}} effective and economical ground modification techniques for accelerating primary consolidation and compensating some secondary compression of soft compressible soils. If vertical sand <b>drains</b> are used, {{they can be}} installed at different diameters. The <b>drain</b> diameter required thus becomes a dependent variable in the design process and the <b>drain</b> spacing is determined a priori. The required parameters can be obtained after a few iterations. However, the number of iterations may increase significantly when prefabricated vertical <b>drains</b> or strip <b>drains</b> are used as the <b>drain</b> size is predetermined by manufacturers and available only in a very limited range. Design curves are developed for prefabricated vertical <b>drains</b> in this paper. The equivalent <b>drain</b> diameter is used as the independent variable and <b>drain</b> spacing becomes the dependent variable. Soil smear around the <b>drain</b> is considered but well resistance of the <b>drain</b> is neglected.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION A <b>drain</b> describes any material or equipment used to prevent {{the formation of a}} haematoma or to carry fluid from inside the body to the surface. Allowing unwanted fluid or blood to remain in a wound may be a potential source of infection and may also impede healing, or result in wound breakdown and dehiscence.

They include vacuum <b>drains</b> which apply negative pressure such as the Redivac®, or non-vacuum systems such as the T-tube <b>drain.</b> 1 The <b>drain</b> is often secured with a suture. The use of a closed <b>drain</b> system lowers the risk of potential infection for patients and reduces staff contact with body fluids. 2. Open <b>drains</b> allow communication with the atmosphere. These <b>drains</b> include corrugated <b>drains,</b> the Penrose <b>drain</b> and sump <b>drains.</b> 1 Open <b>drains</b> are inserted directly into the wound bed and they <b>drain</b> into a dressing.
