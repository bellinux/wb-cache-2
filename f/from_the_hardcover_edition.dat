5000|$|The softcover {{edition of}} the book came out in February 2011, when Romney was nearing the June 2011 formal {{announcement}} of his 2012 presidential campaign. [...] Now with a different subtitle, No Apology: Believe in America featured a new introduction that explicitly focused on themes of the Tea Party movement such as freedom and devotion to the U.S. Constitution. [...] While much of the book's text remained unchanged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardcover</b> <b>edition,</b> material on the 2009 stimulus package was rewritten to be more negative about the act's effects and material about what Romney saw as the differences between [...] "Romneycare" [...] and [...] "Obamacare" [...] was recast to add defenses of the former and be more aggressively opposed to the latter. [...] According to PolitiFact.com, Romney engaged in [...] "some strategic editing" [...] by removing [...] "a defense of state-level choice − not a pitch for a mandatory national approach." ...|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the summary}} as noted on the {{publishers}} website <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardcover</b> <b>edition</b> of Love is a Mixtape:What Is love? Great minds have been grappling {{with this question}} throughout the ages, and in the modern era, they {{have come up with}} many different answers. According to Western philosopher Pat Benatar, Love is a Battlefield. Her paisan Frank Sinatra would add the corollary that love is a tender trap. Love hurts. Love stinks. Love bites, love bleeds, love is the drug. The troubadours of our times agree: They want to know what love is, and they want you to show them. But the answer is simple: Love is a mix tape. In the 1990s, when alternative was suddenly mainstream, bands like Pearl Jam and Pavement, Nirvana and R.E.M.--bands that a year before would have been too weird for MTV- were MTV. It was the decade of Kurt Cobain and Shania Twain and Taylor Dayne, a time that ended all too soon. The boundaries of American culture were exploding, and music was leading the way. It was also when a shy music geek named Rob Sheffield met a hell-raising Appalachian punk-rock girl named Renee, who was way too cool for him but {{fell in love with him}} anyway. He was tall. She was short. He was shy. She was a social butterfly. She was the only one who laughed at his jokes when they were so bad, and they were always bad. They had nothing in common except that they both loved music. Music brought them together and kept them together. And it was music that would help Rob through a sudden, unfathomable loss. In Love Is a Mix Tape, Rob, now a writer for [...] "Rolling Stone," [...] uses the songs on fifteen mix tapes to tell the story of his brief time with Renee. From Elvis to Missy Elliott, the Rolling Stones to Yo La Tengo, the songs on these tapes make up the soundtrack to their lives. Rob Sheffield isnt a musician, hes a writer, and Love Is a Mix Tape isnt a love song- but it might as well be. This is Robs tribute to music, to the decade that shaped him, but most of all to one unforgettable woman." ...|$|E

40|$|Distinguished {{group of}} historians answers key {{questions}} about the past — and about the present and future. What wins wars? Why do empires rise and fall? What makes a great leader? What causes nationalism? How do spiritual movements spread? These are the questions {{in the forefront of}} our minds today but they meant just as much to people in the past. How did earlier generations tackle them, and how far can historians use the lessons of the past to help find some answers? Drawing on examples from ancient Greece to Tony Blair’s Britain, leading historical thinkers address twenty of the really big questions that have been asked over the centuries: What is history? How does personality affect politics? What is the impact of technology on social change? How do intellectual movements start? How do our physical bodies and our private lives impact history? Each essay is accompanied by commentary by a journalist, discussing the views of other leading thinkers, today and in the past. The result is a stimulating ride over continents and across centuries in search of answers that are sometimes surprising, often controversial, and all of great relevance to how we live today. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hardcover</b> <b>edition...</b>|$|E
40|$|The bestselling {{author of}} Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home offers an {{intriguing}} new assessment of modern day science that will radically {{change the way}} we view what is possible. In Science Set Free (originally published to acclaim in the UK as The Science Delusion), Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, one of the world's most innovative scientists, shows the ways in which science is being constricted by assumptions that have, over the years, hardened into dogmas. Such dogmas are not only limiting, but dangerous for the future of humanity.  According to these principles, all of reality is material or physical; the world is a machine, made up of inanimate matter; nature is purposeless; consciousness is nothing but the physical activity of the brain; free will is an illusion; God exists only as an idea in human minds, imprisoned within our skulls.  But should science be a belief-system, or a method of enquiry? Sheldrake shows that the materialist ideology is moribund; under its sway, increasingly expensive research is reaping diminishing returns while societies around the world are paying the price.  In the skeptical spirit of true science, Sheldrake turns the ten fundamental dogmas of materialism into exciting questions, and shows how all of them open up startling new possibilities for discovery.  Science Set Free will radically change your view of what is real and what is possible. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hardcover</b> <b>edition...</b>|$|E

5000|$|A trade paperback, {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "trade paper edition" [...] or just [...] "trades", is a higher-quality paperback book. If it is a softcover edition of a previous <b>hardcover</b> <b>edition,</b> and if published by the same publishing house as <b>the</b> <b>hardcover,</b> <b>the</b> text pages are normally identical to the text pages in <b>the</b> <b>hardcover</b> <b>edition,</b> and <b>the</b> book is essentially the same size as <b>the</b> <b>hardcover</b> <b>edition.</b> Significantly, <b>the</b> pagination is the same so that references to the text will be unchanged: this is particularly important for reviewers and scholars.
