50|$|Imaging {{studies are}} {{performed}} before surgery or biopsy to preclude an intracranial connection. Images usually show a sharply circumscribed but <b>expansile</b> mass. It {{may be difficult}} to exclude the intracranial connection if the defect is small whether employing computed tomography or magnetic resonnance.|$|E

They are lytic lesions that usually contain calcified chondroid matrix (a [...] "rings and arcs" [...] pattern of calcification), except in the phalanges. They may be central, eccentric, <b>expansile</b> or nonexpansile.|$|E
5000|$|When {{performing}} imaging studies, bone {{windows in}} computed tomography studies are the best. The lesion is usually {{identified as a}} well demarcated, <b>expansile</b> mass with an ossified rim at the periphery. Calcifications are noted throughout.

50|$|Cholesteatoma is a {{destructive}} and expanding growth consisting of keratinizing squamous epithelium {{in the middle}} ear and/or mastoid process. Although cholesteatomas are not classified as either tumors or cancers, they can still cause significant problems because of their erosive and <b>expansile</b> properties resulting {{in the destruction of}} the bones of the middle ear (ossicles), as well as their possible spread through the base of the skull into the brain. They are also often infected and can result in chronically draining ears.|$|E
50|$|Hemaris is a genus of sphinx moths in the {{subfamily}} Macroglossinae, {{which is}} native to the Holarctic. Their main host plants are herbs and shrubs of the teasel and honeysuckle families. Moths in genus Hemaris are known collectively as clearwing moths or hummingbird moths in the US and bee hawk-moths in Britain. The related Old World hummingbird moths, genus Macroglossum, are similar in appearance and habits. Both genera have tails that are provided with an <b>expansile</b> truncated tuft of hairs, but only Hemaris has the disc of the wings transparent, as these scales are dropped soon after eclosion.|$|E
50|$|All {{abdominal}} wall hernias {{may be associated}} with pain and Carnett's test may be useful in their evaluation. The hernias of the anterior {{abdominal wall}} include: epigastric hernias, umbilical hernias, spigelian hernias and incisional hernias. Those of the groin include: direct inguinal hernia, indirect inguinal hernia, femoral hernia and sports hernia. Those of the pelvic wall include: sciatic hernia, obturator hernia and perineal hernia. The support hernias include: vault prolapse, enterocele, cystocele, rectocele and uterine decensus. Although most hernias can be detected clinically with the presence of a lump with an <b>expansile</b> cough impulse some may be difficult to detect either because they are small or because the patient is obese. In cases where the diagnosis is suspected but clinically unconfirmed, additional investigation using radiography or ultrasonography may be helpful. Herniography, in which contrast medium is introduced into the peritoneal cavity, has been successfully used to reveal previously unsuspected inguinal hernias in patients with groin pain of uncertain origin and to detect impalpable interparietal lesions such as Spigelian hernias.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the value of surgical staging for the two histologic types (<b>expansile</b> or infiltrative) of apparent stage I mucinous ovarian carcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed patients treated from 1976 and 2016 for apparent macroscopic stage I ovarian mucinous carcinoma. Extra-ovarian disease and tumors that metastasized to the ovaries were excluded. Two expert pathologists performed pathologic reviews of tumor data, according to 2014 WHO classification criteria. Tumors were typed as <b>expansile</b> or infiltrative and clinical and histologic characteristics were studied. The value of staging procedures (peritoneal and nodal) was based on the rate of microscopic involvement in macroscopically normal specimens. Of 114 cases reviewed, 46 were excluded (26 with macroscopic stage > I; 20 inaccessible for pathologic review). Of 68 patients included, 29 had <b>expansile</b> and 39 had infiltrative types. 27 patients received one-step surgery and 41 received restaging surgery. 52 patients received “complete” peritoneal surgical staging (including cytology, peritoneal biopsies, and an omentectomy or large omental biopsies). 24 underwent appendectomies and 31 underwent lymphadenectomies (8 <b>expansile</b> and 23 infiltrative). Before histologic analyses of staging specimens, 35 had “initial” stage IA and 33 had IC disease. After histologic analyses of lymph nodes, 4 cases (17 %, all infiltrative) had nodal involvement, and 2 showed microscopic peritoneal disease (1 omentum and 1 right diaphragm peritoneum). Three patients were upstaged based on isolated positive peritoneal cytology. To conclude, peritoneal staging procedures are required for both types of mucinous ovarian carcinoma. Lymphadenectomy could be omitted in <b>expansile,</b> but required in infiltrative type...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: Investigate {{the role}} of <b>expansile</b> versus infiltrative type of primary {{invasive}} intestinal type mucinous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (mEOC) in predicting recurrence and lymph node metastases. METHODS: Retrospective study. Differentiation was defined according to the Shimizu-Silverberg and expansile/infiltrative type according to the Lee-Scully criteria. RESULTS: Out of 104 patients with mucinous ovarian carcinomas, 44 primary invasive mucinous epithelial carcinomas of the intestinal type (mEOC) were identified. Patients with a mEOC of the <b>expansile</b> type are mainly diagnosed in stage I (21 out 23) and have an excellent prognosis (no relapses in 21 Stage I patients). Patients with mEOC tumours of the infiltrative type are less frequently diagnosed in stage I (12 out of 21) and 2 recurrences were noted out of 12 Stage I patients. Lymph node metastases were not observed in patients with apparent Stage I disease of the <b>expansile</b> type, but were present in 3 out 10 patients with infiltrative disease. Degree of differentiation did not predict recurrence or the presence of lymph node metastases. Prognosis was poor in patients with Stage II or higher disease, irrespective of type of infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Expansile</b> mEOC is mainly diagnosed in stage I and is not associated with lymph node metastases. Infiltrative mEOC has a worse prognosis and is associated with lymph node metastases. Degree of differentiation was unreliable in predicting recurrence or lymph node metastases. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{simulated}} sequential {{filling and}} emptying of a lung lobe Fukuchi et al. 1980) by solving a differential equation for simultaneous convection and diffusion within a solid <b>expansile</b> model of an asymmetrical acinus. For a given degree of asymmetry subtended {{at a fixed}} branch point the shorter units are consistently better ventilated (by diffusion) despite homogenous lung expansion. Thus a helium bolus inhaled at 80 % of vital capacity (VC) results in a higher helium concentration (FHe) at full inflation within the shorter units. A bolus inhaled at 20 % VC results in relatively greater FHe in longer units. On expiration diffusive interaction between parallel pathways at the branch point results {{in a range of}} alveolar plateaus whose slope varies inversely with the volume at which the helium bolus is inhaled. This interdependence of gas transport among parallel pathways contributes to the 'first in-last out' pattern observed experimentally. Comparison of radially <b>expansile</b> with an axial-radially <b>expansile</b> models does not produce qualitatively significant differences. However, equilibration of gas concentrations during breathholding in the model occurs more rapidly than under experimental conditions. indicating that other mechanisms may also contribute to the observed pattern of lung filling and emptying. © 1981.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a {{wide range}} of normal {{variation}} in sphenoid sinus development, especially {{in the size of the}} lateral recesses. The purpose of this study was to determine imaging characteristics that may help differentiate between opacification of a developmentally asymmetric lateral recess and a true <b>expansile</b> lesion of the sphenoid sinus. METHODS: Coronal CT was performed in seven patients with <b>expansile</b> or erosive benign lesions of the sphenoid sinus, and results were compared to a control population of 72 subjects with unopacified sphenoid sinuses. The degree of asymmetry of lateral recess development was assessed with particular attention to the separation of vidian’s canal and the foramen rotundum (vidian-rotundum distance). The images were also examined for evidence of: erosion, defined as loss of the normal thin bony margin on at least two contiguous sections; apparent thinning of the sinus wall, defined as a focal apparent decrease in thickness again on at least two contiguous sections; and for vidian’s canal or foramen rotundum rim erosion or flattening. RESULTS: Of the seven patients with <b>expansile</b> lesions, vidian’s canal margin erosion was present in seven, unequivocal sinus expansion in three, wall erosion in three, wall thinning in three, erosion of the foramen rotundum in two, and flattening in the foramen rotundum i...|$|E

30|$|Another such {{standard}} nanoparticle formulation specific for {{lung cancer}} cells, called <b>expansile,</b> {{was developed by}} Griset et al. in 2009. It was validated against Lewis lung carcinoma cells in murine models. It was enabled with a unique potential to release drug payload in response to highly acidic pH present {{in the vicinity of}} cancer cells [67]. Once the nanoparticle arrives at endosomes following uptake by the cells, the acidic conditions that prevail therein degrade the acid-labile hydrophobic protecting groups on the polymer, which leads to swelling of the polymeric nanoparticle and release of its payload. This system thus attained effective reduction in bystander effects of drugs. In another similar work by Zubris et al. in 2012, a pH-responsive hydrogel loaded with PTX <b>expansile</b> was synthesized and was concluded to be a promising system for targeted delivery to pulmonary lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A 549) [68].|$|E
40|$|Four {{horses were}} {{presented}} to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital with histories of facial asymmetry, nasal discharge or obstruction of normal nasal passage airflow. Radiographic examination of the maxillary sinuses of 2 cases revealed well circumscribed, unilateral, mineralised masses; the other 2 cases showed less mineralisation. The masses were accessed for further investigation by surgically created frontonasal bone flaps or trephination of the maxillary sinuses. Diagnosis of osteoma was confirmed histopathologically in 3 of the cases and of ossifying fibroma in the 4 th. Two horses were euthanased directly after surgical intervention due to poor prognosis. Osteomas are by nature <b>expansile</b> tumours and follow the complex communication of the sinuses, and therefore are not all amenable to surgical removal.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernomas {{are rare}} {{vascular}} anomalies and their <b>expansile</b> {{growth has been}} considered to be mainly due to recurrent hemorrhages. They are not generally reported to show aggressive behavior. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27 -year-old male presented with headache, visual disturbances, and a 17 -year history of seizures. He was known to have a temporal lobe lesion on CT scan, consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous malformation but with no relevant family history. Serial clinical and radiological follow-up revealed a progressive increase {{in the size of}} the lesion with formation of a growing cyst of 7 cm in diameter, which produced mass effect, resulting in the clinical picture of cerebral herniation. The patient underwent emergency surgical resection with symptomatic relief. There was no evidence of significant hemorrhage at surgery.
