40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} in building a multidimensional approximator which {{is used as a}} linear operator for mapping the vector of detuned <b>filter</b> <b>characteristic</b> to the vector of deviations of tuning elements. This has been done for the purpose of using it in postproduction filter tuning algorithm. With the use of collected sets of deviations of tuning elements and <b>filter</b> <b>characteristics</b> corresponding to them, the least squares method (LSM) is applied to determine the matrix which realizes the linear mapping between these vectors. The matrix found in this method approximates the vectors of both spaces (<b>filter</b> <b>characteristics</b> and corresponding deviations of tuning elements). In tuning process this matrix is used to determine the vector of tuning element deviations for a given detuned <b>filter</b> <b>characteristic</b> read from Vector Network Analyzer. To increase the “quality ” of linear operator <b>filter</b> <b>characteristics</b> are transformed with the use of Karhunen-Loeve transform (Principal Component Analysis). In contrast to non-linear artificial intelligence approximators used in filter tuning and published to-date, this method does not require a time-consuming training process.

50|$|Because the {{probability}} of vesicle release is activity-dependent, synapses can act as dynamic filters for information transmission. Synapses with a low initial probability of vesicle release act as high-pass filters: because the release probability is low, a higher-frequency signal is needed to trigger release, and the synapse thus selectively responds to high-frequency signals. Likewise, synapses with high initial release probabilities serve as low-pass filters, responding to lower-frequency signals. Synapses with an intermediate probability of release act as band-pass filters that selectively respond to a specific range of frequencies. These <b>filtering</b> <b>characteristics</b> may be affected {{by a variety of}} factors, including both PPD and PPF, as well as chemical neuromodulators. In particular, because synapses with low release probabilities are more likely to experience facilitation than depression, high-pass filters are often converted to band-pass filters. Likewise, because synapses with high initial release probabilities are more likely to undergo depression than facilitation, it is common for low-pass filters to become band-pass filters, as well. Neuromodulators, meanwhile, may affect these short-term plasticities. In synapses with intermediate release probabilities, properties of the individual synapse will determine how the synapse changes in response to stimuli. These changes in filtration affect information transmission and encoding in response to repeated stimuli.|$|E
