40|$|Background: Providing {{anesthesia}} for gastrointestinal (GI) <b>endoscopy</b> <b>procedures</b> in morbidly obese {{patients is}} a challenge {{for a variety of}} reasons. The negative impact of obesity on the respiratory system combined with a need to share the upper airway and necessity to preserve the spontaneous ventilation, together add to difficulties. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m 2 that underwent out-patient GI endoscopy between September 2010 and February 2011. Patient data was analyzed for procedure, airway management technique as well as hypoxemic and cardiovascular events. Results: A total of 119 patients met the inclusion criteria. Our innovative airway management technique resulted in a lower rate of intraoperative hypoxemic events compared with any published data available. Frequency of desaturation episodes showed statistically significant relation to previous history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). These desaturation episodes were found to be statistically independent of increasing BMI of patients. Conclusion: Pre-operative history of OSA irrespective of associated BMI values can be potentially used as a predictor of intra-procedural desaturation. With suitable modification of anesthesia technique, it is possible to reduce the incidence of adverse respiratory events in morbidly obese patients undergoing GI <b>endoscopy</b> <b>procedures,</b> thereby avoiding the need for endotracheal intubation...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in {{our knowledge of}} celiac disease, the most current and authoritative recommendations conclude that diagnosis requires at least four biopsy specimens to be taken from the duodenal area. These recommendations {{are based on the}} perception that classic endoscopic markers are not adequate to target biopsy sampling to sites of villous damage in the duodenum. In the past few years, newly developed procedures and technologies have improved endoscopic recognition of the duodenum. These advances make possible the real-time recognition of the duodenal villous pattern during an upper <b>endoscopy</b> <b>procedure,</b> and thereby have the potential to optimize diagnostic accuracy.

Methods: Single centre, non-concurrent prospective cohort study, 649 capsule <b>endoscopy</b> <b>procedures</b> were included. Cecal completion rates, gastric and small bowel transit times and diagnostic yield were analyzed. Results: 239 patients received erythromycin, 410 patients received domperidone. The cecal completion rate was 86 % after erythromycin versus 80 % after domperidone (p = 0. 03). After excluding known risk factors for incomplete capsule endoscopy such as hospitalization and previous abdominal surgery, erythromycin still resulted in an increased completion rate (p = 0. 04).

Using angiographic methods, an introducer of long arterial sheath, over a guide wire was passed {{to overcome the}} site of obstruction.
