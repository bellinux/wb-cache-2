Massively parallel pyrosequencing of a normalized multitissue library of Northern bobwhite cDNAs yielded 71, 384 unique transcripts that were annotated with gene ontology (GO), pathway information, and protein domain analysis. Comparative genome analyses with model organisms revealed functional homologies in 8, 825 unique Northern bobwhite genes that are orthologous to 48 % of Gallus gallus protein-coding genes. Pathway analysis and GO enrichment of genes differentially expressed in livers of birds exposed for 60 days (d) to 10 and 60 mg/kg/d 2, 6 -DNT revealed several impacts validated by RT-qPCR including: prostaglandin pathway-mediated inflammation, increased expression of a heme synthesis pathway in response to anemia, and a shift in energy metabolism toward protein catabolism via inhibition of control points for glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, PCK 1 and PPARGC 1, respectively.

In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify the active site of nitrobenzene dioxygenase, and the contribution of specific residues in controlling substrate specificity and enzyme performance was evaluated. The activities of six mutant enzymes indicated that the residues at positions 258, 293, and 350 in the α subunit are important for determining regiospecificity with nitroarene substrates and enantiospecificity with naphthalene. The results provide {{an explanation for the}} characteristic specificity with nitroarene substrates. Based on the structure of nitrobenzene dioxygenase, substitution of valine for the asparagine at position 258 should eliminate a hydrogen bond between the substrate nitro group and the amino group of asparagine.

40|$|Factors {{influencing}} {{natural attenuation}} of <b>dinitrotoluenes</b> (DNT) in surface soils {{and the application}} of monitored natural attenuation (MNA) as a remediation strategy were examined using contaminated soils from Badger Army Ammunition Plant (BAAP). Based on the previous research involving contaminated media obtained from locations at BAAP, and the fact that groundwater at the site is not contaminated, it seemed likely that aerobic biodegradation of DNT is active without intervention, and that natural attenuation may be an effective strategy for managing the contamination that exists at BAAP. Microcosms showed that microbes indigenous to soils are capable of 2, 4 -DNT mineralization and that DNT will adsorb reversibly and become bioavailable. In column studies 2, 4 -DNT biodegradation was observed and the nitrite evolved during DNT degradation was presumably removed due to oxidation by nitrite oxidizers. The use of simulated rainwater as influent with no nutrient amendments suggests that nutrients do not limit the biodegradation of low concentrations of DNT in the soil tested. In the chemostat study carried out to study effect lowering of temperature (22 㬠 15 㬠 10 㬠 7. 5 㠡nd 4 㩠on biodegradation of DNT at hydraulic retention time of 2. 5 days, no sustained change in the DNT substrate removal was observed with change in temperature, but it had a large effect on the nitrite oxidizers.

H 2 S gas is highly corrosive, toxic and odorous in nature. It is very necessary to remove H 2 S from gas streams as it can damage mechanical and electrical components of any control system, corrode energy generation and heat recovery units. In the present work, our main aim is utilise this toxic unwanted H 2 S and synthesise value added fine chemicals such as aromatic amines. In order to achieve our aims two industrially used alkanolamines such as mono ethanolamine (MEA) and n-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) have been used to absorb H 2 S and this H 2 S-laden aqueous alkanolamine solution is used as a reducing agent.

40|$|Contamination of {{soils and}} {{groundwater}} with nitroaromatic compounds such as 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and <b>dinitrotoluenes</b> (DNTs) has drawn considerable attention due to widely distributed contamination sites and substantial efforts for cleanup. Two isomers of DNT, specifically 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene (2, 6 -DNT) and 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (2, 4 -DNT), occur as soil and groundwater contaminants at former TNT production sites. The discovery of bacteria that use DNT isomers as electron donors has encouraged bioremediation at contaminated sites. Current work is extending the existing engineered bioremediation to naturally occurring in situ biodegradation {{and focuses on}} the application of natural attenuation (NA) as a remediation strategy for residual DNT at contaminated sites. More specifically this research evaluated factors influencing in situ bioremediation of DNTs and TNT in surface soils, vadose zones, and saturated medium. Applications involving surface soils and vadose zones investigated the potential of water infiltration to promote in situ bioremediation. Studies in saturated media were more applicable to NA. Factors that were also considered in studies conduced included: 1) the presence and distribution of degrading microbes in field soils (Barksdale, WI); 2) the dissolution and bioavailability of contaminants in historically contaminated soils; and 3) the effect of mixtures of contaminants (i. e., DNTs and TNT) on biodegradation processes. This research provided information useful for practitioners considering an in situ bioremediation NA as a remedial solution for contaminated sites. Under the condition simulating downflow of surface waters or rainwater, the rapid rate of DNT degradation could be facilitated by the availability of oxygen in the soil gas without concern of toxicity (i. e., nitrite evolution and pH drop) and addition of nutrients. As a result, in situ bioremediation or NA should be strongly considered as a remedial option for Barksdale soils and similar sites where relatively low concentrations of DNT isomers are present as contaminants. At TNT contaminated sites TNT was not mineralized by indigenous microorganisms despite oxidative biotransformation, and mixed culture capable of growth on DNT also could not develop the mineralization of TNT during DNT degradation. This suggests that the mixtures of contamination did not improve the potential for in situ TNT bioremediation. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Joseph B.
