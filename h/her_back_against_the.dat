5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 3:00am, Chief Nevins {{attempted}} {{his first}} sally into the vestibule of the theatre; {{no one had}} been in there since District Chief Farley's departure more than three hours prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading into the lobby, he found the body of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many more bodies to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.|$|E
6000|$|She, who was {{standing}} literally with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, gave a little gulp, {{and that was all}} her answer. Soames went on: ...|$|E
6000|$|... [ANN {{shuts the}} street door and sets <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> it. <b>The</b> [...] rumble of the {{approaching}} van is heard outside. It ceases.] ...|$|R
60|$|Fan, {{covering}} {{her face with}} <b>her</b> hands, shrunk <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, sobbing convulsively.|$|R
60|$|He {{had placed}} her upon the grass by now, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stem {{of a huge}} tree. At her {{question}} he stepped back where he could the better see her face.|$|R
6000|$|... [ANN puts <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door. CALWAY mounts {{the chair}} [...] dubiously, and raises his head cautiously, bending it more and [...] more downwards.] ...|$|E
6000|$|She leand <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wa, Says, [...] "Robin, let a' be; For it is a lady {{born and}} bred That's foughten sae well wi thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|She stood, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door, [...] And {{when her}} child drew near-- [...] 75 [...] 'Away! away!' the mother cried, [...] 'Ye shall not enter here.|$|E
60|$|And {{then her}} eyes closed. The {{voice of the}} Man from Nome had a monotony in its very earnestness. Besides, what dull talk was this of brooms and {{sweeping}} and dust? She leaned <b>her</b> head <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall.|$|R
60|$|Slone strode toward <b>her.</b> Lucy <b>backed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cedar-tree {{and could}} go no farther. How white he was now! Lucy's heart gave a great, fearful leap, for she {{imagined}} Slone intended {{to take her}} in his arms. But he did not.|$|R
60|$|For once startled {{out of her}} self-command, Elizabeth gave {{a little}} cry, while <b>her</b> father {{staggered}} <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall.|$|R
60|$|So she {{sat down}} {{in a corner of the}} coop, leaned <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> slats, nodded at the {{friendly}} stars before she closed her eyes, and was asleep in half a minute.|$|E
60|$|Again Louise {{tried to}} find the {{speaking}} tube. Then she made an endeavor to open the door, although just then the car started with a jerk that flung <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cushions.|$|E
60|$|A sigh {{made her}} turn round. With <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{door and a}} white, scared face, the girl was standing. Gyp thought: 'She has {{suffered}} horribly.' And, going impulsively up to her, {{she held out her}} hand.|$|E
5000|$|Robyn Naismith - Victim of Ronnie Joe Waddell. She {{was killed}} {{with a single}} gunshot wound to her head, at her home by Ronnie Joe Waddell. She was naked, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> propped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> television. Bite marks were present on her body.|$|R
60|$|In the meanwhile, Madge had {{arranged}} herself for repose on the straw; but {{still in a}} half-sitting posture, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door of the hovel, which, as it opened inwards, was in this manner kept shut {{by the weight of}} the person.|$|R
60|$|Eight, {{nine and}} ten struck from the tower-clock far away: she heard these sounds as in a dream. Tired, cold and hungry her {{vitality}} {{at that moment}} was at its lowest ebb--and, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall she fell presently into a torpor-like sleep.|$|R
60|$|She ran {{ahead of}} him, intercepted him, faced him with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door. He swept {{out a long}} arm as if to brush her aside. But it wavered and fell. Haggard, troubled, with working face, he stood before her.|$|E
60|$|During {{all this}} time the girl {{remained}} absolutely silent, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, as if knowing that her capture would come next. Hanscom fully expected her to take {{a hand in the}} struggle, but he was relieved--greatly relieved--by her attitude of non-resistance.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked slowly}} round the water's edge. In an embayed recess among the {{surrounding}} yew trees, leaning <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> pedestal of a pleasantly comic {{version of the}} Medici Venus, executed by some nameless mason of the seicento, he saw Mary pensively sitting.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hussy--to {{come between}} us and our child now!' cried Rhoda. 'This {{is the meaning of}} what Satan showed me in the vision! You are like her at last!' And {{clutching}} the bare arm of the younger woman, she pulled <b>her</b> unresistingly <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall. Immediately Brook had loosened her hold the fragile young Gertrude slid down <b>against</b> <b>the</b> feet of her husband. When he lifted her up she was unconscious.|$|R
60|$|And he fell on {{his knees}} before <b>her,</b> as she <b>backed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bookcase, and he caught hold of {{the edge of her}} dress-bottom, drawing it to him. Which made her rather abashed, and much more uncomfortable.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> head sunk <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rock. A low cry {{of terror}} burst from her. Her arm, {{resting on the}} rock, dropped at her side. I hurriedly {{approached}} her, in the fear that she might fall on the stony ground.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Ah yes, I {{would talk}} with thee, but be thou seated. It wearies {{me to look}} so high," [...] and she made room for me {{beside her on the}} couch, placing herself with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> end, so as to have a view of my face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course he}} must rough it,' said Ethel, setting <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} wall; 'I only {{want him to}} be hardened; but after a shock like this, one cannot go on as if one was a stock or stake. Even a machine would have its wheels out of order--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you live, as I understand, over at {{the pretty}} little cottage. It is very {{nice of you to}} call so early. I don't suppose that we shall get on, but still the {{intention}} is equally good." [...] She crossed her legs and leaned <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> marble mantelpiece.|$|E
6000|$|Georgina got up, {{walked with}} her majestic step across the room, {{and closed the}} door. Then she stood there, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{mahogany}} panels, indicating only by the distance she had placed between herself and her hostess the consciousness of an irregular position. [...] "I am not Georgina Gressie! I am Georgina Benyon,--and it has become plain, within a short time, that the natural consequence will take place." ...|$|R
60|$|Prince {{required}} but slight attention, lacking {{energy for}} superfluous movements of any sort. With {{no longer a}} companion to distract her, Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> hives. The mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul, conterminous with the universe in space, and with history in time.|$|R
50|$|In January 1957, {{her body}} was {{discovered}} in the third floor apartment, which was both her home and office. A friend and neighbour, Jerry Keating, went to the apartment when he failed to reach her on the telephone. The door was locked, and Terry did not answer the bell. Keating called the police; they broke in and found Terry's body on the bedroom floor, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bed. Five capsules, their contents gone, were {{on the floor beside}} her.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} leaning with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> desk in a {{somewhat}} mannish attitude. He stood between them. It will always remain Life's chief comic success: the man between two women. The situation has amused the world for so many years. Yet, somehow, he contrived to maintain a certain dignity.|$|E
60|$|Burning with shame, {{trembling}} with anxiety, covered with dust and considerably bruised, Barret sprang up, left his fallen steed, and, raising the {{little old lady}} with great tenderness in his arms, sat her on the pavement with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> railings, while he poured out abject apologies and earnest inquiries.|$|E
60|$|Like {{children}} they stole {{out of the}} house. They climbed the rolling moorland till they reached the hill on the further side of the valley. She sat down, breathless, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> trunk of a small Scotch fir. Burton threw himself on to the ground by her side.|$|E
60|$|Mabane {{closed the}} door through which Grooten had already issued, and I heard the key turn in the lock. I {{released}} Lady Delahaye's hands, and she sprang away from me. As the flame from the lamp which Allan had just rekindled gained in power we saw her, still shaking the handle, but with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> now <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall turned to face us. She was calmer than I had expected, {{but it was a}} terrible look which she flashed upon us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} unlock it," [...] she said; [...] "there is the key, {{and you can}} do as you please." [...] Then she flung the key upon the table, and stood with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, at some ten paces distant from the spot where the desk stood. He took up the key, and placed it remorselessly in the lock, and opened the desk, and brought all the papers forth on to the table which {{stood in the middle of}} the room.|$|R
60|$|As this {{conviction}} strengthened on Rose's mind, her {{purpose of}} vigilance began to decline--her thoughts wandered to objects towards {{which they were}} not directed, like sheep which stray beyond the charge of their shepherd--her eyes no longer brought <b>back</b> to <b>her</b> a distinct apprehension of the broad, round, silvery orb on which they continued to gaze. At length they closed, and seated on the folded mantle, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall of the apartment, and her white arms folded on her bosom, Rose Flammock fell fast asleep.|$|R
