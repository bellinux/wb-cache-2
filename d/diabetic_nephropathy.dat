25|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate CKD from acute kidney injury (AKI) because AKI can be reversible. Abdominal ultrasound, in which {{the size of the}} kidneys is measured, is commonly performed. Kidneys with CKD are usually smaller (≤ 9nbsp&cm) than normal kidneys, with notable exceptions such as in early <b>diabetic</b> <b>nephropathy</b> and polycystic kidney disease. Another diagnostic clue that helps differentiate CKD from AKI is a gradual rise in serum creatinine (over several months or years) as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum creatinine (several days to weeks). If these levels are unavailable (because the patient has been well and has had no blood tests), it is occasionally necessary to treat a patient briefly as having AKI until the kidney impairment has been established to be irreversible.|$|E
25|$|In {{skin wound}} healing, CYR61 is highly {{expressed}} in the granulation tissue by myofibroblasts, which proliferate and rapidly synthesize ECM to maintain tissue integrity and to promote regeneration of parenchymal cells. However, excessive matrix deposition can lead to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of tissue function. In skin wounds, CYR61 accumulates in the granulation tissue as myofibroblasts proliferate, and eventually reaches a sufficiently high level to drive the myofibroblasts themselves into senescence, whereupon these cells cease to proliferate and express matrix-degrading enzymes. Thus, CYR61 limits synthesis and deposition of ECM by myofibroblasts, {{reducing the risk of}} fibrosis during wound healing. In addition to skin wound healing, CYR61 expression is elevated in remodeling cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, in vascular injury, and in the long bones during fracture repair. Blockade of CYR61 by antibodies inhibits bone fracture healing in mice. In the kidney, CYR61 is expressed in podocytes in normal adult and embryonic glomeruli, but expression is decreased in IgA nephropathy, <b>diabetic</b> <b>nephropathy,</b> and membranous nephropathy, particularly in diseased kidneys with severe mesangial expansion.|$|E
25|$|While {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the islet transplantation field, many obstacles remain that currently preclude its widespread application. Two of the most important limitations are the currently inadequate means for preventing islet rejection, and the limited supply of islets for transplantation. Current immunosuppressive regimens are capable of preventing islet failure for months to years, but the agents used in these treatments are expensive and may increase the risk for specific malignancies and opportunistic infections. In addition, and somewhat ironically, the most commonly used agents (like calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin) are also known to impair normal islet function and/or insulin action. Further, like all medications, the agents have other associated toxicities, with side effects such as oral ulcers, peripheral edema, anemia, weight loss, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diarrhea and fatigue. Perhaps of greatest concern to the patient and physician is the harmful effect of certain widely employed immunosuppressive agents on renal function. For the patient with diabetes, renal function is a crucial factor in determining long-term outcome, and calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and ciclosporin) are significantly nephrotoxic. Thus, while some patients with a pancreas transplant tolerate the immunosuppressive agents well, and for such patients <b>diabetic</b> <b>nephropathy</b> can gradually improve, in other patients the net effect (decreased risk due to the improved blood glucose control, increased risk from the immunosuppressive agents) may worsen kidney function. Indeed, Ojo et al. have published an analysis indicating that among patients receiving other-than-kidney allografts, 7%–21% end up with renal failure as a result of the transplant and/or subsequent immunosuppression.|$|E
40|$|Background : Nephropathy is {{a common}} {{complication}} of diabetes {{and it is the}} major cause of disability and death among these patients.

Results: Soy milk consumption, in comparison to cow’s milk, resulted in a significant reduction in D-dimer level. This significant effect remained even after adjustment of cofounding factor (carbohydrate intake). However, soy milk consumption had no significant effects on inflammation and oxidative stress levels.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of chronic kidney diseases is increasing worldwide, and these conditions are {{emerging as a}} major public health problem. While genetic factors contribute to susceptibility and progression of renal disease, proteinuria has been claimed as an independent predictor of outcome. Reduction of urinary protein levels by various medications and a low-protein diet limits renal function decline in individuals with nondiabetic and <b>diabetic</b> <b>nephropathies</b> {{to the point that}} remission of the disease and regression of renal lesions have been observed in experimental animals and even in humans. In animal models, regression of glomerular structural changes is associated with remodeling of the glomerular architecture. Instrumental to this discovery were 3 D reconstruction studies of the glomerular capillary tuft, which allowed the quantification of sclerosis volume reduction and capillary regeneration upon treatment. Regeneration of capillary segments might result from the contribution of resident cells, but progenitor cells of renal or extrarenal origin may also have a role. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms and mediators underlying renal tissue repair ultimately responsible for regression of renal injury...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{complication}} of diabetes mellitus is <b>nephropathy</b> <b>diabetic,</b> if {{this situation is}} not cured properly it tends to develop the end stage of renal failure. The objectives of this diet management in patients with <b>nephropathy</b> <b>diabetic</b> are to reduce progression of renal damage, maintain the nutritional status of the patient, control blood glucose, lipid serum and maintain electrolyte and fluid balance. Nutrient requirement of <b>nephropathy</b> <b>diabetic</b> patients should contain: protein 0. 8 g/kg/body weigh/day. But if patients suffered of end stage of renal failure 0. 8 g/kg body weigh/day, {{in the case of}} dialysis the protein need is 1 - 1. 2 g/kg body weigh/day. For energy requirement they need 35 kcal/kg body weigh/day, with the carbohydrate 60 % from total energy need, fat should be 30 % total energy need contain poly unsaturated fatty acid and mono unsaturated fatty acid. For mineral, natrium (Na) is needed 1000 - 3000 mg/day, whereas kalium (K) is 40 - 70 mEq/day (1600 - 2800 mg/day). In conclusion, diet management is taking an important role to delay the progression of being end stage renal failure. Keywords: nefropati diabetik, gagal ganjal termina...|$|R

40|$|<b>Diabetic</b> <b>nephropathies</b> are {{characterized}} by glycogen accumulation in distal tubular cells that eventually leads to their apoptosis. The present study aims to determine if adiponectin and AMPK {{are involved in the}} regulation of glycogen synthase in these structures. Western blots of isolated distal tubules revealed the presence of ADIPOR 1, catalytic AMPK sub-units 1 and 2, their phosphorylated active forms and the glycogen-binding AMPK sub-unit 2. ADIPOR 2 was not detected. Expression levels of ADIPOR 1, AMPK 1, AMPK 2 and AMPK 2 were increased in streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats while phosphorylated active AMPK levels were strongly decreased. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of adiponectin receptor ADIPOR 1 on the luminal portion of distal tubules and TAL cells. Catalytic sub-units 1 and 2, their phosphorylated active forms and the glycogen-binding sub-unit 2 were also found in the same cells, confirming immunoblot results. In vitro, AICAR (2 mM) and globular adiponectin (10 µg/ml) activated catalytic AMPK in distal tubules isolated from kidneys of normal rats but much weakly in those from diabetic rats. Glycogen synthase (GS) inhibition paralleled AMPK activation, in both groups of animals: active GS levels were low in control animals and elevated in diabetic ones. Finally, glucose- 6 -phosphate, an allosteric activator of GS was also increased in diabetes. These results demonstrate that in distal tubular cells, adiponecti...|$|R

Thedevelopment of a registry on end stage renal disease in French Guiana in 2011 allowed to describe the magnitudeof this problem in the region for the first time. Methods: Using data from the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network registry (R. E. I. N). Descriptivestatistics on quantitative and qualitative variables in the registry were performed on prevalent cases and incidentcases in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
