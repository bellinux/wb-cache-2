The combination of these effects allows light water reactors to use low-enriched uranium.

Because a bomb relies on fast neutrons (not ones moderated by reflection with light elements, as in a reactor), because the neutrons reflected by a tamper are slowed by their collisions with the tamper nuclei, and because it takes time for the reflected neutrons to return to the fissile core, they take rather longer to be absorbed by a <b>fissile</b> <b>nucleus.</b> But they do contribute to the reaction, and can decrease the critical mass by a factor of four.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the right-left {{asymmetry}} is considered in the angular distribution of gamma quanta from fission of 235 U by polarised thermal neutrons, which depends on the polarisation of the neutrons {{with respect to the}} gamma—fission plane. Electric dipole radiation from fission fragments arising due to the Strutinsky—Denisov induced polarisation mechanism may give rise to such an effect. Earlier, this mechanism was shown to fit the non-statistical part observed in the γ spectrum from spontaneous fission of 252 Cf. The calculated value of the magnitude of the asymmetry parameter is on the level of 10 − 4. That is in agreement with the current experimental data. A crucial experiment to give a more definite picture of the concrete mechanism would be determination of the energy of the quanta responsible for the asymmetry. Detection of the quanta with the energy of ∼ 5 MeV approaching the GDR is needed in order to identify prompt gamma rays emitted at the stage of fissioning.

A particularity of 233 U is its small neutron capture cross-section {{which is about}} one order of magnitude lower than the fission cross-section on average. Therefore, the accuracy in the measurement of the 233 U capture cross-section essentially relies on efficient capture-fission discrimination thus a combined setup of fission and γ-detectors is needed. At CERN n_TOF the Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) coupled with compact fission detectors is used. Previously used MicroMegas (MGAS) detectors showed significant γ-background issues above 100 [*]eV coming from the copper mesh.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of Heavy Water Moderated Reactors is their high production of plutonium. This article demonstrates the possibility of reduction of plutonium and other actinides in Heavy Water Research Reactor. Among the many ways for reducing plutonium production in a heavy water reactor, in this research, changing the fuel from natural Uranium fuel to Thorium-Uranium mixed fuel was focused. The main <b>fissile</b> <b>nucleus</b> in Thorium-Uranium fuels is U- 233 which would be produced after neutron absorption by Th- 232, so the Thorium-Uranium fuels have some known advantages compared to the Uranium fuels. Due to this fact, four Thorium-Uranium fuels with different compositions ratios were chosen in our simulations; a) 10 % UO 2 - 90 % THO 2 (enriched= 20 %); b) 15 % UO 2 - 85 % THO 2 (enriched= 10 %); c) 30 % UO 2 - 70 % THO 2 (enriched= 5 %); d) 35 % UO 2 - 65 % THO 2 (enriched= 3. 7 %). The natural Uranium Oxide (UO 2) is considered as the reference fuel, in other words all of the calculated data are compared with the related data from Uranium fuel. Neutronic parameters were calculated and used as the comparison parameters. All calculations were performed by Monte Carol (MCNPX 2. 6) steady state reaction rate calculation linked to a deterministic depletion calculation (CINDER 90). The obtained computational data showed that Thorium-Uranium fuels with four different fissile compositions ratios can satisfy the safety and operating requirements for Heavy Water Research Reactor.

Four years after the Fermi publication, in December 1938, Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch correctly interpreted the radiochemical experimental results of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann as evidence of nuclear fission. News of this discovery spread quickly among physicists and it was realised that if chain reactions could be controlled, fission {{might lead to a}} new source of great power. What was needed was a substance that could [...] "moderate" [...] the energy of neutrons emitted in radioactive decay, so that they could be captured by other <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Heavy water and graphite were the prime candidates for moderating the energy of neutrons.|$|R
25|$|Thermal {{reactors}} (the {{most common}} type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or thermal neutrons to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type.

Thermal neutrons have a far higher cross-section (probability) of fissioning the <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclei</b> uranium-235, plutonium-239, and plutonium-241, and a relatively lower probability of neutron capture by uranium-238 (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of low-enriched uranium or even natural uranium fuel.

25|$|PWRs are {{designed}} to be maintained in an undermoderated state, meaning that there is room for increased water volume or density to further increase moderation, because if moderation were near saturation, then a reduction in density of the moderator/coolant could reduce neutron absorption significantly while reducing moderation only slightly, making the void coefficient positive. Also, light water is actually a somewhat stronger moderator of neutrons than heavy water, though heavy water's neutron absorption is much lower. Because of these two facts, light water reactors have a relatively small moderator volume and therefore have compact cores. One next generation design, the supercritical water reactor, is even less moderated. A less moderated neutron energy spectrum does worsen the capture/fission ratio for 235U and especially 239Pu, meaning that more <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclei</b> fail to fission on neutron absorption and instead capture the neutron to become a heavier nonfissile isotope, wasting one or more neutrons and increasing accumulation of heavy transuranic actinides, some of which have long half-lives.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{pressing}} need for high-precision data on neutron-induced reactions {{of interest for}} emerging nuclear technologies and nuclear astrophysics has triggered {{the development of new}} methods and experiments, especially on capture cross-section measurements of <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclei.</b> In these measurements, radiative capture γ-rays are hidden in a large background of fission γ-rays. The latter has then to be subtracted via a veto method, by detecting fission events with a very good efficiency. This efficiency is limited by the backscattering and the self-absorption of the fission fragments (FF) in the target, and by the alpha radioactivity of the sample. An accurate determination of the fission efficiency is rather difficult. It is often determined by using known fission cross sections if the neutron flux is given. However, in some cases, the fission cross section is not well known and the neutron flux cannot be measured with sufficient accuracy. Another method to determine the fission efficiency is based on the detection of prompt fission neutrons in coincidence or anti-coincidence with the fission detector. Different examples are presented and advantages and disadvantages of this method will be discussed...|$|R
