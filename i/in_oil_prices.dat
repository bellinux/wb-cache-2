Environmental, legal, and political debates followed the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, and the pipeline was built only after the oil crisis provoked the passage of legislation designed to remove legal challenges to the project.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the central}} issues in {{international}} macroeconomics is relative price movements and their sources. One such price is the <b>price</b> of crude <b>oil.</b> An increase <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> leads to a transfer of income from importing to exporting countries through a shift in terms of trade. The general mechanism by which <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> affect the economic performance is well under-stood. However, the dynamics of these effects – especially the adjustment {{to the terms of}} trade – are uncertain. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the impact of an increase <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> on the terms of trade during the time period 1970 to 2004. The relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> and world business cycle as well as the relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> GWP and Saudi Arabia’s export is also examined in this paper. The regression results show that an increase <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> has a negative impact on terms of trade for the net importing country. Whether an increase <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> has a positive or no effect at all on terms of trade for the net exporting country cannot be told form the regres-sion results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} oil shocks on return and volatility in the sectors of ‎Australian stock market and finds significant effects for most sectors. For the overall market ‎index, an increase <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> return significantly reduces return, and an increase <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> ‎return volatility significantly reduces volatility. An advantage of looking at sector returns ‎rather than a general index of stock returns is that sectors may well differ markedly in how ‎they respond to <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks. The energy and material sectors (as expected) and the ‎financial sector (surprisingly) are out of step (in different ways) with results for the other ‎sectors and for the overall index. A rise <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increases returns <b>in</b> the energy and material ‎sectors and an increase <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> return volatility increases stock return volatility in the ‎financial sector.

30|$|Oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of energy, and the impacts of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> fluctuations are risky in terms of the economies of countries. Fluctuation <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> affects both the oil-importing and the oil-exporting countries.

Moreover, it is generally accepted that instant and huge changes <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> can cause a rise in consumer prices and core inflation, which will result in economic recession in oil-importing countries.|$|R
5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked {{a turning point}} toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> {{had only a}} limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E

30|$|The {{scenarios}} {{to investigate}} for this paper reflect {{the impact of}} external shocks {{in the form of}} changes <b>in</b> the crude <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> This research was inspired by the current trend <b>in</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>prices,</b> which seems to display a ‘new’ trend <b>in</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> that deviates from the preceding behavior. As well as the decline <b>in</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> the paper also looks at the cases of the crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> rising.

5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1970s and early 1980s {{that took place in}} Texas (because of the escalation <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices)</b> benefited the Bay Area communities significantly. Industrial operations were expanded including the opening of the U.S. Steel plant in Baytown in 1970, and the Barbours Cut shipping terminal at Morgan's Point in 1977. The Port of Texas City became the third leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. The Barbours Cut terminal, operated by the Port of Houston, became the seventh leading port in the nation. Not all of this development was without controversy, however. In building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of eminent domain to evict residents from nearly one third of the homes in Morgan's Point. Still, when the Texas economy declined in the later 1980s, the economic diversity of the area and substantial annual federal investments related to JSC helped the region fare better than most of Greater Houston.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E
