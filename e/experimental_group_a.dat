40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} propofol and ketamine on the cognitive function and immune function in young rats. MethodA total of 80 young rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control group, ketamine group (<b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> <b>A),</b> propofol group (experimental group B), ketamine and propofol group (experimental group C). All rats had continuous injection for three times, serum IL- 2, IL- 4 and IL- 10 and whole brain IL- 1 β level, hippocampal neuronal apoptosis level were measured. The cognitive ability in rats was tested by water maze. ResultsWater maze test showed on the 1 st d, the maze test latency of the control group, the experimental group B and the experimental group C water were decreased gradually; Compared with the control group after 3 days, the latency of the <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> <b>A,</b> experimental group B and experimental group C were all decreased, the crossing circle times were also reduced. Hippocampal neuron apoptosis were (2. 3 ± 1. 7) %, (14. 7 ± 6. 9) %, (4. 2 ± 3. 3) %, (10. 2 ± 4. 8) % in control group, <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> <b>A,</b> experimental group B and experimental group C, respectively.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} recombinant canstatin proteins with different concentration on the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 2 (TIMP- 2) in mice with corneal alkali burn. METHODS: Sixty BALB/c mice were divided into three groups(experimental group A, experimental group B and control group C), 20 mice in every group and their corneas in the right eyes were burned with alkali(1 mol/L NaOH). The <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> <b>A</b> received recombinant canstatin proteins drops with 3 μg/mL. The experimental group B received recombinant canstatin proteins drops with 5 μg/mL and the control group C was treated with physiologic saline. At different time points(1, 3, 7 and 14 d) after alkali burns, the mice were killed {{and the growth of}} epithelial defect and corneal neovascularization(CNV) were observed with an operation microscope. The expressions of MMP- 2 and TIMP- 2 in cornea were measured by the Western blot technique, and the results were analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescent(ECL). RESULTS: The areas of epithelial defect and corneal neovasularization significantly reduced in mice treated with recombinant canstatin proteins compared to mice treated with physiologic saline at 3, 7 and 14 d after alkali-induced injury(all P); the neovasularization was suppressed and the area of CNV was less than that in control group C(all P). Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of MMP- 2 in <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> <b>A</b> and B were significantly lower than that in control group C(P P P), while the level of TIMP- 2 in experimental group B were significantly higher than that in <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> <b>A</b> on day 7 and day 14 (P). CONCLUSION: Recombinant canstatin proteins may suppress the expression of MMP- 2, upregulate the expression of TIMP- 2 in cornea cells and the infiltrated inflammatory cells, lower the rapid resolution of cornea and ulceration, and {{play a vital role in}} the remodeling of alkali treated cornea in mice...|$|E
