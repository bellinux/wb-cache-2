5|$|I {{was told}} by my {{publishers}} that Cher heard my version and she doesn't like my new lyrics. She thinks it's too overtly sexual. But the original writers were happy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval {{about what happened to}} the song. Now apparently she's heard what I've done and she doesn't like it.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
25|$|It is just unthinkable.... I {{am proud}} and {{honored to be}} a priest and a Jesuit. As a person of faith I must believe that there is work <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> which somehow will be more {{important}} than the work I am required to leave.|$|E

25|$|None of this, apparently, was enough. Sage {{wrote in}} a journal in August 1961, “I have said all that I have to say. There is nothing left <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but scream.” On January 8, 1963, she put a fatal bullet through her heart. Following {{instructions}} in her will, Pierre Matisse buried urns containing Sage’s and Tanguy’s ashes in the water {{off the coast of}} Tanguy’s native Brittany in 1964.|$|E
25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E

[...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a polka medley.

Teaching that machine intelligence class so I could graduate was really nice, too. Thanks go to Drs. Schwartz, Gugel, Arroyo and Nechyba for making sure I was not fed to the lions.

500|$|... "Kissing You" [...] {{was covered}} by American R singer Beyoncé under the title [...] "Still in Love (Kissing You)", later {{replaced}} with other track [...] "If". Beyoncé's rendition was included on the 2007 deluxe edition of her second studio album, B'Day. Beyoncé contributed to the writing and production processes, {{and it was one}} of the last tracks to be added to the album. She called the song [...] "a beautiful ballad" [...] and said, [...] "I've always loved [...] It gives you this emotion – I don't care who you are, you just feel it.

500|$|Princess Ida was {{the first}} of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership's {{previous}} standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after Ida opened, Sullivan told Carte that [...] "it is impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself." [...] As Princess Ida showed signs of flagging, Carte realised that, for the first time in the partnership's history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months' time. In the meantime, when Ida closed, Carte produced a revival of The Sorcerer.|$|E

500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster.

He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.'

Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|After Patience, Carte {{produced}} Iolanthe, {{which opened}} in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice. Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security. Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, [...] "Effectively, [...] made [...] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments." [...] The partnership's next opera, Princess Ida, opened in January 1884. Carte soon saw that Ida was running weakly {{at the box office}} and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners to write a new opera. The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music, and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure only increased. He soon regretted having signed the five-year contract. In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that [...] "it is impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, Ishihara stated that Gold and Silver started development right after Pokémon Red and Green were released in Japan.

Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took {{three and a half years}} was due to being a small team of only four programmers, [...] "We were very greedy in terms of all the features we wanted to include in the games". Ishihara declared that Gold and Silver were supposed to be the last in the series – [...] "I didn’t intend to make any more Pokémon titles. I even thought that once we entered the twenty-first century, it would be time <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something else entirely" [...] – and most of the licensed merchandising, including the Pokémon Trading Card Game, were to [...] "ensure Gold and Silver were successful".|$|E

500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... I {{would go to the}} furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let me have your best advice what is best <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> for that I mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
500|$|On 22 May 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria for his [...] "services ... {{rendered}} to {{the promotion}} of the art of music" [...] in Britain. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. [...] Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan suddenly felt trapped. [...] In mid-December, he bade farewell to his sister-in-law Charlotte, Fred's widow, who emigrated with her young family to America. Sullivan's oldest nephew, Herbert, stayed behind in England as his uncle's ward. The next opera, Princess Ida (1884, the duo's only three-act, blank verse work), had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors, although Sullivan's score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months' notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera. Sullivan's close friend, the composer Frederic Clay, had suffered a serious stroke in early December 1883 that effectively ended his career at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own longstanding kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, [...] "t is impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I trust," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you will}} {{recognize}} {{the justice of}} these conditions.
