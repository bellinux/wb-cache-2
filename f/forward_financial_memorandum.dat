40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{assumption}} of expected profit-maximizing bidding behavior in a multi-unit, multi-period auction where bidders submit non-decreasing step-function bid supply curves to recover estimates of multi-output behavioral cost functions for electricity generation units. This estimation framework extends the results in Wolak (2003) {{to the case of}} multi-output cost functions and incorporates significantly more of the implications of expected profit-maximizing bidding behavior contained in the step-function bid supply curves. This information is used to derive more efficient behavioral cost function estimates and a number of tests of the hypothesis of expected profit-maximizing bidding behavior under a minimal set of assumptions. These techniques are applied to bid, market outcomes, and financial hedge contract data obtained from the first four months of operation of the National Electricity Market (NEM 1) in Australia. The empirical analysis finds statistically significant evidence consistent with the existence of ramping costs. Various specification tests of the null hypothesis of the expected profit-maximizing bidding behavior find no evidence against it. These behavioral cost function estimates are then used to construct a number of counterfactual daily output supply scenarios to quantify the magnitude of ramping costs and the relationship between the level of <b>forward</b> <b>financial</b> contracts held by an electricity supplier and the magnitude of ramping costs it incurs. In particular, I find that relative to case of no <b>forward</b> <b>financial</b> contract holding, the supplier’s existing forward contract obligations commit it to a unilateral profit-maximizing pattern of output that causes it to incur average daily production costs that are on average 9 percent lower. 11...|$|R

Applying these techniques to data from the National Electricity Market in Australia reveals statistically significant evidence of output-dependent marginal costs within and across half-hours of the day, but no evidence against the hypothesis of expected profit-maximizing behavior.

In an effort to contain the crisis from spreading, the authorities in the US and many European governments have taken unprecedented steps of providing extensive liquidity, giving assurances to bank depositors and creditors that include blanket guarantees, and structuring bail-out programs that include taking large ownership stakes in financial institutions, in addition to establishing programs for direct provision of credit to non-financial institutions.

40|$|Purpose – Charities are {{becoming}} recognised as playing {{an important part}} in communities by furthering government’s social objectives through increasing support to disadvantaged members of society. As charities multiply in number, it becomes increasingly difficult for fund providers and contributors to determine which charity to support. In New Zealand there is a move towards providing public access to the financial accounts of charities to assist stakeholders in their decision making and to enhance transparency in charities. However, this assumes that these financial accounts are understandable by all stakeholders. This paper aims to identify four problems that limit the way <b>forward</b> for <b>financial</b> reporting by New Zealand charities. Design/methodology/approach – The first section of the paper comprises {{a review of the literature}} on charities’ financial accounts with a particular focus on the four problems identified above. The paper then reports the results of eight interviews with charitable organisations, auditors and academics that have expertise in charity financial reporting, with a particular emphasis on the four identified problems. Findings – There was agreement that unresolved, these four problems could limit the way <b>forward</b> in <b>financial</b> reporting by New Zealand charities. Some recommendations are proposed that suggest a way forward with regard to these problems, so that the users of the financial reports of charities may benefit. Research limitations/implications – Highlights a need for further research into these problems to identify the feasibility of the proposed recommendations. Originality/value – The enactment of the Charities Act 2005 in New Zealand and its requirement to include financial accounts on a publicly available register has raised the profile of the financial reports of charities. However, there has been limited research into the financial reporting by New Zealand charities, so this paper is a timely evaluation of four specific problems that could limit the way <b>forward</b> of <b>financial</b> reporting by New Zealand charities...|$|R
40|$|John Howard, c. 1423 - 1485, baron Howard {{and first}} duke of Norfolk, {{was one of}} the most {{important}} men of the Yorkist period and this is an attempt to place his career within the political, economic and social framework of his time. He was a consistently loyal supporter of the Yorkists from the late 1450 s until his death at Bosworth and an indefatigable royal servant, active in the military field, as an agent of the crown at home in East Anglia, as a councillor at Westminster and as an ambassador who became England's leading envoy to France. In return for this service he received grants of both offices and lands, culminating in the dukedom of Norfolk (to whose lands he was co-heir through his mother), given him by Richard III as a bid for his support following the usurpation; a bargain Howard accepted and honoured. Coming from substantial Suffolk gentry, he remained essentially a local man rather than a courtier, unlike most of his influential contemporaries who were all either related to, or close personal friends of, the king. Howard?s own affinity, as far as may be judged, were either relations by blood or marriage or local Suffolk men. He was an extremely capable business man, with many contacts among the merchant class and besides building up his estates, much augmented by the crown, he became one of the largest shipowners in the country and consequently a very rich man. Several volumes of his <b>financial</b> <b>memoranda</b> survive for the years 1461 - 1471 and 1481 - 1483, and illustrate almost every aspect of his full life as one of the most diligent and versatile royal servants of the period. <p...|$|R
40|$|We {{advocate}} a domain specific software development methodology for heterogeneous computing platforms such as Multicore CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. We argue that three specific benefits are realised from adopting such an approach: portable, efficient implementations across heterogeneous platforms; domain specific metrics of quality that characterise platforms {{in a form}} software developers will understand; automatic, optimal partitioning across the available computing resources. These three benefits allow a development methodology for software developers where they describe their computational problems in a single, easy to understand form, and after a modeling procedure on the available resources, select how {{they would like to}} trade between various domain specific metrics. Our work on the <b>Forward</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework ($F^ 3 $) demonstrates this methodology in practise.

40|$|This report {{examines}} how the social policy of Age Pension provision {{has affected the}} life-chances of elderly Australians. Based upon a 1982 social survey of fifty pensioners living in Sydney, the study explores the adequacy of income provision {{and its implications for}} {{the quality of life in}} retirement, so as to yield an experiential account of life on the pension. Participants were questioned about a range of historical and contemporary influences upon their present living standards, so as to illuminate the central research themes of adequacy and deprivation. The study found that one half of the sample recorded a worse standard of living on the pension. They adjusted to relative poverty with stoicism, and tended to discount any deprivations suffered. This survey indicates that <b>forward</b> <b>financial</b> planning towards retirement is unlikely amongst those of modest socio-economic status. Economic 'self reliance' through past savings or present part-time work cannot be expected, nor does the 'family' provide an income security 'safety net', so the pension must be sufficient rather than supplementary in its amount. The study suggests a range of social policy targets, proposes a common retirement age of 65 years for both sexes, and floats a proposal for a 'survival bonus', so as to reach those pensioners in greatest need...|$|R
40|$|Further {{education}} corporations {{were formed}} by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 and came into being as exempt charities on 1 April 1993. From 1 April 2012 {{the enactment of the}} Education Act 2011 provided the governing bodies of further education corporations with a range of structural and procedural choices beyond the prescribed rules and regulations that have been in force for the period 1993 - 2012. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain an appreciation of the views of clerks to the corporation in anticipation of these new freedoms and to gauge very early responses to them. It aimed to identify potential areas where additional support in terms of training, development and consultancy may be required, for example to make sense of the new freedoms and in understanding the possible implications of any changes made. To this end an e-questionnaire was sent for completion by clerks to the corporation of 332 colleges in England and Wales. The survey was undertaken shortly before the changes came into force and at a time when some important governance material (such as the <b>Financial</b> <b>Memorandum</b> and Audit Code of Practice) had yet to be revised for the new governance operating context. 119 responses were received. This report presents a descriptive overview of those responses. It does not seek to make interpretive judgements, although inferences will be drawn where the data strongly supports it. There are contradictions and inconsistencies in some of the responses which may reflect the fact that only 8 Colleges consider themselves (as perceived by their clerk) ‘well prepared’ for the new governance freedoms. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that assistance in preparation for governance in the context of the new freedoms may be required. Responses indicate most governing bodies will not rush into making changes, although 44 colleges stated that they would wish to take advantage of the new freedoms to make changes to the Instrument and Articles of Government in the next 12 months...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{reports a}} study of the {{application}} of a computerized financial control system on a target cost contract {{for the development of a}} cable car construction project in Hong Kong. The author is one of the key system designers supplied by the consultancy services of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The system emphasizes the enhancement of the integrity and effectiveness of decision-support and the information flow among the various construction parties for construction target cost contracts aided by a computerized construction integrated management system, equipped with intelligent database and data mining technology. Complex and capital-intensive construction projects usually involve higher risks. A partnering approach can be applied to such projects as a basis to bring about better project results. Partly as a result of rational risk sharing, target cost contracting can also be effective, where a fixed target cost is set based on given parameters at the outset. If this fixed target is exceeded or undercut, the outcome is split between the contracting parties in a pain/gain sharing fashion. An advantage of this approach lies in the incentive to the contractor to be efficient and to achieve savings. Target cost contracting has been globally recommended as an appropriate means of realizing high-risk construction projects. So as to satisfy the high transparency requirement in financial controls and the information demand for <b>forward</b> <b>financial</b> planning, a computerized integrated management system, with data mining and neural capability, is recommended to support decision making in target cost contracting...|$|R
