5|$|Aerial reconnaissances were {{routinely}} carried out; one {{carried out on}} 15 November by the Australian Flying Corps made a detailed reconnaissance behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> over the areas of El Kossaima, Hafir el Auja and Abu Aweigila, taking 24 photographs of all camps and dumps.|$|E
5|$|A ^ Rob {{was awarded}} the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 {{parachute}} drops and for his involvement in operations behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> in Italy and North Africa during the Second World War. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at 2nd SAS at the time so that the dog would remain with the regiment.|$|E
50|$|If the {{opposing}} fleets were of similar size, {{a portion of}} the line might be overwhelmed by focused gunfire of the entire <b>enemy</b> <b>line</b> by doubling. Ships breaking through the <b>enemy</b> <b>line</b> would act in concert with others remaining on the original side to simultaneously engage both sides of {{a portion of the}} enemy fleet while the broadsides of the remainder of the <b>enemy</b> <b>line</b> were unable to engage.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-Republican army, {{the central}} tactic {{was a shock}} infantry-charge, {{designed}} to put the enemy to flight as quickly as possible. Hastati legionaries would advance at a measured pace towards the <b>enemy</b> <b>line.</b> When the gap was only around 15m, each successive line of hastati would fling their two pila, draw their swords and break into a run, yelling their war-cry and charging into the <b>enemy</b> <b>line.</b> Smashing the <b>enemy</b> {{in the face with}} their shield-bosses, legionaries would use their gladii to stab the enemy in the groin, belly, or face, inflicting fatal wounds in the great majority of cases. Where the enemy was tribal and unarmoured, the initial impact alone frequently resulted in the collapse of the <b>enemy</b> <b>line.</b> Against advanced <b>enemies</b> such as the Greeks, the initial impact would at least disrupt the <b>enemy</b> <b>line</b> and, in the ensuing melee, the Romans would benefit from their improved weaponry.|$|R

5|$|Anderson {{appeared}} in a feature film Fighting The Still Life, directed by Matt Burns, who wrestled under the name Sick Nick Mondo. In late March 2008, Anderson began shooting a role for an action film in Puerto Rico. The film, titled , was released direct-to-DVD/Blu-ray Disc on January 6, 2009 to the sequel of the original 2001 film, Behind <b>Enemy</b> <b>Lines.</b> Anderson booked the role through WWE.|$|E
5|$|Corporal Frank Medina, USAAF, was an {{air crew}} member on a B-24 that was shot down over Italy. He was the only crewmember to evade capture. Medina {{explained}} that his ability to speak Spanish had allowed him to communicate with friendly Italians who helped him avoid capture for eight months behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the War Ministry's {{position}} {{immediately after}} the First World War, in 1932 {{it was reported that}} the German army was training pigeons for photography, and that the German pigeon cameras were capable of 200 exposures per flight. In the same year, the French claimed that they had developed film cameras for pigeons as well as a method for having the birds released behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> by trained dogs.|$|E

5000|$|In his Essay on Naval Tactics (1779, {{published}} 1790), Clerk expounded on {{the tactic}} known as [...] "cutting the line". This involved sailing into the <b>enemy's</b> <b>line</b> of ships, and attacking the rear ships of the <b>enemy's</b> <b>line</b> {{with the whole}} force of the attacking fleet. Horatio Nelson used several sentences from Clerk's work in his orders to the British fleet before the Battle of Trafalgar.|$|R

5|$|In May 1941, David Stirling, {{an injured}} British forces Commando in the North Africa theatre, {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} small airborne special forces units to operate behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines.</b> Whilst lobbying for support within Middle East Command it came to Clarke's attention, who offered his backing provided the force {{could also be used}} to help his own deception schemes.|$|E
5|$|Lansdale {{accompanied}} the Alsos Mission on Operation Harborage, which began on 22 April 1945. A special Allied force called T-Force went deep behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines,</b> seized 1.5 tons of uranium ingots, and captured {{a number of}} scientists, including Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Max von Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge and Otto Hahn.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{his unit}} in mid-March, he soon {{achieved}} his 50th victory. On 23 March, {{he was promoted}} to Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of 9./JG52 after his predecessor was shot down behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> and taken prisoner. The rains returned in April, bringing the muds of the rasputitsa. Aerial activity virtually stopped as both sides took the opportunity to regroup.|$|E

5|$|The Han Chinese also {{employed}} chemical warfare. In quelling {{a peasant}} revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows {{that were used}} to pump powdered lime (calcium oxide) at the rebels, who were dispersed. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> and disrupt their formations.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} also charged with {{gathering}} intelligence on the German nuclear weapon project. Through Operation Alsos, Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines,</b> where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet atomic spies successfully penetrated the program.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Zbyněk Zeman, broadcasting {{became the}} most important medium for propaganda throughout the war. Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> by air-ship. In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could be punished by death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant Strachan led the {{squadron}} through the <b>enemy</b> <b>line</b> of machine-gun posts and then, with the surviving men, {{led the charge}} on the German battery, killing seven of the gunners with his sword. When all the gunners were killed and the battery silenced, he rallied his men and fought his way back at night on foot through the <b>enemy's</b> <b>lines,</b> bringing all unwounded men safely in, together with 15 prisoners.|$|R

5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} a frontal {{assault on the}} Gustav Line stronghold at Monte Cassino, and VI Corps, under Major General John P. Lucas from 20 September, was assigned to Operation Shingle, detached from the 15th Army Group to land behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> at Anzio on 22 January 1944. For this mission, CCA (Combat Command A) of the 1st Armored Division {{was attached to the}} 45th Infantry Division. Landing on schedule, VI Corps surprised the Germans, but Major General Lucas's decision to consolidate the beachhead instead of attacking gave the Germans time to bring the LXXVI Panzer Corps forward to oppose the landings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|An Alsos {{team went}} to Stassfurt in the Soviet Occupation Zone and {{retrieved}} 11 tons of ore from WIFO. In April 1945, Pash, {{in command of}} a composite force known as T-Force, conducted Operation Harborage, a sweep behind <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> of the cities of Hechingen, Bisingen, and Haigerloch that were {{the heart of the}} German nuclear effort. T-Force captured the nuclear laboratories, documents, equipment and supplies, including heavy water and 1.5 tons of metallic uranium.|$|E

5|$|As the Brazilian {{army was}} ready for combat, Caxias sought to {{encircle}} Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. To aid the operation, he used observation balloons to gather information of the <b>enemy</b> <b>lines.</b> The combined Brazilian–Argentine–Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory to surround Humaitá. By 2 November, Humaitá was completely cut off from land reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining full control {{of the river and}} isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.|$|E
5|$|Buckner had {{difficulty}} {{traveling to the}} West, and it was early summer before he arrived. He assumed command of the District of West Louisiana on August 4. Shortly after Buckner arrived at Smith's headquarters in Shreveport, Louisiana, Smith began requesting a promotion for him. The promotion to lieutenant general came on September 20. Smith placed Buckner {{in charge of the}} critical but difficult task of selling the department's cotton through <b>enemy</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles Eaton {{was born}} on 21December 1895 in Lambeth, London, the son of William Walpole Eaton, a butcher, and his wife Grace. Schooled in Wandsworth, Charles worked in Battersea Town Council {{from the age of}} fourteen, before joining the London Regiment upon the {{outbreak}} of World WarI in August 1914. Attached to a bicycle company in the 24th Battalion of the 47th Division, he arrived at the Western Front in March 1915. He took part in trench bombing missions and attacks on <b>enemy</b> <b>lines</b> of communication, seeing action in the Battles of Aubers Ridge, Festubert, Loos, and the Somme.|$|E
