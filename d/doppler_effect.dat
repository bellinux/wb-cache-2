5|$|Many players {{prefer to}} play the Hammond through a {{rotating}} speaker cabinet known, after several name changes, as a Leslie speaker, after its inventor Donald J. Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a rotating horn over a stationary treble compression driver, and a rotating baffle beneath a stationary bass woofer. This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> created by the moving sound sources.|$|E
5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect,</b> to alter or modify sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special brake circuit {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect,</b> and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the subject began with the {{development}} in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect.</b> The effect is named after Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves, and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars {{could be attributed to}} their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's temperature, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 (Often {{shortened}} to GJ 3634) is a {{red dwarf}} star in the Hydra constellation. One planet has been discovered in its orbit, Gliese 3634 b. GJ 3634 is under half the mass {{and size of the}} Sun, and is estimated to be at least a billion years younger, and lies near to Earth, with a distance of 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years). It was targeted by astronomers during an over six-year survey of red dwarfs. The astronomers had recently changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits so they could narrow down candidates that transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from the Earth. The Super-Earth GJ 3634 b was the first planet discovered using this new strategy. The planet was confirmed using Doppler spectroscopy, or the observation and extrapolation of data from a recorded <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> in the star's light, but later observations found no transiting pattern. The planet was published by its discoverers on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect,</b> {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E

Unlike Radar, one cannot `send out' special signals of known frequencies into an image to measure velocities. It is the image itself that provides the (highly variable) frequency signals. However, what one can do is `look across' an image in various directions at known velocities, i. e. we can impose a known velocity onto an image and observe the changes in frequency information. From this one can deduce the velocities present in an image...|$|R

5|$|The Kepler team's {{scientists}} conducted follow-up {{observations to}} confirm or reject the planetary nature of the detected object. To do so, they used the Keck 1 telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii; the Shane and Hale telescopes in California; telescopes at the WIYN (including MMT) and Whipple observatories in Arizona; Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands; the Hobby-Eberly and Harlan J. Smith telescopes in Texas; and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Because Kepler-11g orbits its star at a far greater distance than the inner five planets, fewer transits were observed, and radial velocity (the observation of a <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect)</b> interactions could not be easily discerned. As {{with the discovery of}} Kepler-9d, the Kepler team ran the information through numerous models to see if Kepler-11g's light curve could fit the profile of some other object, including an eclipsing binary star in the background that may have contaminated the data. The probability that Kepler-11g is not a planet but instead a false positive was determined to be 0.18%, effectively confirming its existence.|$|E
5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> can show {{the direction of the}} blood flow and its relative velocity and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe to make a good acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> is {{the change}} in {{frequency}} or wavelength of a wave for a receiver and source in relative motion. For simplicity, we consider here two basic scenarios: (1) The motions of the source and/or receiver are exactly along the line connecting them (longitudinal <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect),</b> and (2) the motions are {{at right angles to}} the said line (transverse <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect).</b> We are ignoring scenarios where they move along intermediate angles.|$|E
30|$|With many {{desirable}} properties {{such as a}} high {{spectral efficiency}} and inherent resilience to the multipath dispersions of frequency-selective channels, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology shows attractive features to wireless radio applications[1]. OFDM relies {{on the assumption that}} the channel stays constant within at least one OFDM symbol period. When <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> due to temporal channel variation cannot be ignored, this assumption does not hold any more since the communication channel becomes time varying. The <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> corrupt the orthogonality among OFDM subcarriers by inducing non-negligible inter-carrier interference (ICI)[2], and can therefore severely deteriorate the system performance. For traditional terrestrial radio systems, compensation of ICI in channel equalization has widely been researched for narrowband systems. Due to the small relative signal bandwidth (actual bandwidth divided by the center frequency) of narrowband systems, the <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> can be modeled primarily by frequency shifts[3, 4], in which case it is reasonable to assume that each OFDM subcarrier experiences a statistically identical frequency offset[2]. Consequently, the effective channel matrix of a narrowband OFDM system in the presence of Doppler can be approximated as banded. Efficient equalization schemes for such a banded channel matrix have been studied in, e.g.,[5 â€“ 7].|$|R
30|$|Besides BEM based channel {{estimation}} {{can more}} accurately estimate fast time-varying channels than LS based channel estimation does, another reason that a channel estimator with higher accuracy results in improved performance in time-varying channels is illustrated as follows. In OFDM systems, <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> and instabilities of the {{transmitter and receiver}} carrier frequency oscillators will cause a loss of orthogonality between the subcarriers, resulting in ICI. The carrier frequency offset caused by <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> in time-varying channels is {{a fraction of the}} subcarrier spacing (i.e., in most practical cases the normalized Doppler frequency is less than 0.2). If we want to compensate this effect, we are dealing with the problem of fine-frequency adjustment. One effect of carrier frequency offset is the detrimental effect of a rotation of the subcarriers [23, 24]. This effect will be recognized by a channel estimator, which does not distinguish between phase offsets caused by the channel and those caused by a frequency offset. Thus, a channel equalizer appears also to have fine frequency synchronization capabilities. Therefore it can be inferred that a channel estimator with higher accuracy can more accurately compensate this rotation caused by <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> and thus will perform better in time-varying channels.|$|R
50|$|In {{communications}} systems, {{a communication}} channel may change with time. Coherence {{time is the}} time duration over which the channel impulse response {{is considered to be}} not varying. Such channel variation is much more significant in wireless communications systems, due to <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
25|$|If the transmitter's {{output is}} {{coherent}} (phase synchronized), {{there is another}} effect {{that can be used}} to make almost instant speed measurements (no memory is required), known as the <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect.</b> Most modern radar systems use this principle into Doppler radar and pulse-Doppler radar systems (weather radar, military radar). The <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> is only able to determine the relative speed of the target along the line of sight from the radar to the target. Any component of target velocity perpendicular to the line of sight cannot be determined by using the <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> alone, but it can be determined by tracking the target's azimuth over time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{peculiar}} {{motion of}} an observer {{with respect to}} the CMB rest frame induces a deflection in the arrival direction of the observed photons (also known as CMB aberration) and a Doppler shift in the measured photon frequencies. As a consequence, aberration and <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> induce non trivial correlations between the harmonic coefficients of the observed CMB temperature maps. In this paper we investigate whether these correlations generate a bias on Non-Gaussianity estimators fNL. We perform this analysis simulating a large number of temperature maps with Planck-like resolution (lmax = 2000) as different realizations of the same cosmological fiducial model (WMAP 7 yr). We then add to these maps aberration and <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> employing {{a modified version of the}} HEALPix code. We finally evaluate a generalization of the Komatsu, Spergel and Wandelt Non-Gaussianity estimator for all the simulated maps, both when peculiar velocity effects have been considered and when these phenomena have been neglected. Using the value v/c = 1. 23 Ã— 10 âˆ’ 3 for our peculiar velocity, we found that the aberration/Doppler induced Non-Gaussian signal is at most of about half of the cosmic variance Ïƒ for fNL both in a full-sky and in a cut-sky experimental configuration, for local, equilateral and orthogonal estimators. We conclude therefore that when estimating fNL it is safe to ignore aberration and <b>Doppler</b> <b>effects</b> if the primordial map is already Gaussian. More work is necessary however to assess whether a map which contains Non-Gaussianity can be significantly distorted by a peculiar velocity...|$|R
