40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} {{investigates the}} level and degradation of oil at ten selected Gulf saltmarsh sites months after the 2010 BP Macondo- 1 well oil spill. Very high levels (10 − 28 %) of organic carbon within the heavily oiled sediments are clearly distinguished from those in pristine sediments (< 3 %). Dissolved organic carbon in contaminated pore-waters, ranging up to hundreds of mg/kg, are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those at pristine sites. Heavily oiled sediments are characterized by very high sulfide concentrations (up to 80 mg/kg) and abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria. Geochemical biomarkers and stable carbon isotope analyses fingerprint the presence of oils in sediments. Ratios of selected parameters calculated from the gas chromatograph spectra are in a remarkable narrow range among spilled oils and initial BP crude. At oiled sites dominated by C 4 plants, δ 13 C values of sediments (− 20. 8 ± 2. 0 ‰) have been shifted significantly lower compared to marsh plants (− 14. 8 ± 0. 6 ‰) due to the inflow of isotopically lighter oil (− 27 ± 0. 2 ‰).

Dynamic viscoelastic {{properties of}} soybean protein isolate gels were determined {{as a function of}} the volume fraction of oil droplets stabilised by the same protein, both in absence and presence of 0. 2 M sodium chloride (NaCl). The storage and loss moduli were higher if NaCl was added. For both conditions, they increased with increasing oil volume fraction during the heating as well as the cooling stage. Furthermore, gel formation started at a lower temperature with increasing oil volume fraction. The increase in the moduli with increasing volume fraction of oil droplets was stronger than predicted by Van der Poels theory for a simple filled gel containing single interacting stiff emulsion droplets. This effect was attributed to aggregation of the emulsion droplets. Fracture properties of gels with different oil volume fraction and oil droplet size were determined at pH 7. 0, in the presence of 0. 2 M NaCl, by a uniaxial compression test.

The droplet size distribution and structural details of the emulsion samples were obtained using cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) and optical microscopy. For rheological characterisation, amplitude sweep tests performed on HIPE samples with a high mass fraction of dispersed phase (93. 5 wt%) show that the strain behavior, especially the yield strain (epsilon(y)) and crossover strain (epsilon(c)), are almost independent of the droplet size and polydispersity. However, emulsions with smaller droplets have higher yield stress (tau(y)) and storage moduli (G') values; explanations for these observations, based on the physical properties of the systems are suggested. Furthermore, it is observed that, for constant mass <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and aqueous phases, the strain behavior is also independent of the salt concentration in the dispersed phase.

For this purpose, whey protein films with the addition of 0, 1, 2 and 3 % of rapeseed oil, and glycerol as a plasticizer were obtained by the casting method. Film-forming emulsions were evaluated and compared using light scattering granulometry. The Sauter mean diameters (d 32) of lipid droplets in film-forming solutions showed an increasing trend when increasing the oil volume fractions. The inclusion of rapeseed oil enhanced the hydrophobic character of whey protein films, reducing moisture content and film solubility in water. All emulsified films showed high lightness (L*≈ 90). Parameter a* decreased and parameter b* and total colour difference (ΔE) increased with the increase of the volume <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> These results were consistent with visual observations; control films were transparent and those containing oil opaque.

Acute and chronic toxicity data for marine organisms exposed to water-soluble <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> products were obtained from published materials and the author's investigations. Out of 310 data reviewed and sorted, 82 data for the test temperatures of 20 ± 328 C were selected and () analyzed. The genus mean acute values GMAV were calculated for 15 animal genera belonging to the phyla Chordata, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Annelida. Plant values were obtained for six species of the algae classes Diatom, Chlorophyta and Dinophyta. The GMAVs ranged from 0. 2 to 13. 1 mg/L TPH. The considerable variability of data was attributed to differences in toxicity test designs. The EC 50 values were adjusted by taking into account the fact that average test concentrations drop during courses of static-renewal and static toxicity tests. These adjustments resulted in a GMAV range of 0. 2 ± 5. 2 mg/L with acceptable intergeneric variability.

40|$|In {{the wake}} the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, {{understanding}} the transformation and long-term fate {{of oil and}} chemical dispersants in the coastal and marine environments has become a primary concern. This project aims to expand the analytical window of oil spill analysis by incorporating methods such as FT-IR and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) into the characterization of weathered oil and dispersant. The fate of the chemical dispersant, Corexit 9500, in deep-sea environments remains poorly understood. To this end, a protocol was successfully developed to extract dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), the chief surfactant in Corexit 9500, from deep-sea sediments and quantify it via LC/MS/MS. Weathering processes, including evaporation, dissolution, photo-oxidation and biodegradation, can greatly alter the chemical composition of crude oil and subsequently make the analysis of weathered oil challenging via traditional analytical techniques. To probe the composition of weathered oil in the environment, sand patties and rock scrapings, collected from beaches along the Gulf of Mexico, were separated via silica gel chromatography and were individually examined via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). By characterizing discrete functional groups, FT-IR illuminates the heterogeneity of weathered oil persisting in marine and coastal environments. Results from FT-IR indicate that the most noticeable differences in oil composition are observed in the polar oil fractions, where there is increased presence of hydroxyl groups.

Fish were contaminated via the water column (i) by chemically dispersed oil, simulating dispersant application, (ii) by dispersant, as an internal control of chemical dispersion, (iii) by mechanically dispersed oil, simulating only the effect of natural mixing processes, without dispersant application, and (iv) by the water soluble <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> simulating the toxicity <b>of</b> an <b>oil</b> slick before recovery. Bioconcentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and mortality were evaluated, and related to both total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in seawater. Fish exposed to chemically dispersed oil showed both a higher bioconcentration of PAH and a higher mortality than fish exposed to either the water soluble <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> or the mechanically dispersed oil. These results suggest that (i) dispersion is a more toxic response technique than containment and recovery <b>of</b> the <b>oil</b> slick; (ii) in turbulent mixing areas, dispersant application increases the environmental risk for aquatic organisms living in the water column. Even if the experimental aspects of this study compel us to be cautious with our conclusions, responders could consider these results to establish a framework for dispersant use in nearshore areas...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Page 145 left {{intentionally}} blank. The {{increase of}} diesel fuels {{and natural gas}} has increased the energy cost <b>of</b> the mint <b>oil</b> extraction industry in the Willamette Valley. In this study the energy evaluation of a distillation facility in Oregon is considered. Solvent free microwave extraction <b>of</b> peppermint <b>oil</b> is introduced as a new technique to obtain the essential oils. Technology from approximately fifty years ago was the common characteristic of all the farms visited {{at the beginning of}} this research. Three sets of data from the Setniker farm were collected; information from all the possible sample points were recorded to then evaluate the energy cost <b>of</b> pound <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> extracted. It was found that on average the energy usage cost is 1. 26 per pound <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> obtained; the maximum <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> recovered was reported to be 20...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} for the speed of {{propagation}} of kinematic waves in vertical upward, bubbly oil-in-water flows has been proposed. The new kinematic wave model {{has been used in}} conjunction with (i) appropriate values for the `distribution parameter' C 0, the single-droplet terminal rise velocity vt 0 and an exponent n, obtained from a drift velocity model; (ii) a statistical relationship for the quantity αUh(dC 0 /dα); and (iii) measurements of a cross correlation velocity Ucc and the volume <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> α to make predictions of the superficial velocities of the mixture, the oil and the water in vertical upward, bubbly oil-in-water flows. The systematic errors in these predicted values of the superficial velocities of the mixture, the oil and the water were 0. 16, - 0. 04 and 0. 04 %, respectively. The kinematic wave model can thus be used in conjunction with a cross correlation flow meter for accurate measurement of flow rates in vertical oil wells. It was inferred from the kinematic wave model and the experimental data that, for low values <b>of</b> the volume <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> α, the distribution parameter C 0 decreases rapidly with increasing α. At higher values of α the decrease in the value of C 0 with increasing α is less marked. This result is consistent with the physical explanation that, at low values <b>of</b> α, the <b>oil</b> droplets tend to preferentially accumulate in the relatively fast moving regions of the flow. As α increases the oil droplets become more uniformly distributed amongst the faster and slower moving regions of the flow...|$|R
