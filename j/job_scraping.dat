50|$|Moore {{was born}} in Meridian, Oklahoma. When her father {{got a job in}} the meatpacking {{industry}} in 1924, her family moved to Omaha, Nebraska. She first worked in a packing plant at age 15, though she claimed to be 16 to get a <b>job</b> <b>scraping</b> fat off animals' hindquarters.|$|E
50|$|PHP is a {{commonly}} used language to write scraping scripts for websites or backend services, it has powerful capabilities built in (DOM parsers, libcURL) but its memory usage is typical 10 times the factor of a similar C/C++ code. Ruby on Rails as well as Python are also frequently used to automated <b>scraping</b> <b>jobs.</b> For highest performance C++ DOM parsers should be considered.|$|R
25|$|By 2004, Marinovich was {{broke and}} again {{living on the}} Balboa Peninsula; {{when he was arrested}} in 2004 for skateboarding in a {{prohibited}} area, police found methamphetamines and syringes on him. In May 2005, he was charged with violating probation, but avoided jail by entering an inpatient treatment program. For the next year, Marinovich {{was in and out of}} rehab facilities. He was again arrested on August 26, 2007 for possession of drugs and resisting arrest. He was offered a suspended sentence in exchange for regular drug testing, therapy, and meetings with a probation officer. Marinovich began working several part-time <b>jobs,</b> including <b>scraping</b> barnacles off of boats, leading weekly group meetings at a rehab center, painting murals in residential homes, and as a private quarterback coach.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, due to {{the time}} spent with Bobby, the long-lost {{memories}} of Leon slowly began resurfacing and Scaler discovers that Leon is in fact his father. Years prior, he was a scientist, and while performing an experiment with his invention, the portal compass, he was dragged accidentally by his device into Looger's dimension through a portal, and immediately imprisoned by Looger for years. The tortures inflicted on him by Looger in attempt to make him reveal more about his technology left Leon an amnesiac, stripping him from most of his memories. Only now is he able to escape the lonely island, where he had met his son. So Leon never, as Bobby thought, abandoned him and his mother. Leon is overjoyed to not only finally remember who he is, but also to see his son again, who has become a great hero. However, Scaler struggles a little to accept the truth and accept a father who for so long time he have thought being [...] "a loser freak," [...] who forced his mother to take two <b>jobs</b> to <b>scrape</b> by. In the end, however, he forgives his father, as after all it wasn't his fault at all.|$|R
60|$|I led {{him several}} yards {{further from the}} mouth of the cave and pointed out the exact spot where I said I had picked it up amongst some quarry debris. Then {{followed}} a most learned discussion, for it appeared that this was a flint instrument of the rarest and most valuable type, one that Noah might have used, or <b>Job</b> might have <b>scraped</b> himself with, and the question was how the dickens had it come among that quarry debris. In the end we left the problem undecided, and having presented the article to Dr. Rodd, a gift for which he thanked me with real warmth, I returned to the house filled with the glow that rewards one who has made a valuable discovery.|$|R
