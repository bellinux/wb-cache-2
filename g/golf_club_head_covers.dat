40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} widen a sweet {{area of a}} <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> <b>head,</b> it has been {{attempted}} to increase a coefficient of restitution in the peripheral portion of a face with a variable thickness distribution design. To do so, both the restitution and the strength performance are required, and technology for the estimation of the <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> <b>head</b> strength is necessary. In these investigations, principal strains of the face during the impact were compared between finite element analysis and experiments. As a result, following two conclusions were made. First, the finite element size of 0. 4 mm is suitable to obtain the principal strains during the impact. Second, the sequential waveforms of the maximum principal strains show a similar tendency between analytical and experimental results. Also, following two points were considered. First, {{the magnitude of the}} principal strain of the face in the simulation was considered to show much better agreement with that of experiment when the contact times between simulation and experiment coincide with each other through the ball material modeling. Second, the bending of the face in the vertical direction was considered to be a major influential factor of the maximum principal strain...|$|R

The result of this is that the energy will that was not absorbed by the club threw deformation will remain in the golf ball. This extra energy will be transformed into two forms of kinetic energy.

We have integrated it into a fully automated system that requires neither user intervention nor the use of instrumented <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> or clothing, and that is usable in a natural environment with a potentially cluttered background. Our algorithm robustly fits a global swing trajectory model to club location hypotheses obtained from single frames.

40|$|The {{game of golf}} is {{enjoyed by}} {{a large number of}} people, from all over the world. According to the rules of golf, each player has to choose from a maximum of 14 clubs, before playing a shot. This makes the number of pieces of {{equipment}} required much higher than in any other ball related sport. This research project focuses on the design of a composite <b>golf</b> driver <b>club</b> <b>head,</b> the <b>club</b> <b>head</b> being the part of the <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> that strikes the ball. The driver <b>club</b> <b>head</b> is selected when a golfer wants to achieve a long distance shot. Modern driver heads are manufactured from metal, either steel or titanium and their performance can be defined as the accuracy and length of a shot. An investigation is made to compare the performance of composite and metal <b>club</b> <b>heads.</b> The project included a study of an existing composite golf driver and the design of a new driver. The new shape was analyzed using non linear finite element software (Ls Dyna), and some overall design in composites and metals were done. It was found that the front face structural properties and geometry were critical to club’s performances. So initially the front face only was considered (smaller model) using Ls Dyna and Nastran, before focusing again on the complete <b>club</b> <b>head.</b> Once the best design was done an attempt to manufacture a prototype was made {{in order to try to}} validate the computer model. Experiments revealed that the new driver shape had a higher moment of inertia, which improves the accuracy of a shot, than the existing Callaway C 4 club, for the same mass. The ball speed after impact for the new driver was 0. 2 m/s less, when using a high strength carbon epoxy composite material compared to a titanium one. For this reason, it is concluded that it is possible to achieve similar overall performances with composite and titanium heads. It is anticipated that with more research into stronger fibres, 3 D fabrics and nano-reinforcements, a carbon composite <b>club</b> <b>head</b> will offer a greater overall performance than metallic <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> <b>heads...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} and repeatable method for meshing <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> <b>heads</b> using finite elements in TrueGrid® was developed. Using solid brick elements through {{the thickness of}} the <b>club</b> <b>head</b> instead of shell elements better represents the many thickness variations throughout each section of a <b>club</b> <b>head.</b> This method also results in a high quality mesh {{at the center of the}} <b>club</b> <b>head</b> sections while still maintaining high quality at the edges. A simulation procedure was also developed to predict the acoustic pressure at a designated point in an acoustic medium of a <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> and ball impact using the BEM and Rayleigh methods in LS-DYNA®. The simulation time and computing power required for the impact are modest, while the acoustic simulation time and computing power are much greater. The Rayleigh method provides an alternative which can greatly reduce these requirements. The simulation of sound produced from the ball and a USGA COR plate, generic driver, and hybrid impact was accomplished with reasonable results. Experimental testing was performed using a USGA plate to validate the plate result. A simple tap test and an air cannon test were performed to record the acoustic response with a microphone. A Fast Fourier Transform was performed to obtain the frequency response. These two tests correlated with each other, indicating that air cannon procedures could be negated in favor of a much simpler tap test during prototype testing for acoustics. The simulation frequency responses showed similar results to the experimental tests, demonstrating that the procedure developed in this project can be a viable and effective method for determining the acoustic response of the <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> and ball impact...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} {{a method to}} measure the three-dimensional orientation of a <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> <b>head</b> with one camera using the Newton-Raphson method which requires less calculation time. In this method, the orientation is calculated from {{the relation between the}} coordinates of markers on the head in the coordinate system of the <b>club</b> <b>head</b> and the coordinates of markers on the photo. Golfers hit balls with Irons whose club lie angles were 62 ° and 60 ° or 64 °, and we took photos of the <b>club</b> <b>head</b> hitting balls. We calculated impact lie angles and face angles of the <b>club</b> <b>head</b> using this method and also measured the ball flight with a flight measuring machine. The results are as follows: (1) When the golfers used 64 ° (60 °) clubs, all of them hit balls at larger (smaller) impact lie angles than when using 62 ° clubs. (2) Most of the landing points of the ball when the golfers used 64 ° (60 °) clubs were more to the left (right) than 62 ° clubs. However, the reverse was the case with some golfers, because they changed face angles. In fitting, we need to find advanced methods to change lateral deviation adding on changing club lie angle...|$|R

Results from experiments, including fatigue testing in air and sodium chloride, fatigue under potential control, and static load testing in sodium chloride, suggest that quite distinct mechanisms of fatigue-crack propagation are active in air and sodium chloride solution. Specifically, the fatigue-crack growth rates observed under static and cyclic loading in sodium chloride likely depend on an anodic process, which results in a brittle mode of failure. Conversely in air, fatigue-crack propagation is associated with alternating blunting and re-sharpening of the crack tip, as evidenced by the presence of classic fatigue striations...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{technique of}} titanium production is via the Kroll process which involves chlorination of TiO2 ore {{in the presence}} of carbon and reacting the resulting TiCl4 with magnesium to produce titanium sponge. These processes take place at temperatures as high as 1040 °C. The sponge particle range in size from 45 to 180 µm, with particles ~150 µm termed ‘sponge fines’. These fines are irregularly shaped and porous with a sponge-like morphology. The fines are then blended with alloy additions; cold compacted into a green compact at up to 415 MPa then vacuum sintered at 1260 °C to produce a 99.5% dense component. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) can further increase the density of these parts and produce components more economically than cast or wrought parts, but the porosity present in the material degrades fatigue and fracture properties. The BE approach has been used to produce valves for the Toyota Altezza, <b>golf</b> <b>club</b> <b>heads</b> and softball bats. More recently, close to 100% dense Ti Grade 5 parts has been achieved using a hydrided powder along with 60:40 Al:V master alloy.
