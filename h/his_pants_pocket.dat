One friend remembered that he kept holes in <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>pockets</b> so that he could inconspicuously loosen a strap on his prosthetic leg in order to ease his discomfort. The pain in his leg became more pronounced later in life, including bothering him on film shoots in ways noticeable to others and exacerbating his usually very slight limp.|$|R

The woman pulls food items out of her purse, while the man pulls them out of <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>pocket,</b> and the items they pull out before pulling out a Kit-Kat bar were items that, in real life, couldn't easily be stored there (i.e. the woman pulls a fully intact birthday cake out of her purse, while the man pulls a large hamburger out of his pocket).|$|E

50|$|Chase {{granted a}} series of {{interviews}} with Robert Ressler, during which he spoke of his fears of Nazis and UFOs, claiming that although he had killed, it was not his fault; he had been forced to kill to keep himself alive, which he believed any person would do. He asked Ressler to give him access to a radar gun, with which he could apprehend the Nazi UFOs, so that the Nazis could stand trial for the murders. He also handed Ressler a large amount of macaroni and cheese, which he had been hoarding in <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>pockets,</b> believing that the prison officials were in league with the Nazis and attempting to kill him with poisoned food.|$|R

5000|$|In 2008, Simone, while off-duty, {{entered a}} bank to deposit a check. Realizing a robbery was in progress, {{he ordered the}} suspect, Robert Hackworth, to freeze. Hackworth, who had led the tellers {{to believe that he}} had a gun in his pocket, ran from the bank towards his getaway truck, which he had stolen earlier that day from an auto dealership. As Simone chased Hackworth, a passing driver offered him a ride in her jeep. The driver stopped her vehicle {{directly}} in front of Hackworth's truck. Simone, only a few feet from Hackworth, ordered him to put his hands up. Hackworth ignored his order and instead reached towards his pocket. Simone fired once, fatally striking Hackworth in the side. No gun was found in Hackworth's truck. Investigators theorized that Hackworth was reaching towards <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>pocket</b> to remove a bundle of stolen money that contained a dye pack. They dye pack had exploded and was likely burning his skin.|$|E
50|$|To Monk and Natalie's surprise, {{the dead}} man is Martin Kamakele, {{identified}} from a wallet in <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>pocket.</b> The medical examiner concludes that someone viciously beat him {{to death with a}} shovel. Monk insists that Kamakele's death has to be connected to Helen Gruber's death somehow, given the MOs are similar, but he also finds some clues that suggest one distinct difference between the two murders: Helen's death was very well planned, but Kamakele's murder was not premeditated and was committed either in the heat of a fight or in a fit of rage. For one thing, the roasted pig that the body was buried above had been buried for nine hours, and the body was buried just over it, suggesting that Kamakele was killed sometime that afternoon in broad daylight. This indicates that the killer only tried to delay the body's discovery as opposed to dispose of it. Natalie considers it eerie that both murders were committed in broad daylight and both victims were killed with objects that the killer happened to find lying nearby.|$|E

50|$|To {{entertain}} Wilbur, Bosko sings {{about his}} love for Honey (which is repeatedly interrupted by Bruno), to the child's chagrin. After the dog leaves, Bosko picks up {{a book about the}} Knights of the Round Table, which he shows to Wilbur, attracting his attention. When Wilbur points to a picture of Sir Galahad, Bosko claims that he was a courageous knight himself, which Wilbur does not believe.

50|$|Chalmers and Skinner try {{to flee to}} Bolivia, but are {{stopped by}} Bart, who has Skinner's car key and forces them to explain everything. Years earlier, the school had {{received}} a large grant {{for the purpose of}} improving its classrooms. Skinner cashed the check but left the money in <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> <b>pocket,</b> and his mother inadvertently destroyed it when she washed his laundry. With the help of Groundskeeper Willie, Chalmers and Skinner built a fake classroom and photographed it to fool the government, using rented mannequins to pose as students. They put the mannequins on Bus 23 to have Otto return them before having to be charged for the extra day, but the ice bridge gave out and the bus went into the lake. Chalmers and Skinner apologize to Otto for letting him believe he killed a busload of students, and all is forgiven. No further mention of the rental money is made, though Skinner says that they anticipated the wedding cakes but not Maggie locking herself in the car, and Chalmers chastises him for not anticipating her birth.|$|E
5000|$|The FBI leased three {{adjacent}} rooms in Times Square. One room {{would serve as}} double-agent Sebold's office from which he would receive intelligence reports from Abwehr spies that would later be censored by the FBI and partially transmitted by Sebold via coded short-wave radio to Germany. The other two rooms were used by German-speaking FBI agents who would listen in with headphones and record the meetings using a motion picture camera behind a two-way wall mirror. The first time Duquesne arrived at Sebold's office, he surprised the FBI agents by conducting {{an examination of the}} office, opening chests, looking in corners and around mirrors, and pointedly asking Sebold, [...] "where are the mics?" [...] Once Duquesne believed he was safe, he raised his pants leg and removed documents from his sock, such as: a sketch and photo of the M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, a drawing of a new light tank design, a photo of a U.S. Navy Mosquito boat, a photo of a grenade launcher, and reports on U.S. tanks he had observed at bases at West Point and in Tennessee.

Gabrielle’s lawyer, Mr. Katzburg, is happy, but Gabrielle knows that Carlos never gives up, so he’s up to something. She is suspicious when Carlos comes home {{with a stack of}} papers and locks them in a drawer. While he is in the shower, Gabrielle sneaks into the bathroom, takes the key to the drawer out of <b>his</b> <b>pant</b> <b>pocket,</b> opens the drawer, and finds out that they are business papers. Carlos is getting a new job, and he’s being paid $2 million. Gabrielle asks Mr. Katzburg if she can get some of that money in the divorce, and he says only if he has the money when they get divorced. Gabrielle decides to stall their divorce and successfully seduces Carlos. She tells him that they should re-consider getting a divorce. Of course, she only wants to stall the divorce for Carlos’s money. Carlos laughs and tells her the papers were fake. It was an experiment to see if Gabrielle would seduce him because she wanted the money. He says it’s a payback for her sleeping with that one other guy. Gabrielle is infuriated, and subconsciously pushes him out of the window. She looks down and sees several cuts on his body. She panics and calls 9-1-1. She looks out the window again, and Carlos is gone. She hears the door open. When she goes to the front door, Carlos is seething, and he tells her that because of this, there is a zero percent chance that they will get back together.|$|R
