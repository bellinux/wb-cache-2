25|$|Hearing loss in divers is a known {{problem and}} has many factors, {{one of which}} is noise exposure. Open circuit divers produce a high level of {{breathing}} noise by airflow through the regulator during inhalation and bubble noise during exhalation. The primary noise source is exhaust bubbles which can exceed 95dB(A). Voice communications and free-flow <b>demisting</b> push these levels above 100db(A), as communications need to be about 15dB above background to be intelligible. Free-flow helmet noise levels are generally higher than demand systems, and are comparable with <b>demisting</b> noise levels. Rebreather and reclaim systems are significantly quieter, as there is no bubble noise most of the time. The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood provides substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet sensitivity is similar to in surface air, as hearing sensitivity is not significantly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure.|$|E
25|$|The Passarell process uses reduced {{atmospheric}} pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination. The pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor. The compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced {{pressure in the}} evaporation chamber. The compressor centrifuges the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister (removing residual impurities) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber. The compression of the vapor increases its temperature. The heat is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes, vaporizing {{the water in the}} tubes. Water vapor condenses {{on the outside of the}} tubes as product water. By combining several physical processes, Passarell enables most of the system's energy to be recycled through its evaporation, <b>demisting,</b> vapor compression, condensation, and water movement processes.|$|E

40|$|When a {{spectacle}} wearer enters a warm environment {{after having been}} in a cooler one, his/her spectacles may ‘mist up’ due {{to the formation of}} condensation on the lens surface. Both the physical properties of the spectacle lens and a number of environmental factors determine how long spectacles take to <b>demist.</b> The relative misting performance of crown glass, CR 39 and polycarbonate spectacle lenses were assessed using a novel technique. A box in which the environmental conditions could be controlled was used first to cool the lens and then to warm it. This change in temperature caused condensation to form on the lens surface. By projecting the image of a grating through the lens onto a linear array of photodiodes it was possible to measure the contrast transmission of the spectacle lens as it demister. Each lens type misted and <b>demisted</b> in a characteristic way. The polycarbonate lens <b>demisted</b> more rapidly than the CR 39 lens which, in turn, <b>demisted</b> more rapidly than the glass lens. This indicates that polycarbonate spectacle lenses should be used in conditions where the adverse effects of spectacle misting need to be minimised...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ambulance crews {{usually have}} just one {{opportunity}} to convey information about their patients to emergency department (ED) personnel. ED staff receiving patients from ambulance crews will naturally be focussed on their own initial assessment of the patient, which often distracts them from listening carefully to the ambulance crew’s handover. Important information may be lost after the ambulance crew leaves. Methods: Current handover practice was evaluated in two large EDs. A structured <b>DeMIST</b> format for verbal handover of pre-hospital information from the ambulance crew to receiving ED staff was then introduced {{into one of the}} departments. The number of packets of information in each verbal handover and the accuracy of ED staff’s recall was assessed. Results: 56. 6 % of the information given at verbal handover by the ambulance crews was accurately retained by ED staff before the introduction of <b>DeMIST.</b> Only 49. 2 % of the information given at verbal handover by the ambulance crews in the <b>DeMIST</b> format was accurately retained by ED staff. Discussion: Communications training, clinical team leadership and team discipline must support the communication process between ambulance crews and the ED team to ensure that important pre-hospital information is not lost or misinterpreted. Electronic patient report forms are currently under development and may provide a partial solution for the transfer of accurate pre-hospital information to ED staff...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{standardize}} patient handover in {{the chain}} of emergency care a handover guideline was developed. The main guideline recommendation is to use the <b>DeMIST</b> model (Demographics, Mechanism of Injury/illness, Injury/Illness, Signs, Treatment given) to structure pre-hospital notification and handover. To benefit from the new guideline, guideline adherence is necessary. As adherence to guidelines in emergency care settings is variable, {{there is a need to}} systematically implement the new guideline. For implementation of the guideline we developed a e-learning program tailored to influencing factors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this e-learning program to improve emergency care professionals' adherence to the handover guideline during pre-hospital notification and handover {{in the chain}} of emergency medical service (EMS), emergency medical dispatch (EMD), and emergency department (ED). METHODS: A prospective pre-test post-test study was conducted. The intervention was a tailored e-learning program that was offered to ambulance crew and emergency medical dispatchers (n= 88). Data on adherence included pre-hospital notifications and handovers and were collected through observations and audiotapes before and after the e-learning program. Data were analyzed using X(2) -tests and t-tests. RESULTS: In total, 78 / 88 (88. 6 %) professionals followed the e-learning program. During pre- and post-test, 146 and 169 handovers were observed respectively. After the e-learning program, no significant difference in the number of handovers with the <b>DeMIST</b> model (77. 9 % vs. 73. 1 %, p=. 319) and the number of handovers with the correct sequence of the <b>DeMIST</b> model (69. 9 % vs. 70. 5 %, p=. 159) existed. During the handover, the number of questions by ED staff and interruptions significantly increased from 49. 0 % to 68. 9 % and from 15. 2 % to 52. 7 % respectively (both p=. 000). Most handovers were performed after patient transfer, this did not change after the intervention (p=. 167). The number of handovers where information was documented during handover slightly increased from 26. 9 % to 29. 3 % (p=. 632). CONCLUSIONS: The tailored e-learning program did not improve adherence to a handover guideline {{in the chain of}} emergency care. Results show a relatively high baseline adherence rate to usage and correct sequence of the <b>DeMIST</b> model. Improvements in the handover process can be made on the documentation of information during handover, the number of interruptions and questions, and the handover moment...|$|R

Further distribution and use {{of this paper is}} not permitted without permission from SAE. This paper was part of the SAE 2000 World Congress, Detroit, Michigan, March 6 th– 9 th 2000. The established method of clearing a misted car windshield or of maintaining a clear view under misting conditions is through the application of an air supply via jet outlets in the instrument panel. The ability of such arrangements to perform adequately {{is a function of the}} prevailing environmental conditions, the vehicle speed, the condition of the <b>demist</b> air source and the geometry and arrangement of the jet outlets. This paper presents experimental data obtained in a purpose built environmental chamber designed to accommodate simple rectangular jets impinging on a misted glass surface. The facility consists of three conditioned air sources applied to a test chamber designed to represent the external, internal and <b>demist</b> air flows. Mist conditions on the glass surface are determined using a novel technique employing a CCD camera acquiring grey scale images which are digitally analysed to generate mist detection, grading and clearing contour data. The test facility and mist analysis techniques are described. Transient jet performance is investigated in a parametric study that addresses the effects of jet aspect ratio, offset, impingement angle and mean volume flow rate on clearing performance. Results are presented in terms of parameters derived from the images recorded during the clearing process. These parameters include rate of clearing terms, breakthrough time and location of clearing centre relative to geometric impingement point. Steady state performance is presented for a number of representative geometries by examining the size of the clear area for a range of interior humidity levels...|$|R

40|$|As a {{participant}} in the three-nation partnership for development of the ANBCP-S for use in Helicopters, Transport Aircraft and Fast Jet, the Royal Netherlands Airforce (RNLAF) picked up the challenge to design a Filter- Blower-Unit (FBU). Major Command (MajCom) of the RNLAF set priority to develop a system for Helicopter use first. After that the same system is to be used in Transport Aircraft and Fast Jet. The FBU is supposed to provide clean air for breathing, body and head cooling and <b>demist</b> of the vision system. Because of special knowledge required to set specifications for this FBU, the RNLAF contracted a Dutch Research Institute, TNO. TNO has the capability to do all research and testing to set all requirements. The RNLAF asked TNO to quantify the amount of air needed for breathing, body and head cooling and <b>demist</b> of the vision system. Some of the basic requirements set by MajCom are: - The system must be Man mounted, - Battery powered; - Filtersytem must be based on the NATO canister system; - It has to operate continues, without major changes, for a period of eight hours. Several trails were performed to quantify the acquired amount of air in terms of oxygen consumption, ventilation and corresponding cooling rates. During those trails it became clear {{there is a big difference}} in consumption between a Pilot and a Loadmaster. Therefore our primary goal is to develop a system which is suitable for the most difficult crewmember to equip. To the opinion of TNO and RNLAF that is the Loadmaster.

40|$|Objective: Optical {{coherence}} tomography [OCT) {{is a new}} {{imaging technique}} that uses light to image dental structures intert'erometrically. OCT creates cross-sectional images that have potential diagnostic value for dental applications. When used in epidemiological studies, OCT offers a safe, non-invasive technique to discriminate occlusal sealants and composite restorations. This paper summarizes a study in which dentists were asked to interpret and discriminate between OCT images. Methodology: Twenty-one dentists were asked to interpret OCT images of nine extracted premolars that were either not restored, contained an occlusal sealant or were restored with a composite restoration. Results: Although the d e n t i s t were previously unfamiliar with OCTimages, they adapted well and fell confident in their diagnoses using this new technology. The sensitivity of OCT to discriminate composite and sealants was > 0, 92, while the specificiiv of discrimination was > 0. 94, The capacity of OCT to discriminate sealants from non-rcstored occlusal surfaces was. slightly less (sensitivity 0, 88 : specificity 0. 86), but still within a clinically acceptable level.

50|$|The Morris Major and Austin Lancer Series II models, {{designated}} DO1115, {{were released}} in 1959. The Series I Morris Major / Austin Lancer had sold reasonably well and was profitable to build due to greatly offset tooling costs and {{extensive use of}} shared components. However, BMC Australia quickly invested in the thoroughly re-engineered and subsequently better received Series II. Thenceforth, the Australian cars became quite distinctive from their siblings. Outwardly, the cars were now longer by 9 in, including an extended wheelbase, tailfins and new front sheet metal. Series II's styling {{seems to have been}} more inspired by American ideas and, to many eyes, this gave the cars a more handsome appearance. Several updates to the original design were introduced, many of these changes intended to make the cars more suitable for the tough Australian driving conditions, and to bolster its competitiveness with top selling rivals such as Holden and Volkswagen. The suspension was strengthened, extra reinforcement of the chassis was added and the interiors were given a front bench seat in place of buckets, ventilation and <b>demisting</b> ducts and a new instrument cluster. Also, the rear axle (a Morris Minor unit which in hindsight was not well suited to the more powerful engine) had acquired an unfortunate reputation for weakness in Series I. The axle and differential were improved though, sadly, this early failing had already damaged the car's image and that of its maker. Series II's engine retained its single SU HS2 carburettor/SU fuel pump and received a modified oil sump to afford greater ground clearance. The Series II received highly favourable reviews from the motoring press of the time with its sweeping array of detail improvements, enhanced handling characteristics and attractive price earning much praise.|$|E

Compared to conventional cyclones the RPS is an order of magnitude smaller in size at equal separation performance, while at equal size it separates particles ten times smaller.

The models are assessed through comparison with comprehensive experimental data on removal efficiencies and pressure drops. For the range of droplets sizes of interest for <b>demisting</b> operation, the turbulent dispersion model is found to play {{a fundamental role in}} determining the droplet motion. However, classical dispersion models, as the eddy interaction model, often available in commercial CFD codes are unsuited, resulting in errors on the removal efficiency larger than 100 % for the investigated cases. Therefore, a simple procedure for the modification of the code in order to replace the dispersion model with alternative models by using the existing Lagrangian algorithm is proposed. Predictions with a varied eddy interaction model are observed to match closely experimental data on removal efficiencies. An analysis of the turbulence models is also carried out, those for low Re resulting in a better description of the gas flow field and droplet motion. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model and technique are described {{to simulate the}} turbulent fluid flow over and heat transfer through a model of vehicle windshield defrosting and <b>demisting</b> systems. The simplified geometry and {{the dimensions of the}} {{numerical model}} are representative of vehicle system with accurate locations of the nozzles and outlet vents, including cabin features such as seating and the rear parcel shelf. The three-dimensional geometry of the numerical model is created in Auto Cad (Release 14). Surface meshing and a computational mesh of 750, 000 (tetrahedral) fluid cells is generated in the pre-processor of the CFD software used for the simulation of the fluid flow. Turbulence is modelled by using the k-e turbulence equations together with the wall function method. This decision was made after comparing the k-e model's performance with that of lower order models, and after considering the increased computer time requirements and decreased stability of more complex models, such as the Reynolds stress model. The numerical results of the study are very encouraging and compare favourably with measurements obtained from the actual vehicle by Thermograph and Hot Bulb probe techniques.

40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure for the simulation of fogging and defogging phenomena is presented and {{is applied to}} the prediction of the <b>demisting</b> process on the glass door of a refrigerated closed display cabinet. The physical problem depends on the flow field along the glass. {{both inside and outside the}} refrigerated cabinet, on the unsteady conduction through the multi-glazed door and on the heat and mass transfer phenomena within the thin water layer on the fogged surface. Thus a suite of routines for the unsteady simulation of the water layer evolution is coupled with FVM solvers for the Navier Stokes and energy equations inside the cabinet and for the conduction problem in the glass. The convective heat transfer coefficient on the exterior side of the glass door is evaluated through empirical correlations. The codes are iterated simultaneously to reproduce the physical transient. before, during and after the door opening. Simulations are carried out for a frozen food display cabinet with an air curtain flowing alone the internal side of the door.

The bleed air temperature control is accomplished automatically by an electronic controller in conjunction with an Electro Pneumatic Temperature Control Valve (TCV). This system is designed to maintain the cabin and crew compartment temperature in the range of 18 to 30 °C up to the aircraft ceiling of altitude of 30, 000 ft. This paper covers the system performance evaluation carried out for various engine power settings during ground tests on the aircraft and by empirical method. Further, instrumentation scheme adapted for measuring pressure and temperature for the above said evaluation has been discussed. Results of the tests show that the required mass flow rate and condition of the air entering in to the cabin is met, thus ECS performance is satisfactory. ...|$|E
