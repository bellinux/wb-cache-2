25|$|Now, in {{the chapter}} on Pangenesis in my Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any {{circulating}} system. It is, indeed, obvious {{that the presence of}} gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, , are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.|$|E
500|$|I {{responded to}} all these songs on an {{emotional}} level, when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> them. I wanted songs I felt I could tell with my own voice, and interpret them authentically ... But {{it was important to}} maintain the emotional integrity and the heart of the song. It was a high priority to keep true to the songs.|$|E
500|$|The Honourable Virgil P. Moshansky, who {{investigated}} the crash in Dryden {{and wrote the}} report, appeared in the documentary, alleging that if the recommendations in his report had been followed, the USAir accident could have been prevented. Moshansky told the documentary that his report [...] "probably sat on somebody's [...] desk." [...] He said [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> about it I thought, my God, it's Dryden all over again ... certainly if they had followed the recommendations in my report, the F28 crash at LaGuardia could have been averted." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a town {{down the}} road which <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> {{discussed}} nigh twenty {{years ago by a}} broken-down prospector in a box-car. 'Young feller,' said he, after he had made a professional prophecy,' you'll hear of that town if you live. She's born lucky.' ...|$|R

6000|$|I found Scott {{was quite}} an enthusiast {{on the subject of}} the popular songs of his country, and he seemed gratified to find me so alive to them. Their effect in calling up in my mind the {{recollections}} of early times and scenes in which <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> them, reminded him, he said, of the lines of his poor Mend, Leyden, to the Scottish muse: ...|$|R
500|$|Ronnie Dunn, {{with whom}} McBride collaborated {{when he wrote}} songs for Brooks & Dunn, {{said that he was}} a fan of the band before McBride joined the duo's road band. In an {{interview}} with CMT, Dunn said, [...] "They're amazingly tight as a group. <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> them on the radio in the early '90s, shortly after their first single. I liked Terry's singing style. It had a familiar Texas twang." [...] Dunn has also said that he enjoys writing with McBride, because both of them are Texas natives with a similar upbringing and musical influences.|$|E
500|$|People {{connected}} with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: [...] "I remember when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw." [...] Gary Smith, {{who at the time}} was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he [...] "was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record." [...] Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production [...] "sounded way better than the other ones." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
60|$|How the {{interval}} of suspense in which I was now condemned might have affected {{other men in}} my position, I cannot pretend to say. The influence of the two hours' probation upon my temperament was simply this. I felt physically incapable of remaining still in any one place, and morally incapable of speaking to any one human being, until <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> all that Ezra Jennings had to say to me.|$|R

500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
500|$|Jansch's music, and {{particularly}} his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced {{a range of}} well-known musicians. His first album (Bert Jansch, 1965) was much admired, with Jimmy Page saying, [...] "At one point, I was absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> that LP, I couldn't believe it. It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing. No one in America could touch that." [...] The same debut album included Jansch's version of the Davy Graham instrumental [...] "Angie." [...] This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style. The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) The Sallyangie.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of its}} {{marketing}} campaign for The Girl, HBO released a 30-second trailer in August 2012. During a Television Critics Association press tour promoting the film, Hedren said [...] "I {{have to say that}} when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> Toby's [...] voice as Alfred Hitchcock, my body just froze". Hedren's daughter, Melanie Griffith, attended a screening; when the film ended, the audience was silent until Griffith said [...] "Well, now I have to go back into therapy again!" [...] Hedren attended a London [...] screening in October. The Girl made its US television debut on HBO and HBO Canada on 20 October 2012. It had its UK premiere on 26 December, as part of BBC Two's Christmas programming. The film was released on DVD in the UK on 7 January 2013.|$|E
500|$|Wood {{said that}} she is {{sometimes}} puzzled when reading Steffy's scripts, but connects her present storyline to the character's past. She said: [...] "I just think back to all the things Steffy has been through. She {{has a lot of}} deep seeded [...] issues. That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1956, {{his song}} [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] reached number 29 on the Billboards Top 100 chart, and Berry toured {{as one of the}} [...] "Top Acts of '56". He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that [...] "I knew when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> Chuck that he'd been {{affected}} by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." [...] As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did. Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites. [...] "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe's songs as well", Perkins remembered. [...] "He told me about how he was raised very poor, very tough. He had a hard life. He was a good guy. I really liked him." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{attending}} {{high school}} in Presque Isle, Maine, Paul listened to Top-40 radio and participated in track. [...] He played trumpet in the school's stage band where he {{was introduced to the}} big band jazz music of Stan Kenton and Maynard Ferguson. [...] He excelled in track, becoming the Maine State champion in five-kilometer distance running, a feat that garnered several scholarship offers, including an offer from Boston College. [...] Having graduated high school with the class of 1983, Paul relocated to Boston, leaving small-town rural life behind. [...] In an interview with Daniel Gewertz of the Boston Herald Paul stated, [...] "It wasn't until I went to Boston College on a track scholarship that <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> folk." [...] Paul was particularly moved when he heard Bob Dylan singing [...] "The House of the Rising Sun". [...] It was then that he began to take folk music seriously.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the album}} was {{formulated}} during [...] "vibe sessions" [...] in which the group and producers would visit clubs in downtown Atlanta, select performers they saw, and invite them to the studio. [...] They would then [...] "sit around, smoke a few, drink a few", and create ideas for new songs. However, recording sessions became difficult as André 3000 grew tired of rapping on songs, which made Big Boi and the producers uneasy about how the music would sound. [...] To maintain musical cohesion with Big Boi while continuing to expand his vocal palette, André decided to combine rapping with soul-inspired crooning, which had {{a major influence on}} Stankonias sound. [...] "Snappin & Trappin'" [...] features a guest appearance from then-unknown rapper Killer Mike. The rapper noted that while working with OutKast, he used the opportunity to try to [...] "compete" [...] with the duo to improve his rapping skills. Big Boi was impressed with Killer Mike's abilities, noting, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> him spit, his voice was just so commanding. [...] He's a very intelligent guy." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{had written}} a little letter to Clarence, begging his {{forgiveness}} for having cut him, and treated him with the scorn which, I believe, was the chief fault that weighed upon her conscience; and, hearing my father's voice in the house, she {{sent a message to}} beg him to come and see her in her mother's dressing-room--that very window where <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> her voice, refusing to come down to 'those Winslows.' She had sent for him to entreat him to forgive Griffith and recall the pair to Chantry House. 'Not now,' she said, 'but when I am gone.' ...|$|R
500|$|Sometime during August 1861, Sam Jr. {{enlisted in}} the Confederate States Army 2nd Texas Infantry Regiment, Company C Bayland Guards, sending Margaret into melancholia. She dreaded that her first-born child would never be home again. [...] "My heart seems almost broken... what shall I do? How shall I bear it? When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> the news, I thought I would lie down and die," [...] she wrote to her mother. Houston tried to help out by {{assuming}} care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston. Her fears seemed well-founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh. A second bullet was stopped by his Bible, bearing an inside inscription from Margaret. He was found languishing in a field by a Union Army clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket. Taken prisoner and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois, he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October.|$|E
500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|... "Unbroken" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by OneRepublic leader Ryan Tedder, {{who was behind}} singles such as Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Halo" [...] (2009) and Leona Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007). [...] "Unbroken" [...] was recorded at Artisan Studios in Birmingham, England, and Phil Tan mixed the record at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, Georgia. Walker was honoured by the opportunity to record a piece of Tedder's work. Walker told the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It is a privilege for me to record a song by the guy who wrote 'Halo' for Beyoncé and 'Bleeding Love' for Leona. He's the man, {{one of the best}} songwriters and producers in the world. I am so blessed." [...] In an interview with MTV Australia he said, [...] "The song is so amazing. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> the song I was like this is a beat song and then I read the lyrics and that's what won me over because it talks about my life, being nothing and being in pieces, but then becoming unbroken." [...] "Unbroken" [...] is a piano-driven pop music ballad, and features a repetitive chorus.|$|E
