5|$|Many petroglyphs or carved {{images of}} dogs were found near {{religious}} centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and importance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture.</b> A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N.

Their regional distributions possibly reflected the role of dogs as symbols of tribal/clan loyalty and identity in the islands. They were totem animals associated with the Nakiʻi tribe.|$|E

5|$|After the 1917 Finnish {{independence}} and the Civil War, the other Scandinavian countries {{would have been the}} best candidates for a political alliance. Swedo-Finnish cooperation represented a rich vein of shared history <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of both nations, and the Swedish-speaking Finns had a common language with Swedes. During the Civil War, however, Sweden briefly occupied the Åland Islands and later supported the local movement that wanted to secede from Finland and join the islands to Sweden. The dispute was resolved by the League of Nations in 1921 and the Åland remained Finnish, but were granted autonomy. Other obstacles to closer relations were the ongoing language strife on the status of the Swedish language in Finland. Sweden had also opposed the upper-class resistance movement against Russification. As a result, young Finnish men received their military training in Germany, generating the Jäger Movement. Nevertheless, Finnish–Swedish relations improved considerably before the Winter War.|$|E
5|$|Macaws {{are known}} to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from {{mainland}} South America both in historic times by Europeans and natives, and prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of native Caribbeans, were traded between islands, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. It is therefore difficult to determine whether the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands refer to distinct, endemic species, since they could have been based on escaped individuals or feral populations of foreign macaws of known species that had been transported there. As many as thirteen extinct macaws have been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently. Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor) is known from nineteen museum skins and subfossils, the Saint Croix macaw (Ara autochthones) is only known from subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw is known from subfossils and reports. No endemic Caribbean macaws remain today; they were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times.|$|E

5|$|Various human {{cultures}} have depicted pinnipeds for millennia. The anthropologist, A.

Seals are also of great importance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of the Inuit. In Inuit mythology, the goddess Sedna rules over the sea and marine animals. She is depicted as a mermaid, occasionally with a seal's lower body. In one legend, seals, whales and other marine mammals were formed from her severed fingers. One of the earliest Ancient Greek coins depicts {{the head of a}} seal, and the animals were mentioned by Homer and Aristotle. The Greeks believed that seals loved both the sea and sun and were considered to be under the protection of the gods Poseidon and Apollo. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped the sea and its animals, and often depicted sea lions in their art. In modern popular culture, pinnipeds are often depicted as playful and comical figures based on their performances in zoos, circuses and marine mammal parks.|$|E
5|$|As many as 13 now-extinct {{species of}} macaw have {{variously}} been suggested {{to have lived}} on the Caribbean islands, {{but many of these}} were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. In addition to the Lesser Antillean macaw, only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils, and the Saint Croix macaw (A. autochthones) is known only from subfossils. Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both in historic times by Europeans and native peoples, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of native Caribbeans, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492.

All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times. The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E
