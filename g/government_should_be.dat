5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> more powerful than the states.|$|E
5|$|As State Secretary Reitz had a {{complicated}} and hefty job. After the State President {{he was the}} most important member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus, by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that all correspondence with the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E

5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
5|$|Trained {{research}} teams {{were already on}} the ground on Java responding to the May earthquake and began a {{survey of more than}} one hundred Muslim farmers, plantation laborers, and fishermen (or those with fishing-related occupations) that were affected by the tsunami. Almost two thirds of the group reported that they lived in permanent structures made of wood, brick, or cement, while the remainder lived in semi-permanent facilities made from earth or stone. The government was cited as the first responder for water, relocation and medical assistance, and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% of those surveyed replied that the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> responsible for relief. Most of those requiring aid stated that they were given effective assistance within 48 hours and that they were satisfied with the help.|$|E

25|$|Cultural issues, {{especially}} prohibition {{and foreign}} language schools became important {{because of the}} sharp religious divisions in the electorate.

30|$|In the future, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{stressed}} that the tax revenue sharing system, as the financial system for supporting China’s market economy, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> implemented below the provincial level universally and consistently in the unified market by flattening reforms across all levels of government. Duties and financial privileges <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allocated corresponding {{to the level of}} a <b>government,</b> and duties <b>should</b> <b>be</b> proportionate to financial powers. <b>Governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given authority to set tax levels and compile budgets according to their level. Furthermore, <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given property rights and debt financing powers corresponding to their level. According to the above principle, a long-term mechanism for tax revenue sharing <b>should</b> <b>be</b> established at the central level, the provincial level, and the municipal and county level. At the same time, the central <b>government</b> <b>should</b> implement reasonable, effective, top-to-bottom central-level and provincial-level transfer payments in order to make financial resources proportionate to duties and responsibilities, especially in the provision of basic public services in less developed areas. Steps <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken to correct the biased and short-sighted funding of local governments through land transfers and to defuse risks of hidden debt in local governments. A strong financial and taxation system <b>should</b> <b>be</b> established to bring about a great national revival and the long-lasting stability of China.|$|R
25|$|There {{should be}} two {{separate}} {{accounts for the}} foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.|$|E
25|$|Social {{liberals and}} social democrats {{argue that a}} <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to {{appropriate}} private wealth {{in order to better}} reach a society-wide optimum (as opposed to each actor sub-optimizing for themselves).

The appeals court further ruled that the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sanctioned for suppression of the FBI documents and that Taylor and Haas were wrongfully cited for contempt.

25|$|After the Scarman Report on {{the riots}} was published, Powell {{gave a speech}} on 10 December in the Commons. Powell {{disagreed}} with Scarman {{when he said that}} the black community was alienated because it was economically disadvantaged: the black community was alienated because it was alien. He claimed tensions would worsen because the nonwhite population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25%, of those of secondary school age it was 40%. Powell said that the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> honest to the people by telling them in thirty years' time, the black population of Lambeth would have doubled in size.|$|E
25|$|The {{stock market}} crash in the 1929 not only {{affected}} {{the business community and}} the public’s economic confidence, but also it led to the banking system soon after the turmoil. The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It is precisely because of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist Kindleberger of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and {{after the collapse of the}} stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked. Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.|$|E

Prohibition debates and referendums heated up elections in most states over a period of decades, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (and repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the key {{measures}} that have been implemented in the 3 years since the SARS crisis ended was greatly increased commitment and leadership from the government to tackle public health problems. During the SARS epidemic, governmental and communist party leaders at all levels—from Paramount leader Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabo {{and members of the}} State Council down to village leaders—were involved in tackling a single public-health issue. The epidemic and its eventual control convinced Chinese leaders that the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> much more involved in addressing public-health problems. After the SARS epidemic, the State Council developed a mechanism to oversee public-health emergencies directly. The State Council has also involved itself with other pressing public-health challenges, including HIV/AIDS, avian influenza, occupational safety, and environmental health.|$|E
25|$|Given the Singapore government's {{focus on}} efficiency, {{the country has}} been said to {{emphasize}} a largely green-light approach towards administrative law. Public administration is not seen as a necessary evil but a positive attribute, and the objective of administrative law is not primarily to stop bad administrative practices but to encourage good ones. In this approach, recourse to the judiciary is not the first line of defence against administrative abuses of powers. Instead, it is perceived that control can and should come internally from Parliament and the executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy. In other words, instead of redressing bad government through the courts, good <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sought through the political process and public avenues. Courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules and principles by which the Singapore government may abide and conform to the rule of law.|$|E
