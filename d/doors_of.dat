Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.|$|E
