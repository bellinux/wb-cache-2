The table to the right shows that when you <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the polling booths in the suburb of Croydon, Labor has consistently returned around 60% of the two-party preferred vote even when the first preference votes have fluctuated.

25|$|If we <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing {{as it would}} for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) {{as a function of}} time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.|$|E

On {{the impact of the}} guide, professor Samuel Sweet of UC Santa Barbara stated [...] "Before that book, if people went out to look for snakes, it was so they could gather them up to sell to pet shops or just show off to their buddies.

'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that.

500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it as music.

500|$|Steve Perry has {{expressed}} ambivalence towards the lasting vilification of the Daddies' name, admitting it's [...] "probably the most heinous {{name in the}} history of rock" [...] while emphasizing a disparate delineation between the band's roots in the [...] "bubble" [...] of Eugene's punk subculture and their unexpected longevity in the wider cultural mainstream: [...] "I started this band a long time ago, and we just used [...] We didn't know that in 10 years we'd turn into some sort of happy, peppy, feel-good things". Though Perry has occasionally voiced regret over not having changed the Daddies' name earlier in their career, he has nevertheless acquiescently embraced the name as his [...] "Holden Caulfield red hunting hat", while outright dismissing critics who choose to demonize the name based on literal interpretation than the jazz-era jive slang it drew from. [...] "It gives outrage addicts another soapbox they can jump up on", Perry said, [...] "If people want to <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it , then that's their problem, but I don't write it that way"..."I assure you we don't cruise high schools for dates".|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held {{a series}} of hearings, as part of the ongoing [...] "War on Poverty." [...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north...

[...] Written during a {{difficult}} time in Carey's personal life, the song boasts inspirational lyrics of self-worth and achievement. The song begins with an introductory verse from Mill, followed by Ross on the second verse. Though [...] "cooing" [...] throughout the chorus, Carey's begins singing during the song's bridge and final crescendo, where she displays her whistle register. The track opens with Mill, whose verse quickly sums up {{the theme of the}} track: [...] "The only way {{to make it to the}} top is if you go and get it from the bottom ... I remember they said that it ain't my turn/ <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me now/ Try to hold me down, but I ain't gonna stop/ 'Cause I'm gonna climb to the mountaintop." [...] During the song's chorus, Carey sings of not being able to be torn down by others and [...] "staying triumphant", before continuing: [...] "Don't let 'em ever count you out/ Realize all things are possible/ In your heart who's the greatest/ Reach for the stars/ Be all that you are." ...|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E

I would love to have their input anytime, because they're obviously doing something right." [...] The band also contributed backing vocals and played the guitar to the song. It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums. In an interview, Lovato explained that the song is about being yourself when you are surrounded by [...] "the pressures of fame". She said, [...] "You get to Hollywood {{and a lot of times}} people can try to shape you and mould you into what they want you to be. The song is just about keeping it real and trying to stay yourself when you're out in Hollywood." [...] "La La Land" [...] was released as the album's second and final single on April 10, 2009.

500|$|In January 1959, Kelly {{joined the}} {{musician}} {{with whom he}} became most associated – Miles Davis. Adderley, the alto saxophonist in the band, related how Kelly came to replace Red Garland on piano: Davis had admired Kelly's playing as part of Gillespie's band, and Garland was invariably late to arrive for their club performances; [...] "One night, Wynton was there when we started and Miles asked him to sit in. When Red came, Wynton was playing. Miles told Red, 'Wynton's got the gig.' Just like that." [...] Kelly stayed with the trumpeter until March 1963, appearing on the studio albums Kind of Blue and Someday My Prince Will Come, {{as well as on}} numerous concert recordings. On 1959's Kind of Blue, often mentioned as the best-selling jazz album ever, Kelly replaced Bill Evans on the track [...] "Freddie Freeloader". Even though Kelly was Davis' regular pianist, the trumpeter had planned his album with Evans in mind, so this was the only piece that Kelly played. Kelly toured 22 cities in Europe as part of Davis' quintet in the spring of 1960. Fellow pianist McCoy Tyner commented on Kelly's playing with Davis: [...] "His harmonic colorations were very beautiful. But I think above all it was his ability to swing. John [...] used to mention that. Miles used to get off the bandstand and <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Wynton with admiration, because he really held the group together." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had [...] "no respect" [...] for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat to Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a miss that O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted [...] "to send [...] back home to Scotland" [...] to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that [...] "I know if I do get beat and [...] comes up and does a moonie {{in front of me and}} goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't [...] "personal" [...] for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described. O'Sullivan was unapologetic about the comments he made, saying it made a [...] "better atmosphere" [...] and [...] "what's better than a grudge match?".|$|E

[...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked.
