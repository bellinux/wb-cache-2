They are further divided into two groups called ichi (first) and ni (second) techniques. Ichi techniques have a feeling of the energy moving towards uke, while ni techniques have a feeling of energy moving towards shite. For example, in an ichi technique, shite would move {{in the same direction as}} a pull by uke, while in a ni technique, shite would divert or pivot away from a push by uke.|$|E

While it is a common natural raw material worldwide, the locations where it can be found are not evenly distributed. Because Flanders is highly dependent on imported sand, there is a need to find alternatives. One alternative might be found in the residues from <b>foundation</b> <b>techniques</b> like grout, soil mixed with bentonite, and cemented soils. This paper reports an attempt to determine the annual amount of residues from these <b>foundation</b> <b>techniques</b> available on the Flemish market, by use of a market study. This study estimated that the annual amount of grouted soils and cemented soil remainders is more than 40 % of the annual amount of natural sands dredged from the Belgian Continental Shelf.

Research carried out so far about town’s buildings have not dealt in detail with technical architectural details, notably for private, residential buildings. To fill in this gap of knowledge, a research project has recently started which focuses on building techniques used in Aquileia during the Roman Age. The research is carried out through the collection of data in literature and through analyses on site, in particular at the Domus of "Bestie ferite" and at the central Domus of the archaeological area named "fondi ex Cossar".

40|$|Abstract — Soft clay {{deposits}} possess {{very low}} shear strength and high compressibility. Alternate swelling and shrinkage of these deposits damaged many lightly loaded {{structures such as}} residential buildings, canal linings and pavements. Apart from various innovative <b>foundation</b> <b>techniques,</b> stabilization of expansive soil using lime to improve the behaviors of soft clay has been practiced in several {{parts of the world}} over a long period. Even though many researchers worked on this field, the effect of the form in which lime is added to the soil is not clearly understood. In this paper, the changes occurred in soft clay when it is treated with lime in slurry form and clay lime mix have been studied for lime contents of 10 %, 15 % and 20 % and the performance of lime treated clay bed was studied by evaluating the mineralogical properties,physico-chemical properties, index properties and strength characteristics. Morphological and mineralogical changes were studied by conducting SEM and X-ray diffraction analysis. Physico chemical changes were studied by performing pH test. Strength characteristics were studied using vane shear test. The test results indicated that the soft clay deposits treated with lime in slurry form have better performance than the same treated with clay-lime mix...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Structures {{built in}} {{expansive}} clays {{are likely to}} be damaged due to the strains caused in them following alternate swelling and shrinkage. Variations in the moisture regime during monsoon and summer are the causes for this alternate swelling and shrinkage. Several innovative <b>foundation</b> <b>techniques</b> were suggested to overcome the problems associated with expansive soils. Belled pier, under-reamed pile, Boucell raft are some of the foundation practices adopted in these soils. Besides, overburdens in the form of sand cushion and CNS cushion have also been tried for arresting heave. But, most of them suffer from one shortcoming or the other. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the existing foundation practices, fly ash cushion stabilized with lime or cement has been tried by the authors. This proved to be very effective in arresting heave. However, its efficacy over a few cycles of wetting and drying needs to be established since CNS cushion, which was found to be effective in arresting heave initially, has not been found to be as effective during subsequent cycles of wetting and drying. The present study relates to the behaviour of expansive clays under lime-or cement-stabilized fly ash cushion subjected to several wetting and drying cycles. ...|$|E

The <b>foundation</b> <b>techniques</b> and some of the developments in the field are explained with the mindset that the audience is principally young researchers wishing to understand some basics. It begins with the basic terminologies and concepts, then a mention of some subjects of inquiry in univalent functions theory. Some of the most basic subfamilies of the family of univalent functions are mentioned. Main emphasy is on the important class of Caratheodory functions and their relations with the various classes of functions, especially the techniques for establishing results in those other classes when compared with the underlying Caratheodory functions. This is contained in Section 4. Examples based on this technique are given in the last section. Since the target audience is the uninitiated, the difficult proofs are not presented. The elementary proofs are explained in the simplest terms. Footnotes are made to further explain some not-immediately obvious points. The references are mostly standard texts.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the virtualization {{process of}} university courses {{implemented in the}} four schools of the National Distance Education University (UNED, for its acronym in Spanish). Primarily, {{the objective is to}} determine whether the virtualization of the courses should be the only alternative for students, or if it should be another tool to integrate into the pedagogic model of distance education in the context and reality of Costa Rica, in regards to the viability of access to digital technologies. Thus, an analysis of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) was done through virtualization and e-learning, explaining its implementation in UNED, a setting where there {{is still a long way}} to go in terms of accessibility, mainly between urban and rural areas. Additionally, the ICTs are approached as an alternative, an option, or a tool within the distance education model, since their implementation depends on a pedagogic <b>foundation</b> (<b>techniques,</b> strategies, and methodologies in ICT), and above all, on the context. The conclusions state that the virtualization of the courses must be an alternative but not an imposition for the students, because consideration of the context is vital, in terms of accessibility to digital technologies in Costa Rica, meaning that the quality of education must prevail over the means (semi-virtual, hybrid, virtual, or distance). Virtualization is not a matter of being at the forefront by means of technical innovation, but its implementation must be based on a real need with suitable conditions (adequate logistic infrastructure). Finally, ICTs must depend on a clearly established pedagogical curriculum, without reducing the access and quality in education...|$|E
40|$|Providing high {{performance}} for pointer-intensive programs on modern architectures is an increasingly difficult problem for compilers. Pointer-intensive programs are often bound by memory latency and cache performance, but traditional approaches {{to these problems}} usually fail: Pointer-intensive programs are often highly-irregular and the compiler has little control over the layout of heap allocated objects. This thesis presents {{a new class of}} techniques named ``Macroscopic Data Structure Analyses and Optimizations'', which is a new approach to the problem of analyzing and optimizing pointer-intensive programs. Instead of analyzing individual load/store operations or structure definitions, this approach identifies, analyzes, and transforms entire memory structures as a unit. The foundation of the approach is an analysis named Data Structure Analysis and a transformation named Automatic Pool Allocation. Data Structure Analysis is a context-sensitive pointer analysis which identifies data structures on the heap and their important properties (such as type safety). Automatic Pool Allocation uses the results of Data Structure Analysis to segregate dynamically allocated objects on the heap, giving control over the layout of the data structure in memory to the compiler. Based on these two <b>foundation</b> <b>techniques,</b> this thesis describes several performance improving optimizations for pointer-intensive programs. First, Automatic Pool Allocation itself provides important locality improvements for the program. Once the program is pool allocated, several pool-specific optimizations can be performed to reduce inter-object padding and pool overhead. Second, we describe an aggressive technique, Automatic Pointer Compression, which reduces the size of pointers on 64 -bit targets to 32 -bits or less, increasing effective cache capacity and memory bandwidth for pointer-intensive programs. This thesis describes the approach, analysis, and transformation of programs with macroscopic techniques, and evaluates the net performance impact of the transformations. Finally, it describes a large class of potential applications for the work in fields such as heap safety and reliability, program understanding, distributed computing, and static garbage collection...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} introductory pages of this monograph (pp. i-xx) including: Dedication, Contents, List of Figures, List of Colour Plates, List of Tables, List of Graphs, Contributors, Acknowledgements and Summary (in English, French and German). The Hemington Bridges formed an important medieval crossing point over the River Trent, carrying the King’s Highway linking Leicester {{and the south}} to Derby and northern England. This report {{presents the results of}} the excavations and multi-disciplinary investigations of three successive bridges found during quarrying operations between 1993 – 1998, and places the structures in their technological, geomorphological, environmental and historical contexts. The earliest bridge at Hemington, Bridge I, was constructed in the late 11 th century and rebuilt in the early 12 th century following a calamitous flood. It is the most complete Saxo-Norman timber structure found in Britain and presents unique evidence for vernacular timber working in this period, as well as providing significant information regarding early bridge design and construction techniques. The late 11 th-century phase comprised two timber caisson pier bases and a trestle spanning part of a braided channel. The caisson pier bases were large, lozenge-shaped, jointed wooden boxes filled with sandstone rubble, positioned in the river bed, the long axes parallel to the flow. These served as plinths, supporting a superstructure that elevated the decking. The span between the piers was approximately 10 m, with the trestle providing a mid-pier support. The trestle provides some important evidence for the superstructure showing that the bridge decking was 2. 8 m wide, so suitable for carts, and was carried 5. 5 m above the river bed. It is notable that there are joints preserved in the trestle that have no known parallels. This phase of the bridge was short-lived with evident undermining of the foundations by deep scouring, probably during severe flood conditions. One caisson had rotated laterally by some 808 and the second had tilted from the horizontal by 408. Both had settled into deep scour features, and the trestle had collapsed over one of the caissons. Coarse deposits quickly buried the remains. Sometime after 1111, the bridge, or at least this section, was rebuilt. The second phase of construction comprised a double row of irregularly spaced oak piles with lateral bracing, each pair 2. 90 m apart, spanning 27 m of river channel. Some pairs had supplementary posts, presumably added as alterations or repairs. All the posts had rotted off above the height of the modern water table and consequently no jointing survived to suggest how these posts articulated with the bridge decking. These remains too were buried by coarse, point bar deposits as the river migrated laterally to the south, scouring away the southern bridgehead. The exact timescale for these channel changes is uncertain, but the establishment of Bridge II in the late 12 th century suggests that it should be measured in decades. Bridge II was located upstream from its predecessor, and comprised a double row of piled posts with lateral bracing. This was probably constructed in the late 12 th century and had been maintained into the 13 th century, suggesting that Bridge III was its direct replacement. Bridge III was constructed in the mid 13 th century immediately upstream from Bridge II. The first part of the bridge, found in 1993, comprised the foundations of four regularly spaced piers crossing a 50 m section of an old course of the Trent. Two different <b>foundation</b> <b>techniques</b> were employed for the piers: those closest to the northern bank were of masonry, constructed directly on the river bed. The two mid-stream piers were hexagonal enclosures of deeply driven piles infilled with sandstone rubble, forming a foundation for a masonry pier, the collapsed remains of which were located on the river bed and in scour features downstream. Associated timber structures included three or possibly four inter-pier structures, probably supports for a timber superstructure, and a baffle located in front of the mid-stream piers. The piers and baffle were constructed from timber felled in the late 1230 s and early 1240 s. Further structural activity or maintenance is shown by the presence of a timber felled c. 1270 – 1305 in one of the inter-pier structures. The southern abutment of the bridge was revealed in further quarry work in 1998. A corresponding, but unrecognised, northern abutment was probably observed during quarrying in 1991 – 2.
