25|$|<b>Dump</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded <b>valve.</b> The <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.|$|R
50|$|Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves,</b> {{also known}} as double flap valves or double flap gates, are a type of airlock valve {{commonly}} used in industrial applications as a component in bulk material handling applications. Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily used to discharge chunky or fibrous, bulk materials from hoppers, bins, and cyclones operating under positive or negative pressure. Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> are used to discharge a flow of material {{while at the same}} time serving as an airlock transition point to preserve the pressure differential above and below the valve. This type of material handling valve is ideal for use with bulky or abrasive materials that would tend to jam or damage a rotary feeder.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> {{system was}} {{provided}} for any residual acid. Oxidiser loaded was burned in flight before landing, or dumped.|$|R
50|$|A blowoff <b>valve</b> (BOV), <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> or {{compressor}} {{bypass valve}} (CBV) is a pressure release system present in most turbocharged engines.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of double}} <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> works essentially, like a stacked pair of trickle valves. Each flap plate is held {{closed with a}} {{counterweighted}} arm. As material builds up on the top plate {{the weight of the}} head of material pushes it open where it dumps onto the bottom plate. This type of double <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> has no electrical or pneumatic controls and is the least expensive method of operation. However, it is difficult to sustain a properly timed cycle.|$|R
50|$|Timing of {{the flap}} plates is {{critical}} {{in order to make}} sure a double <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> operates properly. There are several designs that have been employed in order to maintain a consistently operating valve.|$|R
50|$|Dry suit {{inflation}} only {{applies to}} diving. Survival suits and other dry suits designed for wear {{on the surface}} have no inflation or <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> as suit squeeze and achieving neutral buoyancy are not issues.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical piston-type <b>dump</b> <b>valve,</b> used in auto racing. Unlike a blowoff valve, {{this one}} does not vent to the atmosphere. The small hose at the top is a feed from the intake manifold.|$|R
5000|$|Each valve was a wood disc {{with leather}} facing on both sides. One face had a center hole {{leading to a}} pocket of a larger {{diameter}} in the wood. The valve was supported only by a lever between the valve plate pivot and the pouch lifter disc, with a right angle dowel extension that [...] "plugged in" [...] the center hole of the <b>valve</b> <b>button.</b> The pivotal lever is easily removable {{because it was not}} cemented to the valve, rendering a loose <b>valve</b> <b>button</b> in the <b>valve</b> well behind the valve plate that was screwed onto the valve chest with white sealing compound.|$|R

2500|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible. [...] This may cause an uncontrolled ascent resulting in missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. The manual exhaust allows the diver to control the suit volume; this may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or there may be a separate automatic, auto <b>dump,</b> <b>valve</b> on the shoulder. [...] Automatic valves can be set to release at a pre-set pressure and in most situations, the diver can leave the automatic valve at a constant setting throughout the dive so that it releases {{with a small amount of}} over-pressure venting as needed automatically as the diver ascends. There are many different configurations but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder, and manual vents are at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have no <b>dump</b> <b>valve,</b> but are clamped to the helmet with a watertight seal, so the exhaust valve of the helmet functions as a <b>dump</b> <b>valve.</b> Some, now rare, older dry suits may have no vents, requiring the diver to lift one of the wrist seals or the neck seal open to vent the suit.|$|R
50|$|An over {{pressure}} relief valve that automatically vents the bladder if the diver over inflates the BC by ascending or by injecting too much gas. This is usually a secondary function of the vent or <b>dump</b> <b>valve,</b> and is a necessary safety feature to prevent over-pressure damage.|$|R
25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, diverter, bypass, turbo-relief valve, blow-off <b>valve</b> (BOV), or <b>dump</b> <b>valve.</b> It is a pressure relief valve, and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|R
40|$|The {{load control}} system {{developed}} for the shuttle external structural tests is described. The system consists of a load programming/display module, and a load control module along with the following hydraulic system components: servo <b>valves,</b> <b>dump</b> <b>valves,</b> hydraulic system components, and servo valve manifold blocks. One load programming/display subsystem can support multiple load control subsystem modules...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} were {{fitted with}} Britten-Norman rotary atomizers for crop spraying and a 100-imperial-gallon (455-litre) chemical tank in the fuselage, with an emergency <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> allowing the tank to be emptied in 5 seconds. The Workmasters were mainly operated in West Africa, three {{returned to the}} UK later and are currently (2009) on the U.K. civil aircraft register.|$|R
5000|$|After the accident, the NTSB removed, inspected, {{and tested}} the right engine's {{ignition}} magneto {{and found it}} to be operating normally, concluding, [...] "No mechanical or electrical discrepancies were found during the examination of the right magneto." [...] The inspection also determined that [...] "All of the fuel cross-feed and fuel <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> were in the closed position." ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> for {{the loop}} and also {{functions}} as a drain for water. The counterlung is in the exhalation side of the loop. Water from condensate and leakage is trapped in the bellows before it can reach the scrubber, and can be discharged through the exhaust valve for the loop, which is mounted on the lower plate of the bellows.|$|R
50|$|A {{motor-driven}} cam rotates and alternately {{opens the}} top gate {{and the bottom}} plate. A spring attached to the gateâ€™s shaft re-closes the gates. This type of double <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> is generally the most reliable and can be operated {{with an electric motor}} or a pneumatic motor. The speed of the cycle can be selected through the gear reducer ratio or by adjusting the motor speed.|$|R
50|$|Control of {{pressure}} presents the fewest challenges. Given {{a source of}} air or gas of sufficient pressure and flow capacity, the autoclave control system opens the pressurization valve and shuts it once the internal pressure has reached the setpoint. Depressurization occurs when the <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> is opened. On large autoclaves, a silencer or muffler may be needed. The valves are on/off rather than modulating, for cost reasons.|$|R
50|$|Aerosol paint (also called spray paint) {{is a type}} {{of paint}} that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a <b>valve</b> <b>button.</b> A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface. Standard sized cans are portable, inexpensive and easy to store. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.|$|R

Standard sized cans are lightweight, portable, cheap, and easy to store. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.|$|R
50|$|The wing is an {{inflatable}} buoyancy bladder, {{similar to that}} in other varieties of BCD, except that it is not in or permanently attached to the harness part of a BCD. As with other BCDs, wings have an inflation valve on a corrugated hose, <b>dump</b> <b>valve,</b> and over pressure valve. Wings are usually oval (annular, doughnut or toroidal) or U-shaped (horseshoe), and are designed to wrap slightly around the diving cylinder(s) when inflated.|$|R
25|$|Lift bag {{appropriate}} capacity should {{match the}} task at hand. If the lift bag is grossly oversized a runaway or otherwise out of control ascent may result. Commercially available lifting bags may incorporate <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> to allow the operator to control the buoyancy during ascent, {{but this is a}} hazardous operation with high risk of entanglement in an uncontrolled lift or sinking. If a single bag is insufficient, multiple bags may be used, and should be distributed to suit the load.|$|R
25|$|A {{weighted}} dump {{line will}} automatically start open the <b>valve</b> to start <b>dumping</b> excess air if the weight is lifted off the bottom. This {{will stop the}} lift from ascending any further if the <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> releases air fast enough. When the weight is lowered back to the bottom by the sinking load, the valve will close again, and should hold the load steady. The stability of this system depends on the preload of the valve spring {{and the size of}} the valve opening.|$|R
50|$|The {{corrugated}} hose of the inflator assembly should be {{long enough to}} easily dump air from the bladder and no longer, as this {{makes it difficult to}} streamline. The inflator mechanism must not be a high flow type. These use a non-standard connector, and can fill the wing dangerously quickly if the valve sticks open. It is easier to deal with a runaway inflation on a low flow rate inflator. A pull <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> on the inflation manifold is an unnecessary additional point of failure.|$|R
50|$|A vent <b>valve</b> or <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> {{that allows}} gas to be {{released}} or to escape in a controlled fashion from the bladder(s) of the BC. Most BCs {{have at least two}} vents: one at the extreme top and the other {{at the bottom of the}} BC, for use as air migrates to whichever part of the BC is uppermost, the vent situated at the shoulder is used when the diver is upright and the vent situated nearer the diver's waist is used when inverted. Venting through the oral inflation system is also usually possible.|$|R
50|$|Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> {{have two}} trap-door flap plates which {{open and close}} on an {{alternating}} cycle. The top gate opens to allow collected material to drop through onto the bottom gate. The top gate then re-closes to prevent air leakage above the valve. The bottom gate then opens to allow material to pass completely through the valve. The bottom gate then re-closes to prevent air leakage below the valve. This cycle is continuously repeated {{in order to maintain}} a steady discharge of material from the valve, while maintaining a positive seal on the system.|$|R
50|$|The reactor {{consists}} of a tubed calandria vessel of austenitic stainless steel, which contains the heavy water moderator/reflector and 208 coolant tube assemblies. The moderator system {{consists of}} the calandria, coolers, pumps and purification system in the heavy water circuit, and control <b>valves,</b> <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> and helium blowers in the helium circuit. The fuel is natural uranium {{in the form of}} sintered uranium dioxide pellets sheathed in thin zirconium alloy tubes to form solid fuel elements about 19.1 inches (48.53 cm) long by 0.6 inches (1.4 cm) diameter.|$|R
5000|$|Catastrophic bladder failure due to puncture, tearing {{or failure}} of the <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> or {{inflation}} assembly can leave the diver with inadequate buoyancy to make a safe ascent, particularly if diving deep with large gas supply and insufficient ditchable weight. The risk can be mitigated by diving in a dry suit, which can be inflated to add buoyancy in an emergency, by carrying a DSMB, which can be deployed to provide a surface float, and by using distributed ditchable weights - ditching the whole weightbelt may result in the opposite problem of excessive buoyancy.|$|R
25|$|Aerosol paint, {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a <b>valve</b> <b>button.</b> A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented aerosol paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides. The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a spray head.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} components {{include a}} shell of watertight material, sufficiently flexible to allow the wearer to function adequately, seals where {{parts of the body}} pass through the suit while in use, and a method of sealing the access opening while the suit is worn. Insulation may be provided in part by the suit shell, but is usually largely provided by thermal insulation clothing worn under the suit, which relies to a large extent on trapped air for its insulating properties. An inflation valve with gas supply and <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> are generally provided, but were not standard on early models.|$|R
5000|$|Inflator valve {{malfunction}} can {{inflate the}} bladder when the buoyancy is not needed, {{and if not}} recognized and dealt with promptly, can result in uncontrolled ascent with associated risk of decompression illness. This can happen more quickly with inflators combined with alternative demand valves as they must use a larger bore hose connector. However, the standard overpressure and <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> provided are able to vent air faster than the inflator valve can fill the bladder. This can be mitigated by the ability to disconnect the inflator hose under pressure, a skill which is trained by some agencies.|$|R
