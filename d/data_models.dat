It was not intended for correctness verification for techniques (e.g. OT) that are designed for specific data and operation models and for specific applications. In, the notion of intention preservation was defined and refined at three levels: First, it {{was defined as a}} generic consistency requirement for collaborative editing systems; Second, it was defined as operation context-based pre- and post- transformation conditions for generic OT functions; Third, it was defined as specific operation verification criteria to guide the design of OT functions for two primitive operations: string-wise insert and delete, in collaborative plain text editors.|$|E

25|$|There exist two {{underlying}} {{models in}} each OT system: the data model {{that defines the}} way data objects in a document are addressed by operations, and the operation model that defines the set of operations that can be directly transformed by OT functions. Different OT systems may have different data and operation models. For example, the data model of the first OT system is a single linear address space; and its operation model consists of two primitive operations: character-wise insert and delete. The basic operation model has been extended to include a third primitive operation update to support collaborative Word document processing and 3D model editing. The basic OT data model has been extended into a hierarchy of multiple linear addressing domains, which is capable of modeling {{a broad range of}} documents. A data adaptation process is often required to map application-specific <b>data</b> <b>models</b> to an OT-compliant data model.|$|E
5000|$|... it was {{determined}} that current data modeling methods were imparting data isolation into every data architecture in the form of islands of disparate data and information silos. This data isolation is an unintended artifact of the data modeling methodology that results in the development of disparate <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> Disparate <b>data</b> <b>models,</b> when instantiated as databases, form disparate databases. Enhanced data model methodologies have been developed to eliminate the data isolation artifact and to promote the development of integrated <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> One enhanced data modeling method recasts <b>data</b> <b>models</b> by augmenting them with structural metadata in the form of standardized data entities. As a result of recasting multiple <b>data</b> <b>models,</b> the set of recast <b>data</b> <b>models</b> will now share one or more commonality relationships that relate the structural metadata now common to these <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> Commonality relationships are a peer-to-peer type of entity relationships that relate the standardized data entities of multiple <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> Multiple <b>data</b> <b>models</b> that contain the same standard data entity may participate in the same commonality relationship. When integrated <b>data</b> <b>models</b> are instantiated as databases and are properly populated from a common set of master data, then these databases are integrated.|$|E
