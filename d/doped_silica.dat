2500|$|The {{index of}} {{refraction}} (or refractive index) {{is a way of}} measuring the speed of light in a material. Light travels fastest in a vacuum, such as in outer space. The speed of light in a vacuum is about 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. The refractive index of a medium is calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in that medium. The refractive index of a vacuum is therefore 1, by definition. A typical singlemode fiber used for telecommunications has a cladding made of pure silica, with an index of 1.444 at 1,500nm, and a core of <b>doped</b> <b>silica</b> with an index around 1.4475. The larger the {{index of refraction}}, the slower light travels in that medium. From this information, a simple rule of thumb is that a signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200,000 kilometers per second. To put it another way, the signal will take 5 milliseconds to travel 1,000 kilometers in fiber. Thus a phone call carried by fiber between Sydney and New York, a 16,000-kilometer distance, means that there is a minimum delay of 80 milliseconds (about [...] of a second) between when one caller speaks and the other hears. (The fiber in this case will probably travel a longer route, and there will be additional delays due to communication equipment switching and the process of encoding and decoding the voice onto the fiber).|$|E

Indeed, they had so much power available to them that two thirds was attenuated away to prevent damage to the fibre. The 50 kW coupled into the fibre emerged as a 12 kW continuum [...] Stokes lines were clearly visible up to 1.3 μm, {{at which point the}} continuum began to smooth out, except for a large loss due to water absorption at 1.38 μm. As they increased the launch power beyond 50 kW they noted that the continuum extends down into the green part of the visible spectrum. However, the higher power levels quickly damaged their fibre. In the same paper they also pumped a single mode fibre with a 6 μm core diameter and [...] "a few 100 m in length."

5000|$|Intrinsic defects {{are present}} in the matrix of a single {{component}} glass material like pure silica. These include per-oxy linkages, POL (≡Si-O-O-Si≡) which are oxygen interstitials, and oxygen deficient centers, ODC (≡Si-Si≡) which are oxygen vacancies. [...] When exposed to ionizing radiation, these sites trap holes to form per-oxy radicals, POR (≡Si-O-O.) and E’ centers (≡Si.), respectively. In addition, rapidly cooled silica has strained ≡Si-O-Si≡ bonds, which are cleaved upon radiation to form non-bridging oxygen hole centers (NBOHC) depicted as ≡Si-O. and E’ centers by trapping holes and electrons, respectively. [...] When the glass contains a second network former with the same valence as silicon such as germanium, the difference in the electronegativities favors the dopant as a hole trap. Hence greater radiation damage occurs in <b>doped</b> <b>silica</b> glass. To improve radiation resistance of pure silica core fibers, it is necessary to minimize the number density of these intrinsic defects. Minimization of defects is achieved not only by reducing the incorporation of impurities in glass but also by controlling the input gas composition, optimizing the thermal history of glass at all stages of fiber manufacturing and optimizing the stress in the fiber core. Other strategies include incorporation of dopants (such as fluorine) in the core that minimize formation of defect centers discussed above.|$|E
