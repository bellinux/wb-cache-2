5|$|In 1930, {{inspired}} by Breizh Atao's message, Célestin Lainé, a reserve artillery officer, gathered {{a small group}} of companions to found Gwenn ha du, a terrorist organization advocating the creation of an independent Breton state through direct action. In August 1932, Gwenn ha du blew up a 400 year old monument dedicated to the union of Brittany and France.

Gwenn ha du attracted the support of many young nationalists who became disillusioned with the failure of mainstream political parties to gain ground in formal elections. Gwenn ha du ceased its operations between 1933 and 1936, while Lainé was working at the Kuhlmann plant in Loos, French Flanders. There he established links with Flemish nationalists, who introduced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> , <b>an</b> Abwehr agent, who converted Lainé into Nordic neopaganism. Lainé returned to Brittany in 1937, relegating Gwenn ha du the responsibility of sabotage and forming Kadevernn a group that was intended to form the nucleus of a Breton national army.

5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson.

When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} campaign ads, one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating for a state lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E
