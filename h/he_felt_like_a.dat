5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E
25|$|York had {{experienced}} freedom on his adventures with Lewis and Clark. He {{was part of}} the team and he contributed just like the rest with hunting, fishing, putting up tents etc. He had crossed rivers and mountains on the expedition and had a taste of what true freedom is like. On the expedition <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> free man, and then when he returned east he was a slave again, in a world where there was slavery and bondage.|$|E
25|$|From 1989 to 1997, Ali {{attended}} King Edward VI Five Ways School. He {{has said}} that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> misfit at his school, being {{one of only a}} handful of Muslims in the overwhelmingly Anglo student body. As a youth, he found himself torn between an Islamic upbringing and the Birmingham's thriving club scene. In his late teens and early twenties, Ali entrenched himself in the urban Hip hop music scene, a lifestyle of late nights and partying that he said eventually left him disillusioned.|$|E

25|$|In {{designing}} the Jedi Master Yoda, Stuart Freeborn used {{his own face}} as a model and added the wrinkles of Albert Einstein for the appearance of exceptional intelligence. Sets for Dagobah were built five feet above the stage floor, allowing puppeteers to crawl underneath and hold up the Yoda puppet. The setup presented communication problems for Frank Oz, who portrayed Yoda, as he was underneath the stage and unable to hear the crew and Mark Hamill above. Hamill later expressed his dismay at being the only human character on set for months; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trivial element {{on a set of}} animals, machines, and moving props. Kershner commended Hamill for his performance with the puppet.|$|E
25|$|For Bavaria itself Charles Theodore did {{less than}} nothing. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{foreigner}} among foreigners, and his favourite scheme, {{the subject of}} endless intrigues with the Austrian cabinet and the immediate cause of Frederick II's League of Princes (Fürstenbund) of 1785, was to exchange Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands and the title of king of Burgundy. For the rest, the enlightened internal policy of his predecessor was abandoned. The funds of the suppressed Society of Jesus, which Maximilian Joseph had destined for the reform of the educational system of the country, were used to endow a province of the knights of St John of Jerusalem, {{for the purpose of}} combating the enemies of the faith. The government was inspired by the narrowest clericalism, which culminated in the attempt to withdraw the Bavarian bishops from the jurisdiction of the great German metropolitans and place them directly under that of the pope. On the eve of the Revolution the intellectual and social condition of Bavaria remained that of the Middle Ages.|$|E
500|$|In October 1955 he {{directed}} Mishima's modern noh play, The Damask Drum in a theater-in-the-round production at Osaka's Sankei Hall. Mishima, dubious of Takechi's experimental approach to classical theater, later commented that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> father allowing a disreputable plastic surgeon {{to operate on}} his child. Also at Sankei Hall, Takechi directed Mishima's Sotoba Komachi, set as an opera by composer Mareo Ishiketa, in 1956.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> animal long denied food. His {{hunger for}} her welled up in him, and he {{proceeded}} to [...] "wolf" [...] the dainty morsel before him. Here was no patience, no diplomacy. The straightest, direct way was none too quick for him and, had he known it, the least unsuccessful way he could have chosen.|$|R
60|$|Swithin's heart swelled {{within him}} in sudden pity for her, first; then he blanched with a horrified {{sense of what}} she had done, and at his own {{relation}} to the deed. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> awakened somnambulist who should find that he had been accessory to a tragedy during his unconsciousness. She had loosened the knot of her difficulties by cutting it unscrupulously through and through.|$|R

500|$|Matejko {{combined}} {{three key}} {{parts of the}} battle into one tableau: an opportunistic attack by German knight Kökeritz on Jagiełło, {{the death of the}} Grand Master, and the taking of the Teutonic camp (in the top left corner). Unlike many other paintings of battles, the Battle of Grunwald does not separate the viewer from the action; instead it places him at the center of it. Matejko said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "possessed man" [...] while he made the painting.|$|E
500|$|Eichmann said {{he would}} discuss the {{proposal}} with Berlin, {{and that in the}} meantime Brand should decide what kinds of goods he {{was in a position to}} offer. Brand asked how the committee was supposed to obtain these goods. Eichmann said he should open negotiations with the Allies overseas and that Eichmann would arrange a travel permit. Brand suggested Istanbul, where another committee member had a Jewish Agency contact. He testified years later that on leaving the hotel <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "stark madman".|$|E
500|$|After graduating, {{he served}} {{a stint as}} a junior officer at Fort San José in the capital Guatemala City and later under [...] "an {{illiterate}} Colonel" [...] in a small garrison {{in the village of}} San Juan Sacatepéquez. While at San José, Árbenz had to lead squads of soldiers who were escorting chain gangs of prisoners (including political prisoners) to perform forced labor. The experience traumatized Árbenz, who said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> capataz (i.e., a [...] "foreman"). During this period he first met Francisco Arana.|$|E

5000|$|Considered by {{his father}} to be a genius {{by the age of}} five, Ahmanson founded the H.F. Ahmanson company in 1927, before graduating from the University of Southern California. Ahmanson's company {{specialized}} in casualty insurance and quickly became the largest underwriter in California. During the Great Depression, the company prospered by dealing with foreclosures. Ahmanson once remarked that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> undertaker: [...] "the worse it got, the better it was for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cronkite did {{eventually}} join CBS in 1950. However, as Murrow's career {{seemed on}} the decline and Cronkite's on the rise, the two found {{it increasingly difficult to}} work together. Cronkite was not a Murrow Boy, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider soon after joining CBS. Joseph Persico compared Cronkite to Downs in their demeanor as reporters; the difference being that Murrow viewed Downs as a [...] "satellite" [...] rather than a potential rival, as Cronkite seemed to be.|$|R

He keenly follows the England {{national}} football team, and has regularly attended FIFA World Cup games, appearing at France 98, Germany 2006, South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014. Jagger has stated his support of the British conservative party, and expressed his admiration of Margaret Thatcher. He {{also said that he}} wishes to remain apolitical when he pulled out of a political event hosted by David Cameron in 2012 because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "political football". Jagger was a supporter of David Cameron and was mildly in favour of Brexit, before reversing his stance on it.|$|E
500|$|The Second Test in Kanpur saw Davidson {{return his}} career best innings and match bowling figures. On a dry pitch and in searing {{temperatures}} unfavourable for fast bowling, he took 5/31 {{in the first}} innings as India were all out for 152. He then scored 41 as Australia replied with 219. In heat above 38 degrees Celsius, he bowled unchanged for the entire day to take 7/93 from 57.3 overs in the second innings. During the match, Davidson lost around 11kg in weight. According to the Australians, it was the [...] "harshest cricket environment" [...] that they had encountered. Davidson said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "bloody zombie".|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{captured}} {{more than}} 36,000 Germans, and evacuated 2,000 wounded, far exceeding {{the estimate of}} 10,000 Germans given to Middleton by Patton before the operation. [...] Ramcke was captured by troops of the 8th Division, and asked the deputy division commander for his credentials. The American general pointed to the M-1 rifles being carried by his soldiers and told Ramcke that those were his credentials. Ramcke appeared at his formal surrender clean shaven and with a well-groomed Irish setter. With plenty of reporters and photographers documenting the occasion, Ramcke commented in English that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> film star. He was soon sent to {{a prisoner of war}} camp in Clinton, Mississippi, not more than 50 miles from where Middleton was born and raised. After the war he spent time in a prison camp in England, and then was sent to France where he was tried and soon released following five total years of incarceration. He went back to Germany and entered the concrete business, continuing a correspondence with Middleton for 15 years following the war.|$|E

40|$|When Shaquille O'Neal was 11, {{he was so}} {{abnormally}} {{large that}} he had to bring his birth certificate when trick-or-treating. Never mind the phenomenal talent that would be evident young and that has carried him to four NBA championships and a stratospheric career. For years, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider and was treated <b>like</b> <b>a</b> freak. O'Neal rarely touches on that personal history in his new ABC reality show, "Shaq's Big Challenge," but it's hard to believe that it didn't influence his choice of subject: the epidemic that is childhood obesity...|$|R

500|$|... is Ichigo Momomiya's classmate {{and romantic}} interest. He later reveals that he shares her {{feelings}} and they begin dating. Masaya knows Mew Ichigo's real identity, but initially pretends otherwise as he knows Ichigo {{does not want}} him to know. Ichigo describes Masaya as [...] "smart", [...] "cute", [...] "very athletic" [...] and [...] "popular at school". He is also depicted as being a polite and calm person, though he does have moments when he yells at others in anger and acts jealous and possessive regarding Ichigo. Towards the end of the series, Masaya reveals that as an orphan, he began acting like a [...] "perfect child" [...] to be adopted, in reality, however, he felt sick of humans and disgusted by how they treat the planet. He also reveals that Ichigo is the sole exception, and it was only with her that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "real human being". As the series progresses, it is revealed that Masaya is the Blue Knight, but that Masaya did not know that he was the Blue Knight, nor did the Blue Knight appear to have any knowledge that he was Masaya. Once Masaya becomes aware of his transformation, he realizes it was born from his desire to protect Ichigo. Shortly after this revelation, Masaya collapses and reawakens as Deep Blue, the leader of the aliens and the Mew Mew's final enemy. Deep Blue claims that he created Masaya in order to deceive the world until the time was right for his awakening. Masaya sacrifices himself by releasing the final Mew Aqua inside his body in order to stop Deep Blue, and is revived when Ichigo gives her life to save him. In turn, the mew aqua remaining his body then saves her. At the end of the series, Masaya decides to go to England to study the endangered species used for the Mew Project and the Mew Mews hold a mock wedding for Masaya and Ichigo before he leaves.

Towards the end of a la Mode, he also returns to Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|Others in the {{financial}} industry believe they've been unfairly castigated by the public and by politicians.

5000|$|Boyd's friends {{saw him as}} [...] "charming, generous, {{frivolous}} and funny". He {{was sensitive}} and private; a complex man who struggled with his identity as an Anglo-Australian, as an expatriate writer and with religious beliefs. He {{did not believe in}} the class superiority which many of his critics levelled at him; [...] was a loyal family man and friend, yet never found a lasting romantic relationship of his own. As a writer he wrote from experience and about what he knew intimately but was never sure about himself. Throughout his life <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider whether in Australia or Europe.|$|R

2500|$|As well as Diwān, Khāqāni {{left some}} letters and a lesser known 'Ajaibu l-Gharyib (Curious Rarities). [...] The {{life of a}} court poet palled on him, and he [...] "fled from the iron cage where <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bird with a broken wing" [...] and set off a journey about the Middle East. His travels gave him {{material}} for his famous poem Tohfat-ul Iraqein (in Persian: تحفه العراقين meaning A Gift from the Two Iraqs), the two Iraqs being 'Persian Iraq' (western Iran) and 'Arabic Iraq' (Mesopotamia)). [...] This book supplies us with {{a good deal of}} material for his biography and in which he described his impressions of the Middle East. He also wrote his famous qasida The Portals at Madain (in Persian: ايوان مداين) beautifully painting his sorrow and impression of the remains of Sassanid's Palace near Ctesiphon.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 Denomie {{decided to}} create a {{portrait}} a day for one year {{as a way to}} make painting more of [...] a priority in his life. His busy life wasn't allowing him to work in the studio as often as he liked, and upon returning to the studio after a week of not working <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> foreigner. This has led to a collection of hundreds of portraits, primarily small scale works (5x7 inches, 6x8 inches) of American Indians that Denomie describes as [...] "Rugged Indians". The portraits are generally head and shoulder portraits, with the individual faced forward, taking between 15–30 minutes to complete. The concept, similar to Chris Ofili's Afro Muses series, allowed for Denomie to get his [...] "head into the oven" [...] of art creation. Succeeding at this project, Denomie is currently not painting a portrait a day.|$|E
2500|$|On June 7, 1937, Curly married Elaine Ackerman, {{who gave}} birth to their only child, Marilyn, the {{following}} year. The couple divorced in June 1940, after which he gained {{a lot of weight}} and developed hypertension. He was also insecure about his shaved head, believing it made him unappealing to women; he increasingly drank to excess and caroused to cope with his feelings of inferiority. He took to wearing a hat in public to convey an image of masculinity, saying <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little kid with his hair shaved off, even though he was popular with women all his life. In fact, many who knew him said women were his main weakness. Moe's son-in-law Norman Maurer {{even went so far as}} to say he [...] "was a pushover for women. If a pretty girl went up to him and gave him a spiel, Curly would marry them. Then she would take his money and run off. It was the same when a real estate agent would come up and say 'I have a house for you'; Curly would sell his current home and buy another one." ...|$|E
5000|$|Also a {{columnist}} since the mid-2000s, he published his first novel, Goed Volk ("Good people"), in 2017. The book, partially autobiographical, deals with {{growing up in}} Amsterdam and attending public schools; the author's parents {{made a point of}} sending him to schools attended by lower-class children, where <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider and was used as a political statement. Johan van der Keuken is not mentioned by name, though the first-person narrator is called [...] "Teun". Vrij Nederland called the novel [...] "semi-autobiographical" [...] and qualified it as a coming of age novel, in which the narrator develops from being deeply ashamed of his parents and particularly his father to appreciating him as a man with good intentions.|$|R
