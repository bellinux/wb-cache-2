Teddy conveys his revelation to his parents: “After I go out this <b>door,</b> <b>I</b> may only exist {{in the minds of}} all my acquaintances…I may be an orange peel.” His mother and father, victims of their spiritual “immaturity”, are incapable of grasping his warning that they may never see him again. Salinger issues this Vedantic premonition to the reader as a clue to Teddy’s fate.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} a tour to promote Evanescence's previous album, The Open Door, Amy Lee {{said that she}} [...] "just sort of took off and didn't know what I {{was going to do}} next." [...] According to Lee, she was unsure at the time when—or if—Evanescence would continue. After taking a break from music for 18 months, she decided she wanted to work with the band members and it [...] "became more of a group project". Lee admitted to an identity crisis: [...] " [...] Fallen happened really fast, and it was just go, go, go for a couple years, and we went right into writing and wrote the next record. By the time we finished touring with The Open <b>Door,</b> <b>I</b> just needed to go, 'Who am I as an adult? During her hiatus, Lee began painting, attended concerts and museums and listened to folk and indie music.|$|E

[...] When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words [...] "Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!" [...] (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton [...] "thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy." [...] Michael Starr remembered, [...] "That was the most fantastic election... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed... The halls would be filled with people and {{sitting there in the}} front would be the first Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces... I don't care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on." ...|$|E

It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front <b>door.</b> <b>I</b> didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E

The play's artistic director, Kirsten Fitzgerald spoke positively of rehearsals for the Chicago production: [...] "The energy that explodes into the theatre with {{the start of each}} rehearsal is palpable and impossible to deny, even from the office next <b>door.</b> <b>I</b> am ecstatic and so very grateful to bring last year's smash-hit to audiences old and new.

500|$|Tom Hall {{chose the}} Quake engine for Anachronox; its {{developer}} John Carmack took interest {{in its use}} for a role-playing game. Ion Storm would soon switch to the id Tech 2 engine, necessitating a transition from December 1997 to March 1998. The team would implement engine support for 32-bit color, particle systems, a spline-based camera scriptor, facial deformations, and lip-synching. Facial deformation involved moving the vertices of a character's face, thereby creating emotional expressions and body language. Developers built the first models in Lightwave; the main characters had polygon counts of 500-700. By the end of 1997, Hall had scripted interaction with 130 non-player characters for 160 planned locations. Hall cited Chrono Trigger as a strong influence; previewers drew parallels with the Final Fantasy series and Ultima III. As in Chrono Trigger, battles were scripted and not caused by random, unavoidable encounters. Hall explained, [...] "if there's a dragon guarding a <b>door,</b> <b>I</b> want the chance to say, 'whoah, look at the time, gotta run', not, 'think I'll check this door. (*roaaar*) Dragon? Where the hell was that?!?'" [...] The team expanded the Final Fantasy-style combat by allowing actions to be queued in advance. Hall listed some of his inspirations for Anachronox in mid-2000: [...] "In movies, some inspirational people are Spielberg, Hitchcock, George Roy Hill, Rob Reiner, and now Sam Mendes. Also {{a big fan of}} Chuck Jones, who directed Warner Brothers cartoons. Novels: Gateway, Ender's Game, Snow Crash, Hitchhiker's, so many more. Games: Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, LucasArts adventures (Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer rock), Ape Escape (buy it now), Mario, Ultima III, Wizardry I, oh, I'm sure I'm forgetting some!" [...] Hall also drew dramatic inspiration from a scene in Chrono Trigger in which the characters discuss the theme of regret around a campfire.|$|E

2500|$|According to Wainwright, Poses grew thematically out of {{its title}} track, which was {{inspired}} by his residency at New York City's infamous Chelsea Hotel.

[...] Describing his writing process, Wainwright stated he typically comes up with a melody line and starts singing phonetically, from which words often appear. To promote the album prior to its release, Wainwright embarked on a tour throughout the United States and Canada.|$|E

2500|$|To {{counteract}} {{the large number}} of departures, Robinson introduced several new characters, among them Melanie Healy played by Tamzin Outhwaite. In an interview with website Walfordweb, Matthew Robinson has stated that Melanie was [...] "dreamt up to supplement the 'totty' contingent – running thin at the time". Robinson stated that Tamzin Outhwaite was [...] "a shoo-in – and not just because of her beautiful blonde hair. Within a minute of her walking into auditions, hundreds already having trooped {{in and out of the}} <b>door,</b> <b>I</b> knew we had our star." [...] Outhwaite has stated that she was given the role without having to do a screen-test. Mel was brought into the serial as a member of the already established Healy family, joining her brother Reverend Alex Healy (Richard Driscoll) and father Jeff Healy (Leslie Schofield) in October 1998. Initially Mel's relationship with Alex and Jeff was not disclosed to viewers, and it was several weeks after her introduction that Mel actually came face-to-face with her brother on-screen; it was revealed that she had been estranged to them for some time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back <b>door?</b> <b>I</b> remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E
2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the <b>door.</b> <b>I</b> said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012 Grace {{publicly}} {{came out}} as transgender, having dealt with gender dysphoria since childhood, and began her transition.

Grace later renounced {{the fact that it was}} a concept album and claimed it as [...] "Autobiographical". They began recording in February 2012 at Total Treble Studio, working without Butch Vig, who produced New Wave and White Crosses. Instead, Grace was acting as both recording engineer and record producer for the album. Weinberg departed the group that December. Drummer Atom Willard filled in with the band for their 2013 Australian tour dates, and was confirmed as the band's new drummer on July 31, 2013. In March 2013, the band canceled their US tour with Bad Religion. In May 2013, bassist Andrew Seward also announced his departure from the band. Grace has expressed that she felt the band might not continue under the name Against Me!, but will, however, because she believes the new record has a message she wants to spread. On June 24, 2013, Grace announced that recording for Transgender Dysphoria Blues was finished. Grace went on a solo tour in August in a handful of east coast US cities in support of the record.|$|E
