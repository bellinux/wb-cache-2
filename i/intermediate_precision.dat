In our case this is the accurate solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Using the Poisson Problem as a typical PDE example we show that most intermediate operations can be computed with floats or even smaller formats and only very few operations (e. g. 1 %) must be performed in double precision to obtain the same accuracy as a full double precision solver. Thus the FPGA can be configured with many parallel float rather than few resource hungry double operations. To achieve this, we adapt the general concept of mixed precision iterative refinement methods to FPGAs and develop a fully pipelined version of the Conjugate Gradient solver. We combine this solver with different iterative refinement schemes and precision combinations to obtain resource efficient mappings of the pipelined algorithm core onto the FPGA. 1...|$|R
