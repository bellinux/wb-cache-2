5|$|In 2009, Gutawa voiced a {{character}} in Meraih Mimpi (Chasing Dreams), the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn; the voice recording took four months. She later cited it as a good learning experience. The following year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, Love in Perth, in which she played a shy student studying in Perth, Australia. She considered it challenging; for the most difficult part, a scene <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to cry, she practised {{in front of a}} mirror. In May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero; the couple split up sometime before January 2012.|$|E

She was married to him from December 1952 to 1959. She worked actively to advance his career and encouraged his work as a choreographer. Her intervention with producer George Abbott led to his first major job as a choreographer, in The Pajama Game. They divorced as her health worsened, and as Fosse, who was serially unfaithful during their marriage, left McCracken for Gwen Verdon.|$|E
5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing {{a sense of}} humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up {{in an effort to}} remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E
5|$|Preparations {{began in}} January, with Madonna {{saying that the}} {{rehearsal}} was the most exhausting one <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ever participated. Costumes were designed by Riccardo Tisci, Givenchy, Miu Miu and Prada. The performance required 500 outfits, including customized costumes for the musical guests and assisting performers. The production team was allotted seven minutes {{to set up the}} stage, 12 minutes for the performance and eight minutes to take down the stage. The modular structure was assembled from a truck, with a large white fabric in front as media screens for Moment Factory. Projection mapping was used by video-hardware manufacturer Barco, with films modified for the spectators and the television audience. The stadium was equipped with Sharpys lighting arrangements from Clay Paky, and the show used Sennheiser sound equipment.|$|E

5|$|While she {{exhibited}} {{many of the}} Australian works completed {{before arriving}} in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in Brittany. In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, Le Bigouden, was hung. She also appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> eight works, {{a very large number}} for a single artist. The Société not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of her arrival in Aldeburgh Imogen gave {{considerable}} support and assistance to the Aldeburgh Festival, as a conductor and, from 1953, increasingly as a planner and organiser. In 1956 her position was formalised, and she joined Britten and Pears as one of the festival's artistic directors, taking responsibility for programmes and performers. At the 1956 festival she fulfilled a long-held ambition by arranging a performance of Gustav Holst's opera Savitri, the first of several Holst works that she introduced to the festival. Savitri was offered as part of a double bill that included Imogen's arrangement of John Blow's 17th century opera Venus and Adonis. In 1957 she instituted late-night concerts devoted to early music, and in 1962 she organised a series of evening concerts of Flemish music, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> more recently become interested. She also devised frequent programmes devoted to church music, for performance at Aldeburgh parish church. Since moving to Aldeburgh in 1952, Imogen had lived in a series of lodgings and rented flats. In 1962 she moved to a small contemporary bungalow built for her in Church Walk, where she lived {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|Revenge {{participated in}} her first action of the war when she joined the gunboat , six British and four French destroyers, and a French torpedo boat in bombarding German troops from off Nieuwpoort, Belgium, on 22 November 1914. On 15–16 December 1914, Revenge bombarded German heavy {{artillery}} batteries, during which time she received two 8-inch (203-mm) shell hits, one of which penetrated her hull below the waterline and caused her to be withdrawn for repairs. In early 1915, the ship participated in experiments using aircraft to observe and control her gunfire, but these were only partially successful. In April and May 1915 she underwent a refit at Chatham Dockyard <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> anti-torpedo bulges fitted. Afterwards, Revenge conducted trials using sea-based observers on off-shore platforms to direct the bombardment. On 2 August 1915, she was renamed Redoubtable.|$|E

5|$|U-30s sixth patrol was {{the first}} time <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sunk any enemy ships since her third patrol. Having left Wilhelmshaven on 8 June 1940, she once again entered the North Sea in an attempt to sink any Allied ships in the area. For 32 days, U-30 circumnavigated the British Isles and sank five enemy ships in the Bay of Biscay. The first vessel to be {{attacked}} was the 4,876-ton British merchantman Otterpool, which was sunk on 20 June 1940. Two days later, the 3,999-ton Norwegian vessel Randsfjord was sunk. On 28 June, the British ship Llanarth was torpedoed, followed by Beignon on 1 July and the Egyptian Angele Mabro on 6 July. Following these attacks, U-30 headed back to port. Instead of returning to Wilhelmshaven, however, U-30 put in at Lorient, in France, which had been captured after the fall of that country. In doing so, she became the first German U-boat to enter the port.|$|E
