25|$|Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) — Trigger, {{apparently}} {{so called}} because <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse, {{was the principal}} supporting character earlier in the show's run, although his importance lessened as the series progressed. Lloyd Pack was cast by pure chance: Ray Butt, who hired him to portray Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray. A daft road sweeper most frequently seen in the Nag's Head, Trigger was initially portrayed as a small-time thief, supplying Del with dubious goods. In later episodes he came to adopt the 'village idiot' role, and believes that Rodney's real name is Dave.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} school, {{a young girl}} named Kilala Reno stumbles across a boy {{sleeping}} in her yard. After thinking to herself <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will wake him up, just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders {{who he is and}} where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how she would know if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E
25|$|Coppola's {{next project}} was Jack, which was {{released}} on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so {{at the age of}} ten <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 40-year-old man. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin and Bill Cosby, Jack also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film Big, in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for Jack, he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.|$|E

500|$|Kuhn was {{the only}} Vanderbilt {{baseball}} player named All-Southern by either Cliff Wheatley or Morgan Blake in 1922. Wheatley's choice read, [...] "Vanderbilt's sole representative is [...] "Doc" [...] Kuhn, who came in several lengths ahead of the other shortstops. Kuhn is a wonderful batter and fields well enough in comparison with other Dixie infielders". For Blake, [...] "the best shortstop in the S. I. A. A. was Doc Kuhn of Vanderbilt, a great all-around athlete... <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> big leaguer in action." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor met DeBorah Sharpe in 1977 {{during the}} {{production}} of The Wiz where she was the understudy for Dorothy. They married in 1980 and had a son, Adamah. In his spare time, Taylor often helped teach vulnerable young people {{through a variety of}} projects, including at the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey. He noted [...] "things have come out of the air for me...I'm grateful; that's why I work with kids. I've had a blessing in my career, to have gone as far as I've gone." [...] A 1995 piece in The Plain Dealer described Taylor as [...] "A jolly giant of a man, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> natural force – a mountain, perhaps, who can tell great stories." [...] Taylor was a Christian.|$|E
500|$|Lyashenko {{made his}} NHL debut with the Dallas Stars during the 1999–2000 season, seeing action in 58 games, while {{recording}} six goals and six assists. He also {{spent time with}} the Stars' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate Michigan K-Wings, notching five points in nine games. During his rookie season in the NHL, Lyashenko played center on the Stars second line, earning praise from coach Ken Hitchcock, [...] "His game has risen beyond his years. He's 20 years old in age only. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real good fit for us." [...] The Stars went to the Stanley Cup Finals that season, but lost to the New Jersey Devils. In the Stars' first round playoff series against the Edmonton Oilers, Lyashenko scored the winning goal {{in the first game}} of the series. During the 2000 Western Conference final against the Colorado Avalanche, Lyashenko scored the series clinching goal in game seven. Lyashenko played in 16 playoff games for the Stars. During the playoffs in his rookie season, Hitchcock was happy with Lyashenko's play, saying, [...] "He's an exceptional defensive player -- his offensive skills have improved as the season's gone on." ...|$|E

50|$|Anansi is {{depicted}} in many different ways. Sometimes <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ordinary spider, sometimes he is a spider wearing clothes or with a human face and sometimes <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> much more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> human with spider elements, such as eight legs.|$|R
500|$|Manga, anime, video-game {{and related}} media {{publications}} have praised and criticized the character. Sheena McNeil {{of the online}} magazine Sequential Tart liked Allen's design, calling his anti-Akuma weapon [...] "quite impressive" [...] in visually represents his strength. According to McNeil, the combination of his cursed left eye and his white hair make him [...] "much more striking". Anime News Network's Casey Brienza also praised his design, saying that <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "visual kei rock star" [...] and calling him [...] "a nice change of pace" [...] from other shōnen protagonists. Allen's abilities were described as [...] "rather inspired" [...] by Michael Aronson in Manga Life magazine. Brian Henson of Mania Beyond Entertainment wrote that Allen's mysterious, cursed eye might appeal to series readers. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network wrote that Allen did not use [...] "cleverness" [...] to defeat Akuma, letting his arm [...] "overpower the enemy". Allen {{was described as a}} [...] "solid" [...] hero by A.E. Sparrow of IGN. Writing that the character's use of the anti-Akuma weapon might seem clichéd, Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk found its anime depiction entertaining. Like Casey Brienza, Kevin Leathers of the UK Anime Network noted that Allen differed from the genre's typical main characters. Leathers saw little character development: [...] " [...] is focused on his job, but will always make time for his friends, which while different, isn't interesting {{over a long period of}} time." [...] Tom Tonhat of Escapist magazine called Allen a [...] "good lead character". Active Anime's Sandra Scholes found him mysterious, citing his arrival at the Black Order and the anti-Akuma weapon.|$|E
2500|$|Typical of Brewster's portraits is [...] "Francis O. Watts with Bird" [...] (1805), showing [...] "an {{innocent}} looking {{boy with}} manly features" [...] wearing a nightslip {{and holding a}} bird on his finger and with a string. The surrounding landscape is [...] "strangely low and wildly out of scale—the young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> giant," [...] Genocchio has written. Or he {{looks as if the}} viewer must be lying down, looking up at the child from the ground. Brewster always struggled with the relationship of his figures to the background.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he first}} came into the game I felt he was a huge prospect. For some reason he has {{deteriorated}} in such a big way. Just {{the way he is}} walking back, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> totally lost guy." [...] In the final Test of the series Ramdin struck his second Test century, managing 107 not out. At the fall of the ninth wicket Ramdin was joined by Tino Best and the pair built a 143-run partnership, the highest stand for the tenth wicket by the West Indies and the third highest in Test history. On reaching his century, Ramdin produced a piece of paper from his pocket on which he had written a message for Richards the night before. The message read [...] "Yeah Viv Talk Nah". The ICC fined Ramdin 20% of his match fee for [...] "conduct contrary to the spirit of the game".|$|E

2500|$|Many Cuban exiles {{have spoken}} of Guevara in {{unfavorable}} terms, {{and he is}} remembered by some with the epithet [...] "The Butcher of la Cabaña", a reference to Guevara’s post-revolutionary role as [...] "supreme prosecutor" [...] over the revolutionary tribunals at the fortress. Similar disapproval has been shared by Cuban-American actor and director Andy García, who alleged in 2004 that [...] "Che has been romanticized over the years, {{but there is a}} darker side to his story. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rock star, but he executed a lot of people without trial or defense." [...] Garcia's 2005 film The Lost City, portrays what could be perceived by some, as the brutality of pre and post revolution Cuba, including Che. In reference to such polarization, Cuban-American academic Uva de Aragon has hypothesized that [...] "we'll still have to wait many years for history to deliver a definite judgement on Che, when the passions of both sides have passed." ...|$|E
2500|$|... : Akira is the {{character}} {{for whom the}} story is named. He has immense, almost godlike psychic powers, although from outward appearances <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small, normal child. He {{is responsible for the}} destruction of Tokyo and the beginning of World War III. After the war, he was placed in cryogenics not far from the crater created by him, and the future site of the Neo-Tokyo Olympic Games. Shortly after being awoken by Tetsuo, he causes the destruction of Neo-Tokyo during a confrontation between Kaneda and the Colonel's forces. Later in the story he becomes Emperor of the Great Tokyo Empire. When he first appears, Akira has not aged in the decades he was kept frozen. Akira is essentially an empty shell; his powers have overwritten and destroyed his personality, leaving someone who almost never speaks or reacts to external stimuli, with a constant blank expression on his face. In the end he is shot by Ryu while psychically synced with the increasingly unstable Tetsuo. It is at this moment he is reunited with his friends and regains his personality.|$|E
