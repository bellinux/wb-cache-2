40|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>marking</b> is a print {{defect in}} flexography. It {{appears as a}} uniformly spaced pattern of lateral {{alternating}} dark and light bands along the web length corresponding to the distance between gear teeth. A comprehensive definition characterizes <b>gear</b> <b>marking</b> as a regular pattern attributable to metal burrs, nicks, debris, or other flaws that lead to unsmooth movement somewhere in the mechanical system of the press. <b>Gear</b> <b>marking</b> {{can be caused by}} a multitude of different factors. In most cases, <b>gear</b> <b>marking</b> results from more than one phenomenon. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate some factors that were expected to contribute to both the causes and the severity of flexographic <b>gear</b> <b>marking.</b> The factors studied (independent variables) included plate hardness, and surface speed differential between the plate image area and the substrate when <b>gear</b> <b>mark</b> severity was the dependent variable of the study. The test target were designed and printed on the RIT 2 ̆ 7 s Mark Andy 4120 System narrow-web press. To study the effect of plate hardness, three plate types with different hardness, 40 Shore A, 50 Shore A, and 60 Shore A, were used. To study the effect of surface speed differential, two types of stickybacks, 0. 015 inch and 0. 020 inch, were used to create variations in surface speed differentials. Six pressruns were performed; the first three pressruns were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 015 -inch stickybacks and the others were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 020 -inch stickybacks. A group of thirty observers at the Rochester Institute of Technology were asked to participate in press sheet visual evaluation by ranking six sample press sheets in terms of <b>gear</b> <b>mark</b> severity. The Verity IA software was used to measure the horizontal bar defect indices on sample sheets of six pressruns for the quantitative analysis of <b>gear</b> <b>mark</b> severity. The results indicated that plate hardness and differential in surface speed affected the <b>gear</b> <b>mark</b> severity in flexography significantly. A lower plate hardness will produce more noticeable in <b>gear</b> <b>marking</b> than a higher one. A higher differential in surface speed will produce more noticeable in <b>gear</b> <b>marking</b> than a lower differential...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} an iterative sequential random utility model {{to investigate the}} social and environmental determinants of the spatiotemporal decision process of tuna purse-seine fishery fishing effort in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Operations of the fishing <b>gear</b> <b>mark</b> checkpoints in a continuous complex decision-making process. Individual fisher behavior is modeled by identifying diversified choices over decision-space for an entire fishing trip, which allows inclusion of prior and current vessel locations and conditions among the explanatory variables. Among these factors are vessel capacity; departure and arrival port; duration of the fishing trip; daily and cumulative distance travelled, which provides a proxy for operation costs; expected revenue; oceanographic conditions; and tons of fish on board. The model uses a two-step decision process to capture {{the probability of a}} vessel choosing a specific fishing region for the first set and the probability of switching to (or staying in) a specific region to fish before returning to its landing port.

50|$|Owing to a {{shortage}} of Messier-built landing gear and hydraulics, Dowty-built landing gear were used on some aircraft instead.

500|$|Although {{no major}} {{problems}} were encountered {{during the initial}} testing phase, some minor issues with the landing gear and flight control system had to be rectified. The former problem was {{partly due to the}} tandem main landing gear being very narrow, in order to fit into the wings; the leg shortened in length and rotated as it was stowed. During one landing incident, the chain mechanism (used to shorten the <b>gear)</b> in the <b>Mark</b> 1 <b>gear</b> jammed, resulting in incomplete rotation. [...] In a second incident with Arrow 202 on 11 November 1958, the flight control system commanded elevons full down at landing; the resulting reduction in weight on the gears reduced the effective tire friction, ultimately resulting in brake lockup and subsequent gear collapse. A photograph taken of the incident proved that inadvertent flight control activation had caused the accident. The only occasion when a test flight was diverted occurred on 2 February 1959, when a TCA Viscount crash-landed in Toronto, necessitating a landing at CFB Trenton.|$|R

40|$|Studies {{examining}} learners’ text marking displayed some limitations. First, for {{the most}} part these studies measured recall as a learning outcome. Very few studies measured inference and none measured transfer. Second, when describing marked text, these studies mainly used two categories: high and low level sentences, and main and subordinate ideas. This classification is insufficient to explore the relationship between learners’ text marking and expected learning outcomes. Third, studies providing instructions for learners on what and how much to <b>mark</b> <b>geared</b> learners towards one learning outcome; mostly recall, thus missed on capturing the effects of different prompts that direct learners’ expectations to more than one outcome. This research used nStudy, an online learning tool that allows learners to mark text and logs detailed traces of marking, and provided a detailed description of what and how much learners’ marked, using a set of sentence identifiers, such as terms, explanations, main ideas, consequences…etc., when learners are requested to study for recall and transfer tasks. The study also tested the effect of learners’ marking on learners’ performance on recall and transfer tasks. Moreover, it examined the effect of showing learners examples of kinds of information relevant to answering recall or transfer test questions on learners’ performance. Findings reveal that recall and transfer prompts do have an effect on learners’ total marking and some of the categories learners choose to mark. Also, marking text related to recall/ transfer questions enhances learners’ performance on these tasks. Moreover, in transfer tasks, marking parts of text unrelated to transfer questions did enhance learners’ performance in those tasks. On the other hand, showing learners’ examples of kinds of information relevant to answering recall and transfer test questions do not have an effect on learners’ marking nor performance on transfer and recall tests. These findings suggest that the goal/reason learners have when they are marking affects their marking as well as their learning...|$|R
