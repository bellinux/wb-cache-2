5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the outer <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E

In 1999 RTÉ tested opt out for Dublin, Cork and Galway on UHF signals, however Chorus (a Dublin cable operator at the time) aired the Galway edition, while NTL (the other Dublin cable operator aired the Dublin version). RTÉ do not provide local opt-out or regional news. However RTÉ Cork produces {{a number of other}} Irish shows. Capital D was a programme for Dublin (similar in style to Nationwide), presented by Anne Cassin, it took a look at issues in Dublin.

25|$|Guizot's view of {{politics}} was essentially historical and philosophical. His tastes and his acquirements gave him little {{insight into the}} practical business of administrative government. Of finance he knew nothing; trade and commerce were strange to him; military and naval affairs were unfamiliar to him; all these subjects he dealt with by second hand through his friends, Pierre Sylvain Dumon (1797–1870), Charles Marie Tanneguy, Comte Duchâttel (1803–1867), or Marshal Bugeaud. The consequence was that few measures of practical improvement were carried by his administration. Still less did the government lend an <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cry for parliamentary reform.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Nasrullah {{actively}} {{used his}} political power {{to assist the}} German-Turkish efforts. When the Turko-German Niedermayer-Hentig expedition was welcomed to Kabul in 1915 (despite promises to the Viceroy of India that the expedition would be arrested), Nasrullah provided a friendly <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mission after Habibullah reaffirmed Afghanistan's neutrality. Nasrullah was involved in introducing the expedition to journalist Mahmud Tarzi, whose papers began taking an increasingly anti-British stance. He also continued to entreat the mission to remain in Kabul despite Habibullah's unwillingness to offer them a solid alliance. Finally in 1916 Nasrullah offered to remove Habibullah from power and {{take charge of the}} frontier tribes in a campaign against British India, but by then the mission realised such action would be fruitless and declined.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} period of Portuguese rule, Goan Catholic women {{were married in}} whites saris (hol) and changed into a red dress or sari, known as saddo, at home. Women of the upper strata wore the Fota-Kimao after the Church ceremony. Fota was a blouse made of red velvet and satin with a black border and {{embroidered}} with gold thread. Accessories used along with the fota included a variety of jewellery worn on the head, ears, neck, and arms. The fator was an ornament that consisted of a green stone between two corals held by double chains. Together with the fator, women wore a set of five intricate chains known as contti, and other chains. Women wore bangles known as nille with matching carap on their ears. They also wore few small chains from the <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head, combs made of gold (dantoni), silver, or tortoise shell, and rings on every finger. During the later period of Portuguese rule, women got married in Western clothes. The Cordao (wedding necklace) was a necklace of with two black-beaded chains reminiscent to the Hindu Mangalsutra, interspersed with roughly twenty gold coins, which formed a gold pendant, often {{in the shape of}} Jesus or the cross. A widow had to wear black clothes {{for the rest of her}} life and was not allowed to wear ornaments.|$|E

Undercoat is very dense and normally lighter in color than the outer coat. The hair on the front sides of the legs and the head is short and smooth. Hair on the ears diminishes in length {{from the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tips. The hair on the neck, the buttocks, the tail, and {{the back side of the}} legs is longer resulting in a ruff at the neck, breeches on the buttocks and backs of the legs, and feathering on the tail.

Cool noted that, [...] "It's got the sarcasm, it's got the snottiness, but it's got a little {{light at the end}} of the tunnel." [...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority". [...] This was inspired by Armstrong's fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was going to lose the 2000 U.S. presidential election and that [...] "someone really conservative" [...] would take office. He recalled, [...] "We've always tried to keep an <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground and keep our eyes open to what's going on...that's one reason why I was really taking my time writing songs to really [...] Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the lyrics of [...] "Minority" [...] serve as [...] "a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day's early work". [...] "Misery" [...] tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a [...] "lot lizard", a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate highway truck stops. [...] "Blood, Sex and Booze" [...] explores the subject of sadomasochism.|$|E

Bowers says both reviews were probably adapted from a [...] "canned" [...] review supplied by Thanhouser. Though it is uncertain if the review by The Moving Picture World which was issued on October 15 was picked up and reused by the The Moving Picture News for the November 5 edition. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer offered praise for the production in its summary, [...] "The Thanhouser players get considerable humor out of this comedy which is quite cleverly constructed and well acted. Leon is a waiter in a table d'hote restaurant. He bids his fat sweetheart, the restaurant cashier, good-bye and goes on his vacation, stopping at a seaside resort where he poses as a foreign count, captivates the ladies, and finds a rich mamma who wants to marry him to her daughter. The engagement gets into the papers, his fat sweetheart in town reads the news and takes the next train to the seaside hotel, where she makes short work of Leon, leading him off by the <b>ear,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great delight of the rich girl and her American lover.
