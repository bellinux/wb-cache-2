5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} first converts the AC mains to a <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> {{by means of a}} bridge rectifier or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this <b>DC</b> <b>bus.</b> The problem with this is that the rectifier is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at harmonics of the frequency of the voltage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{switched-mode}} power supply, a boost converter is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the <b>DC</b> <b>bus.</b> This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{designed}} and implemented a power converter {{to provide a}} <b>dc</b> power <b>bus</b> for the MCOR 12 correction supply. The characteristics of the <b>dc</b> power <b>bus</b> are variable frequency at both heavy and medium or light loads. These characteristics match the working requirement of the correction supply. The <b>dc</b> power <b>bus</b> has a relaxation oscillator that generates a symmetric triangular waveform, to which MOSFET switching is locked. The frequency of this waveform is related to a voltage to be modulated with feedback circuitry. As a result, the circuit and complex transformer are driven with a half-bridge. We designed the complex resonant transformer and describe in this paper a simulation model that is highly important, thus to exploit its frequency-dependent transfer characteristics. We obtained a power bus with small ripple to provide the correction power. The high-performance characteristics of the resonant <b>dc</b> power <b>bus</b> are illustrated in this paper...|$|R

500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> voltage or up to 3.1times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure. [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with rise time {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dtfilter.|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{powerline}} communication is developed to reduce cable requirements for robotic, electromechanical, and vehicular systems. A <b>DC</b> power <b>bus</b> line connecting a DC power supply to motor drives and sensor units is used for transmitting both data and DC power. Unlike conventional AC powerline communication, the <b>DC</b> power <b>bus</b> provides amenable and predictable noise characteristics and desirable impedance characteristics that allow for large fanout and high bandwidth. First the basic architecture of DC powerline communication is presented, followed by verification of the feasibility of using a <b>DC</b> power <b>bus</b> as a communication medium. A high-fanout modem is then designed using a Guanella type transmission line transformer (TLT). The modem characteristics including high-frequency parasitic dynamics are analyzed, and the overall line impedance and signal attenuation are evaluated {{as the number of}} nodes goes to infinity. A prototype DC powerline communication system is then designed, built, and tested. The serial windings and special resonance characteristics of TLT coupled with a capacitor are exploited to minimize attenuation in high fanout systems. As a result the prototype modem can broadcast data to more than 100 nodes simultaneously. by Eric R. Wade. Thesis (S. M.)
