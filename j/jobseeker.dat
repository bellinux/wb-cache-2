25|$|A {{basic income}} (or {{negative}} income tax) {{is a system}} of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally. It is argued that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as {{there would be no}} risk of destitution for not taking the employment. As a result, the <b>jobseeker</b> could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they could wait until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills in university, which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on Basic Income and NIT in Canada and the USA show that people spent more time studying while the program was running.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In December 1998, 15 {{percent of}} {{unemployed}} <b>jobseekers,</b> and 7 percent of employed persons used {{the internet to}} look for a new job. Conditioning on internet access from home, internet job search rates rise to 50 percent of unemployed <b>jobseekers</b> and 15 percent of the employed. Only 9 percent of black, and 7 percent of Hispanic unemployed <b>jobseekers</b> conduct on-line job search, compared to 16 percent of whites. Statistically, this gap is completely explained by differential access to technology: conditional on home internet access, both black and Hispanic unemployed <b>jobseekers</b> are more likely than whites to search on line. Rather than abandoning other methods of job search, unemployed <b>jobseekers</b> who search on line are more likely to use other “traditional ” job search methods than those who do not search on line. Over time, there is as yet little evidence that expanding internet use has changed the mix of “traditional ” job search methods used by unemployed <b>jobseekers...</b>|$|R

The research involved three longitudinal quantitative surveys. Customers were interviewed previously about their experiences of Jobcentre Plus support between weeks 0 – 13, 13 – 26 and 26 – 52 of their <b>Jobseeker’s</b> Allowance claim. The longitudinal surveys discussed in this report were conducted a year later to explore experiences and longer-term destinations for customers undergoing the <b>Jobseekers</b> Regime in Phase 1 areas and the former <b>Jobseeker’s</b> Allowance regime in Phase 2 areas. Comparisons between the two phases provide an indication of the <b>Jobseekers</b> Regime in contrast to its predecessor but they do not constitute an impact assessment. The research also included a small number of qualitative interviews with customers about their experiences of Stage 3 of the <b>Jobseekers</b> Regime, as delivered in summer-autumn 2010. These additional interviews were conducted in November/December 2010 and were designed to provide an update to previous qualitative research conducted between December 2009 and March 2010, reflecting Stage 3 as it was experienced in 2009 (see DWP Research Report 706, <b>Jobseekers</b> Regime and Flexible New Deal Evaluation: A report on qualitative research findings) ...|$|R
