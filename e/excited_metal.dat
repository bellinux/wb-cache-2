30|$|In {{previous}} works[9, 11], a plasmon resonance {{theory is}} widely used to explain SERS enhancement. In this theory, the LSPR effect of metal nanoparticles {{plays an important role}} in Raman signal amplification because the electromagnetic field strength on the metal particle surface becomes strongest when LSPR is <b>excited.</b> <b>Metal</b> films that serve as SERS substrates often need high particle deposition density to form ‘hot spots’ in the narrow gap regions between neighboring particles, which can harvest high electromagnetic field to enhance the Raman signal[15]. From Figure 3 d, one can find that many narrow gaps with sub- 10 -nm distance are clearly formed between neighboring particles on the film. These regions can produce a strong LSPR effect on the surface of the thin film when GNPs are excited by the incident light and enable the Raman characteristic peaks of R 6 G at a very low concentration to be easily detected. Compared with the previous works[17, 27], Raman signal enhancement is also observed in similar GNP films because of the presence of narrow gaps. For instance, in[17], R 6 G at an extremely low concentration of 10 − 9 M was successfully identified using nanosphere arrays with sub- 10 -nm gaps as sensitive SERS substrates.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The plasmon-induced {{photocatalytic}} {{reduction of}} bromate (BrO 3 -) {{was investigated in}} visible-light irradiated Au-Ag-AgI/Al 2 O 3 suspension. The Br- 3 (-) reduction process was studied in detail. RESULTS: The catalyst {{was found to be}} highly effective for the reduction of Br- 3 (-) from pH 3 to 6. An enhancement of the electrical interaction between Br- 3 (-) and the positively charged surface of the photocatalyst favored adsorption and reduction of Br- 3 (-). Organic compounds such as ethanol could react as sacrificial electron donors with excited holes (h(+)) on the metal nanoparticles (NPs) to accelerate electron transfer, inhibiting the release of metal ions and the recombination of h(+) and electrons, hence promoting photocatalytic reduction of Br- 3 (-). Electron quenching and cyclic voltammetry studies under a variety of experimental conditions verified that Br- 3 (-) trapped conduction band electrons of AgI from the <b>excited</b> <b>metal</b> NPs were reduced, competing with O- 2. CONCLUSION: The photocatalyst Au-Ag-AgI/Al 2 O 3 exhibited particularly good reduction of Br- 3 (-) under visible-light irradiation. The Br- 3 (-) reduction was highly favored at acidic condition due to the greater adsorption of Br- 3 (-) onto the catalyst. This finding indicates that this visible-light-driven catalyst could be applied to the reduction of some oxidative pollutants or even simultaneous removal of both oxidative and reductive pollutants.

Our aim is to identify new line-ratio diagnostics to discriminate between gas photoionization by active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation. We use a standard photoionization code to compute the emission from AGN narrow-line regions and compare this with calculations of the nebular emission from star-forming galaxies achieved using the same code. We confirm the appropriateness of widely used optical spectral diagnostics of nuclear activity versus star formation and explore new diagnostics at ultraviolet wavelengths.

These objects were tentatively identified as Rydberg lines of ultra-high <b>excited</b> <b>metals</b> in ionization stages V-X, indicating line formation in a dense environment with temperatures near one million Kelvin. Since some features show blueward extensions, it was {{argued that they}} stem from a superionized wind. A unique assignment of the lines to particular elements is not possible, although they probably stem from C, N, O, and Ne. To further investigate this phenomenon, we analyzed the ultraviolet spectra available from only three stars of this group; that is, two helium-rich white dwarfs, HE 0504 - 2408 and HS 0713 + 3958 with spectral type DO, and a hydrogen-rich white dwarf, HS 2115 + 1148 with spectral type DAO.

40|$|The {{influence}} of radiative non-equilibrium on {{the occupation of}} <b>excited</b> <b>metal</b> states in flames can be investigated by measuring the deviation ΔT of line reversal (or excitation) temperature TL from “true” (or translation) temperature Tt of the flame {{as a function of}} metal concentration. In this paper it is shown that, under certain conditions concerning the rates of the de-excitation processes, the measurements of ΔT for atoms with close lying upper levels (such as the alkali atoms) may be interpreted by assuming a single excitation level. In that case, the fluorescence yield YD, obtained when both lines are used in excitation and measured in fluorescence, occurs as a parameter in the expressions which describe the behavior of ΔT for low and high metal densities. The theoretical relationships were checked by comparing the experimental values of YD and ΔT for the yellow sodium doublet in a typical hydrogen-oxygen-argon flame. Satisfactory agreement was found. In order to determine more reliably the low density asymptote of the excitation temperature, the variation of ΔT with atomic density was theoretically analysed to first order in the density. Fluorescence yield factors were again measured for several alkali lines with an improved experimental set-up and agreed with our previous results, (1, 2, 3) except for the sodium doublet.

40|$|A two-step thermo-chemical cycle {{process has}} been developed. It is based on metal oxide redox pair systems, which are able to {{reversibly}} incorporating oxygen atoms them into their lattice. CO 2 and water {{can be reduced to}} CO and hydrogen by solar-powered thermo-chemical cycles. Concentrated solar radiation and high temperatures are necessary for this. The product synthesis gas is a precursor for a broad variety of chemical commodities and in particular fuels. Straightforward operation is ensured by the combination of a ceramic substrate as absorber structure, which can be heated to high temperatures with concentrated solar radiation, and of a metal oxide coating which is capable of splitting water. This offers advantages over comparable processes, because in this case the entire process can be conducted in a single solar heated converter. In the first step, the steam or CO 2 flowing past the metal oxide is split by binding the oxygen to the <b>excited</b> <b>metal</b> oxide lattice, and H 2 or CO are produced. In the second step, the oxygen, which has previously been incorporated into the lattice, is released again by applying high temperatures an oxygen-lean atmosphere, and the metal oxide is regenerated. The suitability of different redox materials for this process was screened by thermo-chemical calculations. Some promising candidates have been identified after investigating them as powders and coated on ceramic substrates in dedicated laboratory set-ups. A related process to be run on a solar power tower plant was developed. An operational and control strategy has been derived, validated firstly a mini-plant in DLR solar furnace in Cologne and finally applied for water splitting during the test operation of a pilot-scale plant on a solar tower near Almería in the South of Spain.

40|$|Simple {{models of}} galaxy {{formation}} {{in a cold}} dark matter universe predict that massive galaxies are surrounded by a hot, quasi-hydrostatic circumgalactic corona of slowly cooling gas, predominantly accreted from the intergalactic medium (IGM). This prediction is {{borne out by the}} recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Crain et al., which reproduce observed scaling relations between the X-ray and optical properties of nearby disc galaxies. Such coronae are metal poor, but observations of the X-ray emitting circumgalactic medium (CGM) of local galaxies typically indicate enrichment to near-solar iron abundance, potentially signalling a shortcoming in current models of galaxy formation. We show here that, while the hot CGM of galaxies formed in the simulations is typically metal poor in a mass-weighted sense, its X-ray luminosity-weighted metallicity is often close to solar. This bias arises because the soft X-ray emissivity of a typical ∼ 0. 1 [*]keV corona is dominated by collisionally <b>excited</b> <b>metal</b> ions that are synthesized in stars and recycled into the hot CGM. We find that these metals are ejected primarily by stars that form in situ to the main progenitor of the galaxy, rather than in satellites or external galaxies. The enrichment of the hot CGM therefore proceeds in an ‘inside–out’ fashion throughout the assembly of the galaxy: metals are transported from the central galaxy by supernova-driven winds and convection over several Gyr, establishing a strong negative radial metallicity gradient. Whilst metal ions synthesized by stars are necessary to produce the X-ray emissivity that enables the hot CGM of isolated galaxies to be detected with current instrumentation, the electrons that collisionally excite them are equally important. Since our simulations indicate that the electron density of hot coronae is dominated by the metal-poor gas accreted from the IGM, we infer that the hot CGM observed via X-ray emission is the outcome of both hierarchical accretion and stellar recycling...|$|E
