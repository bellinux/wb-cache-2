5|$|Because of {{the great}} success of the Troilus, the love story was popular as a <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> tale to be retold by English-language writers {{throughout}} the 15th and 16th centuries and into the 17th century. The theme was treated either seriously or in burlesque. For many authors, true Troilus, false Cresseid and pandering Pandarus became ideal types eventually {{to be referred to}} together as such in Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> {{monolith}} pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary farm {{buildings}} {{associated with the}} mansion include the original springhouse. To {{the rear of the}} home the oldest section of residence can be seen. The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east of the house is the family burial ground. Behind the house is a flower garden. The slave cemetery lies beyond the flower garden. Documented but no longer existing buildings include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E

A framework has fallen away, but what is of greater importance is friendship and getting together as one nation — as white people who have to defend their future together.

25|$|In Italy towers {{are almost}} always <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> and the {{position}} is often dictated by the landform of the site, rather than aesthetics.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the normal hospital based emergency departments a trend has developed in some states (including Texas and Colorado) of emergency departments not attached to hospitals. These new emergency departments {{are referred to as}} <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> emergency departments. The rationale for these operations is the ability to operate outside of hospital policies that may lead to increased wait times and reduced patient satisfaction.|$|E

25|$|The Nativity {{has been}} {{depicted}} {{in many different}} media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, panel paintings, manuscript illuminations, stained glass windows and oil paintings. The subject of the Nativity is often used for altarpieces, many of these combining both painted and sculptural elements. Other sculptural representations of the Nativity include ivory miniatures, carved stone sarcophagi, architectural features such as capitals and door lintels, and <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> sculptures.|$|E

It {{is home to}} the Ostankino Tower, the tallest <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> structure in Europe; the Federation Tower, the tallest skyscraper in Europe; and the Moscow International Business Center. By its territorial expansion on July 1, 2012 southwest into the Moscow Oblast, the area of the capital more than doubled, going from , and it gained an additional population of 233,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Residential {{architecture}} is not {{defined by a}} single architectural style, but rather {{an eclectic mix of}} houses, townhouses, condominiums, and apartment buildings in the metropolitan area (particularly in areas of urban sprawl). <b>Free</b> <b>standing</b> dwellings with relatively large gardens are perhaps {{the most common type of}} housing outside inner city Melbourne. Victorian terrace housing, townhouses and historic Italianate, Tudor revival and Neo-Georgian mansions are all common in neighbourhoods such as Toorak.|$|E

25|$|Flooding in the Holderness Level {{increased}} between 1840 and 1880, {{as farmers}} used tile drains {{to keep their}} land <b>free</b> of <b>standing</b> water. These carried the water away more quickly to the main drains, increasing the peak flow. Where this drained into the upland drain, {{this was not a}} problem, but where it entered the lowland drain, it caused difficulties, particularly when Marfleet was tide locked. Following the successful introduction of steam pumping on the Beverley and Barmston drain, {{to the west of the}} River Hull, the Trustees looked at the possibility of installing pumps as Marfleet. However, help came from another source.|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{uncertainty}} over the number of buildings on the site, primarily due to recent surface disturbance. For example, Unit VI {{appears to have been}} transected by a tractor since the 1960s when Patterson first reported it as a complete structure. In 1983, a surface survey determined that there were eleven buildings in total, seven of which were still <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> structures; though archaeologists are uncertain if more buildings once stood on the site.|$|E
25|$|Baptisteries {{often occur}} in Italy as a <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> structure, {{associated}} with a cathedral. They are generally octagonal or circular and domed. The interior may be arcaded on several levels as at Pisa Cathedral. Other notable Romanesque baptisteries are that at Parma Cathedral remarkable for its galleried exterior, and the polychrome Baptistery of San Giovanni of Florence Cathedral, with vault mosaics of the 13th century including Christ in Majesty, possibly {{the work of the}} almost legendary Coppo di Marcovaldo.|$|E

It promotes the formation of social groupings which tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress their difference from the common world by disguise or other means.|$|R
