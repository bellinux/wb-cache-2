60|$|The {{consequence}} {{of all this}} is, that except now and then by chance, {{the form of a}} complete leaf is never seen; but a marvellous and quaint confusion, very definite, indeed, in its evidence of direction of growth, and unity of action, but wholly indefinable and inextricable, part by part, by any amount of patience. You cannot possibly work it out in <b>fac</b> <b>simile,</b> though you took a twelvemonth's time to a tree; and you must therefore try to discover some mode of execution which will more or less imitate, by its own variety and mystery, the variety and mystery of Nature, without absolute delineation of detail.|$|E

Even the dignity of Captain Walter Waters relaxed, to that degree, that he suffered himself to be prevailed upon by Mr. Joseph Tuggs, to partake of cold pigeon-pie and sherry, on deck; and a most delightful conversation, aided by these agreeable stimulants, was prolonged, until they ran alongside Ramsgate Pier.|$|E

6000|$|... § 8. To these beds {{we shall}} return presently, our object just now being {{to examine the}} aiguille, which, on the Montanvert, forms the most {{conspicuous}} mass of mountain {{on the right of}} the spectator. It is known in Chamouni as the Aiguille des Charmoz, and is distinguished by a very sharp horn or projection on its side, which usually attracts the traveller's attention {{as one of the most}} singular minor features in the view from the Montanvert. The larger masses of the whole aiguille, and true contour of this horn, are carefully given in plate +30+, Fig. 2, as they are seen in morning sunshine. The impression which travellers usually carry away with them is, I presume, to be gathered from Fig. 1, a <b>fac</b> <b>simile</b> of one of the lithographs purchased with avidity by English travellers, in the shops of Chamouni and Geneva, as giving a faithful representation of this aiguille seen from the Montanvert. It is worth while to perpetuate this example of the ideal landscape of the nineteenth century, popular at the time when the works of Turner were declared by the public to be extravagant and unnatural.|$|E
6000|$|My dear Brothers--I am safe at Southampton--after having ridden {{three stages}} outside {{and the rest}} in for it began to be very cold. I {{did not know the}} Names of any of the Towns I passed through--all I {{can tell you is that}} {{sometimes}} I saw dusty Hedges--sometimes Ponds--then nothing--then a little Wood with trees look you like Launce's Sister [...] "as white as a Lily and as small as a Wand"--then came houses which died away into a few straggling Barns--then came hedge trees aforesaid again. As the Lamplight crept along the following things were discovered--"long heath broom furze"--Hurdles here and there half a Mile--Park palings when the Windows of a House were always discovered by reflection--One Nymph of Fountain--N.B. Stone--lopped Trees--Cow ruminating--ditto Donkey--Man and Woman going gingerly along--William seeing his Sisters over the Heath--John waiting with a Lanthorn for his Mistress--Barber's Pole--Doctor's Shop--However after having had my fill of these I popped my Head out just as it began to Dawn--N.B. this Tuesday Morn saw the Sun rise--of which I shall say nothing at present. I felt rather lonely this Morning at Breakfast so I went and unbox'd a Shakspeare--"There's my Comfort."[11] I went immediately after Breakfast to Southampton Water where I enquired for the Boat to the Isle of Wight as I intend seeing that place before I settle--it will go at 3, so shall I after having taken a Chop. I know nothing of this place but that it is long--tolerably broad--has bye streets--two or three Churches--a very respectable old Gate with two Lions to guard it. The Men and Women do not materially differ from those I have been in the Habit of seeing. I forgot to say that from dawn till half-past six I went through a most delightful Country--some open Down but for the most part thickly wooded. What surprised me most was an immense quantity of blooming Furze on each side the road cutting a most rural dash. The Southampton water when I saw it just now was no better than a low Water Water which did no more than answer my expectations--it will have mended its Manners by 3. From the Wharf are seen the shores on each side stretching to the Isle of Wight. You, Haydon, Reynolds, etc. have been pushing each other out of my Brain by turns. I have conned over every Head in Haydon's Picture--you must warn them not to be afraid should my Ghost visit them on Wednesday--tell Haydon to Kiss his Hand at Betty over the Way for me yea and to spy at her for me. I hope one of you will be competent to take part in a Trio while I am away--you need only aggravate your voices a little and mind not to speak Cues and all--when you have said Rum-ti-ti--you must not be rum any more or else another will take up the ti-ti alone and then he might be taken God shield us for little better than a Titmouse. By the by talking of Titmouse Remember me particularly to all my Friends--give my Love to the Miss Reynoldses and to Fanny who I hope you will soon see. Write to me soon about them all--and you George particularly how you get on with Wilkinson's plan. What could I have done without my Plaid? I don't feel inclined to write any more at present for I feel rather muzzy--you must be content with this <b>fac</b> <b>simile</b> of the rough plan of Aunt Dinah's Counterpane.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technology}} is relatively simple. An image is made using non-conductive ink {{on a piece}} of tin foil. A stylus, that is in the electrical circuit of the tin foil, is then passed over the foil where it lightly touches it. The stylus passes with parallel scans slightly apart. Electricity conducts where there is no ink and does not where there is ink. This causes on and off circuits matching the image as it scans. The signals are then sent along a long distance telegraph line. The receiver at the other end has an electrical stylus and scans blue dye ink on white paper reproducing the image line-by-line, a <b>fac</b> <b>simile</b> (Latin, [...] "make similar") of the original image.|$|E

He spent much of his time there. His collection of books was a <b>fac</b> <b>simile</b> of Friar Baeon's Study, because his library was similar to Roger Bacon's books and manuscripts. Maurice was associated with the antiquary Robert Vaughan in the collecting and maintaining of these ancient Welsh manuscripts and books that ultimately became a collection of the Hengwrt-Peniarth library, {{an important part of the}} National Library of Wales. Maurice cataloged the Hengwrt manuscript collection in 1658. Many manuscripts are in Maurice's own hand.|$|E
5000|$|A {{facsimile}} (from Latin <b>fac</b> <b>simile</b> ('make alike'), a spelling {{that remained}} in currency {{until the late}} 19th century) is a copy or reproduction of an old book, manuscript, map, art print, or other item of historical value that is as true to the original source as possible. It differs from other forms of reproduction by attempting to replicate the source as accurately as possible in scale, color, condition, and other material qualities. For books and manuscripts, this also entails a complete copy of all pages; hence, an incomplete copy is a [...] "partial facsimile". Facsimiles are sometimes used by scholars to research a source {{that they do not}} have access to otherwise, and by museums and archives for media preservation and conservation. Many are sold commercially, often accompanied by a volume of commentary. They may be produced in limited editions, typically of 500-2,000 copies, and cost the equivalent of a few thousand United States dollars. The term [...] "fax" [...] is a shortened form of [...] "facsimile" [...] though most faxes are not reproductions of the quality expected in a true facsimile.|$|E

There are about five hundred candidates (500) for the honor, each of whom will have his name neatly engraved on the buckle to which the medal is attached. The medal itself is of bronze, {{about the size of the}} silver dollar of blessed memory, and bears upon its obverse in bold relief, a very accurate representation of Fort Sumter at the termination of the first bombardment, taken from an original drawing by Mr. W.T. CRANE, with the legend [...] "Fort Sumter, Aug. 23, 1863," [...] the whole encircled by a border of stars. Upon the reverse in this inscription, in raised letters: [...] "For gallant and meritorious conduct. Presented by Q.A. GILLMORE, Major-General." [...] The name of Gen.

40|$|No life of {{the first}} circumnavigator of Australia has {{hitherto}} appeared in English. Nothing has been accessible to the English reader but an abstract of one voyage and a few lines in biographical dictionaries. This is scarcely surprising, when we consider how careless Tasman's own countrymen have been of his fame. Fifty years ago all that had been printed {{in his own country}} consisted of short abstracts of a few voyages, and these were hidden away in bulky collections. Even the date and place of his birth were matter for conjecture and dispute. Things are somewhat better now. Thirty-five years ago the complete journal of his famous voyage of 1642 was published in Holland, and we are now promised a sumptuous <b>fac</b> <b>simile</b> edition of the original manuscript, with notes by two eminent scholars, and with an English translation. Moreover, patient searchers in the Dutch Colonial Archives have for years past been laboriously gleaning scattered particulars respecting him, and the results of their investigations have been printed {{from time to time in}} the transactions of Dutch learned societies, and in other places. It has thus become possible to piece together a fairly connected account of the great navigator's life. But after all available information has been made use of, the result is disappointing. The man himself remains for the most part an indistinct figure. Personal details are few. The facts are mostly dry and meagre, gathered from formal official despatches and dusty registers. The material is wanting for a biography which would give a clear and sharply defined picture of the man as he lived. It is possible, however, to attain what is of even more interest. We can arrive at a just estimate of his work as a discoverer, and of his place among the great navigators of the world. The discovery of Tasmania and New Zealand was no chance adventure. It was the result of a steady policy. It was the outcome of the adventurous energy which in the 16 th and 17 th centuries created the Dutch Republic; gave to Holland her Colonial Empire; and — not content with her possession of the Eastern Archipelago — sent out her sailors to search for a new world in the unknown regions of the mysterious South. Tasman and Visscher are but types of the men who won for their country her once proud position of mistress of the seas. In the following pages an attempt has been made not merely to give all that is known of Tasman's life and work, but to present that work in proper historical perspective...|$|E
