River boats could navigate the Yukon in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could be hot, while from October to June, during the long winters, temperatures could drop below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E

25|$|This {{stone in}} style Fp was {{reported}} by road construction workers on April 6, 1990. A runologist arrived and noted that it was missing some parts. It was also lying with text upwards and it had probably been dug up and moved by machinery the previous winter <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity. The existence of lichen showed {{that it had not}} been completely covered by soil. Later in the month, an archaeological excavation uncovered two missing pieces of the stone. On the 23rd it was moved to the museum of Sigtuna and on May 16, it was transported to a stonemason who mended the stone.|$|E
25|$|Auf Wiedersehen, Pet was {{a popular}} fictional British comedy-drama series about three Geordies (Dennis, Oz and Neville) leaving England to go and find work in Germany during the heights of {{unemployment}} in Thatcher's Britain.

The three Geordie characters were supposed to be from Birtley Co. Durham (Dennis, played by Tim Healy), Gateshead (Oz, played by Jimmy Nail), and North Shields (Neville, played by Kevin Whately) and all three actors who played them were Geordies themselves.|$|E

25|$|The United States Army {{was slow}} in {{responding}} to the situation, having closed all military posts in Arizona the same year, with the exception of Fort Huachuca. Fort Huachuca, which is relatively close to Naco, sent two companies of Buffalo Soldiers to occupy Naco, Arizona, and prevent the fighting from spreading into American territory. The commander of the detachment positioned his men along the border and had them prepare to attack at a moment's notice while he crossed the border and demanded that the rebel commanders stop dropping bombs on the Arizona side. By this time, however, the rebels were already defeated, and so the Buffalo Soldiers never had to engage. A squadron of eighteen warplanes was also dispatched <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> Texas to shoot down any plane violating American airspace, but it never went into action either, and was withdrawn sometime later without incident.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the legend of}} the Parthian-era {{collation}} engendered a search for a 'Parthian archetype' of the Avesta. In the theory of Friedrich Carl Andreas (1902), the archaic nature of the Avestan texts was assumed to be due to preservation via written transmission, and unusual or unexpected spellings in the surviving texts were assumed to be reflections of errors introduced by Sasanian-era transcription from the Aramaic alphabet-derived Pahlavi scripts. The search for the 'Arsacid archetype' was increasingly criticisized in the 1940s and was eventually abandoned in the 1950s after Karl Hoffmann demonstrated that the inconsistencies noted by Andreas were actually due to unconscious alterations introduced by oral transmission. Hoffmann identifies these changes to be due in part to modifications introduced through recitation; in part to influences from other Iranian languages picked up on the route of transmission <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> eastern Iran (i.e. Central Asia) via Arachosia and Sistan through to Persia; and in part due to the influence of phonetic developments in the Avestan language itself.|$|E
25|$|Among the few recent discoveries {{relating}} to this period are {{the graves of}} five young Viking warriors, {{one of which was}} found at Ship Street Great about 100 metres to the southwest of the Black Pool, the other four being clustered together on the southeastern shore near South Great George's Street. Radiocarbon analysis suggests that all five died in the 9th century, possibly before the establishment of a Viking longphort at Dublin. Oxygen isotope analysis has revealed that two of these warriors were from Scandinavia and two <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> the British Isles, possibly the western coast of Scotland. In total, about one hundred Viking burials from this period have been unearthed in the Dublin region, but most of these discoveries were made serendipitously in the 19th century and few were properly excavated. Most of these burials were accompanied by typical Viking grave goods – swords, spear-heads, shields, daggers, penannular brooches and various decorative items – including hacksilver (i.e. small pieces of silver cut from coins or jewellery and used as currency).|$|E

500|$|The next area along M-185 is also sparsely {{developed}} {{as it passes}} along Griffin Cove. Other than a few newer residential developments, the sights are limited to Brown's Brook, which features a picnic area and interpretive nature trail, and {{the views of the}} Mackinac Bridge as the trunkline rounds both Heriot and Perrot points. Between the markers for miles6 and 7 is Devil's Kitchen, another popular tourist stopping point, at Jacker Point. Near mile7 is the West Bluff Stairs leading up the bluff to Pontiac's Lookout. Further along, there is a marker commemorating the filming of a scene <b>from</b> <b>Somewhere</b> <b>in</b> Time as well as views of the Grand Hotel.

Visible to the east of the hotel is Michigan's second Governor's Mansion, which is used as a summer retreat for the state's chief executive.

500|$|Neuromancer {{was written}} on a [...] "clockwork typewriter," [...] the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> the 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs {{slightly}} less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black [...] "crackle" [...] paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key {{with the tip of}} a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 {{was one of the best}} portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, [...] {{and others}} {{reviewed}} Tschudi's species and re-examined the holotype. Like Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, {{they noted that}} the name punctata is preoccupied; earlier uses of the name in Trachylepis include Lacerta punctata Linnaeus, 1758, which they consider a synonym of Trachylepis homalocephala from South Africa, and Tiliqua punctata J.E. Gray, 1839, an earlier name for the Noronha skink. (The former was assigned to Lygosoma punctatum, a member of another skink genus, by Bauer in 2003.) Miralles and coworkers proposed a new name, Trachylepis tschudii, to replace Tschudi's name punctata; the new name honors Tschudi, who first described the animal. They assigned it to the genus Trachylepis, rather than Mabuya, {{on the basis of}} several characters of the external anatomy which it shares with the former, but were unable to resolve its placement within Trachylepis. It is distinct from T.maculata, a species recorded from Guyana that represents another doubtful mainland South American record of Trachylepis. They considered three hypotheses: (1) T.tschudii is a real, but very rare species from Amazonia; (2) T.tschudii is actually <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> the Old World, but its origin was wrongly recorded; and (3) T.tschudii represents the same species as the Noronha skink, and it either represents an otherwise unknown Amazonian population of that species or actually comes from Fernando de Noronha and was mislabeled. Considering the close similarity between T.tschudii and the Noronha skink, they considered the third hypothesis to be most likely.|$|E
