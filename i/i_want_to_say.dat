25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> at {{once that}} I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the {{greatest}} songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and {{each one of them}} is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.|$|E

In talking to reporters in April, Keating said, [...] "One question, among many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hunter told Taste of Country {{about writing}} the song: [...] "At the time, I {{was trying to}} tell {{somebody}} something, but I couldn't figure out how <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. So <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it in music because I knew it would be a little more impactful. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we are great in this relationship together, and I feel like it could even get better." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007 on the Food Is Not Love podcast, {{she said that the}} song [...] "February" [...] from Mortal City is one of her songs that she likes best. She referred to the way the song [...] "kept on evolving into, not only what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and didn't even know was in there." [...] She liked the way the song [...] "kept on breaking its own rules in a way that art is all about." ...|$|R

There is no justice in television. ... Where's the confidence? Why aren't I here talking about {{being picked up}} for 22 episodes? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to Warren Littlefield: Can you read? Can you read? I've never seen this kind of {{critical}} response to a show before." ...|$|E
500|$|The federal {{government}} was eventually liable for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln's losses when it seized the institution. In talking to reporters in April 1989, Keating maintained {{that he was the}} victim of a {{federal government}} that had spent years trying to destroy him, and then said, [...] "One question, among many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is that I never saw a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E

500|$|Though Max has {{explained}} that he was very proud of In Defense of the Genre, he described it as being more of an [...] "homage to sort {{of a lot of the}} bands that we liked and, like, a style that we respected." [...] He then explained that the new album would be [...] "more concise and would be a bit more original, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and sort of pop out like Is a Real Boy did." [...] He also explained that this CD has both the catchiest and most mature songs they've ever recorded and called it a [...] "step forward." ...|$|E
500|$|A. I {{would like}} to say the {{following}} about this. The term [...] "special treatment" [...] (Sonderbehandlung) has various meanings. As Poliakov says, in Poliakov - Black or Red - I can give the page number right away...I have it in my files somewhere...he reproduces forms. On these forms it says, [...] "Re: Special Treatment" [...] - first of all for Poles suitable for Germanization (eindeutschungsfaehig), and the same word, special treatment, is also for Poles not suitable for Germanization, that is those to be sent from the Eastern Occupied Territories to the Generalgouvernement. So that is one meaning of special treatment (Sonderbehandlung). Special Treatment also means - <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this here in this context as well, although I know that it is known - also means all transports of Jews, the deportation transports.|$|E

60|$|When my unfortunate bicycle {{had been}} started {{on its way}} to Waterton, I threw myself into the family life of the Larramies, {{determined}} not to let them see any perturbations of mind which had been caused by the extraordinary promptness of the younger son. If a man had gone with me instead of that boy, I would have had every opportunity of <b>saying</b> what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the mistress of the Holly Sprig. I may state that I frequently found myself trying to determine what it was <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{obtained}} it!" [...] she cried, I am {{not sure}} to this day whether in consternation or jest. In passing, {{it was not just}} what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Of {{painting}} portraits, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "in {{a picture}} <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something comforting as music is comforting.

2500|$|I say I can't {{thank you}} {{too much for the}} name 'Nocturne' as a title for my moonlights!

2500|$|It's {{wrong for}} Western leaders like [...] Tony Abbott {{to say the}} actions of the Islamic State aren't about religion. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to him 'please don't say such things in public because it's just not true.' You're letting down all the {{individuals}} who are reformers within Islam who are asking the right questions that will ultimately bring about change.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but {{it sounds}} {{different}} on your lips. It sounds as though you meant it yourself, and that you meant it because of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, {{there was}} {{something}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him--or to somebody else? My memorandum-book, Hopkins. In the basket, on that chair. Why wasn't the basket placed by my bedside?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I--haven't {{felt very}} well. I'm {{glad you came}} today, Mr. Bell. Perhaps I shall not see you again, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye {{and thank you for}} all your kindness." ...|$|R

But I {{want you to know}} that I've forgiven you and that you don't need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody. I figure that if Jesus could die so that all of my wrongs could be forgiven, I can certainly extend that same grace to you." [...] Cowell told Mandisa that he was [...] "humbled" [...] and apologized to her immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 {{soon after}} the award of a MacArthur Fellowship. The {{highlights}} are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, [...] "What then is central to {{what you want to}} say about race?" [...] Butler's response was, [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?" [...] This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{do believe}} you. Oh, I haven't said {{at all what}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say!</b> There {{was a great deal}} that I ought <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I can't seem to {{recollect}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well. Perhaps {{you don't}} know quite {{as well as}} I do.' The scowl began to appear on Mr Melmotte's brow. Hitherto it had been banished {{as well as he}} knew how to banish it.

6000|$|... "One at a time," [...] he said. [...] "Mrs. Pullen, I {{was very}} {{sorry to hear}} this afternoon, for your sake, that you had lost all your money.

2500|$|Ringo Starr met {{songwriter}} Dean Grakal at a {{party on}} New Year's Eve 1996, during which the pair had a discussion about songwriting, with Grakal proposing that they form a team with Mark Hudson, whom Starr had met years prior while Starr was working on Time Takes Time (1992). Starr spoke of the writing process {{in an interview with}} Billboard magazine: [...] "This is the first time I've really been involved [...] Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to say what I would have liked to say, on this, we're really trying to say what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> thank you." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{letter was}} sent {{from the office}} of Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) to Perverted-Justice praising their efforts, {{especially}} in regards to getting the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act passed. [...] "The Efforts of Perverted-Justice.com deserve a very special 'Thank you' from everyone interested in stopping the seduction and sexual attack on our children. NBC's Dateline has highlighted your efforts at catching sexual predators, using the internet to hunt the hunters. I believe these shows have directly impacted the timely passage of my bill. So I want to join Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist who acknowledged your efforts from the floor of the United States Senate the day the bill was passed. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Thank you" [...] for your tireless efforts to stop sexual predators." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Dearboy {{admitted}} {{to being a}} member of Charles Taylor's defunct National Patriotic Front of Liberia rebel movement. During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) public hearings, Dearboy said he was forcefully enlisted into the NPFL, in 1992, while searching for his girlfriend in Grand Bassa County. Three witnesses said that Dearboy raped a young woman and murdered several men, women, and children in Grand Bassa County during the civil war. Dearboy denied the accusation leveled against him. Dearboy expressed penitence {{for his role in the}} rebel movement, saying: [...] "The past is what no one is in control of. No one is reading my mind except God.
