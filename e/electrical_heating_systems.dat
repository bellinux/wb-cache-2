Most companies cover plumbing, <b>electrical,</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as refrigerators, dishwashers, and Microwave ovens. Some charge additional coverage for appliances such as clothes washers and clothes dryers. A home warranty company will pay for the cost to repair or replace the system or appliance, as long as it has broken down from normal wear and tear. If the system or appliance failed because it wasn’t maintained (the water heater was not flushed or the fridge’s evaporative coils were not cleaned), most home warranty contracts will not cover the cost to repair or replace it. Home warranties exist to repair or replace old worn out systems that have been properly cared for by the homeowner. Buyers should read the home warranty contract carefully to understand coverages, limitations, and exclusions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In <b>{{electrical}}</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the electrical}} power consumption should {{be lower than}} the Contracted Power Limit. Energy distribution devices are used to solve this problem, but they are only concerned with the electrical energy. We claim that this energy distribution must also consider the comfort level in the building. In this work, an electrical energy distribution MAS for coordinating the electrical heaters is proposed. The MAS is responsible for both objectives: the electrical power must be lower than the Contracted Power Limit and the comfort level in the building must be maintained if sufficient power is available. The MAS is now being implemented in a real world application of an electrical heating system marketed by a local company...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of net-zero energy buildings, buildings that generate {{at least as}} much energy as they consume, has lead to greater use of renewable energy sources such as solar thermal energy. One example is a heat pump assisted solar thermal system, which uses solar thermal collectors with an electrical heat pump backup to supply space heating and domestic hot water. The complexity of such a system can be somewhat problematic for monitoring and maintaining a high level of performance. Therefore, an energy dashboard was developed to provide comprehensive and user friendly performance metrics for a solar heat pump system. Once developed, the energy dashboard was tested over a two-week period {{in order to determine the}} functionality of the dashboard program as well as the performance of the heating system itself. The results showed the importance of a user friendly display and how each metric could be used to better maintain and evaluate an energy system. In particular, Energy Factor (EF), which is the ratio of output energy (collected energy) to input energy (consumed energy), was a key metric for summarizing the performance of the heating system. Furthermore, the average EF of the solar heat pump system was 2. 29, indicating an efficiency significantly higher than traditional <b>electrical</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{increase}} in fluctuating renewable electricity generation requires growing flexibility and balancing capacities {{in the electric}} energy grid. Storage systems can provide the necessary balancing capacities. Therefore, it is analyzed which potential for flexible energy consumption {{can be found in}} private households. Heat and power in private households are heavily interlinked due to increasing numbers of <b>electrical</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> (e. g. heat pumps). In addition, installed PV systems on roof tops are making renewable electricity an attractive energy source for space heating and hot water supply. To maximize the consumption of self-generated electricity, battery energy storage systems (BESS) and thermal hot-water based storage systems are used in private households. The challenge is to find economically viable configurations for sizing of combined battery and thermal storage units. The introduced approach simulates a household with a variable size of the relevant components of the thermal and electric system, being the PV system, PV and battery converters (DC linked), the battery (lithium-ion), thermal hot water storage and a heat pump. Profiles for the electrical load are based on empirical analysis of resident behavior coupled with measurements from typical household appliances. The thermal load profiles are derived from representative simulation tools, simulating resident behavior and the resulting heat demand. Based on the simulation results, an optimal sizing of storage units is calculated...|$|E
40|$|According to the U. S. Department of Energy, 40 % of {{the energy}} {{consumed}} in the U. S. is used in buildings and almost half of that amount is used for heating or cooling. Current technologies allow for efficient thermal management, but most utilize energy harvested from fossil fuels or convert electricity directly into thermal energy. Alternative heating technologies such as heat pumps and solar thermal collectors can greatly reduce the energy used for heating while producing reliable heating performance. Â This paper documents how an off-the-shelf residential heat pump water heater was integrated with a solar thermal system to improve overall heating performance. Â Solar thermal is {{the primary source of}} heat and the heat pump is used as a back-up when the sun is not shining with enough intensity. Â A primary/secondary pumping system is used to allow multiple modes of operation, including both hot water and hydronic heating. Â Since the heat pump water heater is located entirely inside the conditioned space, a secondary benefit/detriment for space cooling is noted based on the weather conditions. An energy dashboard that evaluates the heating performance of this hybrid solar heat pump system in real time was developed. Â Â The primary efficiency metric is the Energy Factor (EF), which is the ratio of thermal energy delivered to electrical energy consumed. Â Â As a point of reference, heat pump water heaters earn an Energy Star rating for an Energy Factor of 2. 2 under test conditions. Â Â During two-weeks of rigorous 24 hours a day testing in March of 2016, the instantaneous EF for the solar heat pump system varied from 1 to greater than 40 depending on the weather conditions.

40|$|International audienceAn {{increasing}} {{attention has}} been paid to Residential Demand Response programs from utilities and aggregators of dispersed capacities have emerged looking for demand response (DR) products which can be characterized in terms of power reduction and time duration. With the incoming results from some of the numerous smart grid demonstrators, it has been observed that households might not respond to price signals or at least not as much as expected. For programs aiming to reduce peak demand, the choice of the control strategy is the key issue for increasing households' involvement. For electrical space heating, in order to be fully efficient, the control strategy should depend on the building's characteristics and take into consideration household's behavior or habits. If the control strategy implemented uses only standard bound limits for indoor temperature as the comfort constraint, households facing discomfort situations might withdraw from DR programs or stop responding to it. This case is more likely to occur for low mass envelope buildings which represent the largest part of the French building stock and which have the highest load curtailment potential in terms of power demand. We suggest to compare different control strategies to evaluate the potential for load curtailment under comfort constraints for several types of buildings (those buildings have different level of insulation) modeled using a simplified thermal model for building and different types of <b>electrical</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems.</b> Using a day as the time horizon and considering that the maximum peak period is two hours, we identified four control strategies as suitable for load curtailment programs, including a predictive controller with comfort constraints. The strategies are compared for each type of building in terms of load curtailment potential (characterized by power and duration of the curtailment) and consumed energy during the day. We also compare them accordingly to the discomfort indicators we defined. While those strategies lead to comparable results for well insulated buildings, the more sophisticated strategies can be interesting for poorly insulated buildings as they allow a diminution of discomfort effects and an increase in households' participation and interest in DR programs...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{efficiency}} of the conventionaltextilewashingprocess is examined. This is done by using the cumulative exergy consumption as developed by Szargut et al. Exergy is the quantity of work that can be extracted from material or energy by reversible processes. Cumulative exergy consumption shows the exergy consumption in all production steps, from the extraction of natural resources to the final product. In this paper the study on minimising the cumulative exergy consumption (CExC) of the washingprocess will be presented. In order to minimise the CExC some experiments have been performed to quantify the exergy consumption of the different process steps that occur during the washingprocess. These experiments show that the <b>electrical</b> <b>heating</b> process consumes the most exergy. Hence, different alternatives of this process are proposed. Finally, the washing performance is related to the washing temperature and the detergent quantity by performing a number of experiments.
