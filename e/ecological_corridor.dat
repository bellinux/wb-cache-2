40|$|ABSTRACT In Brazil, the {{remaining}} areas of Atlantic Forest are intensely fragmented. The connection of forest fragments through <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors</b> {{is an important}} step in biodiversity conservation. Certain areas are more resilient, and in those areas, natural forest regeneration, for example, can be encouraged. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify areas of greater resilience in order to support the connection of Atlantic Forest fragments with <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors.</b> Forest fragments in the municipality of Paraíba do Sul, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification of an Operational Land Imager (OLI) /Landsat- 8 sensor image. Next, we analyzed the influence of terrain attributes (aspect, incident solar radiation, slope, and curvature profile) on natural regeneration. The areas with the greatest potential to achieve natural regeneration and to form <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors</b> were indicated through fuzzy membership functions. Within Paraíba do Sul, 31 % of the territory is covered by vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Recordings were made of 1, 251 forest fragments in a middle or advanced stage of regeneration. These fragments are usually situated in the southeast, south, and southwest aspects, in areas that receive the least amount of global solar radiation (Wh·m- 2) per year, and on slopes with an angle of inclination greater than 20 %. The adjustment of fuzzy functions identified 17, 327. 5 ha with a tendency to recover, and which are therefore strategic areas in the development of <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{identification}} of <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors</b> {{was performed by}} assessing the suitability as green infrastructure of land patches, and their contribution to habitat fragmentation (Cannas and Zoppi 2017). The aggregation of suitability values and other ecological values {{is the basis for}} the creation of a resistance map, where land cells are associated with a ‘cost-weighted distance’ (CWD) value; for this study, land patches within the first decile of CWD values are selected as suitable patches for <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors.</b> Least-cost paths for the migration of species can also be identified on the map; the combination of patch selection and {{identification of}} paths between Natura 2000 sites is used to identify potential habitat corridors in the area.|$|R

40|$|The idea {{to connect}} the {{habitats}} to facilitate the contact between the faunistics taxocenose have been broadly discussed by researchers. However, there are only few projects of this nature that have been implanted in Brazil. The understanding and {{the identification of the}} variable incorporated to the area of study are the main challenger and determinant {{to the success of the}} <b>ecological</b> (biodiversity) <b>corridors</b> project. This study presents the methodology to define the favorable areas to implant the <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors</b> between the Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Feliciano Miguel Abdala and the Estação Ecológica de Ipanema, located on the east side of the state of Minas Gerais, by analyzing the georeferenced information systems.

By the results reached, special analyzes tools and digital elevation model were used to define the most favorable paths to implant the <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors</b> at the area of study. The analyses were improved by the evaluation of the local occurrence of the muriqui do norte, Brachyteles hypoxanthus, the main specie at the present study. The selection of the specie was due to the fact it is endangered and it is very vulnerable to the fragmentation of habitats. The results reached on the study consist on important tools to the decision making, increasing the chances of the project to succeed because it shows the identification and integrated interpretation of variables that are determinants on <b>ecological</b> <b>corridors</b> projects.
