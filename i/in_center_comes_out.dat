Bohnett had been a staff information systems consultant at Arthur Andersen from 1980 to 1983 and, unable to be openly gay in that world, he had left to work at software companies instead.

40|$|Growth {{of massive}} black holes (MBHs) <b>in</b> galactic <b>centers</b> <b>comes</b> mainly from gas {{accretion}} during their QSO/AGN phases. In this paper we apply an extended Soltan argument, connecting the local MBH mass function with the time-integral of the QSO luminosity function, to the demography of MBHs and QSOs from recent optical and X-ray surveys, and obtain robust {{constraints on the}} luminosity evolution (or mass growth history) of individual QSOs (or MBHs). We find that the luminosity evolution probably involves two phases: an initial exponentially increasing phase set by the Eddington limit and a following phase in which the luminosity declines with time as a power law (with a slope of - 1. 2 [...] 1. 3) set by a self-similar long-term evolution of disk accretion. Neither an evolution involving only the increasing phase with a single Eddington ratio nor an exponentially declining pattern {{in the second phase}} is likely.

40|$|The center {{sampling}} technique {{is well suited}} when a population is naturally gathered in overlapping groups of units for which the units can not be labeled and the group size {{as well as the}} population size are unknown. An unbiased estimator Ym for the mean of a quantitative characteristic of interest has been proposed under the simple hypotheses that the relative weight of each center is known. A second estimator Yc can be deduced from a previous proposal under the same hypothesis. In the present paper the exact variance of Yc together with an estimate of it are given. The two estimators are based on different ways of summarizing data and they coincide in the case of proportional allocation of the overall sample size only. A comparison between the two estimators is accomplished both from the inferential and from the practical point of view. Through a simulation study it is shown that no estimator is uniformly more efficient than the other in the general case of L>_ 2 <b>centers.</b> Besides it <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> that Yc is more efficient when there is a "small" variability of the center sampling fractions, while Ym is more efficient as this variability increases.

40|$|From {{the first}} game of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs on April 22, 1876, tens of {{thousands}} of men have played professional sports in the Big Four—baseball, basketball, football, and hockey—major professional sports leagues in the United States. Until April 29, 2013, however, when National Basketball Association <b>center</b> Jason Collins <b>came</b> <b>out</b> publicly as gay, not one of those tens of thousands of men had ever <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to the public as gay while an active player on a major league roster. Is it because gay men can 2 ̆ 7 t jump (or throw, or catch, or skate) ? Or is it more likely that the costs of coming out are too high? In Antigay Bias in Role-Model Occupations, E. Gary Spitko argues that in the case of athletes, and others in role-model occupations, a record of widespread and frequently systematic employment discrimination has been excluding gay people from the public social spaces that identify and teach whom society respects and whom members of society should seek to emulate. Creating a typology of role models—lawyers/judges, soldiers, teachers, politicians, athletes, and clergy—and the positive values and character traits associated with them, Spitko demonstrates how employment discrimination has been used for the purpose of perpetuating the generally accepted notion that gay people are inferior because they do not possess the requisite qualities—integrity, masculinity, morality, representativeness, all-American-ness, and blessedness—associated with employment in these occupations. Combining the inspirational stories of LGBT trailblazers with analysis of historical data, anecdotal evidence, research, and literature, Antigay Bias in Role-Model Occupations is the first book to explore in a comprehensive fashion the broad effects of sexual orientation discrimination in role-model occupations well beyond its individual victims.

By analysing the statistical date supplied by the Regional Meteorological <b>Center</b> Craiova, it <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> that the years with the highest number of days with THI values above 80 are 2000, 2001, and 2007 for the entire studied territory, when, during summer, the region was affected by numerous heat waves, which led to the frequent exceeding of the 40 °C value.
