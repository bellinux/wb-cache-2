40|$|Tor is {{vulnerable}} to network-level adversaries who can observe {{both ends of the}} communication to deanonymize users. Recent work has shown that Tor is susceptible to the previously unknown active BGP routing attacks, called RAPTOR attacks, which expose Tor users to more network-level adversaries. In this paper, we aim to mitigate and detect such active routing attacks against Tor. First, we present a new measurement study on the resilience of the Tor network to active BGP prefix attacks. We show that ASes with high Tor bandwidth can be less resilient to attacks than other ASes. Second, we present a new Tor <b>guard</b> <b>relay</b> selection algorithm that incorporates resilience of relays into consideration to proactively mitigate such attacks. We show that the algorithm successfully improves the security for Tor clients by up to 36 % on average (up to 166 % for certain clients). Finally, we build a live BGP monitoring system that can detect routing anomalies on the Tor network in real time by performing an AS origin check and novel detection analytics. Our monitoring system successfully detects simulated attacks that are modeled after multiple known attack types as well as a real-world hijack attack (performed by us), while having low false positive rates.

50|$|Operators of Internet {{sites have}} the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced {{functionality}} to Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit Wikipedia when using Tor or when using an IP address that also is used by a Tor exit node, due {{to the use of the}} TorBlock MediaWiki extension, unless an exemption is obtained. The BBC blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor relays from its iPlayer service—including <b>guards,</b> <b>relays,</b> and exit nodes—regardless of geographic location. Bridge relays are not affected.|$|R
40|$|Anonymity {{systems such}} as Tor aim to enable users to {{communicate}} {{in a manner that}} is untraceable by adversaries that control a small number of machines. To provide efficient service to users, these anonymity systems make full use of forwarding capacity when sending traffic between intermediate relays. In this paper, we show that doing this leaks information about the set of Tor relays in a circuit (path). We present attacks that, with high confidence and based solely on throughput information, can (a) reduce the attacker's uncertainty about the bottleneck relay of any Tor circuit whose throughput can be observed, (b) exactly identify the <b>guard</b> <b>relay(s)</b> of a Tor user when circuit throughput can be observed over multiple connections, and (c) identify whether two concurrent TCP connections belong to the same Tor user, breaking unlinkability. Our attacks are stealthy, and cannot be readily detected by a user or by Tor relays. We validate our attacks using experiments over the live Tor network. We find that the attacker can substantially reduce the entropy of a bottleneck relay distribution of a Tor circuit whose throughput can be observed-the entropy gets reduced by a factor of 2 in the median case. Such information leaks from a single Tor circuit can be combined over multiple connections to exactly identify a user's <b>guard</b> <b>relay(s).</b> Finally, we are also able to link two connections from the same initiator with a crossover error rate of less than 1. 5 % in under 5 minutes. Our attacks are also more accurate and require fewer resources than previous attacks on Tor. Comment: Accepted for publication in ACM CCS 201...|$|R
40|$|Tor [2] is a volunteer-resourced {{anonymous}} {{communication network}} {{designed to provide}} communicating parties anonymity from their communication partners as well as passive third parties observing the network. As the network has grown, both in number of users and donated resources, {{there has been a}} need to capitalize on the available resources to both allow the network to scale and to safeguard against resource donating adversaries. The idea of entry <b>guard</b> <b>relays</b> [5], [4] emerged as a solution to safeguard against specific threats to end user anonymity that also tangentially provides beneficial load balancing properties. Guards were adopted into Tor — with judicious parameters. This was six years ago. Recently, there has been increased interest [1] in the use of entry guards in Tor and with it the need for the re-examinatio...|$|R

50|$|In {{the next}} attempt, Jojo (Gabriel Malema), a teenage {{villager}} who helped {{set up the}} cage, uses himself as live bait to capture Gustave. The beast arrives, and tries to devour him, but disappears, as Tim, Matt, and Steven race to rescue him. Meanwhile, Avivia catches one of the soldier escorts stealing money from a tent. The soldier knocks her down, but Gustave arrives and kills him. Avivia escapes unharmed, and catches up with the others. The remaining <b>guard</b> <b>relays</b> over his radio that the Americans videotaped the shaman's execution. Just as the group realizes that the soldiers work for Little Gustave, the remaining guards, believing Jacob videotaped the evidence, wounds him; Jojo intervenes, and shoots them. While Jacob's wound is being treated, Gustave attacks the group. Jacob recalls {{the story of how}} his wife, Ona, was killed by Gustave, and that he swore revenge. Jacob produces a grenade, and detonates it as Gustave grabs him in his jaws, and devours him, but the explosion fails to kill the crocodile.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Reliable and on-time data {{delivery}} {{is a crucial}} parameter of network performance in highly dynamic mobile ad hoc networks. Leveraging on a modified 802. 11 MAC tweak, <b>guard</b> nodes <b>relay</b> the packet with prioritized back off time when the intended node fails and becomes a contender nodes themselves. Previously used ad hoc routing protocols of MANETS are susceptible to node mobility, especially for large-scale networks because of this tweak. To address this issue a MAC independent approach called Position-based Opportunistic Routing (POR) protocol uses location information to guide the data flow and can always archive near optimal path. Utilizing in-the-air backup mechanism, communication is maintained without being interrupted. On the other hand, this scheme focuses on the route discovery {{from the perspective of}} network layer and no complex MA...|$|R

25|$|Although {{funded by}} the Nazis, Radu Lecca also {{contacted}} the SSI, making himself available as a double agent. He was therefore in permanent contact with the German Embassy in Bucharest. His position there was to prove important in 1940-1941, when the Iron Guard produced a fascist-style National Legionary government. Lecca maneuvered alongside the German-endorsed political leader, General Ion Antonescu, subverting the Iron Guard's ministers. Through his contacts, he gathered information on which Nazi officials supported the <b>Guard,</b> and <b>relayed</b> it to Antonescu. According to his own testimonies, Lecca focused his attention on Kurt Geißler, the Schutzstaffels liaison with the Guard. Lecca watched on as the Guard made preparations to oust Antonescu. He maintained that, on Geißler's request, the Guard's Legionary Police was armed with some 5,000 Walther PPs (surplus from the Berlin Police), and suggested that the Bucharest regular police chief, Guardist Ștefan Zăvoianu, had influenced Geißler into mistrusting Antonescu. Lecca also claimed that the Jilava Massacre, during which the Guard purged its political enemies, was instigated by Geißler. This account contradicts other reports, according to which the Guard was voluntarily avenging its murdered founder, Captain Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.|$|R

On July 11, orders to withdraw from the camp came at the eleventh hour but then it was too late and Aladeniya had wounded men whom {{he did not want to}} leave behind. Pledging that he would rather die alongside them than leave them, Lt. Aladeniya fought on till an adjacent fuel dump exploded, killing the majority of the defenders in the camp.

50|$|In early June 1990, LTTE fighters {{attacked}} SLA {{forces in}} the area of Mankulam. These initial attacks were repulsed but by June 12, both Mankulam and Kokavil were surrounded. On June 16 a ceasefire was declared so negotiations can take place. Shortly after this sixteen soldiers, from a military detachment <b>guarding</b> the Rupavahini <b>Relay</b> Station at Kokavil, left on leave leaving 69 soldiers at the camp. Soon after that, on June 27, the camp was surrounded by the LTTE. For the next 14 days the camp was constantly coming under attack. Medicine, food and water were in short supply. Supplies were dropped by helicopters. Because of heavy LTTE fire, the supplies had to be dropped from high above the camp. Much of it landed outside the perimeter of the camp and was lost. The final attack was to start on July 10, and the LTTE started building up forces around the camp. Reinforcements for the soldiers at the camp were not able to arrive because the routes were blocked. That evening the SLA soldiers were left with only 300 rounds of ammunition. By next morning some 30 soldiers were still alive, half of them seriously wounded. The SLA commanding officer, Lt. Aladeniya, was given the order to evacuate, but he refused because {{he did not want to}} leave his wounded men. On the evening of July 11, communication with the camp was lost. At 11:45 p.m. the camp was overrun. All of the soldiers were declared missing in action. Lt. Saliya Aladeniya was posthumously promoted to rank of captain and honoured with a Parama Weera Vibhushanaya medal on June 21, 1994.|$|R
