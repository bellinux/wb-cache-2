5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual <b>desire.</b> <b>In</b> his other poem Cleanness, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a <b>desire</b> <b>in</b> Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite <b>desire</b> <b>in</b> others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted hyena {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual <b>desire</b> <b>in</b> people.|$|E

He created the rôle of the Prince in Mikhail Baryshnikov's production of Cinderella, the leading male rôle in Antony Tudor's The Tiller in the Fields (1978), Glen Tetley's Contredances (1979), the title rôle of Peter Darrell's Chéri (1980) {{and the lead}} rôle in Lynne Taylor-Corbett's Estuary (1983). In 1984, Bissell starred as a guest artist with the Universal Ballet Company in its first production, Adrienne Dellas's Cinderella.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Thomas Hardy's The Return of the Native. It focuses on the reasons {{and the results of}} Eustacia Vye's strong <b>desires</b> <b>in</b> life. The writer feels {{challenged}} to analyze the reasons why Eustacia finally has two strong <b>desires</b> <b>in</b> her life and also the results of Eustacia's strong <b>desires.</b> <b>In</b> order to achieve the goal of the thesis, the writer uses the theories of literature, namely characterization and setting. Besides, she also uses psychological concepts of depression, frustration, and suicide. The writer uses these psychological concepts because Eustacia undergoes depression, frustration, and finally she commits suicide. The writer finds out that there are two reasons why Eustacia finally has two strong <b>desires</b> <b>in</b> her life. The first reason is because she has t o move from Budmouth to Egdon. The different setting between Egdon and Budmouth causes her to have two strong desires: to live in the glamorous life and 'to be loved to madness'. The second reason is because she loses her parents' love and affection. The writer also finds out that Eustacia's strong desires cause some results to appear. Her strong desires cause her to live in illusions. They also cause her to use all means to reach her <b>desires.</b> <b>In</b> this case, she uses Wildeve and Clym. She finally gets married with Clym because she thinks that through him, she can reach her strong <b>desires.</b> <b>In</b> fact, Clym cannot fulfill her desires. This causes her to be disappointed of her marriage. Her disappointment of her marriage finally leads her to have a love affair with her former lover, Wildeve. At last, her strong desires cause her to commit suicide. She commits suicide because she sees no hope anymore to reach her strong desires. Her strong desires have led her to her downfall. As a conclusion, how Eustacia's desires lead her to her downfall shows that it is dangerous to have strong <b>desires</b> <b>in</b> life without being able to accept the failures that may appear...|$|R

Martin Stafford criticized Sexual <b>Desire</b> <b>in</b> the Journal of Applied Philosophy, {{arguing that}} Scruton's {{proposal}} that moral education guides students toward {{a state in}} which sexuality is integrated within a life of personal affection and responsibility is inconsistent with his views on homosexuality. According to Stafford, Scruton was invited by the Journal of Applied Philosophy to respond, but declined to do so. Alan Singer discussed Sexual <b>Desire</b> <b>in</b> SubStance, crediting Scruton with succinctly discussing the problems involved in thinking about sexual activity and with showing that sexual desire involves complexity of thought.|$|E
