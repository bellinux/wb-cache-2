Thanks to Cancellara's performances and the Schleck brothers both finishing on the podium at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the team was also in the top spot for a time.|$|E

5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a large city in the Preclassic period.

This dynasty has been reconstructed in part from Late Classic ceramics from the region of great Preclassic cities of El Mirador and Nakbe. This may mean that Calakmul ultimately inherited its political authority from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating itself to Calakmul <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E

5|$|Clay County {{was ranked}} {{as the top}} team {{in the state in}} the 198788 preseason coaches' poll, and Farmer was voted the state's best prep {{prospect}}, garnering twice as many votes as second-place prospect Allan Houston. The Tigers started the year 80 before suffering their only regular season loss in {{the first game of the}} 1987 Beach Ball Classic against Eau Claire High School. In Clay County's next game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classic,</b> Farmer broke the school's career scoring record, scoring his 2,193rd point in a 7657 win over Tulsa, Oklahoma's Nathan Hale High School. Gary Gregory, who had held the record since 1974, was in attendance at the game. In the tournament's fifth place game, Farmer scored 33 points and broke the single-game record for assists with 16, besting Kenny Anderson's year-old record of 13. Clay County defeated Simi Valley High School 9591, and Farmer was selected as the tournament's Outstanding Player and named to the all-tournament team.|$|E
5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. Right up {{to the end of the}} Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.|$|E
5|$|Gannon {{has also}} been called a 'tactical maverick' due to his unusual {{formations}}. These formations include 3–4–1–2, 4–3–2–1, 4–1–2–3, and his preferred set-up of 4–2–3–1. He has stated that he prefers formations that use four lines of players (as opposed to three lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence and presence in midfield, and was inspired to use the formations by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he prefers the 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football. He {{is known to be}} extremely thorough and meticulous in preparing his players for games.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped {{feathered}} serpent deities. Such worship was rare during the Classic period, {{but by the}} Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was Kukulkan, among the K'iche' it was Q'uq'umatz. Kukulkan had his origins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> period War Serpent, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art. Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico. Likewise, Q'uq'umatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.|$|E
