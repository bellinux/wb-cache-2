5|$|His bat {{touches the}} turf {{in line with}} the off-stump, but his <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> well clear of the leg stump. He grips the bat near the tip of the handle, and it gives an {{impression}} that the bat is inordinately long.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of fourth position: open and closed. In both cases, one <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed {{approximately}} twelve inches in front of the other. In open fourth position the heels are aligned, while in closed fourth position the heel of the front <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> aligned with the toe of the back <b>foot.</b> There <b>are</b> two variations of each type of fourth position, determined by which <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> in front.|$|R
25|$|The girl's broken feet {{required}} {{a great deal}} of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.|$|R
5|$|Falco peregrinus macropus, {{described}} by Swainson in 1837, is the Australian peregrine falcon. It {{is found in}} Australia in all regions except the southwest. It is non-migratory. It is similar to brookei in appearance, but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black. The <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> proportionally large.|$|E
5|$|On some vinyl {{pressings}} of the album, {{the cover}} does not crop off their feet. On the Deluxe Edition case the <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> presented {{on the back}} cover, and the band sold an official T-shirt with {{a shot of the}} band's feet after the deluxe edition release.|$|E
5|$|Pugs' {{legs are}} strong, straight, of {{moderate}} length, and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, {{resulting in an}} under-bite.|$|E
30|$|Phases in {{the gait}} cycle were {{evaluated}} according to duration. The {{duration of the}} right swing phase {{was defined as the}} time when the right <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> off the ground, while the right stance phase was defined as the time when the right <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> on the ground. Similarly, the duration of the left swing phase was defined as the time when the left <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> off the ground, while the left stance phase was the time when the left <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> on the ground. The single support phase was defined as the period of time during which the opposite <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> lifted for swing phase, whilst the double support phase was defined as the period when both <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> in contact with the floor. The gait cycle was defined as the time interval between 2 successive occurrences of 1 repetitive event of walking.|$|R
5000|$|A Russian pivot turn, as {{described}} by Bessie and May Evans, is performed as follows. The right <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed flat and the left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed with the toe by the right heel and the left heel raised and this relative position basically maintained during the turning. The turn starts with the right foot raised from the floor. While continuously revolving, on each strong beat (downbeat) the right <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> stepped flat and on each weak beat (upbeat) the left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> stepped on the ball (by the right heel).|$|R

Mount Daniel (472 <b>feet)</b> <b>is</b> to its west, Mackey’s Hill (171 <b>feet)</b> <b>is</b> to its north, and Upton’s Hill (410 <b>feet)</b> <b>is</b> to its east. Its location overlooks the City of Falls Church {{on the opposite}} side of Four Mile Run, 1.4 miles to its south.|$|R
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> {{less likely to}} become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were {{the main source of}} his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The croupade and {{ballotade}} are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, {{the horse}} jumps with both fore and hind legs remaining tucked under {{the body and}} he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks his hind legs slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> visible if viewed from the rear.|$|E
5|$|The family Hirundinidae is a {{group of}} passerines adapted to aerial feeding. These adaptations include a slender {{streamlined}} body, long pointed wings, and short bills with a wide gape.

50|$|In Volume 4 the <b>Foot</b> <b>were</b> given a {{security}} contract by the Utroms for their base because the Utroms have a no weapons {{policy and the}} <b>Foot</b> <b>are</b> skilled at hand-to-hand combat.

50|$|An {{illusion}} {{is involved}} in creating {{the appearance of the}} dancer gliding backwards. Initially, the front <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> held flat on the ground, while the back <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> in a tiptoe position. The flat front foot remains on the ground but is slid lightly and smoothly backward past the tip-toe back <b>foot.</b> What <b>is</b> now the front <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> lowered flat, while the back <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> raised into the tiptoe position. These steps are repeated over and over creating the illusion that the dancer is being pulled backwards by an unseen force while trying to walk forward. Variations of this move allow the moon walking to also appear to glide forwards, sideways, and even in a circle.|$|R
