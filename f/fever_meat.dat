40|$|The Romanian meat sector holds a {{significant}} share in agriculture; {{in the year}} 2007 its value represented 16. 1 % of total agricultural output and 41. 8 % of animal production. In {{the first year after}} Romania’s accession to the European Union, an obvious increase of total meat production by 12. 3 % compared to the year 2006 was noticed, due to {{the increase in the number}} of slaughtered animals in all species and of the slaughtering weight, mainly in the case of specialized industrial units. This positive trend also benefited from support from the state budget received for meat quality, for the classified pork and beef carcass, subsidies for the slaughtered chicks, as well as from direct payments for the bovine, sheep and goat farms. The domestic meat supply remained deficient, although production increased; yet it is worth mentioning that in the year 2007 the consumption coverage by domestic production represented 75. 9 % compared to 66. 5 % in 2006. The meat consumption per capita was at the same level as in 2006, i. e. 64. 7 kg. Meat imports in 2007 totalled 338. 5 thousand tons, down by 22. 1 % compared to 2006. Romania exported mainly live sheep and bovines, pig exports being banned due to swine <b>fever.</b> <b>meat</b> market, carcass classification, direct payments...|$|E
50|$|Pangolins as a genus {{are among}} the most heavily poached and {{exploited}} protected animals. Like other pangolin species, the Sunda pangolin is hunted for its skin, scales, and meat, used in clothing manufacture and traditional medicine. Scales are made into rings as charms against rheumatic <b>fever,</b> and <b>meat</b> is eaten by indigenous peoples. Despite enjoying protected status almost everywhere in its range, illegal international trade, largely driven by Chinese buyers, has led to rapidly decreasing population numbers. The Sunda pangolin is currently considered to be critically endangered.|$|R

30|$|Researchers {{are still}} working on natural plants to {{discover}} new compounds of high biological activity. It is reported by World Health Organization (WHO) that more than 80 % people in developing countries basically depends on herbal medicines [47]. Researchers are more focusing on plant-derived polyphenols, seeing that the synthetic anti-oxidants have several adverse effects [48]. Our investigation showed that caffeic acid; syringic acid and vanillic acid are present in Citrus macroptera peel powder. The previous report also suggests that syringic acid and vanillic acid which are important polyphenols showed anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrogenic and hepatoprotective activities in CCl 4 induced rats [49]. Citrus macroptera or wild orange is occasionally used for increasing appetite, reducing <b>fever</b> and making <b>meat</b> preparation [50]. A recent investigation also suggests that Citrus macroptera is extremely safe, even methanolic extract at a dose of 1000  mg/kg did not produce toxic effects in rats considering biochemical as well as histological assessment [51]. Our investigation also supports this notions that Citrus macroptera peel powder supplementation in normal rats did not alter any of the biochemical as well as histological parameters compared to control rats.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of a vaccine, the incidence of Q fever disease among populations at risk continues to be high. Q fever is an important cause of morbidity for workers, particularly in the meat and agricultural industries. Following an increase in 1998 in the number of Q <b>fever</b> notifications among <b>meat</b> processors to the Communicable Disease Control Branch, South Australia, a survey was conducted in the same year to assess the uptake of Q fever immunisation programs in meat processors and to identify barriers to offering these programs. This survey was conducted prior to the introduction of the National Q Fever Management Program in 2001 that provided a targeted vaccination program to specific at-risk occupations. The results of the survey highlighted that very few meat processors in South Australia offered a Q fever immunisation program to their workers. More importantly, this article highlights that there was a wide variety of attitudes and beliefs about Q fever disease and its prevention. These attitudes and beliefs have the potential to impact on whether workers at risk are offered or seek Q fever vaccination. Previous attitudes may return and levels of protection in at-risk occupations will decrease without a concerted effort at a state level. A replication of this study should benchmark the prevailing attitudes about Q fever programs. In response to the 1998 survey a number of strategies and initiatives were developed to address the barriers to Q fever vaccination in South Australian meat processors. The National Q Fever Management Program (2001 - 2005) further enhanced the ability to address barriers such as vaccine cost. Adriana Milazzo, Kathryn B. Featherstone, Robert G. Hal...|$|R
