50|$|The <b>Halimeter</b> is {{manufactured}} by Interscan Corp. in California, {{and based on}} their earlier model 1170 portable sulfide monitor. This was the model used in the two original studies. These studies, conducted {{for the first time}} by Dr. Mel Rosenberg, showed a significant correlation between monitor levels and oral malodor scores. The small size, simplicity of use, and price (relative to gas chromatograph) of the <b>Halimeter</b> made it popular among dentists seeking to diagnose and treat bad breath, as well as scientific researchers. Much of the published research on bad breath over the past dozen years has employed this instrument. The electrochemical sensor is sensitive to alcohol vapors, and requires recalibration over time. The <b>Halimeter</b> has been the only VSC monitor for the diagnosis of halitosis for years, but now that its patent has expired, it faces competition from other sulfur monitors recently introduced into the marketplace.|$|E

5000|$|More recently, the {{portable}} gas chromatograph, [...] "OralChroma" [...] has been recommended {{in the diagnosis}} of halitosis, [...] as the <b>Halimeter</b> does not detect dimethyl sulfide, which is thought {{by some to be}} elevated in extraoral causes of halitosis. [...] The OralChroma detects dimethyl sulfide in a semi objective manner, and hence is able to differentiate between oral malodor (intraoral halitosis) and extra-oral halitosis. The <b>halimeter</b> is therefore not indicated if extra-oral halitosis is suspected (its use will only be able to rule out intra-oral halitosis), but is useful for diagnosis and clinical monitoring of intra-oral halitosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Halimeter</b> was {{introduced}} in the early 1990s as an adjunct method for determining halitosis (bad breath, oral malodor) levels, alongside human assessment of odor levels (the latter is considered the gold standard).

5000|$|Halimeter: a {{portable}} sulfide monitor {{used to test}} for levels of sulfur emissions (to be specific, hydrogen sulfide) in the mouth air. When used properly, this device can be very effective at determining levels of certain VSC-producing bacteria. However, it has drawbacks in clinical applications. For example, other common sulfides (such as mercaptan) are not recorded as easily and can be misrepresented in test results. Certain foods such as garlic and onions produce sulfur in the breath {{for as long as}} 48 hours and can result in false readings. The <b>Halimeter</b> is also very sensitive to alcohol, so one should avoid drinking alcohol or using alcohol-containing mouthwashes for at least 12 hours prior to being tested.

40|$|Introduction: Halitosis can {{be tested}} using two main methods, {{organoleptic}} and assessment of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), using an electronic meter like <b>Halimeter.</b> Therefore, {{the present study was}} conducted to measure the oral malodor of volunteers by means of the organoleptic method and VSCs monitoring and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the <b>Halimeter</b> in the diagnosis of halitosis. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted to compare the two diagnostic aids for halitosis. The study population included 110 volunteers, all males, between the ages of 18 and 45 years selected from academic staff, students, and patients of college. Evaluation and comparison of two main methods for halitosis were done, namely, organoleptic and <b>Halimeter.</b> Specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and disease prevalence were calculated for the sulfide monitor test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the diagnostic values of <b>Halimeter</b> to differentiate individuals with and without halitosis. Results: The correlation coefficient between VSC grading and organoleptic score (Kendall′s tau-b) was − 0. 1090, which was not significant (P = 0. 2170). Sensitivity and specificity of sulfide monitor grades for detecting individuals with and without halitosis were 20. 75 % and 66. 67 %, respectively. The PPV for the <b>Halimeter</b> was 36. 67 %, and the NPV was 47. 50 %. A total of 48. 18 % of all subjects were accurately identified and differentiated. The area under the ROC curve was 0. 5790 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 4600 - 0. 6980). Conclusion: In the present study, the <b>Halimeter</b> was not found to have a good correlation with the organoleptic method. However, due to the diverse influencing factors, proof of halitosis should always be obtained with two different methods...|$|E
40|$|AIM: This study {{investigates the}} {{occurrence}} of oral malodour in an adult dental clinic population in Pretoria, South Africa, and the clinical parameters associated with the condition. METHODS: Data collected from new patients (n= 896), examined by oral hygiene students under supervision of instructors, between January - October 2004, were retrospectively analysed. Subjects self-reported their medical history and smoking status. Caries experience, plaque index, pocket depths, bleeding on probing (BOP), tongue coating status, and oral hygiene practises were recorded. Malodour was diagnosed using the <b>halimeter</b> (≥ 120 ppb) and an organoleptic measurement (0 - 5 point scale) of ≥ 3. Data analysis included chi-square, t-tests and logistical regression. RESULTS: 15. 1 % presented with organoleptically-determined malodour and 20. 9 % presented with malodour detected {{by the use of}} the <b>halimeter.</b> Irrespective of the diagnostic tool used, tongue coating, increased plaque levels and BOP were associated with an increased likelihood for oral malodour, while regular flossing reduced the likelihood of presenting with the condition. Periodontitis was associated with oral malodour when applying organoleptic ratings, but not with the <b>halimeter.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Oral malodour prevalence corresponds with values reported in developed countries. Interdental flossing was the most effective self-care practise associated with a reduced likelihood of presenting with malodour. <b>Halimeter</b> performance should be further investigated in relation to varying degrees of severity of periodontal disease.

40|$|It is now {{generally}} accepted that the volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide {{are the main}} contributors to halitosis when of oropharyngeal origin. Gas chromatography using a specific sulfur detector is the most appropriate method to detect halitosis of different origin (intra-oral and extra-oral halitosis) and {{should be considered as}} the gold standard. However, a gas chromatograph is an expensive apparatus and needs trained personnel. The less specific <b>Halimeter</b> is the most used apparatus in halitosis research. In this study a newly developed portable gas chromatograph, the OralChroma (TM) (Abilit Corporation, Japan), was evaluated for use in the field of halitosis. The results show that the OralChroma is a very sensitive apparatus for measuring VSCs. Just like standard gas chromatography, it can perfectly differentiate between intra-oral and extra-oral blood-borne halitosis, while the <b>Halimeter</b> can only detect intra-oral halitosis. The hardware of the OralChroma meets all the needs for becoming the apparatus of choice in the field of halitosis. However, the software needs a major revision.

A secondary {{aim was to}} compare the two methods for measuring volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) by halimetry and OralChroma. Methods: Organoleptic scale, <b>halimeter</b> and the OralChroma {{were used to assess}} oral malodour and VSC. The effects of five test formulations and water (negative control) were assessed after 30 -, 60 -, 90 - and 180 -minutes, with one week between the treatments to avoid any cross-over effect. Results: Reduction in H 2 S by halimetry and malodour levels by organoleptic assessment ranged from, slight (LacerFresh®) (P > 0. 05), moderate (BreathRx®, SmartMouth®) (P < 0. 01) to marked effect (SB 12 ®, Listerine®) (P < 0. 001) at all time points compared to water.

30|$|Microbial {{degradation}} is {{the main}} cause of oral malodor (Bollen and Beikler 2012). Combining the results of the <b>Halimeter</b> and GCMS assays in vitro and in vivo, the metabolites produced by P. gingivalis included VSC, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, phenyl compounds, nitrogen compounds, and alkanes. After treatment with IgY, these metabolites were significantly reduced compared with control. Previous reports indicated that the main volatile molecules contributing to oral malodor included VSC, diamines, phenyl compounds, alcohols, alkanes, short-chain fatty acids, nitrogen compounds, and ketones (Bollen and Beikler 2012; Krespi et al. 2006). In addition, hexanal was detected in the experiment associated with halitosis. However, it is likely according to two reports that the hexanal may be a reaction intermediate. Because hexanal can generate hexanedione (Nomeir and Abou-Donia 1985) or hexanediol (Taher et al. 2009) with appropriate reaction conditions.|$|E
30|$|Porphyromonas gingivalis is a {{pathogenic}} Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that colonizes the subgingival {{region of}} gums. These bacteria can invade periodontal tissues, form plaques, and produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) and {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC). Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) that was specifically produced in egg yolks after chickens were challenged with P. gingivalis could control and prevent oral diseases caused by P. gingivalis. The releases of P. gingivalis offensive metabolic odors in vitro and in vivo were determined using a <b>Halimeter</b> and GCMS. With IgY bacterial growth was inhibited, and the relative amounts of VOC and VSC were decreased. The scores for the oral health index and the levels of IL- 6 and TNF-α are also decreased. All treatment groups showed significant anti-inflammatory effects, which strongly suggests that specifically IgY against P. gingivalis may be an effective treatment for the prevention and protection of periodontal inflammation and halitosis.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the past}} decade, {{the use of}} probiotic-containing {{products}} has been explored as a potential alternative in oral health therapy. A widely available probiotic drink, Yakult, was evaluated for oral health applications in this longitudinal study. Selected oral health parameters, such as levels and composition of salivary and tongue plaque microbiota and of malodorous gases, in dentate healthy individuals were investigated for changes. The persistence of the probiotic strain in the oral cavity was monitored throughout the study period. Methods: A three-phase study (7 weeks) was designed to investigate simultaneously the effect of 4 -week consumption of the probiotic-containing milk drink Yakult on the microbiota of saliva and dorsum tongue coating in healthy dentate people (n = 22) and levels of volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) in morning breath. Study phases comprised one baseline visit, at which &#x 2018;control&#x 2019; levels of oral parameters were obtained prior to the probiotic product consumption; a 4 -week period of daily consumption of one 65 ml bottle of Yakult, each bottle containing a minimum of 6. 5 &#x 00 D 7; 109 viable cells of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS); and a 2 -week washout period. The microbial viability and composition of saliva and tongue dorsum coating were assessed using a range of solid media. The presence of LcS in the oral cavity was investigated using a novel selective medium, &#x 2018;LcS Select&#x 2019;. Portable sulphur monitors Halimeter&#x 00 AE; and OralChromaTM were used to measure levels of VSCs in morning breath. Results: Utilization of the LcS Select medium revealed a significant (p &# 60; 0. 05) but temporary and consumption-dependent presence of LcS in saliva and tongue plaque samples from healthy dentate individuals (n = 19) during the probiotic intervention phase. LcS was undetectable with culture after 2 weeks of ceasing its consumption. Morning breath scores measured with <b>Halimeter</b> and OralChroma were not significantly affected throughout the trial, except in {{a small number of}} individual cases where <b>Halimeter</b> scores were significantly reduced during the probiotic intervention period. Natural fluctuations in resident acidogenic populations, and numbers of Candida and anaerobic species, including malodourous Gram-negative anaerobes, were unaffected. Conclusion: While no broad ecological changes in the mouth were induced by consumption of Yakult in healthy dentate individuals, findings of this study confirm the temporary and intake-dependent presence of LcS. Future studies could focus on subjects at greater risk of oral infection, where ill-defined microbiota (e. g. an increased presence of periopathogens) or clinically diagnosed halitosis might be significantly affected by consumption of this probiotic...|$|E

Only limited data are available on the effect of different food items on tongue coating and halitosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single consumption of food with high fiber content versus low fiber content on halitosis parameters. Based on a randomized clinical cross-over study, 20 subjects were examined over a period of 2. 5 hours after consumption of a high-fiber and a low-fiber meal. The determination of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) was performed using a <b>Halimeter,</b> and the organoleptic assessment of halitosis was done on the basis of a distance index. The tongue coating was determined using a modified Winkel index, and the mouth sensation was evaluated subjectively by the subjects.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to unravel the origen and cause of intra-oral and extra-oral halitosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 58 {{patients}} complaining of halitosis, using gas chromatography of volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) in mouth and nose breath, organoleptic scoring of mouth and nose breath, <b>Halimeter</b> readings of mouth air and tongue-coating inspection. Subjects had no precence or history of periodontitis. RESULT: Of 58 patients, 47 patients had halitosis of oral origin, six had halitosis of extra-oral origin and five had no halitosis (halitophobia). A strong correlation was found between the degree of intra-oral halitosis as measured by organoleptic scoring of mouth breath and the concentration of the VSCs hydrogen sulphide (H(2) S) and methyl mercaptan (CH(3) SH) in mouth breath. Taking into account the much larger odour index of CH(3) SH, it was concluded that CH(3) SH is the main contributor to intra-oral halitosis. In all six cases of extra-oral halitosis, halitosis was caused by the presence of elevated levels of dimethyl sulphide (CH(3) SCH(3)) in mouth and nose breath. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that the VSC, CH(3) SH and to a lesser extent H(2) S are the main contributors to intra-oral halitosis and that CH(3) SCH(3) is the main contributor to extra-oral or blood-borne halitosis, due to a hitherto unknown metabolic disorder...|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{perfusion}} biofilm model, derived from tongue-scrape microflora removed from one individual, {{was employed to}} study sulfide biogenesis {{and the effects of}} repeated exposure to chlorhexidine (CHX). Volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) were measured using a carbon veil electrode within the biofilm and a <b>halimeter</b> for liquid and gas phase levels, respectively. The microflora of the perfusate and the biofilm were assessed by microbiological techniques and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to estimate diversity. Biofilms treated with a 1 mL pulse of 0. 1 % CHX twice a day for three days showed (1) a large reduction in viable count (> 90 % kill), (2) a (slow) reduction in the VSC production rate, consistent with the reduction in microbes rather than direct inhibitory effects on the biotransformation steps, and (3) a preferential reduction of strict anaerobes. Treated biofilms allowed to recover over 3 – 5 days showed a nominal amount of regrowth in some experiments, although population numbers were still well below those found in untreated controls. The microbiological composition of biofilms treated but allowed to recover was markedly different from the controls, with proportionally fewer strict anaerobes. Thus, CHX treatment caused detectable ecological shifts with consequent long-term effects on the response of the biofilm in terms of VSC generation, consistent with clinical observations.

Placa visível, sangramento gengival, PS e PI foram avaliados no início, após tratamento da gengivite, 3 e 6 meses após tratamento da periodontite. CSV foram medidos nos mesmos momentos com um monitor portátil de CSV (<b>Halimeter).</b> Alterações foram comparadas ao longo do estudo através do teste de Friedman. Associações entre variáveis clínicas e alterações nos CSV foram avaliadas com correlação de Pearson (r). Níveis de placa e gengivite reduziram significativamente ao longo dos 6 meses. Houve reduções significativas do início para o final do estudo em PS (3, 2 ± 0, 8 mm para 2, 3 ± 0, 3 mm; p Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the effect of periodontal treatment on the production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) in young individuals with periodontitis. Methods: 12 individuals (13 - 26 years old) with at least one permanent first molar and/or incisor with probing depth (PD) ≥ 4 mm and clinical attachment loss (CAL) ≥ 4 mm were included in the study. All subjects had a 14 -days initial program of supragingival scaling and plaque control. Subgingival scaling and root planing was performed in a subsequent period of 14 days. Presence of visible plaque (VP), gingival bleeding (GB), PD, CAL and bleeding on probing (BOP) were assessed at baseline, 14 days after supragingival plaque control and three months after subgingival therapy by one calibrated examiner. At the same intervals, levels of VSC were measured with a VSC portable monitor (<b>Halimeter,</b> Interscan TM). Clinical variables were compared using paired t test and VSC levels with Friedman’s test. Associations between VSC alterations and initial VP, GB, BOP, mean PD and percent of sites with PD ≥ 4 mm were assessed with Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). Results: Periodontal treatment resulted in significant reductions in PD (6. 55 ± 1. 23 mm to 3. 91 ± 0. 75 mm) and CAL (5. 19 ± 1. 47 mm to 3. 26 ± 1. 61 mm). Initial low levels of VSC were observed in the sample (median 29. 50, maximum and minimum 214 - 7). There were no significant differences between VSC levels at baseline, after supragingival plaque control and after three months (median, maximum and minimum: 29. 50, 214, 7; 20. 00, 156, 8; 35. 00, 140, 11; respectively). It was observed a significant correlation between initial percent of sites with gingival bleeding and VSC reduction after treatment (r = 0. 69, p = 0. 01). Conclusions: Periodontal treatment did not promote alterations in VSC production in young individuals with periodontitis...|$|E
40|$|Impact of Bracket Design and Oral Hygiene Maintenance on Halitosis in the Orthodontic Patient Joan Palacios D. D. S University of Connecticut 2015 Introduction: Halitosis is {{considered}} to be offensive to other people, it {{plays an important role in}} the social environment from an individual self-image and social interaction. Halitosis is estimated to affect almost 50 % of the population with different intensity and etiologies. Fixed orthodontic appliances are associated with increase in periodontal status on a negative side, furthermore there is a correlation between plaque accumulation and halitosis. Purpose: the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of bracket type on plaque accumulation and also the impact of the appliance on oral malodor. In addition, the effect of tongue scraping on halitosis between CB brackets and SL brackets Methods: 40 patients were recruited in total, randomized assigned to in one of four groups, CB brackets, CB brackets + tongue brush, SB bracket, and SB + tongue brush, followed during 5 weeks, T 0 bonding day, T 1 1 weeks after bonding, T 2 4 to 5 weeks after T 1, halitosis samples were taken using <b>Halimeter</b> sulfide monitor (Interscan Corporation, Chatsworth, CA USA). Periodontal measurements as such plaque index, bleeding index and gingival index were taken. Results: Halitosis was increased in both types of brackets CB and SB, a decrease in halitosis was found on groups were tongue brush was given. Periodontal measurements were no statistically significant between the groups. Conclusions: From result analyzed so far tongue brush helps reduce halitosis on patients undergoing fixed appliances, and periodontal measurements are not improved y the type of bracket but by the patient’s oral hygien...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{principal}} components of halitosis are volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethylsulfide or compounds such as butyric acid, propionic acid, putrescine, and cadaverine. Objective: The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of Chinese herbs on VSCs in vitro. Methods: Saliva samples from volunteers were used as the source for the evaluation of bacterial activity and VSC inhibition. Extracted substances from Chinese herbs were identified by VSC inhibition tests with a <b>Halimeter</b> and microbial sensitivity testing. The effectiveness on halitosis was compared between a dentifrice containing one of the effective Chinese herbs (ie, chrysanthemum flower [Chrysanthemum morifolium flos]), 4 commercially available antihalitosis dentifrices, and a positive control that received no treatment. Results: Ten volunteers provided saliva samples for VSC testing. Of the 40 herbs tested, 14 extracts had percent inhibition rates of VSCs > 50 %. Ten herbs showed greatest effect against all culturable microorganisms with bacterial inhibition > 70 %. There was a weak positive correlation between bacteriostasis and the anti-VSC activity of the herbs with a correlation coefficient of 0. 2579 (Pearson). The mean (SD) values of the VSC testing were as follows: dentifrice containing chrysanthemum flower, 55. 91 (8. 16) ppb; Crest Tea Refreshing Dentifrice®, 48. 39 (7. 48) ppb (P = NS); Cortex Phellodendri Dentifrice®, 139. 90 (14. 70) ppb (P < 0. 01); Colgate Total Plus Whitening®, 120. 94 (15. 58) ppb (P < 0. 01); Zhong Hua Chinese Herbs Dentifrice®, 136. 96 (13. 06) ppb (P < 0. 01); and positive control, 312. 38 (28. 58) ppb (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Of 40 herbs tested, 14 Chinese herbs were found to be effective for VSC inhibition. A dentifrice containing chrysanthemum flower reduced the formation of VSC in vitro, showing a significantly greater effect than the control group and 3 of 4 dentifrices already on the market...|$|E
40|$|These {{investigations}} {{determined the}} in vivo oral malodor reducing effect of two experimental toothpastes containing new flavor compositions (test-toothpaste I and test-toothpaste II). These toothpastes had shown promising malodor reducing efficacy in an in-vitro model. A commercially available fluoride toothpaste with 0. 3 % triclosan (control I) and an experimental fluoride toothpaste with 0. 3 % triclosan (control II) acted as controls. The efficacy was tested in two clinical trials: a one time application experiment with a three hours evaluation phase and a one week application (two times of brushing per day) experiment {{with a final}} evaluation {{at the end of}} the study. Both studies included 24 persons with oral halitosis and followed a crossover double blind design. At all evaluation points, the subjects were assessed for baseline oral malodor by one trained organoleptic judge (organoleptic 5 -point scale) and a sulfide monitor (<b>halimeter).</b> In the one time application study organoleptic and instrumental oral malodor measurements were performed after 5 minutes up to 3 hours every 30 minutes after brushing with the assigned product. Throughout the one week application study, each subject was asked to use the assigned toothpaste twice a day for 2 minutes for seven days. After 1 week baseline parameters were re-evaluated. After a washout period of 14 days, subjects of both studies repeated the same regimen with another toothpaste sample. The results showed that none of the four toothpastes reduced oral malodor formation of halitosis-patients within 3 hours after a single usage continual. After the one week application the VSC values at the tongue dorsum and for the whole mouth were significantly reduced by test-toothpaste II (28. 4 % / 21. 0 %) and control II (24. 3 % / 22. 2 %). Test-toothpaste I seemed to be slightly less effective because it only showed a significant reduction (18. 7 %) of the VSC formation of the tongue dorsum. Organoleptic scores remained nearly unchanged for all toothpastes even after one week application by Halitosis patients. There were no significant reductions for the market sample (control I) at all. Plaque formation was significantly inhibited by toothpastes containing the tested flavor compositions (20. 5 % resp. 16. 0 %). Generally, the results show that the tongue coating has a great influence on breath malodor. It may be assumed, that a minimal VSC-reduction at the tongue dorsum of at least 18. 7 % is necessary leading to a significant whole mouth odor reduction as well. These findings suggest oral halitosis can not be successfully reduced just by tooth cleaning with toothpaste. Toothpastes containing the tested flavor compositions might be helpful in the management of temporary forms of malodor such as morning breath. Whereas the effects of one time and one week applications were tested further investigations are needed over a period of 6 months for such a flavor composition containing toothpaste...|$|E
