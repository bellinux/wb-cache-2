H. van 't Hoff {{was confronted with}} the problem of the magnitude of the attraction of water by salts. He wondered whether it is possible to measure this force, i. e. the affinity, in the simple case of an aqueous solution. Hugo de Vries drew his attention to Wilhelm Pfeffer's experiments on osmotic pressure. This led to van 't Hoffs theory of osmotic pressure, which he formulated in 1884 - 1885 and which was published in 1885 - 1887. Van 't Hoff found an analogy between the osmotic pressure and the gas pressure. The general gas law PV=RT is also applicable to dilute solutions, although for electrolytes a factor i had to be introduced: PV=iRT. It was Svante Arrhenius who suggested that i is equal to the number of ions. In 1887 Arrhenius published his theory <b>of</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation.</b> Connected with van 't Hoffs theory of osmotic pressure, the definitive formulation of the theory of dilute solutions was obtained. Soon discussions were held about the theory of solutions. The British Association for the Advancement of Science organized a meeting in Leeds in 1893 where the new theories were fiercely attacked by a number of British scientists. In April 1893 the meeting of the Nederlandsch Natuur- en Geneeskundig Congres (Dutch Physical and Medical Congress) in Groningen reached favourably to the new ideas, On January 8, 1894, van 't Hoff lectured on the genesis of the theory of solutions before the Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft in Berlin. It is remarkable that he asked himself whether the theory <b>of</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> conforms to reality. Although his student Jacob Jan Alexander Wijs had determined the value of the dissociation constant of water (1893), van 't Hoff ended his lecture with the intriguing question: "Is the theory <b>of</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> proved in this way? By no means. But it wholly unexpectedly has supplied much in the field of saponification. " It is not clear whether Van 't Hoff had his doubts on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> reality of the theory <b>of</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> or whether {{he did not want to}} take the risk of a confrontation with his opponents...|$|R

5000|$|Raoult's name is {{best known}} in {{connection}} with work on solutions, to which he devoted {{the last two decades}} of his life. His first paper describing how solutes depressed the freezing points of solutions was published in 1878. [...] Further experiments with various solvents, such as benzene and acetic acid, in addition to water, led him to believe in a simple relation between the molecular weights of a solute and the freezing-point of a solution. He expressed the relationship as the loi générale de la congélation (general law of freezing), that if one molecule of a substance be dissolved in 100 molecules of any given solvent, the temperature of solidification of the latter will be lowered by 0.63 °C. Another relation on which Raoult worked was that concerning the depression of a solvent's vapor pressure, due to a solute, showing that the decrease is proportional to the solute's molecular weight. This relationships holds best in the limiting case of a dilute solution. [...] These two generalizations afforded a new method of determining the molecular weights of dissolved substances, and were utilized by Jacobus van 't Hoff and Wilhelm Ostwald, among other chemists, in support of the hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> in solutions. Raoult's freezing-point depression method became even more useful after it was improved by Ernst Otto Beckmann and became a standard technique for determining molecular weights of organic substances.|$|R

40|$|Hydroxyl {{groups in}} {{aliphatic}} and aromatic compounds are readily subject to proton exchanges. Aliphatic alcohols are neutral, while aromatic ones are weakly acidic. It {{is a question}} whether those well-known phenomena in aqueous media may be described uniformly in a framework of molecular interactions, i. e., hydrogen bond functions. A systematic analysis of proton transfer reactions in EtOH(H 2 O) n and PhOH(H 2 O) n {{has been carried out}} Density-functional theory calculations, B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G(2 d,p), with the Onsager's SCRF solvent effect were performed for the title reactions, and proton-relay reaction paths were determined. First, the minimal and optimal model of a proton exchange reaction, Et-OH•(H 2 O) n →Et-OH • •(H 2 O) n, was sought. The n = 3 model was found to give a strain-free hydrogen bond network with the smallest activation energy for the concerted proton transfer. In larger models, such as Et-OH•(H 2 O) 6 and Et-OH•(H 2 O) 12, the Et-OH•(H 2 O) 3 unit was confirmed to involve the concerted proton-relay movement. The transition states of proton transfers in Et-OH•(H 2 O) n (n = 6 and 12) are of the ion-pair character. Similar proton-relay reactions of Ph-OH•(H 2 O) n →Ph-OH • •(H 2 O) n were traced. A crucial difference between Et-OH•(H 2 O) n and Ph-OH•(H 2 O) n is the absence or presence of an ion-pair intermediate. That is, the ion-pair intermediates with Cs-symmetric structures were obtained in Ph-OH•(H 2 O) n (n = 6 and 12). Proton-exchange reactions and absence or presence <b>of</b> the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> were suggested to be described uniformly by the R-OH•(H 2 O) 3 unit...|$|R
