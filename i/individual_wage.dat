Using a large panel of individual administrative data, it shows that wage to age profiles for different cohorts of workers are not stable over time: although younger generations of Italian workers are benefiting from higher starting wages than older generations, they face the prospect of lower growth of future earnings. It also confirms the existence of a significant supply effect: the bigger the cohort relative to the active population, the smaller the cohort’s gain in terms of wage levels. Finally, it captures the dependence of <b>individual</b> <b>wages</b> on aggregate labour market conditions: <b>individual</b> <b>wages</b> are shown to be negatively related to the rate of unemployment and positively related to the union wage index. ...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{issue that}} has emerged is that living wages may be a less {{effective}} anti-poverty tool than other measures. Authors point to living wages as being only a limited way of addressing the problems of rising economic inequality, the increase of long-term low-wage jobs, and a decline of unions and legal protection for workers. Since living wage ordinances attempt {{to address the issue}} of a living wage, defined by some of its proponents as a family wage, rather than as an <b>individual</b> <b>wage,</b> many of the beneficiaries may already be in families that make substantially more than that necessary to provide an adequate standard of living. According to a survey of labor economists by the Employment Policies Institute in 2000, only 31% viewed living wages as a very or somewhat effective anti-poverty tool, while 98% viewed policies like the US earned income tax credit and general welfare grants in a similar vein. On the other hand, according to Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with the State of California's Division of Labor Statistics and Research, the living wage may be seen by the public as preferable to other methods because it reinforces the [...] "work ethic" [...] and ensures that there is something of value produced, unlike welfare, that is often believed to be a pure cash [...] "gift" [...] from the public coffers." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of Blanchflower and Oswald (1994) for different countries has established {{the existence of}} an inverse relationship between <b>individual</b> <b>wages</b> and local unemployment. Moreover, the coefficient for the elasticity between both variables has proved to be very close to – 0. 1 across areas and industries and over time. This relationship is known as the wage curve. The objective of the paper is to explore the existence of a wage curve for Spain. With this aim, we use individual data from the Encu sta de Presupuestos Familiares (Family Budgets Survey) for the year 1990 - 1991 to quantify the relationship between <b>individual</b> <b>wages</b> and local unemployment rates. The results show the existence of a wage curve with an elasticity of – 0. 06. This value is lower than in countries with more flexible labour markets and lower unemployment rates. However, the elasticity is higher when specific labour markets by gender and age are considered. In an influential work, Blanchflower and Oswald (1990, 1994) postulate the existence of a downward sloping relationship between <b>individual</b> <b>wages</b> and local unemployment rates.

The ordinary least squares estimates show statistically insignificant and quantitatively zero effects of accessibility to international markets proxied by the length of contemporary transport routes connecting the origin city and its nearest major seaport. However, using prefecture-level population density in 1820 as exogenous variation in current transport routes, the two-stage least squares regressions provide an opposite picture indicating that every 1 percent increase in distance from the origin city to international markets (i. e. the nearest seaport), ceteris paribus, has {{a negative impact on}} <b>individual</b> <b>wages</b> of 0. 086 percent. This causal effect remains robust to various sensitivity tests which include current labor market structure, historical factor endowments and initial population development. ...|$|R

40|$|Men and women’s {{labor market}} {{outcomes}} differ along pay, promotion and competitiveness. This paper contributes by uncovering {{results in a}} related unexplored field using unique data on <b>individual</b> <b>wage</b> bargaining. We find striking gender differences. Women, like men, also bargain, but they submit lower wage bids and are offered lower wages than men. The adjusted gender wage gap is lower with posted-wage jobs than with individual bargaining, although less is ascribable to the term associated with discrimination. Both women and men use self-promoting, or competitive bargaining strategies, but women self-promote at lower levels. Employers reward self-promotion but the larger the self-promotion, the larger is the gender gap in bargaining success. Women therefore lack the incentives to self-promote, which helps to explain the gender disparities. <b>Individual</b> <b>Wage</b> Bargaining; Competitiveness; Bargaining strategies; Self-promoting Bargaining Strategies; Gender Wage Gap; and Discrimination. ...|$|E
