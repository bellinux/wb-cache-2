[...] The amount of sunlight absorbed at the surface varies strongly with latitude, being greater at the equator than at the poles, and this engenders fluid motion in both the atmosphere and ocean that acts to redistribute <b>heat</b> from the <b>equator</b> towards the poles, thereby reducing the temperature gradients that would exist in the absence of fluid motion.

40|$|The high-latitude oceans {{serve as}} {{freshwater}} sources and heat sinks {{for the global}} thermohaline circulation, exerting significant influence on ocean general circulation and climate variability. Warm surface flows carry heat toward the poles where intense heat loss to the atmosphere drives densification and produces an equatorward return flow of intermediate and bottom waters. This exchange establishes the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) which, when combined with the inter-basin exchange permitted by the zonally unbounded Southern Ocean geometry, supports the global thermohaline circulation. High-latitude convection thus ventilates the many mid- and low-latitude density layers which outcrop in the polar/subpolar oceans, setting subsurface density structure and removing carbon to the ocean interior. In contrast, net precipitation in the polar regions produces an equatorward freshwater flux that is largely confined to the upper ocean. Fresh waters exiting the Arctic can form a low-density surface barrier that inhibits convective overturning at the deep water formation sites in the Labrador and Greenland Seas, modulating {{the strength of the}} MOC and thus the exchange of <b>heat</b> from <b>equator</b> to pole.

For g=g₀= 9. 81 ms⁻², three meridional cells exist in each hemisphere. Up to about g/g₀= 1. 4 all cells increase in strength. Further increasing this ratio results in a weakening of the thermally indirect cell, such that a two- and finally a one-cell structure of the meridional circulation develops in each hemisphere.

The cross sections extend from South America to Africa along the 8 °S, 16 °S, 24 °S, and 32 °S latitude lines, providing temperature and salinity data from the surface to near bottom. A level of no motion was determined by establishing mass and salt continuity across each of the latitudinal cross sections. This level varied from 1100 meters at 8 °S to 1270 meters at 32 °S. It is approximated by the 27. 57 sigma-t surface and corresponds closely to {{the boundary between the}} Antarctic Intermediate Water and the South Atlantic Deep Water masses. The resulting meridional heat transport was then examined and compared with other estimates. Northward (equatorward) heat transports resulted at each latitude, which would seem to oppose the conventional view {{of the role of the}} ocean in the earth's heat budget as a means to transfer <b>heat</b> from <b>equator</b> to poles. However, the northward direction of the net absolute heat transport agrees with the consensus of previous work and is attributed to the warmer surface currents with a net northward transport dominating the cooler deeper currents and their net southward flow. A general circulation pattern was developed from mass transport values for each of three layers of water: Upper, Intermediate, and Deep and Bottom Water. These derived circulation patterns are then compared to general descriptive circulation patterns found in the literature. General agreement was found with the notable exception of lacking a strong Brazil current in the surface and central waters. Vertical cross sections of velocity, mass, salt, and heat transport were contoured to examine the eddy field circulation pattern and further describe general circulation patterns.

40|$|The ocean {{contributes}} to regulating the Earth’s climate through {{its ability to}} transport <b>heat</b> from the <b>equator</b> to the poles. In this study we use long simulations of an ocean model to investigate whether the heat transport is carried primarily by wind-driven gyres {{or whether it is}} dominated by deep circulations associated with abyssal mixing and high latitude convection. The heat transport is computed as a function of temperature classes. In the Pacific and Indian ocean, the bulk of the heat transport is associated with wind-driven gyres confined to the thermocline. In the Atlantic, the thermocline gyres account for only 40 % of the total heat transport. The remaining 60 % is associated with a circulation reaching down to cold waters below the thermocline. Using a series of sensitivity experiments, we show that this deep heat transport is primarily set by the strength and patterns of surface winds and only secondarily by diabatic processes at high latitudes in the North Atlantic. Abyssal mixing below 2000 m has hardly any impact on ocean heat transport. A major implication is that the role of the ocean in regulating Earth’s climate strongly depends on how surface winds change across different climates in both hemispheres at low and high latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{numerical}} experiments {{indicate that}} the rate of meridional overturning associated with North Atlantic Deep Water is controlled both by mixing and by windstress in the Southern Ocean, where the zonal periodicity of the domain alters the nature of the flow. We find a simple approximate expression for meridional overturning as a solution to Gnanadesikan's (1999) cubic scale relation. We compare the predicted overturning to coarse-resolution numerical experiments with an idealized Atlantic-Ocean/Southern Ocean geometry. The scaling accurately predicts the sensitivity to forcing for experiments with a level model employing isopycnal diffusion of temperature, salinity, and “layer thickness". A layer model produces similar results, increasing our confidence in the numerics of both models. Level model experiments with horizontal diffusivity have similar qualitative behavior but somewhat different sensitivity to forcing. We highlight the difference in meridional overturning induced by changes in windstress or vertical diffusivity. Wind-driven circulation anomalies outside the region of windstress perturbation include strongly cross-isopycnal flow near the surface and approximately along-isotherm flow in the thermocline. Overturning anomalies far from the windstress perturbations are not completely determined by windstress in the zonally-periodic Southern Ocean: windstress outside the periodic region strongly influences the transport of <b>heat</b> across the <b>equator</b> primarily by changing the temperature of the flow across the equator.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{physical}} processes {{that control the}} seasonal cycle of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic Ocean are investigated. A high-resolution ocean general circulation model is used to diagnose the various contributions to the mixed layer heat budget. The simulation reproduces the main features of the circulation and thermal structure of the tropical Atlantic. A close examination of the mixed layer heat budget is then undertaken. At a first order, the mixed layer temperature balance in the equatorial band results from cooling by vertical processes and heating by atmospheric heat fluxes and eddies (mainly tropical instability waves). Cooling by subsurface processes is the strongest in June - August, when easterlies are strong, with a second maximum in December. Heating by the atmosphere is maximum in February - March and September October, whereas eddies are most active in boreal summer. Unlike previous observational studies, horizontal advection by low-frequency currents plays here only a minor role in the <b>heat</b> budget.

25|$|NASA {{scientists}} {{now believe that}} the dark material is lag (residue) from the sublimation (evaporation) of water ice {{on the surface of}} Iapetus, possibly darkened further upon exposure to sunlight. Because of its slow rotation of 79days (equal to its revolution and the longest in the Saturnian system), Iapetus would have had the warmest daytime surface temperature and coldest nighttime temperature in the Saturnian system even before the development of the color contrast; near the <b>equator,</b> <b>heat</b> absorption by the dark material results in a daytime temperatures of 129K in the dark Cassini Regio compared to 113K in the bright regions. The difference in temperature means that ice preferentially sublimates from Cassini Regio, and deposits in the bright areas and especially at the even colder poles. Over geologic time scales, this would further darken Cassini Regio and brighten the rest of Iapetus, creating a positive feedback thermal runaway process of ever greater contrast in albedo, ending with all exposed ice being lost from Cassini Regio. It is estimated that over a period of one billion years at current temperatures, dark areas of Iapetus would lose about 20 meters of ice to sublimation, while the bright regions would lose only 10 centimeters, not considering the ice transferred from the dark regions. This model explains the distribution of light and dark areas, the absence of shades of grey, and the thinness of the dark material covering Cassini Regio. The redistribution of ice is facilitated by Iapetus's weak gravity, which means that at ambient temperatures a water molecule can migrate from one hemisphere to the other in just a few hops.|$|R

The predicted overturning is compared with coarse-resolution numerical experiments with an idealized Atlantic Ocean-Southern Ocean geometry. The scaling accurately predicts the sensitivity to forcing for experiments with a level model employing isopycnal diffusion of temperature, salinity, and "layer thickness. '' A layer model produces similar results, increasing confidence in the numerics of both models. Level model experiments with horizontal diffusivity have similar qualitative behavior but somewhat different sensitivity to forcing. The paper highlights the difference in meridional overturning induced by changes in wind stress or vertical diffusivity. Strengthening the Southern Ocean wind stress induces a circulation anomaly in which most of the water is subducted in the Ekman layer of the wind perturbation region, follows isopycnals down into the thermocline, and changes density again when the isopycnals near the surface in the Northern Hemisphere. Approximating the circulation anomaly by this subduction route allows for a surprisingly accurate prediction of the resulting heat transport anomaly, based on the surface temperature distribution. Some of the induced flow follows a second, near-surface northward route through low-latitude water that is lighter than the subducted flow.

40|$|Power can be {{performed}} by a system driven by a potential difference. From a given potential difference, the power that can be subtracted is constraint by the Carnot limit, which follows from {{the first and second}} laws of thermodynamics. If the system is such that the flux producing power (with power being the flux times its driving potential difference) also influences the potential difference, a maximum in power can be obtained {{as a result of the}} trade-off between the flux and the potential difference. This is referred to as the maximum power principle. It has already been shown that the atmosphere operates close to this maximum power limit when it comes to heat transport from the Equator to the poles, or vertically, from the surface to the atmospheric boundary layer. To reach this state of maximum power, the effective thermal conductivity of the atmosphere is adapted by the creation of convection cells. The aim of this study is to test if the soil’s effective hydraulic conductivity also adapts in such a way that it produces maximum power. However, the soil’s hydraulic conductivity adapts differently; for example by the creation of preferential flow paths. Here, this process is simulated in a lab experiment, which focuses on preferential flow paths created by piping. In the lab, we created a hydrological analogue to the atmospheric model dealing with <b>heat</b> transport between <b>Equator</b> and poles, with the aim to test if the effective hydraulic conductivity of the sand bed can be predicted with the maximum power principle. The experimental setup consists of two freely draining reservoir connected with each other by a confined aquifer. By adding water to only one reservoir, a potential difference will build up until a steady state is reached.

40|$|Drainage {{of water}} in soils happens for a large extent through {{preferential}} flowpaths, but these subsurface flowpaths are extremely difficult to observe or parameterize in hydrological models. To potentially overcome this problem, thermodynamic optimality principles have been suggested to predict effective parametrization of these (sub-grid) structures, such as the maximum entropy production principle or the equivalent maximum power principle. These principles have been successfully applied to predict heat transfer from the Equator to the Poles, or turbulent heat fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere. In these examples, the effective flux adapts itself to its boundary condition by adapting its effective conductance {{through the creation of}} e. g. convection cells. However, flow through porous media, such as soils, can only quickly adapt its effective flow conductance by creation of preferential flowpaths, but it is unknown if this is guided by the aim to create maximum power. Here we show experimentally that this is indeed the case: In the lab, we created a hydrological analogue to the atmospheric model dealing with <b>heat</b> transport between <b>Equator</b> and poles. The experimental setup consists of two freely draining reservoirs connected with each other by a confined aquifer. By adding water to only one reservoir, a potential difference will build up until a steady state is reached. From the steady state potential difference and the observed flow through the aquifer, and effective hydraulic conductance can be determined. This observed conductance does correspond to the one maximizing power of the flux through the confined aquifer. Although this experiment is done in an idealized setting, it opens doors for better parameterizing hydrological models. Furthermore, it shows that hydraulic properties of soils are not static, but they change with changing boundary conditions. A potential limitation to the principle is that it only applies to steady state conditions. Therefore the rate of adaptation of hydraulic properties should be faster than the rate of change in boundary conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} status of our {{understanding}} of the Earth's annual, global mean energy balance, the hemispheric energy balances and the symmetry observed about the equator, and explores the influence of latitudinal changes of energy both on the annual mean and seasonal transports of energy from low latitudes to higher latitudes. Based on the best available information we show that our planet continues to be out of balance with additional heat being added to it at the rate of 0. 6 ± 0. 4 Wm− 2. This heat appears to be taken up primarily by the oceans of the SH and perhaps mostly equatorward of 37 S. The nature of the adjustments applied to our best estimates of individual, annual mean fluxes of energy to produce a balance are described and the results of applying a more formal constraint for these adjustments are discussed. The energy balances of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres are then shown to be practically identical which in turn suggests the transport of energy across the equator in the net is close to zero. In fact the hemispheres are not identically symmetrical with the SH being slightly out of balance absorbing the additional heat and transporting a small amount of net <b>heat</b> across the <b>equator</b> to the balanced NH. The symmetry in absorbed solar and the near symmetry in OLR are remarkable in their own right and are a result of the effects of clouds both on solar reflection and OLR that act to offset land–ocean interhemispheric differences. We then demonstrate important interhemispheric seasonal influences on the heat transported to the winter pole that conspire to make these seasonal transports lopsided. This asymmetry {{is a direct result of}} the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit that induces larger energy losses from the southern winter hemisphere. This in turn produces a latitudinal asymmetry in the location of on the tropical trough zone, a region from which energy is always moved to the winter pole, requiring it be located deeper into the NH...|$|R
