General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam.

40|$|The English go future, a quintessential {{example of}} grammaticalization, has shown {{layering}} with will {{since at least}} 1490. To date, most synchronic evidence for this development comes from dialects where <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> represents a sizable proportion of the future temporal reference system. However, in the United Kingdom {{in the late twentieth}} century there were still dialects where <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>was</b> only beginning <b>to</b> make inroads, representing a mere 10 – 15 per cent of future contexts. These varieties offer an effective view of the early stages of grammatical change. Statistical analysis of nearly 5, 000 variable contexts reveals that the use of <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>is</b> increasing across generations, but at different rates, depending on location and orientation to mainstream norms. Major patterns of use mirror previous findings: <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>is</b> favoured for subordinate clauses. However, other widely reported constraints conditioning <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>are</b> radically different across age groups, exposing contrasts between incipient vs later stages of grammaticalization. In the most conservative dialects <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>is</b> strongly correlated with negatives and questions especially in the first person singular. This suggests that these contexts may have been the ‘trigger’ environments for redistribution of meaning of the incoming grammatical form (Hopper & Traugott 1993 : 85). The fact that strong effects of negatives and questions endure in contemporary urban varieties (Torres-Cacoullos & Walker 2009) confirms that grammaticalization begins in very specific syntactic contexts, and impacts on the system for generations to come. In contrast, other reported constraints – resistance of <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> in the first person singular and extension to inanimates and far future readings – emerge across generations, suggesting they are later developments. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how synchronic dialects show us incremental steps in the grammaticalization process. Comparative sociolinguistic analysis thus offers insights into which patterns define the point of grammaticalization itself; which derive from systemic processes; which can <b>be</b> attributed <b>to</b> discourse routines and collocations; and how these factors converge in shaping the evolution of grammar...|$|R
