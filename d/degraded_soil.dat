More than 6 billion people are now using about 38% of the land area of the Earth to raise crops and livestock. Many soils suffer from various types of degradation, that can ultimately reduce their ability to produce food resources. Slight degradation refers to land where yield potential has been reduced by 10%, moderate degradation refers to a yield decrease from 10-50%. Severely <b>degraded</b> <b>soils</b> have lost more than 50% of their potential. Most severely <b>degraded</b> <b>soils</b> are located in developing countries.|$|R
40|$|On {{the sandy}} alfisols {{of the cotton}} belt of Northern Cameroon, {{conventional}} intensive cropping based on soil tillage and mineral fertilizers application does not prevent soil degradation or free farmers from shifting cultivation. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize degradation of these soils under intensive cropping, and to develop ways for restoring the productivity of these <b>degraded</b> <b>soils</b> that have been rendered unsuitable for intensive cultivation. The study was based on evaluation of soil constituents, structure and functions as affected by time. Run-off plots were used in two locations at different stages of <b>soil</b> degradation. <b>Degraded</b> <b>soils</b> were characterized by a low organic carbon content (around 0. 2 %) in its upper 10 cm, a high erodibility, and a high compaction of the upper layers when not recently tilled. Restoration of productivity on these soils should start by aerating and stabilizing the compacted layers. Only then can fertilizer application and other improvements be profitable. Soil mulching after tillage and incorporation of farm manure, adoption of conservation tillage practices and short duration fallows, allow restoration of productivity on these <b>degraded</b> <b>soils.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

50|$|Soil {{that is well}} {{aggregated}} has a {{range of}} pore sizes. Each pore size {{plays a role in}} soil's physical functioning. Large pores drain rapidly and are needed for good air exchange during wet periods, preventing oxygen deficiency that can drown plants and increase pest problems.

50|$|A {{wide range}} of biologically diverse populations in natural {{ecosystems}} and in / near agricultural ecosystems maintain essential ecological functions that are critical {{for the production of}} food. Such populations contribute positively to, for example, nutrient cycling, decomposition of organic matter, crusted or <b>degraded</b> <b>soil</b> rehabilitation, pest and disease regulation, water quality maintenance, and pollination. Maintaining species diversity, while building on and enhancing ecosystem functions, reduces external input requirements by increasing nutrient availability, improving water use and soil structure, and controlling pests.|$|E
50|$|Problems of {{soil erosion}} can be fought, and certain {{practices}} {{can lead to}} soil enhancement and rebuilding. Even though simple, methods for reducing erosion are often not chosen because these practices outweigh the short-term benefits.

50|$|Biodynamic {{agriculture}} was {{the first}} modern system of agriculture to focus exclusively on organic methods. Its development began in 1924 {{with a series of}} eight lectures on agriculture given by Rudolf Steiner. These lectures, the first known presentation of what later {{came to be known as}} organic agriculture, were held in response to a request by farmers who noticed <b>degraded</b> <b>soil</b> conditions and a deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers. The one hundred eleven attendees, less than half of whom were farmers, came from six countries, primarily Germany and Poland. The lectures were published in November 1924; the first English translation appeared in 1928 as The Agriculture Course.|$|E
50|$|In {{disturbed}} {{sites with}} no topsoil and therefore {{few or no}} mycorrhizae, the Kali population may remain dominant for over a decade. To speed the recovery, {{it is better to}} add rich topsoil with plenty of organic material and mycorrhizae than to attack the Kali population. However, {{it is important not to}} regard the ecological interrelationships too simplistically; in some cases the presence of the healthy weed plants on a harsh site without mycorrhizae actually seems to facilitate the succession of grass better than where a mycorrhizal inoculum had reduced the population of the Kali. The assumed competitive effect of the Kali should be assessed and monitored in each case. Furthermore of course, where <b>degraded</b> <b>soil</b> is effectively barren, Kali is better as a pioneer population than simply leaving the soil completely barren. Kali grows best on sandy or at least loose-surfaced soil, so it might pay better to rake the soil to encourage Kali invasion for a few years until its presence has mitigated the conditions.|$|E
40|$|Four {{profiles}} of grey <b>degraded</b> <b>soils</b> and of sandy soils {{were collected from}} different agro-ecological regions in Vietnam and subjected to clay mineral analysis in addition to particle-size analysis. The result showed that those soils had the low clay while high sand contents in the upper layers or throughout the profile. This was ascribed to decomposition of layer silicate minerals in the upper layers and/or downward shifting of clay particles in a profile for grey <b>degraded</b> <b>soils</b> and to inheritance from the parent material for sandy soils. Predominant minerals detected in the clay fraction were kaolin (kaolinite and halloysite (0. 7 nm)) and quartz for both soil types. The present study indicated two opposite processes of soil development. For grey <b>degraded</b> <b>soils,</b> reduction in the clay content with decomposition of layer silicate minerals was enhanced with advancement of soil degradation. As a result, they became sandy-like soils with domination of quartz in the clay fraction. For sandy soils, on the other hand, their particle-size distribution and clay mineralogical composition were changed naturally by enrichment with clay particles from surrounding environment. The latter process suggests a possibility of fertility improvement of poor soils by mixing with more fertile materials such as alluvial soils, river sediments and weathered rock materials, {{in addition to the}} traditional measures such as intensive application of chemical fertilizers and addition of large amounts of organic amendments...|$|R

50|$|Land {{degradation}} and desertification threaten people’s livelihood {{on a global}} scale. Every year, 20 million hectares of fertile land become degraded and within the last 40 years, around {{one third of the}} total agricultural land on earth has become unproductive through degradation processes. Less developed countries are more vulnerable to desertification and land degradation, as they lack the infrastructure and capital to deal with this threat and implement long-term sustainable land management. Soil on degraded land is less resilient and crops grown on <b>degraded</b> <b>soil</b> produce lower yields. Land degradation also negatively influences global food security: in the next 25 years, global food production might drop by up to 12%. This will lead to an increase in average food prices of up to 30%.Estimates show that the annual costs of land degradation are up to €3.4 trillion. Paired with the growing world population and an increasing demand for alternative land management products such as biofuels land degradation causes poverty, food insecurity, reduced availability of clean water, and increased vulnerability towards climate change and extreme weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogeology is the geoprofession {{involved}} when {{environmental studies}} involve subsurface water. Hydrogeology applications range from securing safe, plentiful underground drinking-water sources to identifying {{the nature of}} groundwater contamination {{in order to facilitate}} remediation. Environmental toxicology is a geoprofession when used to identify the source, fate, transformation, effects, and risks of pollutants on the environment, including soil, water, and air. Wetlands science is a geoprofessional pursuit that incorporates several scientific disciplines, such as botany, biology, and limnology. It involves, among other activities, the delineation, conservation, restoration, and preservation of wetlands. These services are sometimes conducted by geoprofessional specialists called wetlands scientists. Ecology is a closely related environmental geoprofession involving studies into the distribution of organisms and biodiversity within an environmental context. Numerous geoprofessional disciplines contribute to the redevelopment of brownfields, sites (typically urban) that are underused or abandoned because they are or are assumed to be contaminated by hazardous materials. Geoprofessionals are engaged to evaluate the degree to which such sites are contaminated and the steps that can be taken to achieve the sites’ safe reuse. Environmental engineers and scientists work with developers to identify and design remediation strategies and exposure-barrier designs that protect future site users from unacceptable exposure to environmental contamination resulting from previous uses of the site. Because these previous uses often resulted in <b>degraded</b> <b>soil</b> conditions and the presence of abandoned, underground structures, geotechnical engineers often are needed to design special foundations for the new structures.|$|E
