5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{was even worse}} in the West. A critical blow was inflicted on the Empire in 827, as the Aghlabids began the slow conquest of Sicily, aided by the defection of the Byzantine commander Euphemios and the island's thematic fleet. In 838, the Muslims crossed over into Italy, taking Taranto and Brindisi, followed soon by Bari. Venetian operations against them were unsuccessful, and throughout the 840s, the Arabs were freely raiding Italy and the Adriatic, even attacking Rome in 846. Attacks by the Lombards and Lothair <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> dislodge the Muslims from Italy, while two large-scale Byzantine attempts to recover Sicily were heavily defeated in 840 and 859. By 850, the Muslim fleets, together {{with large numbers of}} independent ghazi raiders, had emerged as the major power of the Mediterranean, putting the Byzantines and the Christians in general on the defensive.|$|E
25|$|Military tactics {{developed}} before World War <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> {{keep pace}} with advances in technology and had become obsolete. These advances had allowed the creation of strong defensive systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through {{for most of the}} war. Barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while artillery, vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with machine guns, made crossing open ground extremely difficult. Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.|$|E

25|$|Objections {{were made}} against the closure, notably from the Kent County Council and Strood Rural District Council which {{challenged}} BR's method of calculating passenger numbers and losses. They {{argued that the}} figures (<b>i)</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> consider cheaper methods of running the line such as using diesel traction units, closing minor halts, eliminating unnecessary journeys, the operation of direct summer excursions from London to Allhallows and the combination of passenger and goods services, (ii) took into account costs incurred for the line between Gravesend and Grain which would remain open for freight, (iii) included a figure of £5,000 which would be paid to Maidstone & District Motor Services for replacement bus services, (iv) failed {{to take into account}} holiday traffic - 2,812 passengers having used Allhallows on the Whitsun holiday of 3/6 June 1960, and (v) failed to record the 25% increase in passenger numbers or take into account the ongoing residential development in the area.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{refers to}} {{altering}} the control room's appearance as changing the desktop theme, as the Fifth Doctor does in [...] "Time Crash". Like the Third Doctor in Inferno, the Doctor and Idris operate a TARDIS console without an outer TARDIS shell. The Doctor also jettisons TARDIS rooms to create thrust, {{as he had}} done previously in stories such as Logopolis and Castrovalva. The Doctor admits he killed all of the Time Lords, alluding to the events of the Time War. In The War Games, the Second Doctor contacted the Time Lords using a cube similar to those seen in this episode. The Doctor refers to himself as [...] "a madman with a box", reprising Amy's and his own description of himself in [...] "The Eleventh Hour". The Doctor refers to Nephew as [...] "another Ood <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> save"; in [...] "The Satan Pit" [...] the Doctor commented {{that he did not have}} time to save the Ood. Idris' cryptic words, [...] "the only water in the forest is the river", are explained in the mid-series finale, [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E
500|$|On 1 December, Benfica played Porto in the Clássico. Ricardo Quaresma took {{advantage}} of a 42nd-minute counterattack to dribble past David Luiz and score the winning goal for Porto. It was Benfica's first league loss at Luz since 28 January 2006. Camacho said, [...] "We were inexperienced, failed to retain the ball and allowed counter-attacks." [...] Three days later, Benfica travelled to Donetsk to play Shakhtar in the final match of the Champions League group stage, and Cardozo scored twice in the first 25 minutes to give Benfica the win. The club overtook Shakhtar, finishing third and qualifying for the UEFA Cup, and Camacho {{was pleased with the}} result. On 9 December, Benfica began their Portuguese Cup run by hosting Académica. The club won with goals by Luisão and Cardozo; Académica scored a consolation goal after a mistake by Benfica's goalkeeper, Butt. According to Camacho, [...] "We suffered a bit in the second half. Académica's goal complicated things." [...] League play resumed on 15 December, with Benfica commuting to the Estádio do Restelo to face Belenenses. The club failed to stem their hosts' momentum, giving up a 71st-minute goal for their second-straight league loss. Camacho accepted the blame: [...] "When you lose it is always the manager's fault. <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> pass the message to my players." [...] Benfica ended 2007 by hosting Estrela da Amadora on 20 December, winning 3–0 with all goals scored in the second half. The win placed Benfica seven points behind league leaders Porto, who had their first league loss to Nacional. On 21 December, Benfica participated in the UEFA Cup draw for the round of 32 and was paired with German team 1. FC Nürnberg.|$|E

2500|$|Last {{among the}} ministers were the Grand Treasurers. They kept {{accounts}} of the state finances, cash flow and State Treasury, and controlled the minting of coin. Since, like the Chancellors, they received no wages, corruption ran rampant and a sizable portion of state finances was lost in their pockets. If a Treasurer moved to another post, he was obliged to render accounts of his disbursements, and if he died, his family were required to produce them. A telling story is that of Bogusław Leszczyński, who while a Grand Treasurer (1650–1658) was offered a Chancellor's post, which he accepted in 1658. He bribed {{the members of the}} Parliament to grant him [...] "absolution", and when one of them later opposed him, he asked, curious: [...] "Who's this son of a bitch that <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> pay off?" ...|$|E
2500|$|McTaggart remarked, [...] "If {{somebody}} takes a {{third of}} somebody's book, which {{is what happened to}} me, they are lifting out the heart and guts of somebody else's individual expression." [...] Goodwin had previously reached a [...] "private settlement" [...] with McTaggart over the issue. In an article she wrote for Time magazine, she said, [...] "Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work, <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> provide quotation marks for phrases that I had taken verbatim... The larger question {{for those of us who}} write history is to understand how citation mistakes can happen." [...] In its analysis of the controversy, Slate criticized Goodwin for the aggrieved tone of her explanation, and suggested Goodwin's worst offense was allowing the plagiarism to remain in future editions of the book even after it was brought to her attention.|$|E
2500|$|Bell {{exhibited}} a working telephone at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in June 1876, where it {{attracted the attention}} of Brazilian emperor Pedro II plus the physicist and engineer Sir William Thomson (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 {{at a meeting of the}} British Association for the Advancement of Science, Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, [...] "I heard [...] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S. Cox Has Arrived' (<b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> make out the S.S. Cox); 'The City of New York', 'Senator Morton', 'The Senate Has Resolved To Print A Thousand Extra Copies', 'The Americans In London Have Resolved To Celebrate The Coming Fourth Of July!'

2500|$|In 1642 at {{the start}} of the Civil War, Charles <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> capture the two arsenals of Portsmouth and Hull, which {{although}} in cities loyal to Parliament were located in counties loyal to him. As he had failed to capture the arsenals, Charles did not possess any supply of swords, pikes, guns, or shot; all these the Black Country could and did provide. From Stourbridge came shot, from Dudley cannon. Numerous small forges which then existed on every brook in the north of Worcestershire turned out successive supplies of sword blades and pike heads. It was said that among the many causes of anger Charles had against Birmingham was that one of the best sword makers of the day, Robert Porter, who manufactured swords in Digbeth, Birmingham, refused at any price to supply swords for [...] "that man of blood" [...] (A Puritan nickname for King Charles), or any of his adherents. As an offset to this sword-cutler and men like him in Birmingham, the Royalists had among their adherents Colonel Dud Dudley, who had invented a means of smelting iron by the use of coke, and who claimed he could turn out [...] "all sorts of bar iron fit for making of muskets, carbines, and iron for great bolts", both more cheaply, more speedily and more excellent than could be done in any other way. His method was employed on the King's behalf.|$|E
2500|$|An {{official}} from Greek Ministry of National Defence {{said the}} plane had entered Greek air space at 14:58 (UTC). The pilots transmitted the hijack squawk code twice at 14:55 (UTC), while the aircraft was cruising about 25kilometres (15mi) north of Thessaloniki. Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato reported that the hijacker slipped into the cockpit with a package {{which could have been}} a bomb when flight attendants opened the cockpit door, and the pilots acted according to the international rules in the matter and did what the hijacker wanted. The flight's captain reported in Istanbul that [...] "while the chief stewardess entered the cockpit to ask if we needed anything, the terrorist entered by force. I tried to push him out but he was a big man and <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> stop him". The captain {{went on to say that}} the hijacker said he had three friends and they had explosives. He wanted to go Rome to speak with the Pope, and Italian Minister of the Interior Giuliano Amato reported that, the hijacker added there are other hijackers on another unspecified plane, [...] "would blow that plane up if the missive didn't get to the pope". The captain reported to the air-traffic controller in Thessaloniki that [...] "he had two undesirables who wished to go to Italy to see the Pope and to give him a message". Four Greek F-16 fighter jets took off and accompanied the plane until it left Greek airspace. Once in Italian airspace, two Italian F-16s intercepted, escorted, and forced it to land in Brindisi Airport in Brindisi. The airline spokesman said that Greek officials had alerted their Italian counterparts about the hijacking incident.|$|E
