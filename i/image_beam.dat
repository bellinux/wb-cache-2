Detailed temperature {{studies were carried out}} using a Ni layer (as a heating loop) sputtered on the backside of the ZrO 2 screen. Additionally, the spectral response of the materials was mapped for different temperature levels (RT- 300 o C), using a spectrometer.

These results clearly point out that the temperature of the scintillators is critical for high current operations.

Despite its many advantages over another steering antennas, applications of phased arrays are regrettably restricted to narrow {{fields such as}} military probably due to their high expenses. The high cost mainly comes from phase shifters which are a key device of phased arrays.

If we use one-bit phase shifters (phase quantization unit is 180 degrees) in a phased array, a mirror <b>image</b> <b>beam</b> appears with respect to the array broadside in addition to the intended scanning beam. A one-bit phased array, therefore, is not of practical use. The next roughest phase quantization unit is 120 degrees, which is obtained by dividing 360 degrees by 3.

40|$|Lippmann {{interference}} architectures are {{alternatives to}} holographic memories for high capacity data storage. In these systems, the <b>image</b> <b>beam</b> carrying the information data interferes with its reflection onto a mirror. The resulting interference pattern thus records a grating {{in the light}} sensitive material. Several images can be wavelength multiplexed at the same location. On the one side, and just as in holography, {{the number of images}} multiplexed in the same location is given by the wavelength Bragg selectivity of the thick gratings and is thus inversely proportional to the material thickness. On the other side, the page resolution is just diffraction limited and does not depend on this thickness. Each page can thus have a very large data content. Conversely to holography, no additional reference beam is required for recording. This absence of any reference beam simplifies the recording architecture at the expense on stringent requirements on the set-up adjustments.

40|$|The current {{thesis is}} divided into two projects. The first part deals with studies on active galaxies hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Specifically, an optical spectroscopic study of a nearby (z < 0. 06) volume - limited sample of Low - Luminosity Quasi - Stellar Objects (LLQSOs) has been carried out. The sample has been drawn from the Hamburg/ESO QSO survey (HES), which has a {{well-defined}} flux limit of B_j < 17. 3. The aim of the present project is to characterize the excitation degree of the sample, distinguish between possible star forming and Seyfert activity and to investigate the spectral characteristics of the sample. The spectroscopic data were analyzed and emission lines were fitted using a routine, which employs Levenberg - Marquardt least square minimization. The same analysis was also applied for some additional archival data from the 6 Degree Field Galaxy Survey (6 dFGS). The objects of the LLQSOs sample are classified according to the classical optical diagnostic diagrams, based on optical emission lines close in wavelength, avoiding almost any impact of reddening. The diagrams provide a diagnosis of the ionizing source within a galaxy, hence activity between Hii, LINERs (Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region), and Seyfert galaxies can be clearly distinguished. The classification of all members of the LLQSOs sample is shown in chapter 3. The broadness of the emission lines, cases with double components and the electron density are also analyzed. The comparison of the diagnostic diagrams between the two data sets (HES and 6 DFGS) results in different classifications of most of the sources. This is due to the different spectroscopic techniques applied in the two data sets during the observations, and is sketched in chapter 4. Several galaxies at a variety of cosmological distances, with elliptical and circular morphologies, were simulated. In these simulations, different instruments (different spectroscopic techniques, i. e. slit, fiber) were applied to the galaxies, in order to study the instrumental effect (aperture effect). The impact of the aperture effect in local and high redshift universe is discussed in detail. The second project of the thesis focuses on the construction of an <b>image</b> <b>beam</b> combiner for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LINC - NIRVANA instrument will be operating in the near - infrared (1 - 2. 4 μm) and will provide a high angular resolution (9 mas at 1. 25 μm) over a wide field of view (100 arcsec at 1. 25 μm). A fundamental component of the instrument, the Fringe and Flexure Tracking System (FFTS) is responsible to ensure a complete and time-stable wavefront correction at the position of the science detector. This will allow for long integration times at interferometric angular resolutions. A historical overview and our current achievements are also discussed in chapter 5. Laboratory tests of specific parts of the FFTS are presented in chapter 6.

40|$|The hole-drilling {{strain gauge}} {{technique}} {{has become a}} standard method in measuring residual stresses [1]. Moiré interferometry combining hole-drilling method opens additional opportunity for full-field residual stress measurement using optical interferometry [2]. The optical moiré method has a non-contact feature comparing with strain gauge method. Yet Moiré interferometry suffers a drawback in its complicated grating preparation {{on one hand and}} it is difficult to be applied to work piece with complicated geometry on the other hand. Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) provides information about the displacement field of a surface and it can be conveniently used on asreceived surfaces without special surface preparation and can be applied to work piece with complicated geometry that may be unsuitable for applying strain gauge or gratings. Studies on combining ESPI with hole-drilling show that is feasible to obtain reasonable residual stress values [3, 4]. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the detail of hole-drilling technique combining ESPI with phase unwrapping method to reveal the full field stress distribution and to measure the associated stress field on a thin specimen exerted by a uni-axial load. This study also demonstrates the noise reduction achieved by Gaussian low pass filter and a successful phase unwrapping resulted from five-step phase shifting and cellular automata method. Figure 1 shows the experimental setup of the ESPI system and the hole-drilling system. The light from a laser source is split into two beams. One split beam emerges from a PZT-stage to provide stepwise phase shifting and it further interferes with the other split <b>image</b> <b>beam</b> on the specimen surface to produce speckle patterns onto the CCD camera. By recording the speckle images of stepwise phase shifting before and after hole-drilling, the fringe patterns at each step can be obtained. Through a uniaxial loading fixture loads with different stress magnitudes in the range between 50 MPa and 150 MPa were applied to produce different degrees of loading and the associated fringe patterns. A five-step phase shifting was used in this work. Continuous phase distribution was achieved using phase unwrapping method. Gaussian low pass filter was applied and a suitable cut-off frequency was selected to effectively reduce the noise of patterns especially in the vicinity of the hole and to obtain a continuous phase map with closed contours. The continuous phase maps were reconstructed with higher quality and lower noise by applying the Schmitt’s five-step phase shifting algorithm and cellular automata (CA) phase unwrapping method. Special caution should be put on the phase unwrapping around the hole. Reducing the image area considered in the CA computation effectively reduced the CA computation time with stress values still in the range with satisfactory accuracy. Theoretical fringe patterns at each phase shifting step and at different stress magnitudes were constructed to compare with the experimental ones, Fig. 2. The relationship between displacement, stress and the number of fringes and the change of fringe patterns was analyzed to validate the feasibility of the ESPI combining hole-drilling method and to verify the accuracy of the stress results.
