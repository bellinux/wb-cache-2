40|$|Methods of coating diverse {{substrate}} {{materials with}} antimicrobial agents have been developed. Originally intended to reduce health risks to astronauts posed by pathogenic microorganisms that can grow on surfaces in spacecraft, these methods {{could also be}} used on Earth for example, to ensure sterility of surgical inserts and other medical equipment. The methods involve, generally, chemical preparation of substrate surfaces to enable attachment of antimicrobial molecules to the substrate surfaces via covalent bonds. Substrate materials that have been treated successfully include aluminum, glass, a corrosion-resistant nickel alloy, stainless steel, titanium, and poly(tetrafluoroethylene). Antimicrobial agents that have been successfully immobilized include antibiotics, enzymes, bacteriocins, bactericides, and fungicides. A variety of linkage chem istries were <b>employed.</b> <b>Activity</b> of antimicrobial coatings against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi was demonstrated. Results of investigations indicate that the most suitable combination of antimicrobial agent, substrate, and coating method depends upon the intended application...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a methodology for investigating whether a new delivery method for learning Introductory Statistics {{will be more}} effective in teaching students not only the computational manipulations of problems, but also how to apply the computational knowledge to the interpretation and solution of real world problems. Many students in Asia are able to quickly and successfully solve statistical problems when required to find numerical answers, but fail when the problem asks for a meaningful interpretation of the result. Or when faced with a problem in a work environment, many formally successful students fail to recall the methods used in statistics and/or cannot apply them successfully. We begin with a brief description of two theories we <b>employed,</b> <b>activity</b> theory and the situative (socio-historic) learning perspective and briefly review their implications for current practices. We then argue that only by changing the instructional delivery methods to include authentic activities, group discourse, collaborative inquiry, and self-assessment will the students be able to develop the skills necessary to transfer and retain the statistical methods learned. Both the situative learning perspective and activity theory take the view that considering the mind a...|$|E

A second interim target to be pursued simultaneously could be social integration.

Activities bring structure to the day and may enhance skills, e.g. Lechner/Sari (2014) confirm positive long-run income effects of sports activities estimating dose–response relationships. The third interim target—increasing employability—can only be set once the more pressing personal problems have been solved. Soft skills training and mobile learning could also be good activities.|$|R
40|$|Many {{application}} {{problems can}} be formulated as dynamic preference constraint satisfaction problems.

The preferences can be combined using any commutative, associative and monotonic operator to compute the preference of the overall solution. The important problem of expressing user preference under incomplete knowledge and combining them has not been addressed however. This paper introduces an order of magnitude preference (OMP) calculus to handle reasoning with preferences. The benefits of this calculus are twofold. Firstly, it allows for a partial ordering of preferences, rather than the usually imposed total ordering, thereby simplifying the knowledge required for problem formulation. Secondly, computational efficiency can be improved in solving complex problems as the OMP calculus ignores those preferences that are an order of magnitude lower than the ones that make a real difference to the overall quality of an emerging solution...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect of self-efficacy on student {{development}} in a higher learning institution, Universiti Putra Malaysia. There is an increase in figures in the unemployment rate of graduates was mainly due to the fact that most of the graduates were released to the labor market well trained in their areas of specialization but without being fully equipped with skills that are required in the highly competitive business environment. We used a Bandura's concept of self-efficacy as a measured framework of this study. A quantitative survey approach was employed in this study in Malaysia. The sampling frame was from a university's database provided by the Academic Department 2013. The findings showed that self-efficacy beliefs influence the goals which people set for themselves.
