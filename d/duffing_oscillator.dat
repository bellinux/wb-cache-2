40|$|We {{explore the}} quantum-classical {{crossover}} of two coupled, identical, {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) rings. We {{note that the}} motivation for this work is based on a study of a similar system comprising two coupled <b>Duffing</b> <b>oscillators.</b> In that work we showed that the entanglement characteristics of chaotic and periodic (entrained) solutions differed significantly and that in the classical limit entanglement was preserved only in the chaotic-like solutions. However, <b>Duffing</b> <b>oscillators</b> are a highly idealised toy model. Motivated by a wish to explore more experimentally realisable systems we now extend our work to an analysis of two coupled SQUID rings. We observe some differences in behaviour between the system that is based on SQUID rings rather than on <b>Duffing</b> <b>oscillators.</b> However, we show that the two systems share a common feature. That is, even when the SQUID ring's trajectories appear to follow (semi) classical orbits entanglement persists. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|A common {{external}} forcing {{can cause a}} saddle-node bifurcation in an ensemble of identical <b>Duffing</b> <b>oscillators</b> by breaking the symmetry of the individual bistable (double-well) unit. The strength of the forcing determines the separation between the saddle and node, which in turn dictates different dynamical transitions depending {{on the distribution of}} the initial states of the oscillators. In particular, chimera-like states appear {{in the vicinity of the}} saddle-node bifurcation for which theoretical explanation is provided from the stability of slow-scale dynamics of the original system of equations. Further, as a consequence, it is shown that even a linear nearest neighbor coupling can lead to the manifestation of the chimera states in an ensemble of identical <b>Duffing</b> <b>oscillators</b> in the presence of the common {{external forcing}}.

40|$|Abstract: Chaotic {{communications}} schemes {{based on}} synchronization aim {{to provide security}} over the conventional communication schemes. Symbolic dynamics based on synchronization methods has provided high quality synchronization [5]. Symbolic dynamics is a rigorous way to investigate chaotic behavior with finite precision {{and can be used}} combined with information theory [13]. In previous works we have studied the kneading theory analysis of the Duffing equation [3] and the symbolic dynamics and chaotic synchronization in coupled <b>Duffing</b> <b>oscillators</b> [2] and [4]. In this work we consider the complete synchronization of two identical coupled unimodal and bimodal maps. We relate the synchronization with the symbolic dynamics, namely, defining a distance between the kneading sequences generated by the map iterates in its critical points and defining n-symbolic synchronization. We establish the synchronization in terms of the topological entropy of two unidirectional or bidirectional coupled piecewise linear unimodal and bimodal maps. We also give numerical simulations with coupled <b>Duffing</b> <b>oscillators</b> that exhibit numerical evidence of the n-symbolic synchronization...|$|R
