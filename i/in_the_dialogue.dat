40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were (1) to identify the type of speech acts proposed by Searle performed by <b>the</b> characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> contained <b>in</b> Pathway to English for Senior High School Grade X: General Programme, (2) to explore the context of situations of <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> <b>in</b> Pathway to English for Senior High School Grade X: General Programme, (3) to reveal {{the relation between the}} illocutionary forces found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> and <b>the</b> two competencies formulated by The Ministry of National Education (4) to find out the character qualities integrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> <b>in</b> Pathway to English for Senior High School Grade X: General Programme. This study employed descriprive-qualitative research. <b>The</b> data used <b>in</b> this study were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forms of <b>dialogues</b> uttered by <b>the</b> characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> textbook. <b>In</b> this research, <b>the</b> quantitative data was involved to describe the occurrence of the data to support findings. The primary instrument of the researcher was the researcher and the data sheets were also employed as the second instrument. Some steps were undertaken during the data collection: Reading <b>the</b> <b>dialogues,</b> selecting <b>the</b> data, refitting the collected data, recording the data into data sheets. <b>In</b> analyzing data, <b>the</b> method was done by identifying and re-examining. This research principally used credibility, dependability and conformability to check the trustwothiness of the data. The results show that there are four points of findings discussed in this research. Related to the speech acts, there were four types of speech acts employed by <b>the</b> characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> <b>in</b> textbook entitled Pathway to English for Senior High School Grade X: General Programme. Assertive was the dominant speech acts used by the characters. Regarding the context of situation, the findings show that participants involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> varied. <b>The</b> conversations mostly happened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school. Warm, friendly and pleasant were the most physical setting occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conversation. <b>The</b> topics discussed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> are generally about <b>the</b> problems found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daily life. Then, <b>the</b> functions expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conversations are the expressions needed to be learned and practiced by <b>the</b> students <b>in</b> their daily life. The third result is there are relations between the illocutionary forces found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> and <b>the</b> two competencies, especially core competencies. Next, there are five classifications of character qualities integrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues.</b> Character qualities <b>in</b> relation of human to others get the highest place, including tolerant, appreciative, friendly, and socially caring...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} Plato’s {{dialogue}} form creates a Quinean “opaque context” that segregates the assertions by Plato’s characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> from both Plato {{and the real}} world {{with the result that}} <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> require a hermeneutical interpretation. Sec. I argues that since <b>the</b> assertions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> are located inside an opaque context, the forms of life of <b>the</b> characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> acquires primary philosophical importance for Plato. The second section argues that the thesis of Sec. I coheres with <b>the</b> claim <b>in</b> Plato’s Seventh Letter that since philosophical truth is incommunicable by means of language it is of primary importance for philosophers to develop proper “schemes of living” (forms of life). Sec. III argues since the forms of life of <b>the</b> characters portrayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> is of primary philosophical importance for Plato, and since hermeneutical methods are required to interpret emerging forms of life, Plato’s dialogues are positively crafted to be read hermeneutically. Sec IV argues that Heidegger, who is famous for seeing Plato’s views as antithetical to his own hermeneutical approach, is mistaken, and that Plato’s real views are, in principle, more akin to Heidegger’s views than he thinks...|$|R

5|$|Lowell {{believed}} that the poet {{played an important role}} as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> of his characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind also {{contained}} a fair bit of voiced dialogue; an aspect somewhat better {{received by the}} gaming press. Of note is Lynda Carter, television's Wonder Woman, promoted by Bethesda {{for her role in}} voicing the female Nords in the game. Morrowinds race-specific voice acting received praise from some reviewers, though was met with disdain from others, who disliked the discord between a culturally inflected voice spoken in an alien dialect and the grammatically flawless dialogue printed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> boxes. The Special Edition Soundtrack was released over DirectSong as a digital release.|$|E

Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E

25|$|The 'doctrine of reserve' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues.</b> There are {{numerous}} passages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> <b>in</b> which an especially important theme is introduced but then not further discussed. <b>In</b> many cases, <b>the</b> conversation breaks off just where it approaches {{the crux of}} the issue. These often concern questions which are of fundamental significance for philosophy. The defenders of the Tübingen School interpret these instances of 'reserve' as pointers to the content of the unwritten doctrines, which cannot be directly handled in written dialogues.|$|R

5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} {{different aspects of the}} Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogue.</b> The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E
5|$|The {{philosophy}} {{and principles of}} Tulsidas are found across his works, and are especially outlined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> between Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas.

At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that his work is in accordance with various scriptures – the Puranas, Vedas, Upavedas, Tantra and Smriti. Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas elaborates on Tulsidas' Lokmangal as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world littérateur.|$|E
5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, {{after its}} 1883 revival, Carmen was always {{presented}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, {{the year of}} the 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company's 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein's 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken dialogue, in Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{proposes a}} model of {{knowledge}} dynamics in dialogue, applied to expert–novice dialogues dealing with violin-string change. The model works by focusing on breakdowns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues,</b> where lack of understanding is signaled, and yields a functional stratification of <b>the</b> utterances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues,</b> and more-or-less distinct levels of instruction, coordination, and verbal labelling. These levels are then shown to correspond to different positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> continuum between pragmatics and semantics. The analysis also shows a close interplay between information management and social phenomena such as politeness. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Plato's dialogues feature Socrates, {{although}} not always {{as the leader}} of <b>the</b> conversation. (One <b>dialogue,</b> <b>the</b> Laws, instead contains an [...] "Athenian Stranger.") Along with Xenophon, Plato is the primary source of information about Socrates' life and beliefs and it is not always easy to distinguish between the two. While <b>the</b> Socrates presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> is often taken to be Plato's mouthpiece, Socrates' reputation for irony, his caginess regarding his own opinions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues,</b> and his occasional absence from or minor role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conversation serve to conceal Plato's doctrines. Much of what is said about his doctrines is derived from what Aristotle reports about them.|$|R
5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} and most {{powerful}} supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dialogue,</b> his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.|$|E
5|$|Bhimsen {{felt the}} need to finish off his rivals, but at the same time, felt a need to take {{precaution}} before going after immediate members of the royal household. For almost two years after returning to Kathmandu, Rana Bahadur had no official position in the government – he was neither a king, nor a regent, nor a minister – yet he felt no qualms in using the full state power. Not only did Rana Bahadur carry out the Baisathi Haran under Bhimsen's advice, he was also able to banish all non-vaccinated children, as well as their parents, from the town during a smallpox outbreak, in order to prevent King Girvan from catching that disease. Now, after almost two-year, all of a sudden Rana Bahadur was made mukhtiyar (chief authority) and Bhimsen tried to implement his schemes through Rana Bahadur. Bhimsen had also secretly learned of a plot to oust Rana Bahadur. Tribhuvan Khawas (Pradhan), a member of Sher Bahadur's faction, was imprisoned on the re-opened charges of conspiracy with the British that led to the Knox's mission, but for which pardon had already been doled out, and was ordered to be executed. Tribhuvan Khawas decided to reveal everyone that was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> with the British. Among those implicated was Sher Bahadur Shah.|$|E

40|$|One way {{of coming}} to terms with Platonic wonder is to examine what types of things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> elicit <b>the</b> pathos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place. My primary goal in this paper is to examine what evokes the wonder of Socrates and his interlocutors in a number of these works, and I will pay {{particularly}} close attention to what Plato has to say about the wondrous nature of humanity itself. I will show that Plato depicts Socrates and other characters found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialogues,</b> such as <b>the</b> young Theaetetus, as not only wonderers of the first rank, but also true wonders in themselves...|$|R
