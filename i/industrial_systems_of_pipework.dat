40|$|Mixing under {{laminar flow}} {{conditions}} {{is key to}} a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> size extending from microns to meters. Examples range from the traditional (and still very relevant) mixing of viscous fluids via compact processing equipment down to emerging micro-fluidics applications. Profound insight into laminar mixing mechanisms is imperative for further advancement of mixing technology (particularly for complex micro-fluidics systems) yet remains limited to date. The present study concentrates on a fundamental transport phenomenon of potential relevance to laminar mixing: the formation of coherent structures in the web of 3 D fluid trajectories due to fluid inertia. Such coherent structures geometrically determine the transport properties of the flow and better understanding of their formation and characteristics may offer ways to control and manipulate the mixing properties of laminar flows. The formation of coherent structures and its impact upon 3 D transport properties is demonstrated by way of examples...|$|R

40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> {{practical}} relevance can be often characterized {{in terms}} of discrete control variables and real-valued physical variables, and can therefore be modeled as hybrid automata. Unfortunately, continuity of the physical behaviour over time, or triangular constraints, must often be assumed, which yield an undecidable class of hybrid automata. In this paper, we propose a technique for bounded reachability of linear hybrid automata, based on the reduction of a bounded reachability problem to a MathSAT problem, i. e. satisfiability of a boolean combination of propositional variables and mathematical constraints. The MathSAT solver {{can be used to}} check the existence (or absence) of paths of bounded length. The approach is very similar in spirit to SAT-based bounded model checking; furthermore, the ability to reason directly about real variables gives computational leverage over discretization-based methods. Despite the undecidability of the general problem, the proposed method is able to provide valuable information on large designs of practical relevance...|$|R
