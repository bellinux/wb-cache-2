5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yajna-fire of {{her father}} Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor.

5|$|Billie Burke {{objected to}} her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) {{since she was}} also an actress under {{contract}} to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point {{she was not a}} big enough star to play <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Great Ziegfeld. However, according to Emily W.

Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.|$|E
