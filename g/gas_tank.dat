5|$|Prior {{to a new}} hotel {{opening on}} Amity Island, an {{enormous}} great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing {{the wreck of the}} Orca. A couple of days later, their camera is recovered, and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver, killing the skier, while the driver fends off the shark using a <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.|$|E
50|$|Built between 1910 and 1921, the <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> {{were built}} to hold gas. Until the 1960s, the <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> had been {{maintained}} by an inspector using a rowboat. Due {{to the increasing}} prevalence of much more compact gas cylinders, Brooklyn Union Gas began dismantling the <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> in 1996.|$|R
25|$|The Elmhurst <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> were {{formerly}} {{located in}} the area and were demolished in 2001. The Maspeth <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> were also {{located in the}} area until they were demolished.|$|R

5|$|Alex deduces {{that since}} he intervened Death skipped Carter and moved onto Billy, and realises that he is next on Death's list. While hiding out in a {{fortified}} cabin Alex recalls switching seats with two girls in his premonition but not before the explosion in reality, meaning Clear is actually next, and he rushes to save her while being chased by agents. Meanwhile, Clear is trapped inside her car with a leaking <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> surrounded by loose live wires. Alex arrives in time to save Clear and grabs the wire, allowing her {{to escape from the}} car seconds before it explodes, leaving Alex incapacitated.|$|E
5|$|Coastal {{scenes were}} filmed at Bass Rock and near Trancas, while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> which stood over 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to the cast and crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved to be a challenge, as the cast and crew had trouble communicating with each other, with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E
5|$|During the ship's peacetime career, she {{frequently}} {{took part}} in fleet reviews. In 1934, she went on a tour with the royal yacht to eastern Africa, and she made another foreign cruise two years later to Germany during the 1936 Summer Olympics being held there. She {{was involved in the}} Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s; she evacuated Italian nationals in August 1936, and while returning to Italy, suffered an explosion in an aviation <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> that necessitated major repairs. The ship supported the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939.|$|E

50|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> {{which are}} the most {{prominent}} features of any Gas Works, were {{to be of the}} ‘disappearing type’ that is only visible {{to the extent to which}} they are inflated and moreover they were to be placed upon the lower level of the site, which would be planted to almost completely screen the structures. The idea to make the <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> as inconspicuous as possible seems to have been abandoned later as the other three <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> were added and, though they were also, ‘of the disappearing kind’, they were much higher than the first two and were more visible from the road. The <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> have become part of the skyline of the city and, rather than be an eyesore as the city anticipated in 1927, they are now regarded as a heritage landmark.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, the Fringe {{division}} is falsely told that their Olivia has escaped. Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), still needing hyperbaric treatment to regrow his skin after being burned, and Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) follow a tracking device on Henry's taxi. When {{they arrive at}} the station, Olivia orders Henry to drive away, and manages to fire at a small valve on a <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> allowing the explosion to cover their trail. Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the rush of adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting {{this turn}} of events, Rin travels {{back into the}} {{artificial}} world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, {{the two of them}} go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak hole on the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, {{and the members of the}} Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Hiding {{inside an}} oil field shack while police comb {{the area and}} set up roadblocks, Gil is {{discovered}} by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies. Hurrying back to her house, Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who they are for. While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips {{out of the door}} to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the oil field, and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the girl out of the shack into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs the stairs {{to the top of a}} tall natural <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the splash}} pool are several effects {{such as a}} giant water tower which {{periodically}} releases a torrent of water, {{and the sound of}} an organ coming from the spire of a supposedly submerged church. Until 2006, the effects included a damaged <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> firing a large flame approximately every 10 minutes, but the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> no longer operates because the cylinders that were used to fuel the flame were removed {{to make way for the}} construction of Stealth. The other effects are also currently nonoperational and have been out of order for several years.|$|E

25|$|His last {{victory was}} on the {{afternoon}} of 27 May 1918. Immediately after he shot down this last Spad, he was jumped by several other enemy scouts. A bullet through the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> forced him to land behind French lines, about 50 meters from his final victim.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Schwinn {{successfully}} re-styled the B-10E, renaming it the Aero Cycle. While the Aero Cycle featured no technical improvements {{over the}} original B-10E, its streamlined frame, faux <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> and battery-powered headlight came {{to define the}} cruiser 'look'. Modern cruiser bicycles retain these design elements, (except sometimes for the tank and/or light accessories).|$|E
25|$|Larry is {{credited}} with helping to re-popularize the stripped down, tall handlebar, foot clutched, jockey shifted, no front brake or fender, small <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> open piped, kick start only, stock rake choppers that prevailed in the 1960s, before long front ends became popular (Larry explained during his first Biker Build-Off, that he preferred nimbleness in a bike so he could ride at high speeds along the mountain switchbacks).|$|E

50|$|Custom {{parts are}} what make {{choppers}} art, whether it's {{coming up with}} a new frame design or thinking out of the box and using a car rim for the rear. Many builders build their own <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> that are similar to full-size motorcycle <b>gas</b> <b>tanks,</b> but scaled down to fit the bikes. Sheet metal parts such as laser cut gussets are also used as accent pieces on the bike. The desire is to produce an individualized piece of mechanical art.|$|R

25|$|The ExPRESS Logistics Carrier 3 (ELC3) carried several Orbital Replacement Units (ORU) {{that were}} too large or too heavy for other {{spacecraft}} to carry to the ISS. These ORUs included a High Pressure <b>Gas</b> <b>Tank</b> (HPGT), an Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA), the S band Antenna Sub-System Assembly #2 & 3 (SASA), a Special Purpose Dextrous Manipulator (SPDM) Arm with Orbital Replacement Unit change-out mechanism, a Space Test Program Houston 3 Department of Defense payload, and a spare ELC pallet controller avionics box.|$|E
