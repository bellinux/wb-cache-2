5|$|In the {{previous}} year, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center {{found out that}} 56% of Russians felt pride and admiration at the anthem, even though only 40% (up from 19% in 2004) knew the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of the anthem. It was also noted in the survey that the younger generation was the most familiar with the words.|$|E
5|$|Vocabulary {{development}} is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their <b>first</b> <b>words</b> around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations.|$|E
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's <b>first</b> <b>words</b> are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E

When a radio {{reporter}} comes to broadcast André's <b>first</b> <b>words</b> upon landing, he explains his sorrow and denounces Christine. She is listening to the broadcast in her Paris apartment; she is attended by her maid, Lisette (Paulette Dubost). Christine has been married to Robert, Marquis de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio) for three years. For two years, Lisette has been married to Schumacher (Gaston Modot)the gamekeeper at Robert's country estatebut she is more devoted to Christine.

He arranges to meet his mistress Geneviève (Mila Parély) the next morning.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E

25|$|The {{complete}} text comprises fifteen stanzas. The anthem is an acrostic: {{the first}} {{letters of the}} fifteen stanzas formed the name 'Willem van Nassov' (Nassov was a contemporary orthographic variant of Nassau).

25|$|Infants {{follow a}} general {{timeline}} of vocal developments in childhood. This timeline provides a general outline of expected developments {{from birth to}} age one. Babbling usually lasts 6–9 months in total. The babbling period ends at around 12 months {{because it is the}} age when <b>first</b> <b>words</b> usually occur. However, individual children can show large variability and this timeline is only a guideline.|$|E
25|$|Infants usually {{produce their}} first word around 12 –14 months of age. <b>First</b> <b>words</b> are simple in {{structure}} and contain the same sounds {{that were used}} in late babbling. The lexical items they produce are probably stored as whole words rather than as individual segments that get put together online when uttering them. This is suggested by the fact that infants at this age may produce the same sounds differently in different words.|$|E
25|$|On {{the episode}} {{broadcast}} on Monday, August 30, 2010, {{it was revealed}} that Nancy had died in her sleep; the next day's episode dealt with Nancy's memorial service.

25|$|The {{couple had}} three {{children}} within the first three years: Vivien Brynhilda Carloine Foley (b. July 1895 – 1978), Arthur Percival Foley (b. 27 September 1897) and a second daughter, Nesta Foley (1900–1973). Unlike most parents of the Victorian era, the parents of Rhys-Davids {{spent a great deal}} of their time with their children, although they employed a child minder named Minna, a German woman. The <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of Arthur and his sister were German and the children often used German phrases. Nevertheless, Rhys-Davids's parents continued to be busy academics. In 1905 his father became a professor at the University of Manchester. His mother became a prolific author.|$|E
25|$|Like young {{children}} most of Genie's <b>first</b> <b>words</b> were monosyllabic consonant-vowel-(consonant) sequences, usually consisting of an unaspirated Bilabial stop or dental stop and a monophthong. But while most children's first disyllabic words also follow this pattern, hers had both consonant-vowel and vowel-consonant sequences. Unusually, {{from the very}} first disyllabic words Genie more fully articulated, except when referring to herself by her (real) name she immediately demonstrated proper stress patterns. For approximately two years the length of time she held out a vowel was her only stress indicator, and during that time was very exaggerated. People unfamiliar with her speech said she sounded either like a deaf child or someone with cerebral palsy, although trained speech pathologists only said the latter.|$|E
25|$|Nathan Leopold {{was born}} on November 19, 1904 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Florence (Foreman) and Nathan Leopold, a wealthy German Jewish {{immigrant}} family. A child prodigy {{who claimed to have}} spoken his <b>first</b> <b>words</b> at the age of four months, he reportedly scored an intelligence quotient of 210, though test results from that era are not directly comparable to scores on modern IQ tests. At {{the time of the murder}} he had already completed an undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago with Phi Beta Kappa honors, and planned to begin studies at Harvard Law School after a trip to Europe. He reportedly had studied 15 languages and spoke at least five fluently, and had achieved a measure of national recognition as an ornithologist. He and several other ornithologists identified Kirtland's warbler, an endangered songbird that had not been observed in the Chicago area in over half a century.|$|E
