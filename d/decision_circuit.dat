40|$|International audienceBayesian {{inference}} is {{a powerful}} approach for integrating independent conflicting information for decision-making. Though {{an important component of}} robotic, biological, and other sensory-motors systems, general-purpose computers perform Bayesian inference with limited efficiency. Here we show that Bayesian inference can be efficiently performed with stochastic signals, which are particularly adapted to novel low power nano-devices that exhibit faults and device variations. A simple Muller C-element directly implements Bayes' rule. Complex inferences are performed by C-element trees, which compute the probability of an event based on multiple independent sources of evidence. A naïve Bayesian spam filter circuit is demonstrated as a pedagogical application, and design techniques for improving circuit functionality are described. Limitations of this structure are discussed in terms of signal autocorrelation. The stochastic inference structure is exceptionally robust to faults, an essential feature of <b>decision</b> <b>circuits,</b> and can therefore leverage the increased efficiency of emerging nanodevices. This hardware implementation of Bayesian inference is extremely area and power efficient, with an area-energy-delay product several orders of magnitude less than the conventional floating point implementation. These results open a pathway for a direct stochastic hardware implementation of Bayesian inference, enabling a new class of embedded <b>decision</b> <b>circuits</b> for robotics and medical applications...|$|R

40|$|We often face {{alternatives}} {{that we are}} free to choose between. Planning movements to select an alternative involves several areas in frontal and parietal cortex that are anatomically connected into long-range circuits. These areas must coordinate their activity to select a common movement goal, but how neural circuits make decisions remains poorly understood. Here we simultaneously record from the dorsal premotor area (PMd) in frontal cortex and the parietal reach region (PRR) in parietal cortex to investigate neural circuit mechanisms for decision making. We find that correlations in spike and local field potential (LFP) activity between these areas are greater when monkeys are freely making choices than when they are following instructions. We propose that a <b>decision</b> <b>circuit</b> featuring a sub-population of cells in frontal and parietal cortex may exchange information to coordinate activity between these areas.

40|$|Fluctuations {{in rates}} of gene {{expression}} can produce highly erratic time patterns of protein production in individual cells and wide diversity in instantaneous protein concentrations across cell populations. When two independently produced regulatory proteins acting at low cellular concentrations competitively control a switch {{point in a}} pathway, stochastic variations in their concentrations can produce probabilistic pathway selection, so that an initially homogeneous cell population partitions into distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Many pathogenic organisms, for example, use this mechanism to randomly switch surface features to evade host responses. This coupling between molecular-level fluctuations and macroscopic phenotype selection is analyzed using the phage lambda lysis-lysogeny <b>decision</b> <b>circuit</b> as a model system. The fraction of infected cells selecting the lysogenic pathway at different phage:cell ratios, predicted using a molecular-level stochastic kinetic model of the genetic regulatory circuit, is consistent with experimental observations.
