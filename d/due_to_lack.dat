The final size of Douaumont had to be cut in size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of funds.|$|E

5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony {{and later the}} Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, {{though there is no}} evidence to prove the theory. It is considered unlikely <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When {{developing}} {{a catalogue of}} technical requirements for online voting systems {{to be used in}} legally ruled, non-parliamentary elections, major interdisciplinary problems arise which currently cannot be solved. Technical requirements are not yet definable <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> legal preconditions, and legal definitions are not yet definable <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> technical experience. Problems of this type are the role of a technically necessary intermediate storage of votes, the so-called last call problem and the general problem of ensuring verifiability. The problem of verifiability is discussed from the technical point of view to bring forward a possible solution 1. ...|$|R

40|$|Using 12 {{waves from}} the SOEP, this study {{analyses}} if there exists inequity in access {{or in the}} utilisation of health care services <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> language skills or <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> information about {{the health care system}} (approximated by years since migration) among German first-and second-generation immigrants. The results indicate that years since migration have a slightly impact on the contact decision, but not on the frequency decision. Hence, missing knowledge about the health care system could create additional access barriers and hence yield inequity in access to health care, but not in utilisation of health care services. Regarding the contact decision, German language skills have no influence for the first-generation immigrants, but for second-generation women. Hence, for this group, there exists inequity in the access <b>to</b> health care <b>due</b> <b>to</b> language skills. Regarding the frequency decision, German language skills seem to play a role for the group of first-immigrant men as well as for {{men and women of the}} second-generation: those reporting poor language skills have a significant lower expected number of visits. Hence, there is evidence for inequity in health care utilisation <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lacking</b> language skills...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 20 tropical storms, there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity. The first developed on June 1 in the northwest Caribbean and dissipated a few days later. Another depression developed on July 11 over Panama and also quickly dissipated. A tropical depression developed on July 17 in the northeastern Atlantic west of the Azores, and one ship reported hurricane-force winds; however, there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized, {{so it was not}} classified as a tropical storm. Originally, there was a tropical storm in the database in the Caribbean in the middle of August, but it was downgraded to a tropical depression <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of any reports of gale-force winds. Similarly, there was a tropical storm in the database in late September, but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> of gale-force winds.|$|E
