40|$|Final {{published}} versionData {{are presented}} from {{a survey by}} airborne scanning laser profilometer and an AUV-mounted, upward looking swath sonar in the spring Beaufort Sea. The air-snow (surface elevation) and water-ice (draft) surfaces were mapped at 1 x 1 m resolution over a 300 x 300 m area. Data were separated into level and <b>deformed</b> <b>ice</b> fractions using the surface roughness of the sonar data. The relation (R = d/f) between draft, d, and surface elevation, f, was then examined. Correlation between {{top and bottom surfaces}} was essentially zero at full resolution, requiring averaging over patches of at least 11 m diameter to constrain the relation largely because of the significant error (similar to 15 cm) of the laser instrument. Level ice points were concentrated in two core regions, corresponding to level FY ice and refrozen leads, with variations in R attributed primarily to positive snow thickness variability. <b>Deformed</b> <b>ice</b> displayed a more diffuse "cloud," with draft having a more important role in determining R because of wider deformed features underwater. Averaging over footprints similar to satellite altimeters showed the mean surface elevation (typical of ICESat) to be stable with averaging scale, with R = 3. 4 (level) and R = 4. 2 (deformed). The "minimum elevation within a footprint" characteristic reported for CryoSat was less stable, significantly overestimating R for level ice (R > 5) and <b>deformed</b> <b>ice</b> (R > 6).

Scientists are interested in evaluating the decline in local ice production. We will attempt to classify automatically First Year (FY) ice, Multi Year (MY) ice and <b>Deformed</b> <b>ice</b> using Sidescan sonar images of the Arctic ice-shelf. We use 4 -bit data (16 grey levels) ground truth images provided by an expert as a starting point of the study. These images have been obtained using a Sidescan sonar pointing upward. Our methods use first order statistics extracted from local areas of the image. The local histogram is fitted to three pdfs (Rayleigh, Log-normal and Gaussian distributions) whose parameters are extracted. A Chi-square test is used to evaluate the quality of the fit. The parameters are then used to classify the regions. The results obtained show that FY and MY ice follow Rayleigh or Log-normal distributions whereas <b>Deformed</b> <b>ice</b> is more like a Gaussian distribution. We have created a new method to classify ice types selecting the best fitting for each region.

We compute EM responses of ice types with a three-dimensional (3 -D) finite-volume discretization of Maxwell’s equations and present 2 -D sliced visualizations of their associated EM fields at discrete frequencies. Several interesting observations result: First, since the simulator computes the fields everywhere, each gridcell acts as a receiver within the model volume, and captures the complete, coupled interactions between air, snow, sea ice and sea water {{as a function of}} their conductivity; second, visualizations demonstrate how 1 -D approximations near <b>deformed</b> <b>ice</b> features are violated. But the most important new finding is that changes in conductivity affect EM field response by modifying the magnitude and spatial patterns (i. e. footprint size and shape) of current density and magnetic fields.

In order to evaluate the dual-pol data, ice thickness and surface roughness measurements and optical remote sensing data were compared to backscatter signatures observed in the SAR data. The study found that: i) dual-pol data provide improved separation of ice and open water, particularly at steep incidence angles and high wind speeds; ii) the contrast between new, young and first-year (FY) ice types is reduced in the cross-pol channel; and iii) large areas of heavily <b>deformed</b> <b>ice</b> can reliably be separated from level ice in the dual-pol data, but areas of light and moderately ridged ice cannot be resolved and the thickness of heavily <b>deformed</b> <b>ice</b> cannot be determined.

At a depth of 152. 8 m, a sharp discontinuity marks the transition between meteoric ice accumulated from above and marine ice accreted from below, as testified by electrolytical conductivity and stable-isotope measurements as well as geophysical field surveys. Automated image analysis of thin sections indicates that the decrease in grain-boundary density {{and the increase in}} grain cross-sectional area with depth is commensurate with though not necessarily caused bythermodynamically driven grain growth down to 120 m depth, corresponding to a vertical strain of roughly 65 % as computed with a simple temperature-history, particle-path model. The observed increase of grain-boundary density (i. e. a decrease of grain-size) with age in the marine ice is in part explained by the thermal history of this layer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Major {{polar ice}} sheets and ice caps {{experience}} cycles of variable flow during different glacial periods {{and as a}} response to past warming. The rate and localisation of deformation inside an ice body controls the evolution of ice microstructure and crystallographic fabric. This is critical for interpreting proxy signals for climate change, with deformation overprinting and disrupting stratigraphy deep under ice caps {{due to the nature of}} the flow. The final crystallographic fabric in polar ice sheets provides a record of deformation history, which in turn controls the flow properties of ice during further deformation and affects geophysical sensing of ice sheets. For example, identification of layering in ice sheets, using seismic or ice radar techniques, is attributed to grain size changes and fabric variations. Such information has been used to provide information on climate state and its changes over time, and as the Fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report (Solomon et al. 2007) points out there is currently still a lack of understanding of internal ice-sheet dynamics.

40|$|Abstract. We examine, {{and find}} {{evidence}} to support, {{the hypothesis that}} the width of Siple Coast ice streams in West Antarctica is set by the development of significant internal melting (i. e., development of temperate ice conditions) within the ice sheet at the margins. We first illustrate, from published ice sheet deformation data and from sim-ple 1 -D thermal modeling based on temperature-dependent flow and conduction prop-erties, that most existing Siple Coast ice stream margins {{are in a state of}} partial melt, with temperate ice being present over a substantial fraction of the sheet thickness. We show that, although the margins sustain high lateral strain rates, they can support (and hence transmit to the cold ridges) notably less lateral shear stress than would the some-what less rapidly <b>deforming</b> <b>ice</b> located inboard, away from the ridge. We then propose, and quantify approximately, a possible related mechanism of margin formation, that is, of locking the sheet to the bed at the margin. Shear heating of the temperate ice con-tinually generates melt, which percolates toward the bed below. If this develops a chan-nelized marginal drainage of Röthlisberger type, the standard theory argues that the high, nearly lithostatic, basal pore pressure elsewhere (i. e., near the bed within the fast mov-ing stream) is somewhat alleviated within the channel. This results in a higher Terza-ghi effective normal stress, which we quantify approximately, acting along the bed near the channel, thereby creating high resistance against frictional shear and possibly lock-ing the ice to the bed, naturally forming an ice stream margin. Our estimates are that the effective normal stress acting on the bed just outside such a channel, and hence the till shear strength, can be twenty to sixty times larger than that inferred to be present at the bed within the fast-moving stream. Reduced basal fluid pressure, and hence en-hanced strength, over a broad region near the margin is shown sufficient to remove the strong stress concentration at the slipping to locked bed transition, and provides a sta-bilizing mechanism for the margin. 1...|$|R

40|$|Changes of {{the mean}} sea ice {{thickness}} and concentration in the Arctic are well known. However, comparable {{little is known about}} the ice thickness distribution and the composition of ice pack in quantity. In this paper we determine the ice thickness distributions, mean and modal thicknesses, and their regional and seasonal variability in the Arctic under different large scale atmospheric circulation modes. We compare characteristics of the Arctic ice pack during the periods 1975 – 1987 and 1988 – 2000, which have a different distribution in the AO/DA space. The study is based on submarine measurements of sea ice draft. The prevalent feature is that the peak of sea ice thickness distributions has generally taken a narrower form and shifted toward thinner ice. Also, both mean and modal ice thickness have generally decreased. These noticeable changes result from a loss of thick, mostly <b>deformed,</b> <b>ice.</b> In the spring the loss of the volume of ice thicker than 5 m exceeds 35 % in all regions except the Nansen Basin, and the reduction is as much as over 45 % at the North Pole and in the Eastern Arctic. In the autumn the volume of thick, mostly <b>deformed</b> <b>ice</b> has decreased by more than 40 % in the Canada Basin only, but the reduction is more than 30 % also in the Beaufort Sea and in the Chukchi Sea. In the Beaufort Sea region the decrease of the modal draft has been so strong that the peak has shifted from multiyear ice to first-year type ice. Also, the regional and seasonal variability of the sea ice thickness has decreased, since the thinning has been the most pronounced in the regions with the thickest pack ice (the Western Arctic), and during the spring (0. 6 – 0. 8 m per decade) ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{attractive}} {{since it}} scales up the Nye channel formation {{which has been}} observed in sediments, a weakness of the steady state theory is that it requires that tunnel valleys be excavated in unconsolidated sediment, in which meltwater is initially forced through an initially narrow subglacial conduit. With progressive sediment erosion by the meltwater, <b>ice</b> <b>deforms</b> under its own weight into the cavity to creating an ever-larger tunnel valley. However the steady state theory appears not to account for erosion into bedrock, which has been extensively observed.|$|R
40|$|Major {{polar ice}} sheets and ice caps {{experience}} cycles of variable flow during different glacial periods {{and as a}} response to past warming. The rate and localisation of deformation inside an ice body controls the evolution of ice microstructure and crystallographic fabric. This is critical for interpreting proxy signals for climate change, with deformation overprinting and disrupting stratigraphy deep under ice caps {{due to the nature of}} the flow. The final crystallographic fabric in polar ice sheets provides a record of deformation history, which in turn controls the flow properties of ice during further deformation and affects geophysical sensing of ice sheets. For example, identification of layering in ice sheets, using seismic or ice radar techniques, is attributed to grain size changes and fabric variations. Such information has been used to provide information on climate state and its changes over time, and as the Fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report (Solomon et al. 2007) points out there is currently still a lack of understanding of internal ice-sheet dynamics. To answer this we have recently conducted experiments at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) to collect fully quantitative microstructural data from polycrystalline heavy water (D₂O) <b>ice</b> <b>deformed</b> in a dynamic regime. The ice and temperature (- 7 ℃) chosen for this study is used as a direct analogue for <b>deforming</b> natural-water <b>ice</b> as it offers a unique opportunity to link grain size and texture evolution in natural ice at - 10 ℃. Results show a dynamic system where steady-state rheology is not necessarily coupled to microstructural and crystallographic fabric stability. This link needs to be taken into account to improve ice-mass-deformation modelling critical for climate change predictions. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} {{modes of}} polycrystalline ice are reviewed. Whereas single crystals of <b>ice</b> <b>deform</b> easily by shear on the basal plane, the minimum creep rate of polycrystalline ice is largely controlled by processes occurring on non-basal planes. Three main models describing the transient behaviour of polycrystalline ice are presented and discussed. Evidence that {{the occurrence of}} the first cracks, in the ductile-brittle transition, is related to a critical delayed elastic strain is presented. The mechanical behaviour of damaged ice is discussed. It is shown that damage enhances the creep rate notably. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
