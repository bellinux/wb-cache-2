50|$|Ordnungspolizei (Orpo) ranks {{were based}} on local police titles and were {{considered}} a separate system {{from the ranks of}} the SS. It was also possible for Orpo members to hold dual status in both the Orpo and the SS, meaning that two ranks could be held simultaneously. In the case of Orpo generals, equivalent SS rank was always held in which case the Orpo general would be addressed by their SS rank first, followed by their police titles (for example: SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei). In 1944, all Orpo generals also gained equivalent Waffen-SS rank so that, in the event of capture by the Allies, the Orpo general would <b>hold</b> <b>status</b> as a military officer instead of a police official.|$|E

40|$|Background: Psychopathy is a {{controversial}} psychological construct with a contentious history. Ambiguity regarding its pathology persists, coincident with long-standing {{critique of the}} construct. Contemporary research indicates ontological confusion, limitations with assessment practices, {{and the presence of}} a negative bias towards individuals identified as psychopathic; the implications of this raise serious ethical concerns. Despite this, the psychopathy construct is used within forensic settings to understand the psychology of forensic service users; in particular, clinical psychologists <b>hold</b> <b>status</b> as a professional group able to understand, assess for, and confer the presence of, psychopathy. In addition to the aforementioned limitations, there is also a lack of research into the accounts of clinical psychologists working in forensic settings. Aims: To examine how clinical psychologists discursively construct psychopathy, including an investigation of the discourses and subjectivities produced and utilised in their talk, and the implications for action resultant from these. Method: Eight one-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinical psychologists currently working in forensic mental health contexts (low, medium and high secure). Foucauldian Discourse Analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: (1) Persons with psychopathy were constructed as problematised individuals. Constructions arose from four overarching discursive sites: dangerous, challenging, manipulative, and psychologically deficient. ‘At risk’ and ‘trauma’ discourses were utilised to explain the aetiology of psychopathy. ‘Intuition’ talk was employed by participants as a marker of the presence of psychopathy. (2) The psychopathy construct was identified as contested and problematic. To manage this, a variety of subject positions were taken up; three overarching subjectivities were identified: pragmatist, subversive, and expert/specialist. (3) Accounts pointed to a psychological imperative for psychopathy. Central to this was the promotion of three core psychology technologies: formulation, supervision, and reflective practice. These were constructed as solutions to the ‘problem’ of psychopathy in different ways. Clinical and research implications are discussed in light of the analysis...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a scenario where an energy harvesting sensor continuously monitors a system and sends time-stamped status updates to a destination. The destination {{keeps track of}} the system status through the received updates. We use the metric Age of Information (AoI), the time that has elapsed since the last received update was generated, to measure the "freshness" of the status information available at the destination. We assume energy arrives randomly at the sensor according to a Poisson process, and each status update consumes one unit of energy. Our objective is to design optimal online status update policies to minimize the long-term average AoI, subject to the energy causality constraint at the sensor. We consider three scenarios, i. e., the battery size is infinite, finite, and one unit only, respectively. For the infinite battery scenario, we adopt a best-effort uniform status update policy and show that it minimizes the long-term average AoI. For the finite battery scenario, we adopt an energy-aware adaptive status update policy, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal when the battery size goes to infinity. For the last scenario where the battery size is one, we first show that within a broadly defined class of online policies, the optimal policy should have a renewal structure, i. e., the status update epochs form a renewal process, {{and the length of}} each renewal interval depends on the first energy arrival over that interval only. We then focus on a renewal interval, and prove that if the AoI in the system is below a threshold when the first energy arrives, the sensor should store the energy and <b>hold</b> <b>status</b> update until the AoI reaches the threshold, otherwise, it updates the status immediately. We analytically characterize the long-term average AoI under such a threshold-based policy, and explicitly identify the optimal threshold...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} method {{is used to}} obtain approximate solutions to operations planning problems. Its power comes from the ability to model complex systems effectively. This property makes simulation preferable in practice over programming methods which provide exact solutions but are limited {{in the range of}} problems they can be applied. Flexibility of simulation modeling is desirable especially in resource constrained operations planning problems. When internal decision mechanisms like heuristic methods are added to the scope of simulation, performance can be enhanced significantly. As a result of application of neural networks and fuzzy associative memories to operations planning through the context of simulation, we expect to improve the plan quality in terms of accurate projection of schedule, cost and performance over the project duration. For this purpose, we partition the general system model into three parts. We implemented the functions of the activity network, the first part, using a neural network. Our analysis of the proposed network predicted hundred percent recall success, and we verified this through experiments. The second part which is to resolve resource constraints is implemented with a fuzzy associative memory. This approach allows us to use multiple heuristics to obtain the best results in plan quality. Our work is based on the success of earlier studies of multi-heuristic techniques in solving resource constrained operations planning problems. The rest of the process is taken care of by the third part of simulation model which includes everything that is not included in activity network part or in determining the priorities using heuristics. This part allocates the available resources to pending activities in the order of priorities assigned by the FAM, until the skyline of resources are reached. It puts the activities which did not receive service from a resource to <b>hold</b> <b>status</b> to evaluate its request again when resources become available...|$|E

40|$|Abstract When atoms {{are cooled}} down to {{temperature}} {{close to the}} absolute zero, {{they can no longer}} be described as a classical gas of point-like particles, and it becomes necessary to use the laws of quantum mechanics to describe their properties. Thanks to the high accuracy with which cold atomic systems can be controlled and manipulated, nowadays ultracold atomic gases provide a platform to emulate other many-body quantum systems, encountered in particular in condensed matter physics. For this reason we can say that cold atoms systems are "quantum simulators" of various many-body systems with interesting properties. This thesis describes the research work I have done within the Bose Einstein Condensates group of Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, at Collège de France in Paris. The experiment to which I took part aims to simulate for electrically neutral atoms the analogue of an electromagnetic gauge potential in a bidimensional periodic system. The presence of a magnetic field breaks the lattice periodicity, and consequently the energetic band structure of the lattice changes, with the appearance of subbands separated by finite gaps. This turns in important consequences for the transport properties of the system (e. g., in the integer Quantum Hall Effect displayed by electronic systems). In the tight binding regime, where particle motion is described by tunneling between nearest-neighbors, the presence of the magnetic field results in a complex tunneling amplitude (the so-called Peierls factor). The simulation scheme of our experiment is based precisely on mimicking this phase factor using laser dressing of ultracold Ytterbium atoms. The ground state 1 S 0 = g and the metastable excited state 1 P 1 = e are coupled by an ultranarrow optical transition (also used in optical atomic clocks). Driving this clock transition in a special, state-dependent lattice, one can realize the Peierls factor trough laser-assisted tunneling, as I explain briefly in the thesis. In this manuscript I will focus on the production and characterization of an Ytterbium BEC, to be used as the first step for the realization of the gauge fields. I {{have been involved in the}} reconstruction of the main setup (at my arrival the vacuum chamber was disassembled for allowing some improvements). An ultracold cloud is produced after several laser cooling steps (Zeeman slowing and magneto optical trapping) performed in the so-called MOT chamber, followed by evaporation in an optical dipole trap in the Science chamber. Here the condensate is obtained, and then charged in the optical lattice. I describe the experimental aspects of each one of these steps, and briefly sketch the theoretical elements underlining them. An essential aspect of quantum gases experiments is the acquisition of high-resolution images that provide density maps of the quantum gases under investigation. I will present in-depth tests of the existing imaging systems in the experiment, and also the design, construction and test of a new one with much improved performances. The tests aimed to infer informations about the optical resolution, limited in general by optical aberrations. In order to minimize the presence of these aberrations, I designed using a ray tracing software (OSLO) and optically characterized an aberration-corrected microscope objective for the new imaging system, operating with diffraction-limited resolution for a numerical aperture of 0. 3 (limited by the vacuum system geometry). In particular the magnification, focal length, modulation transfer function and resolution have been measured. For completeness I also report some preliminary results in setting up a repumper for atoms in the metastable state e. In the current experiment, only atoms in the ground state can be detected. It would be extremely useful in the future to also detect atoms in the excited state directly. This requires a repumper laser in order to quickly bring back atoms from the metastable state to the ground one with good and reproducible efficiency. Unfortunately, the laser broke, and the supplier could not repair within the duration of the research stay, leaving this project on <b>hold</b> <b>status.</b> Nevertheless, I report on the basic idea, as well as on spectroscopy measurements performed to locate nearby absorption lines that could be use to lock the laser frequency...|$|E
