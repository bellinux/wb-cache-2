50|$|Endolymphatic hydrops is a {{disorder}} {{of the inner}} ear. It consists of an <b>excessive</b> <b>build-up</b> of the endolymph fluid, which fills the hearing and balance structures of the inner ear.

In addition to water, endolymph fluid contains salts such as sodium, potassium, chloride and other electrolytes. If the inner ear is damaged by disease or injury, the volume and composition of the endolymph fluid can change, causing the symptoms of endolymphatic hydrops.|$|E

Most Mark 3 carriages have no retention tanks, discharging onto the track via a U-bend/pipe near the bogies, and in the 2000s both the RMT trade union and politicians were concerned at {{the environmental impact of}} this legacy issue. The problem was first raised in 2003 after Railtrack staff at [...] abandoned local clean-up and then track maintenance procedures due to an <b>excessive</b> <b>build-up</b> of sewage waste in the area. In 2006 the RMT agreed waste tank and clean-out developments at Northern Rail's Heaton depot in 2006 with GNER, and new clean-out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over the previous 18 months. By 2011, the European Union had started a formal investigation to see whether trains composed of such carriages were breaking EU environmental and health laws, although the Environment Agency confirmed that train companies claimed special exemptions to dump waste on the track. In 2013, Transport Minister Susan Kramer branded the practice [...] "utterly disgusting" [...] and called on the industry to take action.

40|$|Large and {{persistent}} current account deficits are frequently raised {{as a cause}} for concern for a number of reasons. Perhaps the key concern is that countries in this situation could be on a path to insolvency, building up excessive net foreign debt, raising the prospects of default or a sharp reversal in capital flows, which might force an abrupt and costly adjustment. 1 Large deficits and rising indebtedness could also leave countries more vulnerable to adverse external shocks, including a change in sentiment on the part of foreign creditors. Some argue that policymakers should take steps to ensure that countries move toward a sustainable position in which the current account deficit is not so large that it will lead to an <b>excessive</b> <b>build-up</b> in foreign indebtedness. 1.

However, there is no confirmation that TG 2 is the only transglutaminase involved, neither there are strategies to control its action specifically over that of the conserved family-members. In this study, we have profiled transglutaminase isozymes in the rat subtotal nephrectomy (SNx) model of progressive renal scarring. All transglutaminases increased post-SNx peaking at loss of renal function but TG 2 was the predominant enzyme. Upon SNx, extracellular TG 2 deposited in the tubulointerstitium and peri-glomerulus via binding to heparan sulphate (HS) chains of proteoglycans and co-associated with syndecan- 4. Extracellular TG 2 was sufficient to activate transforming growth factor-β 1 in tubular epithelial cells, and this process occurred in a HS-dependent way, in keeping with TG 2 -affinity for HS. Analysis of heparin binding of the main transglutaminases revealed that although the interaction between TG 1 and HS is strong, the conformational heparin binding site of TG 2 is not conserved, suggesting that TG 2 has a unique interaction with HS within the family.

This again confirmed GAO's lack of scientific/engineering understanding of the weapon concept/deployment strategy. Unfortunately, GAO's less than informed report led to speculation that binary weapons might be inferior to those of the unitary weapons they were intended to replace despite their inherent safety for US military personnel. The GAO repeatedly backed these assertions without engineering substantiation, maintaining that the BIGEYE was not adequately tested and that it had encountered major technical issues.

Against these paltry forces France decided to mobilize an army of 450,000 men, larger than any army Europe had ever seen.”Depending on the source, the exact number of those conscripted ranges from 750,000 to around 800,000. However, the values cannot be verified and is a reconstructed estimate because the French Government was in no position to give accurate figures at the time. One source states the official numbers in February 1793, were 361,000 men, in January 1794, were 670,900 men, in April 1794, 842,300, with the maximum reached in September 1794, 1,108,300. “However these figures are worth very little.” The figures “designated all who were on the rolls as being maintained {{at the expense of the}} state, including therefore all those disabled by illness, capture or even desertion...The best guess seems to be that about 800,000 were available for active service” in 1794. Other sources give estimates that around 750,000 men were actively serving in the French Army. “The Commission of Armies alone could not identify the armies, let alone its location or strength.” Also, there were many individuals that deserted the army, but the exact number of individuals that deserted is also an estimation based on the number of individuals that were caught or came back to France due to amnesty laws.|$|R
