5|$|The Devonian {{tetrapods}} {{went through}} two major bottlenecks during {{what is known}} as the Late Devonian extinction; one at the end of the <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage,</b> and one twice as large at the end of the following Famennian stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance of primitive tetrapods with fish-like features like Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When tetrapods reappear in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
50|$|Beelarongia is a genus {{of prehistoric}} lobe-finned fish which lived during the Late Devonian period (<b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage,</b> about 375 to 385 million years ago). Fossils {{have been found}} in Victoria, Australia.|$|E

50|$|The Gogo sediments {{represent}} deep, Hypoxic seafloor {{deposits in}} the vicinity of a large tropical reef composed primarily of algae and stromatoporoids during the <b>Frasnian</b> faunal <b>stage</b> of the Late Devonian. Associated stratigraphic units which comprise this ancient reef system are the Windjana Formation (the actual reef structures), Pillara Limestone (reef platform) and the Sadler Formation (fore-reef deposits).|$|R
50|$|In the Morvan Devonian sediments of the Givetian, <b>Frasnian</b> and Famennian <b>stages</b> are exposed. Givetian and Frasnian are {{developed}} as reefal limestones. The Famennian {{is composed of}} clymeniid-bearing shales interbedded with spilites.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage</b> was {{proposed}} in 1879 by French geologist Jules Gosselet and was accepted {{for the lower}} stage of the Upper Devonian by the Subcommission on Devonian Stratigraphy in 1981. It is named after the village of Frasnes-lez-Couvin in Belgium.|$|E
50|$|Major reef-building {{was under}} way during the <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage,</b> {{particularly}} in western Canada and Australia. On land, the first forests were taking shape. In North America, the Antler and Taconic orogenies peaked, which were contemporary with the Bretonic phase of the Variscan orogeny in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Elginerpeton is a {{monotypic}} genus {{of early}} tetrapod, the fossils {{of which were}} recovered from Scat Craig, Scotland, in rocks dating to the late Devonian Period (Late <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage,</b> 375 million years ago).

40|$|About 2, 450 carapaces, {{valves and}} {{fragments}} of ostracods have been extracted from 94 samples {{collected in the}} Fromelennes, Nismes and Moulin Liénaux Formations at Nismes, close to Frasnes (southern border of the Dinant Synclinorium, Belgium). Sixty-three taxa belonging to the Eifelian Mega-Assemblage are recognized. The only significant change as deduced from the ostracod fauna is the progressive transition from lagoonal and semi-restricted environments to open-marine environments in {{the upper part of}} the Fromelennes Fm. The Polyzygia beckmanni beckmanni Zone and the Favulella lecomptei Zone established on metacopid ostracods are recognized at Nismes, and the simultaneous occurrence of these two species in a sample collected in {{the upper part of the}} Sourd d’Ave Mbr implies the emendation of the definition of the P. beckmanni beckmanni Zone. The new definition is: presence of P. beckmanni beckmanni before the first occurrence of F. lecomptei. A new species, Ovatoquasillites nismesensis nov. sp., is described. The sedimentological analysis confirms that the transition of the Givetian and <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stages</b> does not correspond to a particular event. The evolution of the lithological curve across the Givetian / Frasnian boundary allows the recognition of 5 sequences recording a general drowning of the Givetian carbonate platform. No effective barrier system was active at that time suggesting that the Givetian carbonate platform was already dismantled prior to its definitive drowning...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfter terrestrialization, the {{diversification}} of arthropods and vertebrates {{is thought to}} have occurred in two distinct phases 1, the first between the Silurian and the <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stages</b> (Late Devonian period) (425 – 385 [*]million years (Myr) ago), and the second characterized by the emergence of numerous new major taxa, during the Late Carboniferous period (after 345 [*]Myr ago). These two diversification periods bracket the depauperate vertebrate Romer’s gap (360 – 345 [*]Myr ago) and arthropod gap (385 – 325 [*]Myr ago) 1, which could be due to preservational artefact 2, 3. Although a recent molecular dating has given an age of 390 [*]Myr for the Holometabola 4, the record of hexapods during the Early–Middle Devonian (411. 5 – 391 [*]Myr ago, Pragian to Givetian stages) is exceptionally sparse and based on fragmentary remains, which hinders the timing of this diversification. Indeed, although Devonian Archaeognatha are problematic 5, 6, the Pragian of Scotland has given some Collembola and the incomplete insect Rhyniognatha, with its diagnostic dicondylic, metapterygotan mandibles 5, 7. The oldest, definitively winged insects are from the Serpukhovian stage (latest Early Carboniferous period) 8. Here we report the first complete Late Devonian insect, which was probably a terrestrial species. Its ‘orthopteroid’ mandibles are of an omnivorous type, clearly not modified for a solely carnivorous diet. This discovery narrows the 45 -Myr gap in the fossil record of Hexapoda, and demonstrates further a first Devonian phase of diversification for the Hexapoda, as in vertebrates, and suggests that the Pterygota diversified before and during Romer’s gap...|$|R
50|$|Large halite (salt) {{deposits}} {{were formed}} during <b>Frasnian</b> and Famennian <b>stages</b> of the Late Devonian epoch. Saliferous formations cover 26 thousand km2 {{in the southeastern}} part of the country. Three deposits have been explored - Starobin (in Minsk Voblasts), Mazyr and Davydaŭskaje (both in Homiel Voblasts). The Davydaŭskaje deposit is the biggest, with proven reserves over 20 billion tonnes, but only the Starobin and Mazyr deposits are used to produce salt. More than 350,000 tonnes of halite are mined in the Starobin deposit per year (2004). In the Mazyr deposit, the saliferous liquid is extracted via wells, and up to 360,000 tonnes of salt are produced annually (2004).|$|R

5000|$|The Givetian {{is one of}} two faunal {{stages in}} the Middle Devonian period. It lasted from [...] million years ago to [...] million years ago. It was preceded by the Eifelian stage and {{followed}} by the <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage.</b> It is named after the town of Givet in France.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{is clear}} a massive loss of {{biodiversity}} occurred in the Later Devonian, the extent of time during which these events took place is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 500,000 to 25 million years, extending from the mid-Givetian to the end-Famennian. Nor is it clear whether it concerned two sharp mass extinctions or a series of smaller extinctions, though the latest research suggests multiple causes {{and a series of}} distinct extinction pulses through an interval of some three million years. Some consider the extinction to be as many as seven distinct events, spread over about 25 million years, with notable extinctions at the ends of the Givetian, <b>Frasnian,</b> and Famennian <b>stages.</b>|$|R
40|$|Acanthodian remains {{occur in}} {{micaceous}} siltstone lenses (presumed {{to have been}} deposited during a marine incursion) in the Cuche Formation (?Frasnian) of northeast Colombia. The acanthodians are represented by patches of scales from climatiidid Nostolepis sp. cf. N. gatijensis and a fin spine and scales from a new diplacanthid. Type material of N. gaujensis is from the <b>Frasnian</b> Sventoji regional <b>stage</b> in the Baltic, and Nostolepis sp. cf. N. gaujensis has been recorded in the Frasnian of Iran, {{as well as from}} Colombia. The new diplacanthid taxon shows affinity to Baltic and Antarctic diplacanthids. The fauna thus shows possible links to both Gondwanan and Euramerican acanthodian assemblages. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|More {{advanced}} {{structures are}} common in the Rhynie chert, and many other fossils of comparable early Devonian age bear structures that look like, and acted like, roots. The rhyniophytes bore fine rhizoids, and the trimerophytes and herbaceous lycopods of the chert bore root-like structure penetrating a few centimetres into the soil. However, none of these fossils display all the features borne by modern roots. Roots and root-like structures became increasingly more common and deeper penetrating during the Devonian, with lycopod trees forming roots around 20 cm long during the Eifelian and Givetian. These were joined by progymnosperms, which rooted up to about a metre deep, during the ensuing <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage.</b> True gymnosperms and zygopterid ferns also formed shallow rooting systems during the Famennian.|$|E
5000|$|Six {{possible}} {{species of}} Cheirolepis are currently known. The type species, named in 1835, is C. trailli. Remains {{of this species}} have been found from Scotland and {{date back to the}} Eifelian and Givetian stages of the Middle Devonian. C. canadensis was described in 1881 from material found in Miguasha, Canada that dated back to the middle <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Devonian. Two species, C. gracilis and C. gaugeri, have been found from Germany and Belarus in deposits that are of Givetian age. They were first described in 1973 from scale material that is now of questionable validity. Another species has been found from Belarus that lived during the Eifelian, and has been named C. sinualis. A new species has recently been described from a locality in Red Hill, Nevada deposited during the Mid-Late Devonian boundary. The specimen from which this species was named, consisting of scales and a lower jaw, was originally referred to C. canadensis. New, more complete specimens have shown it to be distinct from the type, although a species name is yet to be given for the remains.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} isotope–geochemical {{studies of}} the Upper Devonian of the Rudny Altai.

In aleurosandstones the total content of iron (by resonance adsorption) varies in a wide range- from the amount corresponding to the lowest limit of method sensitivity (≈ 0. 3 mass %) to the significant amount (up to 5 mass %).

40|$|Abstract – The {{intensity}} {{and extent of}} anoxia during the two Kellwasser anoxic events has been investigated {{in a range of}} European localities using amultidisciplinary approach (pyrite framboid assay, gamma-ray spectrometry and sediment fabric analysis). The results reveal that the development of the Lower Kellwasser Horizon in the early Late rhenana Zone (<b>Frasnian</b> <b>Stage)</b> in German type sections does not always coincide with anoxic events elsewhere in Europe and, in some locations, seafloor oxygenation improves during this interval. Thus, this anoxic event is not universally developed. In contrast, the Upper Kellwasser Horizon, developed in the Late linguiformis Zone (<b>Frasnian</b> <b>Stage)</b> in Germany correlates with a European-wide anoxic event that is manifest as an intensification of anoxia in basinal locations to the point that stable euxinic conditionswere developed (for example, in the basins of the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland). The interval also saw the spread of dysoxic waters into very shallow water (for instance, reefal) locations, and it seems reasonable to link the contemporaneous demise of many marine taxa to this phase of intense and widespread anoxia. In basinal locations, euxinic conditions persisted into the earliest Famennian with little change of depositional conditions. Only in the continental margin location of Austria was anoxia not developed {{at any time in the}} Late Devonian. Consequently it appears that the Upper Kellwasser anoxic event was an epicontinental seaway phenomenon, caused by the upward expansion of anoxia from deep basinal locales rather than an ‘oceanic’ anoxic event that has spilled laterally into epicontinental settings...|$|E
40|$|The Hujiersite Formation of West Junggar, Xinjiang contain fossil {{plants that}} {{represent}} significant examples of Middle Devonian flora in North China. However, previous radio-isotopic age constraint for this fossil-rich formation is absent. The best-studied {{section of the}} Hujiersite Flora occurs at a locality referred to as 251 Hill, which exposes numerous examples of fossil plants and information on depositional environment. In this study, we investigate the geological background of the 251 Hill section and collect two tuffaceous sandstone beds from a normal fault near the classic fossil outcrop. U-Pb ICP-MS analysis of detrital zircons from these samples gave a maximum depositional age of 385 Ma (Givetian stage) for the hanging wall and 380 Ma (early <b>Frasnian</b> <b>stage)</b> for the footwall of the upper Hujiersite Formation. This study thus reports a novel Givetian–early Frasnian age constraint for Hujiersite Flora. This geochronologic constraint {{is consistent with previous}} age interpretations derived from biostratigraphic correlations...|$|E
40|$|The Frasnian-Famennian (Late Devonian) mass {{extinction}} {{has often been}} related {{to the development of}} the Kellwasser anoxic events in Europe and North Africa but the synchronous development of the anoxia has not been reported from the Great Basin of the western United States. An integrated sedimentological, palaeoecological, and pyrite petrographic study has been undertaken on a range of F-F boundary sections from Nevada and Utah spanning a spectrum of carbonate and clastic depositional environments from distal basin, base-of-slope, mid-slope, and intrashelf basin settings. These reveal a range of facies from oxic strata, fully bioturbated and lacking any pyrite, to euxinic strata characterised by fine lamination and pyrite framboid populations of small size and narrow size range. Oxygen-restricted deposition is seen in all sections at various times, but the only interval characterised by basin-wide euxinicity occurs at the end of the <b>Frasnian</b> <b>Stage</b> late in the linguiformis Zone. This is the peak of the F-F {{mass extinction}} and it is also contemporaneous with the Upper Kellwasser Horizon of Europe. The study therefore reinforces the claim that the mass extinction coincides with the global development of marine anoxia. Shallow-water sections were not studied but slope and base-of-slope sections record many sediment-gravity flows that transported an allochthonous fauna into deeper water settings. This shallow-water fauna temporarily disappears late in the linguiformis Zone perhaps indicating the development of oxygen-restriction in shallow-water settings. Intriguingly the condensed, deepest water sections from the Woodruff basin record somewhat higher oxygenation levels than the contemporaneous slope sections. The most oxygen-restricted conditions may therefore have occurred in a mid-water oxygen-minimum zone that expanded its vertical range both upwards and downwards and became sulfidic late in the linguiformis Zone...|$|E
40|$|The Oscar Range in Western Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Canning Basin {{features}} inliers of folded Paleoproterozoic quartzite, quartzitic conglomerate, and phyllite {{that formed}} islands during the Late Devonian. Undisturbed strata of the Pillara Limestone (Upper Devonian, <b>Frasnian</b> <b>Stage)</b> surround individual paleoislands that {{rise above the}} former seabed with a maximum topographic relief of 90 m. On average, the Mowanbini Archipelago (aboriginal name for the Oscar Range) lies 15 km off the granitic and metamorphic mainland represented by the Kimberley Block to the north. Devonian facies on outer rocky shores were studied at three localities near the southeast end of the Oscar Range. At {{the west end of}} the study area, a Devonian reef margin sits unconformably on Paleoproterozoic phyllite, but to the east, the reef is separated from rocky shores by a wide lagoon. Massive clast- supported conglomerate and sandstone beds interfinger with backreef carbonates where the reef is closest to land. Across the lagoon 2. 5 km eastward, differential erosion between steeply dipping quartzite layers interbedded with softer phyllite resulted in low sea stacks, or skerries. Tabular quartzite cobbles and quartz sand were shed by the skerries as a unidirectional apron of " breccia" under shoal water conditions. Nearby offshore stromatoporoid thickets reflect growth orientation aligned with paleocurrents compatible with the breccia apron. On a smaller island 2. 5 km farther east, lateral transport of debris from a quartzite shore to a contiguous phyllite sector of the coast conforms to the same pattern of water circulation. Overall, the physical geography of outer rocky shores in relation to the lagoon and barrier reef suggests that waves crashed over the reef to energize a longshore current that moved west to east {{at one end of the}} Oscar Range. A rapid rise in sea level probably promoted the burial and preservation of the Mowanbini Archipelago, characteristics shared with other examples of quartzite paleoislands that date from Cambrian to Cretaceous times...|$|E
