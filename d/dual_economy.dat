25|$|The revised {{sequence}} concept {{applies only}} to the industrial system – that is, the manufacturing core {{of the economy in}} which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the market system in the Galbraithian <b>dual</b> <b>economy.</b> In the market system, composed of the vast majority of business organizations, price competition remains the dominant form of social control. In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so largest corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith's view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and value judgments. That this power is exercised in the shortsighted interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent with democracy and a barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} contribute to the ongoing debate on the variety of post-socialist developmental trajectories by analyzing specific country cases and factors. The origins of distinct development paths are traced to early policy decisions, formation of tax regimes, and the shifting balance between demand for, and supply of, redistribution. An important feature of the transition economies is the varying propensity of policy-makers to control the speed of market reforms. Policy discretion has been restricted by self-imposed economic transnationalization, i. e., the opening of the financial and production sectors to the penetration of foreign capital. Post-socialist economies have varied with respect to the timing of their transnationalization and to the strength of the associated monetary and financial discipline, which have far-reaching implications for their competitiveness. The examination of existing cases of delayed reforms, such as in Belarus, further uncovers the nuances of formation of divergent post-socialist trajectories. This process is riddled with an inescapable conflict between backward and advanced sectors. Domestic social forces are often unable to reach a negotiated, consensual solution to this conflict, thus opening an avenue for transnationalization. If this conflict is left unresolved, <b>dual</b> <b>economies</b> tend to emerge, and are characterized by the coexistence of a sector of subsidized enterprises with a sector of profit-making and more efficient companies. In order to trace the dynamics of <b>dual</b> <b>economies,</b> the dissertation develops two analytical models encapsulating the factors behind the inter-sectoral conflict and the policy instruments, including taxation and financial repression in the form of directed lending. A continuous use of these policy instruments has clear-cut implications for investment and economic growth over the long run. A case is made to show the conditions under which <b>dual</b> <b>economies</b> are sustained over prolonged periods, but do not necessarily become more efficient and stable. The first model predicts that – ceteris paribus – the speed at which <b>dual</b> <b>economies</b> converge to the income level of the most advanced countries is reduced by the legacies of industrial employment and ideological hostilities towards reforms. The second model, which captures some important properties of the Chinese economy, demonstrates that in <b>dual</b> <b>economies</b> financial repression can lead to economic growth, but it occurs at the expense of savers’ well-being...|$|R

40|$|Structural change {{consists}} of the long-term changes in the sectoral composition of output and employment. We introduce a structural change perspective {{to the study of}} income inequality in 27 countries of the developing world for the period 1960 – 2010. The service sector has become the main employer, but the agricultural sector is central to the income distribution because poverty is mostly rural, and the labor surplus is high. We decompose the sectoral composition of aggregate labor productivity at the country level, divide the countries into agrarian, dual (beginner, intermediate and advanced) and mature economies and use the inter-sectoral productivity gap to test the effect of structural change on income inequality. We confirm increases in agricultural productivity everywhere and find that the inter-sectoral gap is positively associated with income inequality. The effect is negligible in agrarian and advanced economies but powerful in dual beginner economies: an increase of 1 % in the inter-sectoral gap increases income inequality by 0. 5 %. The effect peters out in <b>dual</b> intermediate <b>economies</b> and disappears completely in <b>dual</b> advanced <b>economies.</b> Finally, redistribution has been the key to compensating the losers in the income changes, particularly for those entering the non-agricultural economy...|$|R

40|$|The view toward {{agricultural}} and rural {{development in the}} modern world has changed dramatically in the past several decades. Traditionally, agriculture was thought of an inferior partner in development. Since the size of the sector falls during development, it was logically considered that it could be ignored. Why is that leaders would ever want to invest in a sector that shrinking? Some academics urged policy makers to treat agriculture like a black box from which resources could be costlessly extracted (Lewis, 1954). All investment was supposed to be targeted at the industry and the cities. As a low productivity sector, it did not deserve investment. Unfortunately, countries that took this path seriously soon found out that while such a strategy may work in the initial years of development, in the longer run it slowed development and often ended up in failure (Timmer, 1998). Neglect of agriculture meant that {{a large part of the}} population was left out of the development process. If those in the low productive part of the economy were not invested in, they found it difficult to shift to the developing parts of the <b>economy.</b> <b>Dual</b> <b>economies</b> grew apart.

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{drawbacks}} of the Lewis model was the undermining {{of the role of}} agriculture in boosting the growth of the industrial sector. In addition to that, he did not acknowledge that the increase in productivity of labor should take place prior to the labor shift between the two sectors. However, these two ideas were taken into account in the Fei-Ranis <b>dual</b> <b>economy</b> model of three growth stages. They further argue that the model lacks in the proper application of concentrated analysis to the change that takes place with agricultural developmentIn Phase 1 of the Fei-Ranis model, the elasticity of the agricultural labor work-force is infinite and as a result, suffers from disguised unemployment. Also, the marginal product of labor is zero. This phase is similar to the Lewis model.In Phase 2 of the model, the agricultural sector sees a rise in productivity and this leads to increased industrial growth such that a base for the next phase is prepared. In Phase 2, agricultural surplus may exist as the increasing average product (AP), higher than the marginal product (MP) and not equal to the subsistence level of wages.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Cuba experienced economic depression resulting from the loss of income from Soviet trade. This Special Period saw the reintroduction of elements of market capitalism into the Cuban economy and prostitution re-appeared. The need for foreign capital resulted in a <b>dual</b> <b>economy.</b> The possession of US dollars became a primary route to prosperity, and prostitution was an avenue used by many women to obtain them. The development of the Cuban tourist industry resulted in the income available from prostitution being many times greater than professional salaries in the country, and university-educated women turned to dollar-earning prostitution in the tourist sector. Young women began selling sex to tourists in a style that resembled the sex tourism that had become established in South-East Asia, and Cuban prostitutes began to dress in ways which made their profession clear. The British-born writer Pico Iyer reported in 1994 that [...] "Prostitution, which was scarcely visible (if only for security reasons) five years ago, is pandemic now: the tourist hotels are filled with Cuban teen-agers reddening their lips with children's crayons". Prostitution was practiced widely and openly in tourist areas and was generally tolerated by the police, for the revenue it brought into the country. In some cases, prostitution was seen as a possible route to a better life through marriage and emigration.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{will explore}} how developing provinces within countries attract foreign direct investment. The policy implication {{to this study}} {{is important because it}} could account for the uneven distribution of growth in developing countries that so frequently leads to <b>dual</b> <b>economies.</b> To attract foreign direct investments, provincial governments compete among themselves trying to appeal to international investors. There is consensus in the economic development literature that both economic and political variables interact to advance a nation 2 ̆ 7 s economy. The ability for a country to provide a free market economy to exchange goods and ideas makes the environment more favorable for investors, hence it makes sense to focus on institutions that can attract FDI if the government is committed to developing its economy and compete in the global market. Political factors serves as an important component of strengthening a country 2 ̆ 7 s economy. Political variables such as political capacity have helped ensure the success of a growing economy. Governments must possess the ability to extract resources from its people, thereby pursuing policy goals to create a more favorable market environment for investors. Investors then feel more confident and comfortable investing in these economies. This political variable has helped countries redefine themselves in the global community as credible and safe countries for investment. However, this political variable alone is not enough to explain how to attract foreign direct investments in developing countries. Rather, governments must also possess the economic tools necessary, such as economic growth and an open economy. These economic tools combined with political capacity can effectively attract foreign direct investments. Many provinces in developing countries lack these variables, thereby jeopardizing the opportunity to attract foreign direct investments and compete in the global market. Hence, I look at both the political and economical variables as an interaction variable as a strong indicator to attract foreign direct investments. If my work is successful, I hope that these findings can serve as a policy tool for provinces of developing countries to effectively attract foreign direct investments in a competitive global market...|$|R
