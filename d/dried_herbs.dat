Surprisingly, Pakistani food also makes extensive use of olive oil. Sparingly used vegetables does not mean there is no vegetarian food on the menu. Since the cuisine is very similar to Punjabi-style of cooking, tikka, simmered dals, tawa sabzi, and chaat feature here.|$|E
25|$|Irradiation {{has been}} {{approved}} by many countries, for example in the US the FDA has approved food irradiation for over 50 years. However, {{in the past decade}} the major growth area is for fruits and vegetables that are irradiated {{to prevent the spread of}} pests. In the early 2000s in the US, irradiated meat was common at some grocery stores, but because of lack of consumer demand it is no longer common. Because consumer demand for irradiated food is low, reducing the spoilage between manufacture and consumer purchase and reducing the risk of food borne illness is currently not sufficient incentive for most manufactures to supplement their process with irradiation. Nevertheless, food irradiation does take place commercially and volumes are in general increasing at a slow rate, even in the European Union where all member countries allow the irradiation of <b>dried</b> <b>herbs</b> spices and vegetable seasonings but only a few allow other foods to be sold as irradiated.|$|E
500|$|The book is in two parts. David {{wrote the}} first four chapters, [...] "Spices and Condiments," [...] "Aromatic Herbs, Dried or Fresh," [...] "More Flavourings" [...] and [...] "Measurements and Temperatures" [...] {{specifically}} for the book, drawing on an earlier pamphlet, <b>Dried</b> <b>Herbs,</b> Aromatics and Condiments, written in 1967 for sale in her kitchen shop. In these chapters, David writes about {{the background of the}} herbs and spices and condiments that came into use in British kitchens over the previous centuries, and sketches the history of their adoption from Asia and continental Europe.

40|$|In {{this study}} Chinese herbs {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} male infertility were investigated for relevant biochemical activity. Male factor infertility predominantly arises via barriers to, or defects in, spermatogenesis. The process of spermatogenesis is under strict endocrine control; in addition oxidative stress has been implicated in male infertility with significant levels of reactive oxygen species detected in 25 % of infertile males. A total of 37 individual herbs and seven herb decoctions used in the treatment of male factor infertility were therefore tested for endocrine activity using a recombinant yeast based assay and antioxidant activity using the FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant potential) assay. Individual herbs tested did not show androgenic properties, 20 showed strong and 10 weak anti-oestrogenic activity (per g of <b>dried</b> <b>herb</b> tamoxifen equivalents ranged from 1. 18 - 1280. 66 mg and 0. 06 - 0. 98 mg, respectively). Oestrogenic responses were elicited for two herbs (85. 30 - 550 g oestradiol equivalents/g <b>dried</b> <b>herb),</b> with seven and three herbs exhibiting a strong or weak anti-androgenic response (per g of <b>dried</b> <b>herb</b> DHT equivalents ranged from 1. 54 - 66. 78 mg and 0. 17 - 0. 32 mg), respectively. Of these 37 herbs, strong (15 herbs), intermediate (7 herbs) and weak/no (15 herbs) antioxidant activity was detected (ranging from 0. 912 - 1. 26; 0. 6 - 0. 88 and 0 - 0. 468 g ascorbate equivalent/mg <b>dried</b> <b>herb,</b> respectively). The seven decoctions (previously used to treat patients) tested elicited strong (5 herbs) and weak (2 herbs) anti-oestrogenic responses (per g of <b>dried</b> <b>herb</b> tamoxifen equivalents ranged from 1. 14 - 13. 23 mg and 0. 22 - 0. 26 mg, respectively), but not oestrogenic, androgenic nor anti-androgenic, consistent with their individual composition. With regard to antioxidant activity the following responses were recorded: three strong, three intermediate and one weak (ranging from 1. 02 - 1. 2; 0. 72 - 0. 76 and 0. 44 g ascorbate equivalent/mg <b>dried</b> <b>herb,</b> respectively).

50|$|Most guides today {{point out}} that {{medicines}} should be made from the <b>dried</b> <b>herb</b> or by heat extraction as the untreated plants and extracts will contain protoanemonin, a mild toxin. The plant has been widely used in Russia and is sold in most pharmacies as a <b>dried</b> <b>herb.</b> The protoanemonin found in fresh leaves is an irritant and mildly toxic but is suggested to have antibacterial properties if used externally. The process of heating or drying turns the Ranunculaceae toxin to anemonin which is non-toxic and may have antispasmodic and analgesic properties.|$|R
500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only the clothes on their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We {{have to face the}} possibility that we may have to stay here, unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few <b>dried</b> <b>herbs.</b> [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E

2500|$|Their {{traditional}} medicine is Unani (Greek) medicine. Sir Percy Sykes described the medicine as [...] "based {{on the ancient}} Greek theory" [...] and mentioned how ailments and sicknesses were treated in Through Deserts and Oases of Central Asia. Today, {{traditional medicine}} can still be found at street stands. Similar to other traditional medicine, diagnosis is usually made through checking the pulse, symptoms, and disease history, and then the pharmacist pounds up different <b>dried</b> <b>herbs,</b> making personalized medicines according to the prescription. Modern Uyghur medical hospitals adopted modern medical science and medicine and applied evidence-based pharmaceutical technology to traditional medicines. Historically, Uyghur medical knowledge has contributed to Chinese medicine in terms of medical treatments, medicinal materials and ingredients, and symptom detection. It introduced to Chinese medicine the medical use of snakes, opium and many new kinds of plants. During the Qing era the Uyghurs used Chinese medicine.|$|E
2500|$|After the veneration of the image, {{visitors}} {{gather in}} the Concordia Plaza for the [...] "trueque" [...] (trade), to exchange and sell goods, a tradition from the pre-Hispanic period. Common items include cheese from Chiautla, fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>herbs</b> (both culinary and medicinal), ocote wood, incense, nuts, fruits from various parts of Puebla state, resins, [...] "mecapales", vanilla pods, saffron, peanuts, and crafts such as palm frond mats (petates), baskets, clay pots and wooden utensils. While September 8 {{is considered to be}} the date of the Virgin's first appearance in Cholula, the date is also related to Chiconauhquiauhitl (goddess of nine rains) who was worshiped {{at the top of this}} pyramid at the end of the pre-Hispanic period. The Spanish replaced this image with that of the Virgin of the Remedies. Very early on 8 September, residents and pilgrims come to the pyramid and sanctuary to sing [...] "Las mañanitas" [...] and carrying paper lamps. This is the most important religious event in the city, with events related to it on almost every block. This event brings in people from all parts of the city and from many parts of the region. One tradition associated with this is the exchange of small gifts among the strangers in the crowd. Traditional dress is usually worn only for this event. For women, this includes a black or dark blue skirt, with trim in magenta, or emerald green, a wrap belt tied on the hip, a blouse embroidered with flowers, a rebozo or neckerchief, with earrings and a cross of silver. Men wear loose pants and shirts of natural cotton cloth, huaraches, a wrap belt with one end hanging loose in front, and wool shoulder wrap decorated with geometric designs and a palm frond hat. Concurrent with the feast of the Virgin from the 1 to the 16th of September is the regional fair. The trueque, while still practiced in its original form, has also evolved into this regional fair, called the Feria de Cholula. It features local food and music, culminating on Mexico's Independence Day.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} effect of drought (water deficit) stress and manure on yield {{and some of}} the morphological characters of dragonhead was studied. In this study a strip plot pot experiment based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) was conducted in greenhouse with 15 treatments and 3 replication, in the Islamic Azad University Jiroft Branch in Iran during 2009. Three levels of water stress at 75 % Fc (least stress), 50 % Fc (moderate stress) and 25 % Fc (severe stress) were considered as vertical factor and five manure levels (0 – 10 – 20 – 30 – 40 t/ha) were considered as horizontal factor. Total fresh and <b>dry</b> <b>herb</b> yield, plant height, number of stem, internode length, dry leaf and dry stem weights were measured. The results showed that the effect of water deficit stress on all morphological characters, except inter node length and stem number, were significant (= % 5). The effect of manure on all morphological characters, except inter node length, were significant (= % 5, = % 1). Fresh and <b>dry</b> weights of <b>herb,</b> number of stem, plant height, dry leaf and stem weights decreased by increasing water stress.
