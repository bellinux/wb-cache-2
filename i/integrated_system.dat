5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an <b>integrated</b> <b>system.</b> The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, {{supporting}} an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the seventeenth century Bishop John Wilkins, the first {{secretary}} of the Royal Society in England, was asked by the society to devise a universal standard of measure. In 1668, in his book An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language, on the possibility of an international language, he devoted a short section to physical measurement in which he proposed an <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> of measurement based on a decimal system. While Wilkins did propose his system two years before Moulton, it was never promoted and lay undiscovered until 2007.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{strategy}} {{for dealing with the}} Marcher Lords, Llywelyn married his eldest son, Dafydd, to Isabella, the daughter of William de Braose, a powerful lord in Brecon, Builth and Abergavenny. The Marcher Lords had adopted a style of stone castle that included circular keeps and an <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> of curtain walls. Following Dafydd's marriage, Llywelyn appears to have started a second phase of building at Dolbadarn, probably in the 1240s, adding these elements to the existing castle. The prince was probably aiming not only to incorporate the latest military technology, but also to create a castle of equal prestige to those of his new allies in the south. Traditionally the surrounding district of Is Gwyrfai had been run from the town of Llanbeblig; after the 1240s, this role was transferred to Dolbadarn.|$|E
5|$|Returning from Tarawa, Radford was reassigned {{as chief}} of staff to Towers, who was Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet. He {{assisted}} in planning upcoming operations, including Operation Flintlock, the invasion of the Marshall Islands. He had hoped to return to combat duty {{at the end of this}} assignment, but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C. and appointed as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. He assumed this new duty on 1 April, a role which was primarily administrative in nature. His duties included establishing a new <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft wear and tear. After six months in this duty, Radford was returned to the Pacific theater by Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Issued {{four months}} into the king's accession, the charter {{expressly}} implemented an arrangement designed by Henry VIII and was confirmed by Edward Seymour, Lord Protector. Unusually for a cathedral city Norwich did not receive a cathedral school following the Reformation, but an endowed city grammar school. Norwich Cathedral {{was the first of}} the eight cathedral priories to surrender to the Crown, formally being re-established as a secular cathedral with a dean and chapter on 2 May 1538. Consequently, negotiations over the refoundation charter were between the city, rather than the cathedral, and the Crown. Known as the Great Hospital Charter, it granted the city possession of St Giles' hospital, also called the Great Hospital, and merged the school with it in the hope of achieving an <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> of education and poor relief. These plans were never realised, however, as the Great Hospital was partially stripped for building materials and later sacked during Kett's Rebellion in 1549. The school temporarily occupied St Luke's House, a building north-west of the cathedral.|$|E
