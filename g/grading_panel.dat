It brings together factual information, perceptions, and ideas {{for addressing the}} key issues that affect the livability and wellness of communities within Metro Vancouver. It {{tells the story of}} {{what it is like to}} live here. For this year’s report, we have made two signifi cant changes: fi rst, we have broadened the focus beyond the city of Vancouver to the Metro Vancouver region; second, we have included brief stories about community organizations that are working to address community needs in the various areas examined. We are also including two new key areas: Getting Around and Food. The purpose of Vital Signs is not simply to capture information. Vital Signs is intended to inform the work of Vancouver Foundation. As a community foundation, the largest in Canada, understanding the needs of the communities we serve is critical to our success and to ensuring donated funds are used effectively. Through Vital Signs, we are gaining a clearer sense of the needs and priorities of our region. We understand how Vancouver Foundation can have more impact as a funder, convenor, partner, and leader, using these priorities to guide our decisions. Vital Signs has also brought new partners, networks, and colleagues into our midst to help us address issues. Besides the benefi ts to Vancouver Foundation’s work, we know others have used Vital Signs to plan, learn, and stimulate dialogue. We hope our 2007 report will build on this and assist all of us in making informed choices and taking action to address issues affecting our communities.

First-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) of plate is applied to model the panel, and the von-Karman strain- displacement relations are adopted to consider the geometric nonlinearity due to large deformation. Further, the first-order piston theory is used to model the supersonic aerodynamic load acting on a panel and Rayleigh damping coefficient is used to present the structural damping. In order to find a critical value of the speed, linear flutter analysis of FG panels is performed.

The functionally <b>graded</b> <b>panel</b> structures consist of ceramic and metal which are assumed to vary continuously through the thickness according to the power-law distribution, and two types of power-law distributions are considered for the ceramic volume fraction.

The biharmonic equations governing the motion of each micro-panel are formulated through the adoption of the energy method along with the postulates of the Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. Concentrating on the asynchronous motion of the connected micro-panels, the study investigates the shift of the natural frequencies of the system as a result of variation in the: aspect ratio of the micro-panel, span-to-thickness ratio of the micro-panel; gradient index; small-scale effect; and the ratio of the Youngs modulus. Estimates of the natural frequencies, under the assumption of simply-supported edges of the micro-panels, are provided by the Naviers solution method. The qualitative assessment of the models parameters indicates that the effect of the gradient index is stifled by the presence of the size effect. Moreover, it is observed that higher values of the ratio of the constituents Youngs modulus generate a stiffer response of the micro-panel than higher values of the connectors stiffness and the constituents density ratio...|$|R
