50|$|Fire-protective {{glass is}} another {{application}} of nanotechnology. This {{is achieved by}} using a clear intumescent layer sandwiched between glass panels (an interlayer) formed of silica nanoparticles (SiO2), which turns into a rigid and opaque <b>fire</b> <b>shield</b> when heated. Most of glass in construction is on the exterior surface of buildings. So the light and heat entering the building through glass has to be prevented. The nanotechnology can provide a better solution to block light and heat coming through windows.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of MagiQuest {{is to build}} and gain power by obtaining magic runes. These runes are awarded for completing certain tasks, using the wand to activate targets marked with a stylised Q. The runes available on Rune Quests are: Lightning, Enchant Creature, Music, Protection, Freeze, Distraction, Healing, Portal, Dazzle, Reveal, Ice Arrow, and Master Magi. While the Master Magi Rune does not grant any spells like the other Runes, earning it opens up new Rune Quests specifically for Master Magi. These Runes are the <b>Fire,</b> <b>Shield,</b> and Potion Runes. The Celestial and Great Wolf Runes are also available at some Great Wolf Lodge locations.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "{{frequency}}" [...] of the {{shields and}} photons can be changed.

50|$|Ironically, one of {{the changes}} that contributed to the {{collapse}} was the installation of a safety feature. <b>Fire</b> <b>shields</b> were installed around all escalators {{to prevent the spread of}} fire from floor to floor, but to install them, the builders cut into the support columns, reducing their diameter further. The reduced diameter concentrated the burden on a smaller area of supported slab, leading to an eventual puncturing of the slab. Those factors, along with the addition of a fifth floor including restaurants and heavy restaurant equipment, all contributed to the building's eventual failure. However, the original building design would have been more than twice as strong as needed to remain erect, and the flawed structure managed to stand for almost five years.|$|R

50|$|Keeper of Fire Gem: Pirena - DeshnaThe gem grants its keeper {{the power}} to control and conjure fire, {{enabling}} the person to control warmth/heat, temperature and light. In this sense, the beholder can intensify or withhold sunlight. This fire is sometimes {{used to create a}} portal window to see what other people are doing at the time. Fire can also be used as a container of power, knowledge and even souls/consciousness so that it may be kept or transferred to others. This gem has the ability of shapeshifting/glamouring into another person. Pirena used this ability many times. Her notable transformations are: Ades, Amihan, Aquil, Danaya, Lira, Ybrahim, Agane, Muros, Mira, Asval, Andora, and even the deities, Emre and Ether. It can also create a volcanic eruption with burning lava that can reach even the farthest place in Encantadia. It can also grant immunity to fire. It can also conjure a rain of fireballs. It can conjure a <b>fire</b> <b>shield.</b> It can let someone fly like a comet. When used with other gems, {{it can be used to}} enhance defense and deter attack for a whole kingdom. It can also locate others through body heat. This gem can give the ability to command all kinds of dragons. This gem is infamous for being used for evil. This gem chooses a keeper like Pirena and Deshna, with a scheming and wise personality. This gem is used by Pirena when she and Lira went to Avila.|$|E

The results are compared with data from the Single Burning Item test and the cone calorimeter. For FRT wood, the need for verification of the weather durability of the treatment is stressed and a new European technical specification CEN/TS 15912 presented. The need to use fire stops behind multi-storey façade claddings to avoid fire spread in the cavities is underlined and the possibilities of fire safety design with sprinklers is briefly presented...|$|E

The paper will analyze mainly the newscast on the public radio and public TV, since this is considered the main product of an electronic media. Based on that {{we will try to}} answer several question if there is a link between professionalization of the journalists with the reduced reasons of protecting independence in the newsroom. Is the new law a good way for increasing the motives of political interference? Does we need a public broadcaster or private media could fulfill our needs of being informed? The paper will analyze also the electoral code and the way that this code protects or makes the public broadcaster an easy prey for the party in power...|$|E

50|$|Indeed, {{the player}} will {{encounter}} {{a multitude of}} enemies and dangers {{throughout the course of}} the game. Enemies usually take the form of Terracon machines; some enemies, although confined to a small number of levels, are organic. These appear {{in a wide variety of}} types, and attack the player in different ways. Most common of all are the Terracon walkers. These terrestrial, spider-like machines patrol the levels, and if the player strays too close to them, they emit a targeting laser in their direction, before firing a shot at the player. As the player progresses, the enemies they encounter will become increasingly difficult to deal with, as they employ a whole manner of offensive and defensive strategies, including homing missiles, arcs of electricity, aerial ability, and shielding which renders them temporarily invincible. Other non-enemy dangers include: <b>fire,</b> <b>shielding</b> on objects, and lava. Coming into contact with these hazards all cause the player to lose health.|$|R
50|$|It's {{also known}} that the player's force field works unreliably. The ship might explode when coming in contact with an enemy or a shot <b>fired</b> {{although}} the <b>shield</b> was activated.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of several full-scale experiments to study heat radiation attenuation and shielding using sprinklers to create a water curtain between a compartment fire and a target wall. This work builds on the concept that water absorbs and scatters heat radiation and applies it as a shielding mechanism, which can be used to protect personnel and property exposed to an opening during a compartment fire. The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of a water curtain created using sprinkler heads in attenuating the heat flux from flames exiting a compartment <b>fire,</b> <b>shielding</b> the target wall and preventing fire spread. The results show that the water curtain reduces heat flux to the target wall which may allow for decreasing the building distance from the property line. Heat fluxes along the target wall are compared to heat fluxes required for the piloted ignition of wood products. The effects of fire size, sprinkler system flow rate, and separation distance to the target wall are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{a simple}} {{strategy}} {{was employed to}} fabricate bioinspired hybrid composite with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), graphene oxide, and reduced graphene oxide/alumina (rGO/Al) by a facile solution casting method. The tensile strength and toughness of rGO/Al-CMC-GO can reach 586. 6 +/- 12 MPa, 12. 1 +/- 0. 44 MJm(- 3), respectively, due to the interface strengthening of alumina, which is 1. 43 and 12 times higher than steel and about 4. 3 and 6. 7 times that of nature nacre. The artificial nacre hybrid composite is conductive due {{to the introduction of}} rGO/Al on the surface. Interestingly this structure can also be coated on the surface of cotton thread to give the thread good mechanical performance and conductivity. Additionally, the artificial nacre has better <b>fire</b> <b>shielding</b> and gas barrier properties. The oxygen permeability (OP) for 1 % rGO/Al-CMC decreased from 0. 0265 to 0. 003 mL mu m m(- 2) day(- 1) kpa(- 1), the water vapor permeability (WVP) decreased from 0. 363 to 0. 205 gmmm(- 2) day(- 1) kpa(- 1) when the concentration increased from 1 % rGO/Al to 6 % rGO/Al.

50|$|On {{the night}} of June 9, 1965, the {{unfinished}} Army Special Forces Camp at Dong Xoai was mortared and attacked by the 272nd Vietcong Regiment (estimated over 2,000 uniformed Vietcong), and the Special Forces compound was captured the next morning. After being wounded by mortar <b>fire,</b> <b>Shields</b> fought with Special Forces soldiers against the enemy carrying up needed ammunition to the firing line positions.
