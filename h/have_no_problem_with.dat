25|$|Swanson invited Will Hays {{for lunch}} and {{summarized}} the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise that he would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the making of such a film. Swanson set about getting {{the rights to the}} play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. Thus {{they were able to get}} the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke as to just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham requesting that he write an original story that served as a sequel. The sequel would involve following what became of Sadie in Australia. Maugham agreed to write a new story (for $100,000) but a sequel was never made.|$|E

Maugham claimed Fox had asked about a sequel at the same time Swanson had bought the original story's rights. The sequel was to follow the further exploits of Sadie in Australia, but was never made.|$|E
500|$|By mid-2012, Obamacare {{had become}} the colloquial term used by both {{supporters}} and opponents. In contrast, the use of [...] "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act" [...] or [...] "Affordable Care Act" [...] became limited to more formal and official use. Use of the term in a positive sense was suggested by Democrat John Conyers. Obama endorsed the nickname, saying, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> people saying Obama cares. I do care." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{day before}} Folie à Deux arrived in stores (December 15), Fall Out Boy had planned on staging an impromptu concert in New York City's Washington Square Park. However, the band did not obtain {{a permit to}} do so. Taking {{inspiration}} from Bob Dylan and similar folk singers from the 1960s, the group {{wanted to do something}} free and spontaneous as a gift to fans. The band and its management argued with the NYPD about allowing the show to go on. In the end, they were told that picking up any instruments would earn them a trip to jail, so the band instead led the audience in a sing-along. Stump sang while Wentz and Trohman played air guitar and Hurley drummed on his knees. Stump later commented in an interview that [...] "Those cops back there—and I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the cops, trust me—but those cops were like the Grinch. They just took all the presents." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "Whale Whores" [...] {{addressed}} the controversies surrounding Japanese whaling, condemning {{not only the}} whalers who engaged in the practice, but shows like Whale Wars and activists like television celebrity Paul Watson who profit from fighting whaling. [...] "Butters' Bottom Bitch" [...] featured {{a scene in which}} Butters visits an ACORN office seeking benefits for prostitutes working for him, a reference to a similar 2009 scandal. The episode [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] demonstrated a double standard between rights of men and women by showing the South Park men, who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> farting, strongly objecting to vaginal flatulence from women. [...] The season finale, [...] "Pee", satirized the disaster film genre, especially the movie 2012, which was released five days before the episode aired. Cartman interprets the large number of minorities at his favorite water park {{as a sign of the}} 2012 phenomenon, the prediction that cataclysmic events will occur in the year 2012, which is said to be the end of the Mayan Long Count calendar.|$|E
500|$|Jorgensen {{calls the}} 1966 {{recording}} of [...] "How Great Thou Art" [...] "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions," [...] as Presley had [...] "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement {{in which he}} took {{every part of the}} four-part vocal, from [...] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax," [...] in the process becoming [...] "a kind of one-man quartet." [...] Guralnick finds [...] "Stand By Me" [...] from the same sessions [...] "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance," [...] but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on [...] "Where No One Stands Alone" [...] on which [...] "he was reduced to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound" [...] that Jake Hess would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with.</b> Hess himself thought that while others may have a voice as great or greater than Presley's, [...] "he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime." [...] Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: [...] "The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort." ...|$|E

500|$|A billionaire socialite who dedicates {{himself to}} {{protecting}} Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked vigilante who is hailed as its [...] "Dark Knight" [...] at night. Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{criticized by}} rivals for his {{perceived}} levels of wealth, Bajatović once remarked, [...] "I am a Socialist, but I {{do not want}} to be a social case." [...] On another occasion, he said, [...] "I have no doubt that I am one of the most strongly attacked and criticized figures in the country, who is believed to be immensely rich. Sometimes I am accused of being overbearing because I am opinionated and do not flinch from expressing my views. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> all the criticism nor the harsh accusations in some media against me. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> my big mouth either." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The present {{application}} of those criteria we feel is totally unrealistic and perhaps very very wrong. We {{need to address}} that. The {{application of}} the current criterias - we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the criterias but the application - EVI (Environmental Vulnerability Index) {{must be one of}} the two.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Former celebrity {{publicist}} Max Clifford {{has played}} down the apparent outrage aimed at Brand. In {{a recent interview}} he said [...] "I don't think this will cause any problems for Russell Brand. He's known to be controversial and, if anything, it will make him more popular amongst his fans, who will have thought this was hilarious...They won't see anything wrong in what he did. It is a big PR success for him...He will <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> his career." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{has said}} that she {{supports}} a two-state solution in theory but that it cannot work in practice, commenting: [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> a Palestine that would live in peace alongside Israel ... I respond to the evidence of what is actually happening. Israel is being demonised ... If Israel were to leave the West Bank, it would turn Islamist overnight and become an Iranian proxy on Israel's doorstep. That is why I cannot support a state of Palestine." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was not {{involved}} in the struggle for gay rights as a youth. ...I did not [...] "come out of the closet" [...] voluntarily—circumstances forced me out. While I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> being publicly identified as homosexual, it would be dishonest of me to present myself as one who was in the forefront of the struggle for gay rights. ...I fundamentally consider sexual orientation to be a private matter. As such, it has not been a factor which has greatly influenced my role as an activist.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, Batman {{refuses to}} use guns because {{his parents were}} murdered with a firearm. In this tale, Leatherwing's parents were murdered at sword-point, but he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> using a sword.|$|R
50|$|Goldacre <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{the idea}} of someone {{choosing}} to give their body a rest after overindulging, say. That is just common sense. But he sees detox treatments as the modern equivalent of religious rituals of purifcation or abstinence. Clearly, such rituals fill a human need in some way - Goldacre <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> that. What is wrong, however, is to pretend that these detox rituals are based in science. They are not. At worst, they are supposed quick-fixes that distract from the genuine lifestyle risk factors for ill health that affect us over the long term.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{her first}} name is Kate, she chooses to go by KT, saying [...] " [...] just {{makes me think of}} a buxom lass baking bread for her man working in the fields. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> that, but it's just not really how I pictured being a rock star." [...] Also, Tunstall spells {{her first name}} KT (as opposed to Katie) to {{differentiate}} herself from fellow singer Katie Melua. She also asserted that she derived [...] "KT" [...] from K-T impact, the name of a geological event that caused extinction of dinosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2002, Massow {{resigned}} as Chairman of the ICA, after the board unanimously requested him to. Board member Ekow Eshun {{was quoted in}} The Guardian as saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Ivan bringing up this debate. But Ivan has been ramping up the story all week. I think he's {{been a little bit}} of a pillock." [...] There was speculation that Massow had deliberately been as provocative as possible to engineer his own sacking. Massow claims he spoke out to redress the imbalance between the promotion of conceptual and more traditional art in the British art scene.|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2008 sermon for Friday prayers in Tehran, Khamenei {{stated that}} [...] "it is incorrect, irrational, {{pointless}} and nonsense {{to say that}} we are friends of Israeli people", because he believed that the occupation is done by the means of them. [...] "...usurpation of houses, lands, and business [...] are carried out using these people. They are the background actors of Zionist elements," [...] said Khamenei in his speech. [...] "...we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Jews and Christians...we have problem with the usurpers of Palestine land," [...] he added. Also, {{he said that he had}} raised the issue [...] "to spell an end to any debates". In 2013, Khamenei accused France of [...] "kneeling" [...] before Israel, while saying that Israel was led by people unworthy of the [...] "title human".|$|E
5000|$|However, John [...] "Grinny" [...] Grinton later {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the new Skrewdriver, and that he became a member of the National Front along with Donaldson.|$|R
50|$|An {{opponent}} of Lloyd George, McKenna {{was critical of}} the Prime Minister's political approach, telling Conservative politician Arthur Balfour that “you disagree with us, but you can understand our principles. Lloyd George doesn't understand them and we can't make him.” But unlike McKenna, Lloyd George <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> relations with Cunliffe.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 he {{indicated}} that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the substance of Dominus Iesus, the document on relativism of the Holy Office of the Catholic Church, but faulted it for its unecumenical language.|$|R
2500|$|According to Collins, [...] "What we're {{in court}} {{deciding}} {{seems to be}} a level or two down from what, before we went into the jury, we supposed the trial was about, or had been initially about, which was who leaked [...] Some jurors commented at some point: 'I wish we weren't judging Libby. You know, this sucks. We don't like being here.' But that wasn't our choice." [...] Collins described how after 10 days of deliberations, [...] "What we came up with from that was that Libby was told about Mrs. Wilson nine times...We believed he did have a bad memory, but it seemed very unlikely he would not remember about being told about Mrs. Wilson so many times....Hard to believe he would remember on Tuesday and forget on Thursday." [...] Collins told the press [...] "Well, as I said before, I felt like it was a long, you know, haul to get this jury done. And if Mr. Libby is pardoned, I would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of her altered looks and weight gain from her {{rheumatoid}} arthritis treatment, The New York Times published this statement in 2005, [...] "Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much. She later said in interviews that she didn't bother correcting the rumors because people in show business hire drunks all the time, but not people who are sick." [...] Turner has had well-publicized problems with alcohol, which she used as an escape from the pain and symptoms of acute rheumatoid arthritis. Turner has admitted that because of her illness, she was in constant unbearable agony and that as a result, the people she was closest to would suffer from it, as she was constantly drinking to relieve the pain and it made her a very difficult person. A few weeks after leaving the production of the play The Graduate in November 2002, Turner was admitted into the Marworth hospital in Waverly, Pennsylvania, for the treatment of alcoholism. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> alcohol when I'm working," [...] she explained. [...] "It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking...I was going toward excess. I mean, really! I think I was losing my control over it. So it pulled me back." ...|$|E
5000|$|Butt {{has argued}} that Muslims in Britain should have no {{allegiance}} to Britain, saying, [...] "I feel absolutely nothing for this country. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the British people...but if someone attacks them, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> that either." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Oleguer {{appeared}} at a protest in Amsterdam against the Dutch ban on squatting. His club Ajax <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> his presence, because he only {{participated in the}} peaceful sections of the protest.|$|R
5000|$|Lanczos works {{throughout}} {{with the}} original matrix [...] (and <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> it being known only implicitly), whereas raw Householder rather wants to modify the matrix during the computation (although that can be avoided).|$|R
