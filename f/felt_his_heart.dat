He then passed his next examination by the boxing commission. Holyfield later stated that his heart was misdiagnosed due to the morphine pumped into his body.|$|E
2500|$|Romans {{has been}} at the {{forefront}} of several major movements in Protestantism. Martin Luther's lectures on Romans in 1515–1516 probably coincided with the development of his criticism of Roman Catholicism which led to the 95 Theses of 1517. In 1738, while hearing Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the Romans read at St. Botolph Church on Aldersgate Street in London, John Wesley famously <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> [...] "strangely warmed", a conversion experience which is often seen as the beginning of Methodism. In 1919 Karl Barth's commentary on Romans, The Epistle to the Romans, was the publication which is widely seen as the beginning of neo-orthodoxy.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{appendix}} to Self realisation Narasimha {{wrote that}} in 1912, {{while in the}} company of disciples, Ramana's vision was suddenly impaired three times by a [...] "white bright curtain" [...] which covered a part of his vision. At the third instance his vision was shut out completely, while his [...] "head was swimming," [...] and he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> stop beating and his breathing seizing, while his skin turned blue, as if he was dead. This lasted for about ten or fifteen minutes, whereafter [...] "a shock passed suddenly through the body," [...] and his blood circulation and his respiration returned. In response to [...] "strange accounts" [...] about this event, he later said that it was a fit, which he used to have occasionally, and did not bring on himself. According to Osborne, it [...] "marked the final completion of Sri Bhagavan’s return to full outer normality".|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaders of}} the Sumter County Movement were {{trying to decide what}} to do next, and a young activist chose to lead a group to pray in front of city hall. Aelony {{attended}} the march as a non-participant observer and was arrested on a charge of insurrection against the state of Georgia. This charge carried the death penalty under Georgia’s 1871 Anti-Treason Act. Three other CORE fieldworkers, Ralph Allen, Don Harris, and John Perdew, were arrested in Americus as well. With Aelony, this group became known as the Americus Four while they spent time on death row. Their arrest originally went unnoticed in the United States, but attracted attention in Europe and Africa. As public concern grew, awareness spread within the United States and eventually put pressure on the federal government to attend to the arrests in Georgia. The Americus Four were ultimately exonerated. [...] Shortly afterward, he suffered a myocardial infarction and was hospitalized at Grady Hospital, by a local black physician who cared for the CORE workers. [...] Thus, Aelony integrated the black ward at Grady Hospital. He was examined [...] there by the famous academic cardiologist, Professor Willis Hurst, [...] who <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> attack was related to his beating in Ocala, Florida. [...] He was then advised to terminate his dangerous protest work in the deep South.|$|E
