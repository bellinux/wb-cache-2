5|$|Scott Gorman (William Hope) is {{commanding}} officer of the mission to LV-426, and the Colonial Marines do not take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> the inexperienced lieutenant. Although he performs adequately when they initially secure the empty colony, he quickly loses {{control of the situation}} when the Aliens ambush his troops. Ripley takes over, driving the command vehicle, and Gorman is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he transfers command of the colony's defense to Hicks. During the Aliens' assault on the operations room, Gorman tries to rescue Vasquez but his pistol runs out of ammunition. Realizing they are trapped, they embrace and detonate a grenade (taking a number of Aliens with them).|$|E
5|$|After the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI received over {{a thousand}} calls a day for months {{in response to the}} offer of a $1million reward for information leading to the identity of the Unabomber. Many letters claiming to be from the Unabomber were also sent to the UNABOM Task Force, and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, David Kaczynski hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly. The Kaczynski brothers had become estranged in 1990, and David had not seen Ted for ten years. David later hired Washington, D.C., attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize evidence acquired by Swanson, and make contact with the FBI, given the likely difficulty in attracting the FBI's attention. He wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, such as the Ruby Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he assumed Ted would not take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> being contacted by the FBI and would be likely to react violently.|$|E
5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E

5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E

However the Germans equalised through Weber to level the match at 2–2 at full-time.|$|E

Ironically, with Masashi Tashiro being known for his puns, {{the name of this}} Rehab Center is also a pun on Jeanne D'Arc). He appeared at a press conference on March 18, 2015, announcing the Opening of the Asagaya Loft A. There's a chance that Tashiro may want to return, but the entertainment industry may not take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
25|$|The Great American Ass was a {{critical}} failure, but despite Edson's complaint, better editing would not have disposed critics more <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> the story he chose to tell. The book catalogs the pretentious and petty tendencies of the narrator's Puritan ancestors, focusing on his father as the main villain. Edson also ascribes these traits to his New York colleague Franklin P. Adams, exposing him as a Chicago native who adopted the tastes, dress, and accent of the Harvard elite only upon arrival in New York. Adams was a popular columnist {{at the time and}} {{one of the founders of}} the Algonquin Round Table.|$|E

Foch, now French chief of staff, also urged Robertson at a meeting (7 June 1917) to conduct only limited attacks (he opposed the planned Flanders Offensive) until the Americans sent more troops, and they discussed the possibility of attacks on Austria-Hungary designed to encourage her to make peace.|$|E

25|$|Carrera {{defeated}} General Agustin Guzman {{when the}} former Mexican officer tried to ambush {{him and then}} went on to Quetzaltenango, where he imposed a harsh and hostile conservative regime for liberals. Calling all council members, he told them flatly that he was behaving <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> them for being that the first time they had challenged him, but sternly warned them {{that there would be no}} mercy if there was a second time. Finally, the general Guzmán, and the head of state of Los Altos, Marcelo Molina, were sent to the capital of Guatemala, where they were displayed as trophies of war during a triumphant parade on February 17, 1840; in the case of Guzman, shackled, still with bleeding wounds, and riding a mule.|$|E

500|$|... "No Chris Left Behind" [...] is the 16th {{episode of}} the fifth season of the {{animated}} comedy series Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 6, 2007. The episode features Chris after he is expelled from James Woods High School for dragging down their test scores, and is forced to attend an upper-class academy that does not take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> Chris's economically middle-class and socially lower-class upbringing. In an effort to fit in, he decides to join the academy's Skull and Bones society, but he quickly finds participation in its activities to be too demanding.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, the Ku Klux Klan held {{a conference}} and planned a parade from its local {{headquarters}} at 230 S. Michigan St. In preparation, Klan members were posted around town to direct traffic. Notre Dame students, {{well aware of}} the anti-Catholic nature of the Klan, did not take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> this state of affairs, and before noon all of the Klansmen traffic directors had been [...] "unmasked and unrobed." [...] Notre Dame students continued the fight, with several hundred gathering outside of the Klan headquarters, throwing rocks and smashing windows in protest. Local police as well as Notre Dame officials eventually managed to convince them to return to campus. Apparently even legendary football coach Knute Rockne became involved in the struggle to calm down the students.|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{relative}} anonymity, several players have received media coverage describing their games. Sporting Life noted that [...] "the visitors took <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> {{the curves of}} Sterling", as [...] "the Athletics were easily beaten by the Stars" [...] in Philadelphia's contest against Syracuse. In 1872, The New York Times described O'Rouke as a new player on Eckford of Brooklyn who [...] "appear to be an improvement over the recent incumbents": in his only game, the pitcher allowed 15 runs to score in a complete game against the Troy Trojans. Lewis received a mention in Sporting Life (pictured) that recapped his performance, and another in the Pittsburgh Press, with a synopsis that summarized the game as [...] "one of the greatest slugging matches ever seen since curve pitching came into vogue".|$|E

500|$|The opening episode [...] "Deep Down" [...] {{picks up}} {{three months after}} last season. Angel returns, and Holtz' {{deception}} is revealed. Relations are shaky as Angel kicks Connor {{out of the house}} in punishment for sinking him, but secretly keeps a protective eye on him from afar. Stricken by the betrayal of his adoptive father and the apparent abandonment by his real one, Connor seeks solace in Cordelia's arms. When an all-powerful demon lord The Beast rises from the ground at the place he was born, Connor feels responsible. As The Beast causes fire to rain from the sky in an apparent apocalypse, Cordelia sleeps with Connor to give him some happiness before the end. While an apocalypse does not occur, Angel (also in love with Cordelia) doesn't take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> the development, causing another rift between him and Connor. Unbeknownst to all, Cordelia is possessed to be with Connor by a cosmic entity, Jasmine, looking to give herself birth in this world through their union. As Cordelia becomes pregnant and manipulates Connor into helping her sacrifice an innocent girl for their child, his inhuman actions begin conflicting with his inner good, accelerating his already deteriorating mental health.|$|E
500|$|Nixon did {{not reply}} to Voorhis's April debate proposal. [...] In May, the congressman wrote to Long as Nixon's {{campaign}} initially made the alleged PAC endorsement an issue. [...] Voorhis suggested that Nixon be challenged to debates {{as a matter of}} urgency. [...] Long responded in June, saying that though Nixon was known as a champion debater during his Whittier College days, [...] "with your age and experience the general public might not take <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> your challenging a boy like Nixon". [...] Long advised awaiting a challenge from Nixon. [...] By August, the two campaigns had settled on a debate to be held before a veteran's group in Whittier on September 20. However, the [...] "Independent Voters of South Pasadena" [...] (IVSP), headed by future Voorhis biographer Paul Bullock, announced a September 13 town meeting on campaign issues at South Pasadena Junior High School. The IVSP's actual purpose in having the meeting was to get a vulnerable Republican assemblyman (who declined his invitation) to debate his Democratic rival, but Senate and 12th district Republican and Democratic candidates were invited. Given that the debate sponsors were liberals, some of Nixon's aides advised him to refuse, but he overrode them. Voorhis also accepted; when it was suggested to him later he should have sent a spokesman, he responded, [...] "I suppose so, but I just couldn't bring myself to refuse." [...] Both Senate candidates declined their invitations, with Senator Knowland sending Chotiner in his place, while Democratic candidate Will Rogers, Jr. sent Representative Chester E. Holifield of the neighboring 19th district.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's first {{challenge}} as captain was the Ashes series against England in 195455.

It {{was to be the}} only Australian victory in the series. Injured, Johnson was unable to play in the Second Test in Sydney. [...] With Miller also injured, Arthur Morris was asked to lead the Australian team against an English fast bowling attack including Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. [...] Tyson, who took ten wickets in the match, was instrumental in England winning the Test by 38runs. [...] Johnson and Miller returned for the Third Test in Melbourne but were unable to prevent another English victory, this time by 128runs. [...] The Test was marred by controversy; Melbourne newspaper, The Age, alleged that the pitch had been watered {{during the course of the}} match, in contravention of the laws of cricket. [...] Following an enquiry, the Victorian Cricket Association and the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a statement denying any watering of the playing area during the match; however Wisden reported that [...] "large cracks were evident on Saturday yet on Monday these had closed and for a time the surface behaved more <b>kindly</b> <b>to</b> batsmen". Certainly, Johnson felt the pitch had been changed to his disadvantage: [...] "It was like losing the toss twice over". [...] Johnson and Test debutant Len Maddocks shared a partnership of 54runs to help Australia fight back in their first innings. Tyson ended the Australian resistance, taking 7/27 in the Australian second inningsEngland won the match by 128runs. [...] England won the Fourth Test at Adelaide by five wickets and therefore retained the Ashes. [...] With the Fifth and final Test ending in a draw, England won the series 31.|$|E
