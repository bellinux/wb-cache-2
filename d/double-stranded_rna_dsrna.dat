5|$|<b>Double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>dsRNA)</b> is RNA {{with two}} {{complementary}} strands, {{similar to the}} DNA found in all cells. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses (double-stranded RNA viruses). Double-stranded RNA such as viral RNA or siRNA can trigger RNA interference in eukaryotes, as well as interferon response in vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>dsRNA).</b> When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E
5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>dsRNA)</b> molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E

25|$|Orthoreovirus {{is part of}} {{the family}} known as Reoviridae. Its genome is {{composed}} of segmented <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>dsRNA),</b> thus it is classified as a group III virus according to the Baltimore classification system of viruses. This family of viruses is taxonomically classified into 12 distinct genera. These genera are sorted out taking into account the number of dsRNA genomes. The Orthoreovirus genus has 10 segments that have been isolated from a large range of hosts including mammals, birds, and reptiles. These genera are further divided into two phenotypic groups: fusogenic and non-fusogenic. The way that they are determined to belong to a specific group is if the virus is able to cause multinucleated cells known as syncytial cells. According to this classification, mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) are known to be non-fusogenic, meaning it does not produce syncytia, while other members of this genus are fusogenic, such as avian orthoreoviruses (ARV), baboon orthoreoviruses (BRV), reptilian orhtoreoviruses (RRV).|$|E

2500|$|Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) is {{important}} for inducing interferons {{in response to the}} presence of double-stranded RNA viruses; the ligand for this receptor is <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>dsRNA).</b> [...] After binding [...] dsRNA, this receptor activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which are important for initiating synthesis of many inflammatory proteins. [...] RNA interference technology tools such as siRNA or vector-based reagents can either silence or stimulate interferon pathways. Release of IFN from cells (specifically IFN-γ in lymphoid cells) is also induced by mitogens. [...] Other cytokines, such as interleukin 1, interleukin 2, interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor and colony-stimulating factor, can also enhance interferon production.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>dsRNA)</b> {{structure}} of the hairpins in a pri-miRNA is recognized by a nuclear protein known as DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region 8 (DGCR8 or [...] "Pasha" [...] in invertebrates), named for its association with DiGeorge Syndrome. DGCR8 associates with the enzyme Drosha, a protein that cuts RNA, to form the Microprocessor complex. In this complex, DGCR8 orients the catalytic RNase III domain of Drosha to liberate hairpins from pri-miRNAs by cleaving RNA about eleven nucleotides from the hairpin base (one helical dsRNA turn into the stem). The product resulting has a two-nucleotide overhang at its 3' end; it has 3' hydroxyl and 5' phosphate groups. It is often termed as a pre-miRNA (precursor-miRNA). Sequence motifs downstream of the pre-miRNA that are important for efficient processing have been identified.|$|E
2500|$|Type I interferons (IFN), {{secreted}} {{mainly by}} dendritic cells, {{play a central}} role in antiviral host defense and a cell´s antiviral state. Viral components are recognized by different receptors: Toll-like receptors are located in the endosomal membrane and recognize <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>dsRNA),</b> MDA5 and RIG-I receptors are located in the cytoplasm and recognize long dsRNA and phosphate-containing dsRNA respectively. When the cytoplasmic receptors MDA5 and RIG-I recognize a virus the conformation [...] between the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and the CARD-containing adaptor MAVS changes. In parallel, when toll-like receptors in the endocytic compartments recognize a virus the activation of the adaptor protein TRIF is induced. Both pathways converge in the recruitment and activation of the IKKε/TBK-1 complex, inducing dimerization of transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7, which are translocated in the nucleus, where they induce IFN production with the presence of a particular transcription factor and activate transcription factor 2. IFN then binds to the IFN receptors, inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes to be expressed. This leads to antiviral protein [...] production, such as protein kinase R, which inhibits viral protein synthesis, or the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase family, which degrades viral RNA.|$|E
2500|$|Many viruses {{have evolved}} {{mechanisms}} to resist interferon activity. [...] They circumvent the IFN response by blocking downstream signaling events that occur after the cytokine binds to its receptor, by preventing further IFN production, and by inhibiting {{the functions of}} proteins that are induced by IFN. [...] Viruses that inhibit IFN signaling include Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2) and viruses of the herpesvirus family, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [...] (KSHV or HHV8). Viral proteins proven to affect IFN signaling include EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) from Epstein-Barr virus, the large T antigen of Polyomavirus, the E7 protein of Human papillomavirus (HPV), and the B18R protein of vaccinia virus. [...] Reducing IFN-α activity may prevent signaling via [...] STAT1, STAT2, [...] or IRF9 [...] (as with JEV infection) or through the JAK-STAT pathway (as with DEN-2 infection). [...] Several poxviruses encode soluble IFN receptor homologs—like the B18R protein of the vaccinia virus—that bind to and prevent IFN interacting with its cellular receptor, impeding communication between this cytokine and its target cells. [...] Some viruses can encode proteins that bind to <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>dsRNA)</b> to prevent the activity of RNA-dependent protein kinases; this is the mechanism reovirus adopts using its sigma 3 (σ3) protein, and vaccinia virus employs using the gene product of its E3L gene, p25. The ability of interferon to induce protein production from interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) can also be affected. [...] Production of protein kinase R, for example, can be disrupted in cells infected with JEV [...] Some viruses escape the anti-viral activities of interferons by gene (and thus protein) mutation. [...] The H5N1 influenza virus, also known as bird flu, has resistance to interferon and other anti-viral cytokines that is attributed to a single amino acid change in its Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1), although the precise mechanism of how this confers immunity is unclear.|$|E

The basis of this gene-specific inhibition is small, <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>dsRNAs),</b> also referred to as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), that correspond in sequence to a part of the exon sequence of a silenced gene. The selection of siRNAs for a target gene is a crucial step in siRNAmediated gene silencing.
