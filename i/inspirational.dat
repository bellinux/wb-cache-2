Some reviewers compared {{the film to}} other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in Cell Block 11. Gene Siskel said that like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an <b>inspirational</b> drama about overcoming overbearing authority.|$|E
5|$|Walker took 60 wickets in the 1875–76 {{domestic}} {{season at}} an average of 8.47 runs per wicket, the best for all bowlers of the season. Walker was also a highly skilled wicket-keeper.

5|$|Ariel's {{original}} design {{was developed by}} animator Glen Keane. Her appearance {{was based on a}} number of <b>inspirational</b> sources, including Glen Kleane's wife, actress Alyssa Milano (who was 16 at the time in addition to hosting the making of the special on Disney Channel,) and model-comedian Sherri Stoner, who provided live-action references for the animators during the development of the film. The movement of Ariel's hair underwater was based on footage of astronaut Sally Ride while she was in space. Extra reference was given by filming Stoner swimming in a pool, which also helped guide Ariel's aquatic movement.|$|E
5|$|Atchison {{remarked that}} his {{theme for the}} film, deemed an <b>inspirational</b> film, was about {{overcoming}} obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He {{also said that he}} wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizes the public school system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.|$|E
5|$|Cardus {{spent the}} Second World War years in Australia, where {{he wrote for}} The Sydney Morning Herald and gave regular radio talks.

He continued to write on cricket, and produced books on both his specialisms. Cardus's work was publicly recognised by his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1964 and the award of a knighthood in 1966, while the music and cricket worlds acknowledged him with numerous honours.

5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the <b>inspirational</b> qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|Jeff, {{eager to}} get away, {{deliberately}} stirs a fight among the group, then leaves once more to get the test answers. Dr. Duncan hands him a sealed envelope, but only in return for Jeff's Lexus. When Jeff returns, the group is in turmoil, and Britta promises {{to go out with}} him if he can restore order.

Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E
5|$|Nine cities {{submitting}} bids to {{host the}} 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics were recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, and Paris—from which London eventually prevailed; thus becoming the first city {{to host the}} Olympic Games for a third time. The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics {{was considered one of}} the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC. Paris was seen by some as the front-runner for much of the campaign, but skillful lobbying by London's supporters and an <b>inspirational</b> final presentation by Sebastian Coe led to the success of its bid.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{and critics}} have also often {{associated}} {{the production of}} recent all-female metal acts to the sound and music of Girlschool, identifying them as a band that, just like The Runaways before them, helped in paving {{the way to the}} presence of women in rock music. However, Williams remembered in 2004 how, in her experience, Girlschool were more <b>inspirational</b> for young male musicians than for female ones in starting rock bands. Moreover, important female metal bands of the 2000s, such as Crucified Barbara and Drain STH, denied even of knowing the music of Girlschool. Only the American all-female rock band The Donnas publicly acknowledged the influence of Girlschool on their music.|$|E
5|$|The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That {{day was a}} {{start to}} an annual {{tradition}} throughout Major League Baseball and an <b>inspirational</b> reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years earlier when Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. The day {{would be the first}} official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 23 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).|$|E
5|$|The song {{has been}} well-received, with many complimenting its <b>inspirational</b> lyrical content, and {{described}} it as an open window into Carey's personal life for listeners.

Though stalling at number 81, it became successful on the Billboard dance charts, hitting number 1 for a week in the United States. The song also achieve higher placements in international markets, reaching the top in Spain and peaking within the top ten in Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Vocally, {{the support}} from Stockport fans {{has often been}} cited by {{managers}} and players as <b>inspirational</b> and a huge boost to the team during play, with their influence likened to having a twelfth player on the field. Stockport supporters often receive praise from other players and managers, {{both at home and}} away, for their vocal support. Between the 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons the squad number 12 was allocated to the 'Blue & White Army', in reference to the supporters being the team's 12th man on matchdays. However, for the 2010–11 season, the number reverted to one of the players.|$|E
5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? {{was named}} Book of the Year by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 1998. In 2006, it ranked 17th on Christianity Todays list of fifty books {{that have shaped}} Evangelicals the most. In a Publishers Weekly review, Henry Carrigan notes an anecdotal style that can be {{frustrating}} but ultimately worth reading. For the Presbyterian Record, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway writes that he found the book refreshing and <b>inspirational.</b> What's So Amazing About Grace? has been endorsed {{by a number of}} public figures, including Irish musician Bono, British adventurer Debra Searle, and World Vision Australia CEO Tim Costello.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the main}} {{narrative}} are side stories involving {{various members of}} Fortuna Entertainment, which Itsuki can help as he learns from working in various sectors of the agency's business.

5|$|Arthur Percy Frank Chapman (3 September 1900 – 16 September 1961), usually {{known as}} Percy Chapman, was an English {{first-class}} cricketer who captained England between 1926 and 1931. A left-handed batsman, he played 26 Test matches for England, captaining the side in 17 of those games. Chapman was appointed captain for the final, decisive Test of the 1926 series against Australia; under his captaincy, England defeated Australia {{to win the}} Ashes {{for the first time}} since 1912. Holding amateur status, Chapman played Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire and first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Kent. Never a reliable batsman, Chapman nevertheless had a respectable batting record. He could score runs very quickly and was popular with spectators. As a fielder, contemporaries rated him extremely highly. Although opinions were divided on his tactical ability as a captain, most critics accepted he was an <b>inspirational</b> leader.|$|E
5|$|As 1997 {{turned to}} 1998, an <b>inspirational</b> {{performance}} from Giggs helped a modest United side labour for a hard-earned three points and still maintain {{their desire for}} a fifth title in six seasons. A trip to the Dell to play Southampton – where United were undone last season repeated itself, this time by a solitary Kevin Davies goal in the third minute. The Saints pulled off a valiant performance, most notably from goalkeeper Paul Jones, who denied Solskjær from scoring right at {{the death of the}} second half. Things went from bad to worse in January as Tony Cottee popped in to stun Old Trafford and score the winner for Leicester in what proved a wretched season for the striker. This was the Foxes first win in the league since November and United's first home defeat of the season and fifth altogether.|$|E
5|$|As {{a junior}} in 2000, he threw for 3,679 yards and a school single-season record 38 touchdowns passes as the Aggies {{advanced}} to the Division II semifinals, where they lost to Bloomsburg by a score of 58–48. He had a 193.85 passer rating and was the only Division II player to receive a Heisman Trophy vote that season. He was named a Third Team Little All-American by the Associated Press, a Second Team All-American by both Don Hansen's Football Gazette and Daktronics, and a First Team All-American by D2Football.com He was also named First Team All-West Region by Daktronics. He was {{a finalist for the}} Harlon Hill Trophy and a team co-captain as well. He was co-winner of the Jerry Norris Award in 2000 as the team's most valuable and <b>inspirational</b> player.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers <b>inspirational,</b> which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
5|$|Hammond married Dorothy Lister almost {{immediately}} after returning home, just before the 1929 season began. Gloucestershire's <b>inspirational</b> new captain, Bev Lyon, led another Gloucestershire challenge for the County Championship. He used Hammond's bowling less due {{to the emergence of}} Tom Goddard, but Hammond was less dominant with the bat than was expected. In first-class cricket, he scored 2,456 runs at an average of 64.63. He played in four of the five Tests against South Africa, missing the fourth due to injury; he also suffered an injury in the second Test which required him to use a runner. Adopting tactics similar to those with which he had success in Australia, he scored two centuries—an unbeaten 138 in the first Test, and a match-saving 101 not out in the final Test which gave England a 2–0 series victory. His only other innings over fifty was played in the third Test. He ended the series with 352 runs at an average of 58.66. At the time, critics considered him the best batsman in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, he was {{inspired}} to write music again {{after the birth of}} his first child, Michael, with fellow R singer and then-girlfriend Angie Stone. He also traveled back to the South, spending time in South Carolina and in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, while reconnecting himself with the African-American musical history that had originally inspired him. Shortly after his son's birth and the release of his first live album Live at the Jazz Cafe (1998) through EMI Records, he began preparation for the recording of songs for Voodoo. In several interviews after its release, he cited his son's birth as an <b>inspirational</b> source and creative muse for him. A dedication to his son Michael and daughter Imani was included in the album's liner notes, which were co-written by D'Angelo and writer/musician Saul Williams. In a press video accompanying the release of Voodoo, D'Angelo suggested that he was attempting to create a new sound for him that was in transition.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} honour the deeds and <b>inspirational</b> stories that {{unfolded}} in Changi during the war, the Changi Chapel and Museum {{was built in}} 1988 as a dedication {{to all those who}} lived and died in Singapore during the years of World War II. It also serves as an important educational institution and resource centre with documentation of significant events of the Japanese Occupation in Singapore. The Selarang Barracks Incident, Double Tenth Incident and other similar stories that were mentioned by the survivors of Changi Prison are retold on the storyboard displays for posterity. There are also showcases containing tools, materials and personal belongings of POWs and other artefacts related or used during World War II. The items displayed in the showcases were donated from organizations, POWs and their families, as well as other visitors.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} day of the Second Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led his brigade, which had spent much of the {{previous}} weeks in defensive lines, in an attack on Miteirya Ridge during which it achieved all of its objectives. In contrast to three months earlier at Ruweisat Ridge, he took care to establish his headquarters as far forward as possible prior to the commencement of the battle to minimise communication difficulties with the units of the brigade. Despite this, he still lost contact with the leading 23rd Battalion which quickly overwhelmed its opposition. In fact, the battalion had advanced so quickly that it arrived at its final objective so far ahead of schedule that it believed it had only reached its first objective and so advanced even further. The battalion's commander blamed his unit's eagerness for a rapid advance on Kippenberger's <b>inspirational</b> pre-battle speech which particularly enthused his men.|$|E
5|$|While garnering the {{anticipation}} for the album, Big Sean released the mixtape Detroit on September 5, 2012. The mixtape consisted of previously unreleased songs. The mixtape features guest appearances from fellow rappers J. Cole, Juicy J, King Chip, French Montana, Royce da 5'9", Kendrick Lamar, Tyga, Chris Brown, Wale and Wiz Khalifa, along with track narrations by Common, Young Jeezy and Snoop Dogg. Production {{was provided by}} Hit-Boy, Da Internz, Lex Luger and Key Wane. Before the album's release, Big Sean released a handful of his <b>inspirational</b> video blogs, which gets in touch on how far he has gotten to where he’s at throughout his career and what he plans on doing to further his position in music. Most of his vlogs feature cameo appearances from Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Pusha T, Common, No I.D., Rita Ora, Trey Songz, Wale, Wiz Khalifa, Lupe Fiasco, Teyana Taylor and T-Pain, among others. Starting on February 23, 2013, Sean began a European tour in promotion of the album, which continued until March 13, 2013. On September 28, 2013, Sean released a 23-minute documentary covering the development and making of the album, which began 269 days before the project's release.|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more <b>inspirational</b> than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an <b>inspirational</b> back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E
