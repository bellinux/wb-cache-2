5000|$|<b>Dovetail</b> <b>saw</b> [...] - [...] a small backsaw used to cut dovetails. Although most <b>dovetail</b> <b>saw</b> {{teeth are}} set for cross-cutting, a rip saw tooth pattern is more efficient. These saws will {{usually have a}} higher number of teeth per inch (around 15 - 20 T.P.I.) with teeth {{sharpened}} to favor ripping operations and set to leave a narrow kerf.|$|E
5000|$|Backsaws {{include the}} tenon saw, the <b>{{dovetail}}</b> <b>saw,</b> and the (United Kingdom) sash saw1. Tenon and dovetail saws {{usually have a}} pistol grip style handle which may be open or closed at the bottom.|$|E
50|$|While early mass {{production}} of guitars dramatically {{increased the number}} of guitars in circulation, each instrument was still handcrafted by a single or team of luthiers. For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years. As more advanced tooling options become available, however, less of the work in manufacturing a guitar is necessary to complete by hand. Handcrafting guitars is a time and labor-intensive method of production. Some common tools used by luthiers today are a Band saw, Drill Press, Table Saw, Stationary Sander, Jointer, C Clamps, Sanding Board, Column Sander, Power Planer, <b>Dovetail</b> <b>Saw,</b> Scraper blades, Hand Files, Router, and Sand Paper.|$|E
60|$|This slight {{misconception}} {{having been}} disposed of, they {{explained to the}} carpenters what was wanted. First, all the gold was emptied out of the sacks in which it remained as the priests had brought it, and divided into heaps, each of which weighed about forty pounds, a weight that with its box Alan considered {{would be a good}} load for a porter. Of these heaps there proved to be fifty-three, their total value, Alan reckoned, amounting to about Â£100,000 sterling. Then the carpenters were set to work to make a model box, which they did quickly enough and with great ingenuity, cutting the wood with their native <b>saws,</b> <b>dovetailing</b> it as a civilized craftsman would do, and finally securing it everywhere with ebony pegs, driven into holes which they bored with a hot iron. The result was a box that would stand any amount of rough usage and when finally pegged down, one that could only be opened with a hammer and a cold chisel.|$|R
5000|$|Gent's saw or Gentleman's saw (rare) [...] - [...] a small <b>dovetail</b> <b>saw</b> with a {{straight}} turned handle, rather than an open one typical of most saws. The name seems to have arisen from its use by the nineteenth century dilettante who would now be called a hobbyist {{but it is hard}} to find a nineteenth century reference to it. For example, in the section on tools in Every Man his own Mechanic (1881) (816pp), tenon, dovetail and sash saws are listed as a group but there is no mention of a gent's saw. It is adapted for use in making joints in very small woodwork such as that in some musical instruments, dolls' furniture or other model-making. Its distinguishing features are its small size and turned handle.|$|E
