5|$|Tom Comstock {{comes home}} {{the next day}} to find his son {{returned}}, alive but shaken. Black deduces that the paint swatch matches paint used on the vehicle that killed Burke's son; he also realizes that the boys are being kidnapped to force their fathers to confess hidden sins—Comstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was killed because he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black sees that Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{not telling}} anyone about hitting Delia, Adam fears the {{investigation}} is closing in on him. He names Jack Connor's godfather and makes him promise to protect him should anything happen to him, and then proposes to Chelsea again and asks her to move to Paris with him, like they had planned during their first marriage. At the same time, Victor's private investigation on the <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>driver</b> leads him to Adam. He agrees to not turn him in {{as long as he}} can take part in Connor's life; a role he had initially refused him. Adam agrees as he and Chelsea remarry. Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) puts the pieces together and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them staggers away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes. Adam's body is thrown from the vehicle, is not recovered and he is presumed dead, devastating Chelsea just as news that Adam killed Delia breaks. However, Adam's bloody hand is later shown to be moving, alluding that he survived. Soon after, he is shown to be lying in a bed, being held captive by an unknown captor. Later Victor informs Chelsea that his investigators have found Adam's remains, but elsewhere Adam is seen paying off Victor's investigator, confirming that Adam has faked his death.|$|E

The full text may be available through the publisher links provided above. Although a small body of research has explored drivers’ decisions to leave the scene of a road traffic collision (hit-and-run) little research has explored how understanding the processes of hit-and-run collisions could inform prevention strategies. Drawing upon findings from a literature review and in-depth interviews with 52 convicted <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>drivers,</b> a crime script approach is utilised as a heuristic device to explore the precursors, immediate aftermath and longer-term aftermath of hit-and-run events. This method allows for motivational factors to be identified. Then, utilising Clarke’s techniques of situational crime prevention as a guiding framework, possibilities for the prevention of hit-and-run are presented. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the relative crash risk of drivers at various blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels a case-control study was conducted in Long Beach, CA and Fort Lauderdale, FL. Data was collected on 4, 919 drivers involved in 2, 871 crashes of all severities. In addition, two drivers at the same location, day of week and time of day were sampled a week after a crash, which produced 10, 066 control drivers. Thus, a total of 14, 985 drivers were included in the study. Relative risk models were generated using logistic regression techniques with and without covariates such as driver age, gender, marital status, drinking frequency and ethnicity. The overall result was in agreement with previous studies in showing increasing relative risk as BAC increases, with an accelerated rise at BACs in excess of. 10 BAC. After adjustments for missing data (<b>hit-and-run</b> <b>drivers,</b> refusals, etc.) the result was an even more dramatic rise in risk, with increasing BAC that began at lower BACs (above. 03 BAC) ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: An {{epidemiological}} {{study of the}} mortality rates by injuries in São José do Rio Preto, State of São Paulo, Brazil, has been carried out. The period considered is 1996 - 1998. Objectives: To show injuries mortality rates in São José do Rio Preto-SP in 1996 - 98. Methods: The study was based on official data from the Mortality Information Service of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and in a survey {{based on data from}} medical forensic examiners (IML). Software Epinfo 6. 0 and Tabwin was utilized for data analises. Results: The results were compared to values obtained in the literature for the other cities of São Paulo and Brazil. In the case of São José do Rio Preto, was observed a {{decrease in the number of}} deaths associated with external causes in the period, but particularly in deaths due to traffic accidents with motor vehicles an increase in cases of pedestrians killed by <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>drivers,</b> that is much larger than the corresponding values for Brazil and for the State of São Paulo. The study showed increase in rates of homicides, mainly in the 15 to 39 years age group. Conclusion: This result suggests that is important to start programs to reduce the number of deaths by injuries, as well as the necessity of monitoring locally all these data...|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} a traffic {{collision}} in China {{is that in}} many cases, neither party will move their vehicle from the position that it came to rest following the collision, regardless of {{its effect on the}} flow of traffic. It is a justifiable fear of many Chinese motorists not to move their vehicle from the scene of a collision because recent traffic law changes have provided for hefty penalties {{in the event of a}} <b>hit-and-run.</b> A <b>driver</b> found guilty of hit-and-run forfeits his or her license for life, and any party to a collision who flees the scene is subject to severe sanctions.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explain the {{relationship}} of a history of driver's violations as a factor in motor vehicle versus child pedestrian injury incidents. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted utilizing police reports from 1 January 1993, to 30 June 1995, to identify drivers (cases) whose car struck a child pedestrian less than 15 years of age. Controls were randomly selected drivers identified from the license files of the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) who had no record of striking a child pedestrian in the 30 month study period. Two controls per case were selected based on postal code of residence and incident date of case. Prior driver citations, safety violations, license suspension/revocation, and negligent operator points were analyzed from 1 April 1991, to the incident date for cases and controls. RESULTS: Of 327 drivers who met the case definition, 237 (73 %) had information on file in the California DMV driver records. Analysis was based on 237 cases and 474 controls. Drivers who hit a child pedestrian were more likely to have had a prior citation, more citations, more safety violations, a suspended or revoked license, or more negligent operator points than drivers who did not hit a child pedestrian in the study period. A positive association exists between the number of citations, safety violations, or negligent operator points and the likelihood that a driver hit a child pedestrian. CONCLUSIONS: Drivers with a history of driving infractions represent a high risk source of danger to child pedestrians. Possible routes of intervention include more rigorous sanctions against these drivers, more intensive education of the involved driver regarding pedestrians, higher insurance and monetary penalties, and a need to pursue more rigorously <b>hit-and-run</b> and unlicensed <b>drivers,</b> including modification of driver code violations for such cases...|$|R

Elliot was [...] "discovered" [...] by Jack, who found him selling his photography on the street, which all happens before the series begins. He also dated Maya {{for a period}} of time. In one episode, when he reveals that he is not allowed to vote in an election, he reveals that he was once arrested and spent time in jail. In a season four episode, it is revealed that he had planned to propose to a former girlfriend but as he was buying flowers, he was subsequently the victim of a <b>hit-and-run</b> — the <b>driver</b> turned out to be Nina. Though Elliot was angry at Nina for ruining his chances (he and his girlfriend's relationship ended the night of the accident), upon meeting his ex later, Elliot discovered that his ex-girlfriend had three husbands who died in accidents involving boats. Elliot also has a brother (in the episode [...] "Slow Donnie") named Donnie (played by David Cross). When they were kids, Elliot accidentally threw a frisbee into a tree. Donnie climbed up the tree to get the frisbee, but slipped and fell out. From then on, his brain had been severely damaged, so he was almost mentally disabled. In the episode, it is Donnie's birthday. Elliot invited Maya along and while at the party, Donnie reveals to Maya (with no-one else in the room) that he is faking to have everything done for him and so he doesn't need to pay for anything (he still lives with his parents). Maya tries to tell Elliot, however Elliot doesn't believe her, she later tries to expose Donnie as a fraud, but Donnie sees through it and makes Maya look worse in the process. Later in the episode while Jack (who Donnie tries to avoid throughout the episode) tries to explain a vacuum to Donnie. He snaps at Jack thus inadvertently revealing to everyone in the Blush office including Elliot that he is not actually slow but has been faking it.|$|R
