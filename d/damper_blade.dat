40|$|Abstract A {{circular}} CAV damper {{has been}} developed, {{based on the}} investigation of the pressure loss, and the flow-resisting moment by the <b>damper</b> <b>blade.</b> When a torsional spring is attached to the damper axle, and the setting angle is adjusted to around 82 °, the volume rate across the damper is almost independent of the static pressure. Such a CAV characteristic appears at an opening angle between 40 ° and 60 °, where the normalized moment decreases linearly with the angle. In addition, by adjusting the setting angle, the volume rate can be controlled to within 10 % error, regardless of the pressure loss.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} the pressure loss characteristics of thin, single-blade flat dampers in square branch ducts in the turbulent region. The damper pressure loss characteristics and the interactions between the <b>damper</b> <b>blade</b> and shaft have been studied at various damper width ratios {{to take account of}} the damper leakage effects. At damper angles > 10 °, the damper pressure loss characteristics determined for damper -width ratios of 0. 5 to 1. 414 are found to be independent of the shaft sizes for typical rectangular and circular shafts with blockage area ratios ≤ 0. 16. The damper pressure loss coefficients are observed to have collapsed onto a single curve within a ± 10 % accuracy for damper width ratios of 0. 9 to 1. 414. By applying this relationship to square, flat airtight dampers in square branch ducts, the desired flow characteristics for branch ducts fitted with proportional damper controller-actuators can be achieved within a maximum deviation of ± 10 %. This helps solve the nonlinearity problem in the installed damper characteristics for large, complex, variable air volume systems having branch ducts with different resistances. Using a graphical approach, the required tuning parameter values for square, single-blade airtight dampers have also been determined for use by control system designers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{mathematical}} model of the Air Torque Position dampers. The mathematical model establishes a link between the velocity of air in front of the damper, position of the <b>damper</b> <b>blade</b> and the moment acting on the blade caused by the air flow. This research aims to experimentally verify the mathematical model for the damper type with non-cascading blades. Four different types of dampers with non-cascading blades were considered: single blade dampers, dampers with two cross-blades, dampers with two parallel blades and dampers with two blades of which one is a fixed blade in the horizontal position. The case of a damper with a straight pipeline positioned in front of and behind the damper was taken in consideration. Calibration and verification of the mathematical model was conducted experimentally. The experiment was conducted on the laboratory facility for testing dampers used for regulation of the air flow rate in heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The design and setup of the laboratory facility, as well as construction, adjustment and calibration of the laboratory damper are presented in this paper. The mathematical model was calibrated by using one set of data, while the verification of the mathematical model was conducted by using the second set of data. The mathematical model was successfully validated and it can be used for accurate measurement of the air velocity on dampers with non-cascading blades under different operating conditions.

The most commonly used methods for studying the dynamic behavior of a blade with a {{friction damper}} are direct integration methods.

40|$|All {{numerical}} {{models of}} friction <b>damped</b> <b>bladed</b> arrays require knowledge of contact-friction parameters, which are established either through direct frictional measurements, {{done with the}} help of a separate single contact test arrangement, or by fine tuning the parameters in the numerical model of the real damping device and comparing the experimental response of a <b>damped</b> <b>blade</b> against its computed response. Recent results from direct measurements on underplatform dampers and the subsequent cross-comparison of experimental and numerical results have put into evidence several features which are usually neglected in FE models of damper-blade systems: - markedly different friction coefficients at different contact points; - friction coefficients evolving with time and cycle number towards a stable shape, in a systematic and repeatable manner with dramatic consequences on the shape of the hysteresis cycle and on dissipated energy; - particular cases where minimal variations in the friction coefficients lead to gross changes of the damper behavior; Identifying the contact parameters to assure the best match between model and experimental results becomes crucial to guarantee that the validated damper model will produce the correct cyclic forces on the blades during vibrational motion. While the tuning process described in the previous papers was a search based on the progressive refinement whose results depended on the operator's ability to match different patterns of the model and experimental results, this paper dwells on a more objective and controllable method based on properly chosen indicators. The latter method is based on a sampling technique (Latin Hypercube) which produces a large number of solutions (in the present case 5000) on the basis of randomized extractions of contact parameters (in the present case 5) between given boundaries. An advantage of this method is a systematic exploration of the influence of each input contact parameter on the collection of output indicators, considered acceptable according to predetermined criteria. The main indicators suited for the purpose are three, i. e., the relative errors on the real and imaginary parts of the HBM complex spring equivalent to the hysteresis cycle and a measure of shape similarity between the experimental and simulated cycle. The paper shows the selection procedure which has been adopted to produce the final set of eligible solutions, which are further reduced by applying a secondary indicator based on the similarity of a kinematical parameter. In this paper this parameter is chosen to be a measure of the shape similarity of the damper rotationduring the hysteresis cycle...|$|R
40|$|All {{numerical}} {{models of}} friction-damped bladed arrays require knowledge or information of contact-friction parameters. In the literature, these parameters are typically tuned {{so that the}} experimental Frequency Response Function (FRF) of a <b>damped</b> <b>blade</b> matches its numerical counterpart. It {{is well known that}} there exist multiple combinations of contact parameters capable of satisfying a given experimental-numerical FRF match. A better approach towards a finer tuning could be based on directly measuring contact forces transmitted between blade platforms through the damper: in this case friction coefficients are estimated through tangential over normal force components during those hysteresis segments which are safely identified as being in a slip condition. This has been applied by these authors to rigid bar (solid) dampers. Unfortunately, the four contact stiffness values (left and right damper-platform contact, normal and tangential) are more than the measurements available in the technique presentedby these authors. Therefore, the problem is underdetermined. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold, i. e., to propose an alternative way to estimate contact stiffness values (i. e. thus solving the under-determinacy mentioned above) and to check the effective significance of such estimates from a practical engineering point of view.

To efficiently simulate the friction contact, a full- 3 D time-discrete contact model is reformulated and an analytical expression for the Jacobian matrix is derived {{that reduces the}} computation time drastically {{with respect to the}} classical finite difference method. The developed numerical solver is applied on bladed disks with shroud contact and the advantage of full- 3 D contact model compared to a quasi- 3 D contact model is presented. The developed numerical solver is also applied on bladed disks with strip damper and multiple friction contacts and obtained results are discussed. Furthermore, presence of higher harmonics in the nonlinear contact forces is analyzed and their effect on the excitation of the different nodal diameters of the bladed disk are systematically presented. The main parameters that influence the effectiveness of friction <b>damping</b> in <b>bladed</b> disks are engine excitation order,  contact stiffnesses,  friction coefficient, relative motion at the friction interface and the normal contact load. Due to variation in these parameters during operation, the obtained friction damping in practice may differ from the optimum value. Therefore, to control the normal load adaptively that will lead to an optimum damping in the system despite these variations, use of magnetostrictive actuator is proposed. The magnetostrictive material that develops an internal strain under the influence of an external magnetic field is employed to increase and decrease the normal contact load. A linearized model of the magnetostrictive actuator is used to characterize the magnetoelastic behavior of the actuator.   A nonlinear static contact analysis of the bladed disk reveals that a change of normal load more than 700 N can be achieved using a reasonable size of the actuator.

Due to the nonlinear nature of dry friction, in general dynamic analysis of structures constrained through frictional contacts is difficult, direct time integration with commercial finite element codes may not be a suitable choice given the large computation times. For this reason, ad hoc numerical codes have been developed in the frequency domain. Some authors prefer a separate routine in order to compute contact forces as a function of input displacements, others include the damper in the FE model of the bladed array. All numerical models, however, require knowledge or information of contact -friction parameters, which are established either through direct frictional measurements, done with the help of single contact test arrangements, or by fine tuning the parameters in the numerical model and comparing the experimental response of <b>damped</b> <b>blade</b> against its computed response. The standard approach is to fine-tune and experimentally validate the UPDs models by comparing measured and calculated vibration response of blade pairs. To our knowledge, nobody has ever attempted to directly measure the forces transmitted between the platforms through the damper and the relative damper-platform movement. In the light of recent results from direct measurements on dampers it is evident that a dedicated routine for the damper mechanics is an effective tool to capture those finer details which are essential to an appropriate description of damper behaviour. This was made possible by the successful effort of the present authors to accurately measure the forces transmitted between the platforms through the damper, to connect them with the relative platforms movement and to use the findings for the validation of the numerical model.

40|$|Friction damping {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{exploited}} systems of passive control of the vibration of mechanical systems. In order to mitigate vibration of turbine blades, friction dampers are commonly included in the bladed disk design. A common type of blade-to-blade friction dampers are the so-called underplatform dampers (UPDs); these are metal devices placed under the blade platforms and held in contact with them by the centrifugal force acting during rotation. The effectiveness of UPDs to dissipate energy by friction and reduce vibration amplitude depends mostly on the damper geometry and material and on the static loads pressing the <b>damper</b> against the <b>blade</b> platforms. The common procedure used to estimate the static loads acting on UPDs consists in decoupling the static and the dynamic balance of the damper. A preliminary static analysis of the contact is performed in order to compute the static pressure distribution over the damper/blade interfaces, assuming that it does not change when vibration occurs. In this paper a coupled approach is proposed. The static and the dynamic displacements of blade and UPD are coupled together during the forced response calculation. Both the primary structure (the bladed disk) and the secondary structure (the damper) are modeled by finite elements and linked together by contact elements, allowing for stick, slip and lift off states, placed between each pair of contact nodes, by using a refined version of the state-of-the-art friction contact model. In order to model accurately the blade/damper contact with a large number of contact nodes without increasing proportionally the size of the set of nonlinear equations to be solved, <b>damper</b> and <b>blade</b> dynamics are modeled by linear superposition of a truncated series of normal modes.

In this paper a different approach to evaluate the damper-blade interaction has been put forward. A test rig has been purposely designed to accommodate a single blade and two under-platform dampers. One side of each damper is in contact with a ground support specifically designed to measure two independent forces on the damper. In this way both the normal and the tangential force components in the damper-blade contact can be inferred.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of current aircraft turbofan engines consists of multi-stage assemblies {{resulting from the}} coupling of bladed disks by means of bolted flange joints. The efficiency of such systems in real working condition is strictly related to the dynamic properties of blades and disks constituting them. According to the current design practices, blades and disks are designed so that their weights are reduced and their slenderness increased. Therefore, latest generation turbofan engine thus result much more sensible to mechanical vibrations that may cause failure by high cycle fatigue phenomena. For these reasons robust computational techniques and innovative measurement systems have become necessary tools for the design and validation of multi-stage bladed disks assemblies, {{in order to preserve}} their structural integrity while operating in real working conditions. The topics developed in this Ph. D. thesis concern aspects of linear and non-linear dynamics in the turbomachinery field and give a series of important guidelines for the study of multi-stage bladed disks systems from both a numerical and experimental point of view. The research activity has been mainly focused on the following two topics: 1. Development of reduced order model techniques for the prediction of forced response of multi-stage bladed disk assemblies. The main challenge associated with modeling multi-stage assemblies is strictly related to the possible different cyclic symmetry characterizing the coupled stages. In such case a sector representative of the whole multi-stage system does not exist in general and typical dynamic calculations based on cyclic constraints can not be performed {{as in the case of}} single bladed disks. Therefore, two novel reduced order model techniques for multi-stage systems have been developed in order to overcome the mentioned drawback while guaranteeing high fidelity in modeling the system dynamics. Furthermore, for the first time the bolted flange joint coupling two bladed disks is considered as a possible source of damping due to friction phenomena. Understanding the effects of such non-linearities in <b>damping</b> <b>blade</b> vibrations could be crucial in design of bolted flange joint. The proposed reduction techniques then also allow the prediction of the forced response of a multi-stage system when friction contacts are present at the flange joint interface while maintaining low computational costs. 2. Validation of the Blade Tip-Timing measurement technique, for the identification of the modal properties of two laboratory dummy disks. In this frame an experimental procedure to validate the Blade Tip-Timing system against the strain gauges measurement has been proposed. Furthermore, a novel methodology for the identification of the operative deflection shape of a vibrating bladed disks in presence of small mistuning has been developed...|$|R
