5|$|Despite the {{flooding}} in Florida, the heavy rainfall proved beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. By late September, water levels in 18counties in southwestern Florida were within {{the normal range}} {{for the first time}} in 18months. On September28, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared seven Florida counties as disaster areas; this allocated <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> debris removal and repairing damaged public facilities. After the storm's passage, there were more than 32,000insurance claims for homes, and 10,000claims for damaged cars.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} overhaul the station completely. In 1999, the MTA requested $125 million in <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of satellite dishes was proposed for the station. By this point, the New York City Transit Police were operating from a tent adjacent to the station, and there were vestiges of a carousel within the station.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, United States President Bill Clinton {{declared}} nine Florida counties as disaster areas, which allocated <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> debris removal, emergency services, {{and restoration}} of damaged public facilities. In Franklin County, many residents had to boil water before consumption due to contaminated water wells. As a result, the local Red Cross chapter provided water bottles to the affected residents.

5|$|The {{project was}} {{approved}} in 2002 by the United States Congress, but <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the site ended in 2011 under the Obama Administration via {{amendment to the}} Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, passed on April 14, 2011. The project has had many difficulties and was highly contested by the non-local public, the Western Shoshone peoples, and many politicians. The Government Accountability Office stated that the closure was for political, not technical or safety reasons.|$|E
5|$|Despite rising {{traffic to}} Las Vegas, WAE reduced {{service to the}} city amid the Great Depression. Once its {{financial}} situation improved, the airline bought the airfield and established a monopoly on flights. When the city attempted to purchase the field and build a more modern terminal, WAE refused. With the advent of World War II, however, WAE was pressured to sell the airfield. Nevadan Senator Pat McCarran helped obtain <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the city to buy the field and construct a new terminal. He also helped establish a gunnery school by the United States Army Air Corps at the field. For the senator's contributions, the airport was named McCarran Field in 1941.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{his time}} as housing {{secretary}} was considered unsuccessful. However, although {{he could not get}} <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|On September4, President Bill Clinton {{approved}} disaster declarations for six {{counties in}} Florida.

Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
5|$|Romney {{restructured}} the organization's {{leadership and}} policies. He reduced budgets and boosted fundraising, alleviating {{the concerns of}} corporate sponsors while recruiting new ones. Romney worked {{to ensure the safety}} of the Games following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by coordinating a $300million security budget. He oversaw a $1.32billion total budget, 700employees, and 26,000volunteers. The federal government provided approximately $400million to $600million of that budget, much of it a result of Romney's having aggressively lobbied Congress and federal agencies. It was a record level of <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the staging of a U.S. Olympics. An additional $1.1billion of indirect federal funding came to the state in the form of highway and transit projects.|$|E
5|$|By October22, over 72,000people were {{housed in}} 560shelters nationwide. Additional {{evacuations}} occurred after further floods impacted Tabasco {{weeks after the}} initial deluge, and by October25, 94,203people were staying in 896shelters. The Mexican Department of Health declared a sanitary alert in six states, and 354medical teams operated in 894communities to assist 50,000homes. The Secretaría de Gobernación declared Tabasco, Veracruz, Hidalgo and Puebla as disaster areas, which allocated <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> relief. The National Fund for Natural Disasters allocated $234million (2.34billion pesos) in emergency relief, including $41.5million (400million pesos) in Oaxaca where the earthquake previously struck; this was smaller than the flood's damage total. The repair cost in Puebla alone was estimated at $200million (1.83billion pesos), which was largely completed within two years and dealt with repairing roads and protecting cities from landslide and flood mitigation.|$|E

50|$|During his {{successful}} 1974 reelection campaign, Briscoe fought both aggressively and bitterly {{back against the}} Raza Unida Party to try to destroy the organization and prevent the movement from spreading beyond South Texas. He had countered RUP with legislative attempts to tighten requirements for political party recognition. Moreover, he denounced the party as a communist threat and blocked <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> Zavala County programs. The fallout from the fight over <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> RUP's Zavala County stronghold would affect the 1978 primary fight.|$|R
5|$|Efforts were {{underway}} in 1997 to secure <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> {{the highway and}} other infrastructure near the Mexican border, largely supported by Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Bob Filner, and Representative Bud Schuster, {{the chairman of the}} House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, visited the region before giving informal approval to the proposal. In 1999, Governor Gray Davis approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E
5|$|Following heavy {{damage to}} the coral reef around Curaçao, workers placed reef balls to assist in {{replenishing}} the damaged structure. In Puerto Rico, workers quickly responded to power and water outages. Similarly on Saint Croix, power systems were quickly restored. On November23, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area. This allocated <b>federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> loans to public and private entities and provided 75percent {{of the cost of}} debris removal. By December10, nearly 3,000residents had applied for assistance, mostly on St. Croix. In response, the federal government provided about $480,000 to the affected people. The United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $185,000, mostly directed toward the United Nations Development Programme, for aid to other islands in the eastern Caribbean. Other agencies, including the Caribbean Development Bank, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, and the European Union, provided $1.1million in assistance.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, the {{government}} made a Statement of Reconciliation– including an apology {{to those people}} who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schools– and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF). The Foundation was provided with $350million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical and sexual abuse. In its 2005 budget, the Canadian government committed an additional $40million to support the work of the AHF. <b>Federal</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget. The AHF closed in 2014.
