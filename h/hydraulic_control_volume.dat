40|$|A {{high-speed}} jet flowing {{inside of}} a partially-open hydraulic valve {{is accompanied by a}} reaction force, also referred to as flow force. The nature of this force has remained a mystery despite an extensive research effort spanning many decades. The momentum theory on the flow force by Lee and Blackburn (1952) explains the origin of the flow force and offers a design solution to shape the valve spool as a turbine bucket. It provides a model to calculate the compensated flow force as well. This paper shows that the model applies to a different flow case due to incorrect assumptions made. A corrected equation is presented based on a detailed analysis of the static-pressure distribution in the valve cavity as well as on a literature review of pressure loss in diffusers and nozzles. The new equation is based on the compensation taking place upstream of the valve orifice, not downstream as assumed by the momentum theory. The new model can be applied to chamfers or notches on the valve spool without the need to machine a complete turbine-bucket profile.

The numerical control servo press performance and <b>control</b> principle of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system are analyzed. According to the flow equation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valve, <b>hydraulic</b> cylinder flow continuity equation and the force balance equation of the hydraulic cylinder with load press, the mathematical model of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system is established.

The simulation result shows that the hydraulic systemâ€™s transition time controlled by the immune particle swarm algorithm is shorter than traditional ones, and the control performance is obviously improved.

40|$|Control of Solids Retention Time (SRT) in the {{activated}} sludge process {{is critical for}} ensuring effective wastewater treatment. SRT sets {{the growth rate of}} microorganisms in the {{activated sludge}} process, thereby selecting the microbial composition of the mixed liquor and its settling and treatment properties. The industry has developed various methods to control activated sludge. This study evaluated seven (7) methods to calculate SRT and implemented a simple, straightforward <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT method. The study was conducted at the 34 mgd Seneca WWTP in Eagan, MN, which operates a plug-flow nitrifying activated sludge process with reduced air-flows in initial zones to enhance phosphorus removal. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT is based on a solids mass balance over the aeration tanks and clarifiers. Specifically, it depends on the influent wastewater forward flow rate into the aeration tanks, the clarifier underflow rate, the waste sludge flow rate and aeration tank volume in service. It eliminates the need for costly TSS sampling at various points in the process, along with its associated measurement variation and time lags. During this study, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> produced an SRT that agreed with conventional estimation methods, i. e. mass under aeration divided by mass flow rate wasted, when the conventional methods were corrected for solids inventory in the clarifiers. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT provides a simple, real-time calculation to adjust wasting flow rates of return sludge to maintain a target SRT and a stable microbial population. At the Seneca WWTP, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT, combined with gently air-mixed inlet aeration zones, simplified process control, reduced O&M costs, and produced an excellent effluent quality that averaged 4. 6 mg/l TSS, 3. 6 mg/l BOD, 0. 58 mg / l total phosphorus and 0. 14 mg/l ammonia...|$|R

40|$|Finite volume methods, {{also called}} {{conservative}} methods or <b>control</b> <b>volume</b> methods, require {{the evaluation of}} the fluxes (mass, momentum, energy etc.) at the interfaces of the <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> and the mass quantity inside the <b>control</b> <b>volume</b> for the calculation of the transient and source terms. In petroleum reservoir simulation this means the need of calculating mobilities at the <b>control</b> <b>volume</b> interfaces and porosity {{at the center of the}} <b>control</b> <b>volume.</b> Considering the geometrical entity defined by the nodes of the computational grid as an element, <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> in a finite volume method can be classified as a vertex-center construction when they are built around the nodes of the grid, and cell-center when the <b>control</b> <b>volume</b> is coincident with the element. The widely used method in petroleum reservoir simulation stores the physical parameters, like porosity and absolute permeability, at the center of the <b>control</b> <b>volumes.</b> This means that for a heterogeneous media the interface of the <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> lies between two media with different properties, and some kind of interpolation in the physical parameters at the interface will be required. In this work, using a finite volume framework, a novel method is advanced, where all calculations are performed for the element (element-based finite volume method) and properties are stored at the center of the elements, instead of the <b>control</b> <b>volumes.</b> Since in this construction the <b>control</b> <b>volume</b> interfaces lie inside the elements, there is no need of any interpolation. It is shown, by solving two-phase flows in heterogeneous media, that storing the properties at the center of the elements instead at the center of the <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> gives better results and renders to the methodology flexibility for new and more robust interpolation functions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> {{systems of}} {{butterfly}} valves are presently valve-controlled and pump-controlled. Valve-controlled hydraulic systems have serious power loss and generate much heat during throttling. Pump-controlled hydraulic systems have no overflow or throttling losses but {{are limited in}} the speed adjustment of the variable-displacement pump, generate much noise, pollute the environment, and have motor power that does not match load requirements, resulting in low efficiency under light loads and wearing of the variable-displacement pump. To overcome these shortcomings, this article designs a closed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system in which an AC servo motor drives a quantitative pump that controls a spiral swinging hydraulic cylinder, and analyzes and calculates the structure and parameters of a spiral swinging hydraulic cylinder. The hydraulic system adjusts the servo motorâ€™s speed {{according to the requirements}} of the control system, and the motor power matches the power provided to components, thus eliminating the throttling loss of hydraulic circuits.

Several approaches based on autoregressive (AR) bispectrum, trispectrum and its slices are investigated as data mining techniques in the fault diagnosis of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valves. The characteristics of vibration signals obtained from the control valves have been extracted by means of analyzing the 2 -dimensional and diagonal slices of bispectrum and trispectrum, with the main goal of detecting a possible working condition including the normal and fault conditions.

Comparisons have been done between trispectrum and bispectrum.
