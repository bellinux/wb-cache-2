40|$|Abstract At least 30 000 {{hectares}} of land {{has been converted}} from plantation forest to pasture in the central North Island of New Zealand between 2000 and 2010. When forests are cleared for pasture the soil may undergo changes in soil structure affecting physical properties. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to investigate changes in soil physical properties in Pumice Soils following land use change from forest to pasture. Two study areas were identified; one near Tokoroa (Maxwell Farms), and one near Taupo (Wairakei Estate). At each study area a series of sites including: plantation pine forest, pasture converted from pine forest 2, 3, 4 and 5 years ago, and long term (> 50 years) dairy, and sheep and beef pasture, were identified, all on Taupo Pumice Soil. Field and laboratory methods included measurement of; penetration resistance, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing,</b> soil dry bulk density, soil hydrophobicity, unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture retention, aggregate stability, particle size distribution, and soil pH. There was increased soil compaction in the A horizon on recently converted sites compared to pine forest sites as evidenced by higher soil dry bulk density, increased penetration resistance, and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing.</b> At the Tokoroa study area the pine forest soil A horizon had a significantly lower dry bulk density (mean 0. 58 g/cm 3) (P < 0. 05) than any of the pasture sites (mean 0. 65 - 0. 72 g/cm 3). At the Taupo study area only long term dairy (mean 0. 78 g/cm 3) and the youngest pasture site (3 years since conversion from pine forest) (mean 0. 74 g/cm 3) had higher (P < 0. 05) bulk density than the plantation pine forest soil. At the Tokoroa study area, the penetration resistance and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> in the A horizon of the pine forest site was lower (P< 0. 01) than any other site. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> and penetration resistance at the Taupo study area in the A horizon of the pine forest site was lower (P< 0. 05) compared to 3 years old conversion and long term dairy pasture but was not significantly different from pastures converted 4 and 5 years ago. The water repellency of recently converted pastures was higher (P < 0. 05) than pine forest at both study areas. Two of the three long-term pasture sites investigated had very low water repellency. The long term pasture sites had markedly higher total available water holding capacity than either the recently converted pastures or the pine forest sites. The pine forest soil water content at 10 kPa (field capacity) and 100 kPa (readily available water) was generally lower than pasture sites. At the Tokoroa study area there was no significant difference in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity between the pine forest soil and any other site. At Taupo the pine forest soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was higher (P < 0. 05) than the most recent conversion site (3 years old) but not significantly different from other sites. At the Taupo study area none of the land uses had significantly different saturated infiltration rate compared to the pine forest. At the Tokoroa study area the pine forest saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher (P < 0. 05) than the 5 years old conversion or the long term sheep and beef farm. The A horizon, at both study areas, was observed to be deepest under long term dairy farm followed by forest and shallowest on sites recently converted from pine plantation. There was no clear pattern of changes in soil colour, pedality or boundary distinctiveness and shape, between different sites. Aggregate stability of the Ap horizon was noticeably lower in recently converted pastures than in the pine forest or long term pasture sites. Soil pH values were generally in 4. 5 to 5. 9 ranges across all land uses in all horizons. The exception was the most recent conversions to pasture (2 and 3 years ago converted) at the Tokoroa study area which exceeded pH 6, presumably due to high rates (3. 5 T/ha) of lime application during the conversion process...|$|E

In {{spite of the fact}} that this may be a common scenario, little work has been done to study these systems because they are virtually invisible to traditional planet hunting techniques. We present the results of simulations of planetary systems investigating this scenario. Each simulation begins after the nebular gas has disappeared and oligarchic protoplanets have begun to grow from a disk of planetesimals with a mass concentration at a hypothetical "ice line " at 5 - 6 AU. We investigate systems with different (i) mass fractions in oligarchs, (ii) spacing of oligarchs in the ice line (<b>degree</b> <b>of</b> over <b>packing),</b> (iii) number <b>of</b> oligarchs in the ice line, (iv) size of the ice line, (v) and total mass in the ice line. Simulations show high levels of chaos at early times, but eventually settle into stable configurations. We find that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> over <b>packing</b> and the total mass in the ice line play the largest roles in the final configuration, while the other variables have less significant but measurable effects. Further, we investigate the feasibility of detecting such bodies by microlensing, through new telescopes like the Space Interferometry Mission, and through direct detection of oligarch-oligarch collisions. We find that oligarchs that reach stable orbits at 2 - 6 AU are the most likely to be detected by microlensing and SIM, and that oligarch-oligarch collisions are rare, but detectible provided the oligarch is thrown out to at least 20 AU for nearby stars.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of 328 patients during 5 years at a single institution. The initial angiographic and follow-up angiographic occlusion rates were recorded as were any procedural complications. The proportion of HydroCoil used was described as the relative amount of HydroCoil length to the total coil length used during an aneurysm treatment, thus forming 4 groups: 0...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{processes}} to fractionate the main compounds in biomass, such as wood, are {{a prerequisite for}} an effective biorefinery. Water is environmentally friendly and widely used in industry, {{which makes it a}} potential solvent also for forest biomass. At elevated temperatures over 100 °C, water can readily hydrolyse and dissolve hemicelluloses from biomass. In this work, birch sawdust was extracted using pressurized hot water (PHWE) flow-through systems. The hypothesis of the work was {{that it is possible to}} obtain polymeric, water-soluble hemicelluloses from birch sawdust using flow-through PHW extractions at both laboratory and large scale. Different extraction temperatures in the range 140 – 200 °C were evaluated to see the effect of temperature to the xylan yield. The yields and extracted hemicelluloses were analysed to obtain sugar ratios, the amount of acetyl groups, furfurals and the xylan yields. Higher extraction temperatures increased the xylan yield, but decreased the molar mass of the dissolved xylan. As the extraction temperature increased, more acetic acid was released from the hemicelluloses, thus further decreasing the pH of the extract. There were only trace amounts of furfurals present after the extractions, indicating that the treatment was mild enough not to degrade the sugars further. The sawdust extraction density was increased by packing more sawdust in the laboratory scale extraction vessel. The aim was to obtain extracts with higher concentration than in typical extraction densities. The extraction times and water flow rates were kept constant during these extractions. The higher sawdust packing degree decreased the water use in the extractions and the extracts had higher hemicellulose concentrations than extractions with lower sawdust <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing.</b> The molar masses of the hemicelluloses were similar in higher packing degrees and in the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> that were used in typical PHWE flow-through extractions. The structure of extracted sawdust was investigated using small angle-(SAXS) and wide angle (WAXS) x-ray scattering. The cell wall topography of birch sawdust and extracted sawdust was compared using x-ray tomography. The results showed that the structure of the cell walls of extracted birch sawdust was preserved but the cell walls were thinner after the extractions. Larger pores were opened inside the fibres and cellulose microfibrils were more tightly packed after the extraction. Acetate buffers were used to control the pH of the extracts during the extractions. The pH control prevented excessive xylan hydrolysis and increased the molar masses of the extracted xylans. The yields of buffered extractions were lower than for plain water extractions at 160 – 170 °C, but at 180 °C yields were similar to those from plain water and pH buffers. The pH can thus be controlled during extraction with acetate buffer to obtain xylan with higher molar mass than those obtainable using plain water. Birch sawdust was extracted both in the laboratory and pilot scale. The performance of the PHWE flow-through system was evaluated in the laboratory and the pilot scale using vessels with the same shape but different volumes, with the same relative water flow through the sawdust bed, and in the same extraction temperature. Pre-steaming improved the extraction efficiency and the water flow through the sawdust bed. The extracted birch sawdust and the extracted xylan were similar in both laboratory and pilot scale. The PHWE system was successfully scaled up by a factor of 6000 from the laboratory to pilot scale and extractions performed equally well in both scales. The results show that a flow-through system can be further scaled up and used to extract water-soluble xylans from birch sawdust. Extracted xylans can be concentrated, purified, and then used in e. g. films and barriers, or as building blocks for novel material applications...|$|R
