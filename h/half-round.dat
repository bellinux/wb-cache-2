5|$|These later castles did {{not always}} have a keep, but {{this may have been}} because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation {{to make up for the}} loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two <b>half-round</b> towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more portcullis.|$|E

Such design ideas influenced castle building in nearby Crusader states, such as the Principality of Antioch, where fortifications ranged from tiny hilltop outposts to major garrison fortresses. Antioch attracted few European settlers, and thus they relied heavily on military elites of Greek, Syrian, and Armenian origin, who probably influenced the design of local fortifications.|$|E

The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive.

40|$|Various {{attacks against}} RC 5 have been {{analyzed}} intensively. A known plaintext attack {{has not been}} reported that it works on so higher round as a chosen plaintext attack, but it can work more efficiently and practically. In this paper, we investigate a known plaintext attack against RC 5 by improving a correlation attack. As for a known plaintext attack against RC 5, the best known result is a linear cryptanalysis. They have reported that RC 5 - 32 with 10 rounds can be broken by 2 ^ plaintexts under the heuristic assumption: RC 5 - 32 with r rounds can be broken with a success probability of 90 % by using 2 ^ plaintexts. However, their assumption seems to be highly optimistic. Our known plaintext correlation attack can break RC 5 - 32 with 10 rounds (20 <b>half-rounds)</b> in a more strict sense with a success probability of 90 % by using 2 ^ plaintexts. Furthermore, our attack can break RC 5 - 32 with 21 <b>half-rounds</b> in a success probability of 30 % by using 2 ^ plaintexts...|$|R

25|$|Other notable {{aspects of}} the {{missions}} were the long arcades (corridors) which flanked all interior and many exterior walls. The arches were Roman (<b>half-round),</b> while the pillars were usually square and made of baked brick, rather than adobe. The overhang created by the arcade had a dual function: it provided a comfortable, shady place to sit after a hard-day's work, and (more importantly) it kept rainfall away from the adobe walls. The mainstay of any mission complex was its capilla (chapel). The design of chapels overall followed that of Christian churches in Europe, but tended to be comparatively long and narrow due {{to the size of}} lumber available along the California coast. Each church had a main section (the nave), a baptistry near the front entrance, a sanctuary (where the altar was located), and a sacristy {{at the back of the}} church where materials used to celebrate Mass were stored and where the priests vested. In most churches, a stairway near the main entrance led up to a choir loft.|$|E

Paired scrolled wood brackets support a wide overhanging eave. The house is covered by a low-sloped hipped roof.|$|R
50|$|Early Saxon abaci are {{frequently}} simply , but sometimes grooved {{as in the}} crypt at Repton (fig. 1) and in the arcade of the refectory at Westminster Abbey. The abacus in Norman work is square where the columns are small; but on larger piers it is sometimes octagonal, as at Waltham Abbey. The square of the abacus is often sculptured with ornaments, as at the White Tower and at Alton, Hampshire (fig. 2). In Early English work, the abacus is generally circular, and in larger work, a group of circles (fig. 4), with some examples of octagonal and square shapes. The mouldings are generally <b>half-rounds,</b> which overhang deep hollows in the capital. In France, the abacus in early work is generally square, as at Chateau de Blois (fig. 3).|$|R

Lodge member Mark Ellis drew plans to replace and expand the seating using steel posts. The Lodge organized a number of work parties to excavate an expanded area for the campfire. They built and installed about 275 steel support posts to terrace the fire bowl and permanently support new seating. They also rebuilt the fence behind the campfire rings and the campfire rings themselves. The expanded amphitheater was rededicated in a ceremony attended by then-Chief Scout Executive Bob Mazzuca on July 16, 2011 and dedicated in his name. Mazzuca attended the camp as a youth.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a known plaintext attack on RC 5 based on correlations.
