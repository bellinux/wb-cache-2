[...] Saddle blankets or pads can provide assistance to correct minor fit problems, but no amount of padding can compensate for a poor-fitting saddle. The common problems associated with saddle fitting problems are: bridging, ill-fitting <b>headplates</b> and incorrect stuffing of the panels.|$|R
40|$|Genetic model-fitting {{was used}} to {{determine}} the heritability of anteroposterior and vertical facial proportions in twins. Lateral <b>headplates</b> of 33 monozygotic and 46 dizygotic twins, none of whom had undergone orthodontic treatment, were used. Five proportions, based on four vertical and five horizontal measurements, were assessed: lower facial height, anterior- to posterior-facial height, total facial height to face depth, sella-A-point to sella-B-point, and sella-upper incisal edge to sella-lower incisal edge. Reproducibility was high for all variables. Model-fitting indicated that all the facial proportions were controlled by additive genes and the specific environment. The genetic component was 71 % for upper-to lower-facial height, 66 % for anterior- to posterior-facial height, 62 % for total facial height, and 66 % for sella-A-point to sella-B-point and sella-upper incisal edge to sella-lower incisal edge. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} {{images of}} the head were taken in five monozygotic and seven dizygotic twins in order to calculate bilaterally masseter muscle cross-sectional areas and total volume. Comparing correlation coefficients between cotwins, genetic influences could be expected for maximal cross-sectional area but not for volume measurements. Model fitting revealed that additive genetic factors explained 93. 9 % of the variance for the left and 82. 4 % for the right maximal masseter muscle cross-sections. It is anticipated that {{while the number of}} masseter muscle fibers is under strong genetic control, the length of individual fibers can be influenced by specific environmental factors. In {{the second part of the}} investigation, cephalometric measurements from lateral <b>headplates</b> were compared with these masseter muscle values in 10 twin pairs. Only three of the 15 angular and five (three vertical, one transversal, and one sagittal measurement) of the 20 linear measurements were significantly correlated with masseter muscle values. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Rapp-Hodgkin {{syndrome}} (RHS) {{is a rare}} form of {{ectodermal dysplasia}} with variable involvement of the hair, eyes, sweat glands, nails, and teeth. Oral findings may include hypodontia, hypoplastic enamel, cleft lip/palate, and a pronounced midfacial hypoplasia. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if the pronounced midfacial hypoplasia is the result of a true tissue hypoplasia or displacement of midfacial tissues. We have identified a family in which three members, a mother and two daughters, display clinical features characteristic of RHS. Clinical and intraoral examination of these affected persons showed manifestations characteristic of RHS, and several new findings were observed, including subcutaneous abscesses, palmoplantar keratosis, and keratotic lesions located on the chest and trunk. To assess the midfacial hypoplasia, lateral cephalometric analysis was performed on lateral <b>headplates.</b> Results of the cephalometric analysis suggest that the midfacial hypoplasia results from both a deficiency and a displacement of the maxilla. These findings are significant because successful dental treatment of RHS relies upon accurate assessment of current and projected orofacial development, particularly for the skeletal relations of the maxilla and mandible...|$|R
40|$|An active maxillary {{magnetic}} {{expansion device}} (MED) {{was developed to}} be used clinically. The aim was to show the effects of light and continuous forces producing less traumatic stimulation of maxillary sutural growth than a conventional rapid maxillary expansion device. In this study, {{two different types of}} appliances were used on six patients between 7 years 4 months and 16 years 2 months: the first type was bonded, the other one used bands. For better appreciation, four implants were placed on each patient: two apically between central and lateral incisors, and two between second premolars and molars. A standardized radio-graphic technique was used to take occlusal radiographs, and postero-anterior and lateral <b>headplates.</b> The results varied according to the age and the appliance used. The skeletal effect with the banded MED was between 16 and 77 per cent, and for the bonded MED 0 and 25 per cent in comparison to the overall expansion. It seems that 250 - 500 g of continuous magnetic forces can produce dental and skeletal movements in a light force expansion concept, but further studies with larger samples are needed to make firm conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} prevalence, relative magnitude, and selected components of velar stretch in normal-speaking 8 and 10 -year-old children. For twenty 8 -year-old and twenty 10 -year-old children, lateral cephalometric films were obtained under three conditions: (1) subject at rest, (2) subject sustaining the vowel /u/, and (3) subject sustaining the voiceless fricative /s/. The cephalometric films were traced on acetate paper and specific radiographic measurements {{were made to}} describe important facets of velar stretch in children. Data were obtained on the resting length of the soft palate, the antero-posterior depth of the pharynx, and the prevalence of velopharyngeal closure and/or the degree of velopharyngeal opening observed during selected speech utterances in normal-speaking 8 and 10 -year-old children. Such information {{is expected to be}} useful to dentists, speech pathologists, and physicians who use lateral <b>headplates</b> to assess velopharyngeal adequacy. Velar stretch per se was not observed in all 40 normal-speaking children. During the production of /u/, 36 children (90 %) exhibited velar stretch; for /s/, 32 children (80 %) manifested stretch. Paired- comparison t-test results showed that the length of the soft palate measured during speech was significantly greater than its resting length in both 8 and 10 -year-old children. Moreover, significantly more total velar stretch was found during the production of the vowel /u/ than during the production of the consonant /s/ in both 8 and 10 -year-old children. Although there was {{a significant increase in the}} length of the entire soft palate during the functional activities of speech, no significant increase in the anterior portion of the soft palate was associated with speech. Analysis of variance techniques showed that 10 -year-old children exhibited significantly greater velar stretch during both /u/ and /s/ utterances than did 8 -year-old children. In addition, 10 -year-old children exhibited significantly greater velar height and greater velar length characteristics during both /u/ and /s/ utterances than did 8 -year-old. children. Correlation procedures were used to examine the relationships between velar stretch and other commonly employed cephalometric measures. These analyses indicated that although velar stretch was significantly correlated with a number of commonly employed cephalometric measures, the amount of velar stretch was not well predicted by any single cephalometric measure used in this research...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This study {{investigated}} familial cases of cleft lip {{with or without}} cleft palate {{to determine whether the}} unaffected members of each family can be identified as gene carriers for the cleft trait. This research presumes that such carriers will have henotypic features identifiable by cephalometric analysis that are associated with an increased risk to cleft offspring. Using population genetics methodology, a pedigree analysis was made for each family member was assigned to one of four groups: (1) obligate normal, (2) affected, (3) carrier, and (4) unknown. LA and PA cephalographs were taken on each subject and a clinical oral-facial examination carried out on participating family members. Various anatomic landmarks located on the LA and PA films were digitized and from them, a total of 28 linear measurements were made. To eliminate the effect of sex and differential age responses, Z scores were calculated. Through univariate analysis, only one variable, NCR-MO, was shown to be significantly different between the two groups. This variable difference by itself is not adequate to differentiate those in the normal group from the carrier group. Even though only one variable was significant, other differences in the variables between these groups become obvious when the group variables were plotted as Z scores. Since Z scores are pure values with no limits (2 [...] the number of standard deviations in a given variable differs from normal). Thereby, age-related growth differences were minimized. Further information is gained when these Z scores are plotted as pattern profiles, Figures 5 - 7. These profiles of mean Z scores for each variable pointed out areas of the face in which the differences were so great that specific anatomic areas appeared to be associated with one of the four groups. For example, gene carriers demonstrated specific alterations in facial height that might conceivably be used to discriminate that group from the other three groups. The family normals and carriers were then analyzed by using a stepwise multivariate analysis. By this approach, a discriminant function was generated consisting of six variables (three each from the lateral and frontal <b>headplates),</b> which proved to be significant in distinguishing an individual's phenotype. These variables define facial height, width and depth. The specific findings included a decrease in mid-facial height and depth along with an increased lower facial height and width in the gene carrier population as compared to the normals. The function then was used to predict group membership of the same two groups. Comparing this analytical prediction to that of the grouping system that resulted from the pedigree analysis, all but one individual was classified correctly in both the normal and carrier population. A discriminant score was also determined for the unknown population of family members which were defined as non-cleft blood relatives of cleft probands. Thus, they were a mixture of two types [...] those unaffected who carried a genetic liability for producing a cleft child and those unaffected who did not. A prediction of their placement into either the normal or carrier group was made with the discriminate function. One-third were classed in the normal group and two-thirds as gene carriers. The results of this study confirm that the phenotype of these unaffected family members designated as obligate gene carriers differs significantly from that of the family normals. This information is not only quite useful for genetic counselling but gives both a better understanding or the genetic control of clefting and can lead to molecular research to identify the specific gene in question...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether angular and linear measurements from tracings of a Panorex radiograph provide a valid comparison to bony relationships identified on the lateral cephalometric <b>headplate</b> of the same individual. A pilot study was performed on a dried skull to identify selected skeletal landmarks on Panorex radiographs. Using these landmarks, fifteen measurements of bony relationships of the head were completed on each radiograph. Values obtained on a lateral <b>headplate</b> were compared with measurements on the same patient's Panorex radiograph for a group of forty-eight children. The data were recorded on standard IBM punch cards and submitted for statistical analysis to the Research Computation Center of Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis. The data support the conclusion that angular and linear measurements from a tracing of a Panorex radiograph cannot be compared directly or in a proportional manner to similar measurements from a tracing of a lateral <b>headplate</b> of the same individual. Although there was significant correlation of comparative measurements for the sample group as a whole, there was wide variation from individual to individual...|$|E

30|$|As biosurfactants are {{naturally}} surface-active substances, during the cultivation they partition into the foam and {{are concentrated in}} it. Resulting biosurfactant-rich foam can be captured as a separate phase. Several reports have described implementation of foam fractionation for biosurfactant concentration. Integrated foam fractionation was reported in processes for production of rhamnolipids (Heyd et al. 2011; Beuker et al. 2016), surfactin (Chen et al. 2006 a; Alonso and Martin 2016), hydrophobin protein HFBII (Winterburn et al. 2011), and mycosubtilin (Guez et al. 2007). In these processes, foam fractionation and product separation were conducted by either using a fractionation column attached directly to the <b>headplate</b> of the bioreactor or by allowing foaming inside the bioreactor space. Rhamnolipid enrichments factors of 4 (Sarachat et al. 2010), 15 (Beuker et al. 2016) and 53 (Heyd et al. 2011) in the foam phase were reported, with product recovery in the foam phase as high as 97 % (Sarachat et al. 2010; Beuker et al. 2016). The high degree of biosurfactant concentration in the foam fraction can save incredible energy input requirements in downstream purification processes (Stevenson and Li 2014).|$|E
