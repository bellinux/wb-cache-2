Vehicle interface fittings, length from pump to attachment and vehicle control systems require various configurations of an auxiliary hydraulic system. Auxiliary hydraulic systems usually include external fluid fittings to facilitate connecting and disconnecting the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> {{lines of the}} attachments to the vehicles' hydraulic pump. They also usually include valves configured to control the supply of hydraulic fluid through the fittings.|$|E

The pile driving machine is lifted and positioned over the pile by means of an excavator or crane, and is fastened to the pile by a clamp and/or bolts. Vibratory hammers can either drive in or extract a pile; extraction is commonly used to recover steel [...] "H" [...] piles used in temporary foundation shoring. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>fluid</b> is typically <b>supplied</b> to the driver by a diesel engine powered pump mounted in a trailer or van and connected to the driver head through a set of long hoses.

Vibratory pile drivers are often chosen to mitigate noise, as when the construction is very close to residence or office buildings, or when there is not enough vertical clearance above the foundation to permit use of a conventional pile hammer (for example when retrofitting additional piles to a bridge column or abutment footing). Hammers are available with several different vibration rates, ranging from about 1200 vibrations per minute to about 2400 VPM; the vibration rate chosen is influenced by soil conditions at the site and other factors such as power requirements and purchase price of the equipment.|$|R
