Exact knowledge {{of the nature of}} changes during ripening and storage in refrigerated storage is essential. Authors investigated physical, chemical and biological changes of field-grown, autumn-harvested food grade potato (cultivar Kondor) as a function of temperature and storage time and the market quality was determined by visual assessment. Most of the investigations were preceded by sampling and methodological examinations. The most appropriate characteristics for the predictive modelling were: water soluble solids content, total starch content, weight loss during storage, marketability of the product (visually assessed) and texture parameters: acoustic <b>firmness</b> <b>factor</b> and bio-yield (by Instron Universal Testing Machine).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Structure {{property}} correlation is {{a critical}} textile research area explored by various researchers and many factors have been proposed {{over the years to}} predict/compare/design the woven fabrics. Cross-over <b>firmness</b> <b>factor</b> (CFF) and floating yarn factor (FYF) have been recently proposed as parameters to understand weave effect on fabric properties (Morino, H., Matsudaira, M. and Furutani, M.

40|$|The {{non-destructive}} acoustic {{impulse response}} method was evaluated for monitoring firmness changes of Conference and Doyenne pears on the tree. The correlation between <b>firmness</b> and meteorological <b>factors</b> was investigated during two successive years. In both years, the firmness showed a sudden reduction between {{three weeks and}} one week before harvest to about 23 kHz(2) g(2 / 3) for Conference and on average 31 - 5 kHz(2) g(2 / 3) for Doyenne pears. Afterwards the firmness decrease could be described by a first order model, which allows to estimate the optimum harvest date, corresponding to a firmness of about 20 - 21 kHz(2) g(2 / 3) for Conference and 26 - 27 kHz(2) g(2 / 3) for Doyenne. Especially for Doyenne pears {{the correlation between the}} non-destructive firmness and the destructive penetrometer firmness was high (correlation coefficient rho = 0. 82). Also the soluble solids contents was reasonably well (negatively) correlated with the firmness measures (rho = - 0. 60 to - 0. 79). Pears that were harvested too early never reached an acceptable quality for consumption. Especially Conference pears stored at a low relative humidity developed weak necks. On the other hand, when pears were picked late, the rates of firmness degradation and weight loss increased. None of the measured meteorological parameters (temperature and rainfall) consistently provided a significant improvement of the predictive firmness model.

Influence of fabric structure on preform properties relevant for resin transfer molding composite manufacture, such as compression, permeability, and tensile behavior were studied with respect to the interlacement and float indices.

40|$|In this study, air {{permeability}} of woven fabrics is predicted from {{the parameters of}} weave structures. Air permeability is an important property of fabrics and has a decisive influence on the utilisation of fabric for some technical and clothing applications. There {{is no doubt that}} predetermination of the {{air permeability}} in woven fabric is vital, and modelling the ef-fective parameters shows the role of the factors as well as the prediction of the property. To promote the design of woven fabrics, we can define the crossing over <b>firmness</b> <b>factor</b> (CFF) and floating yarn factor (FYF) as the parameters of the weave structures for predicting air permeability values. All the parameters are related to air permeability. Multiple regression equations of air permeability are derived from those parameters of weave structures and the values predicted almost exactly agree with the values measured from the FAST system. Key words: air permeability, weave structure, woven fabric. Undoubtedly, predetermination of the air permeability in woven fabric is vital, and modelling the effective parameters shows the role of the factors as well as the pre-diction of the property. Therefore, many efforts have been made to model wo-ven fabric air permeability. The primary model to analyse fabric air permeability is given by Robertson [8]. He considered a wire mesh as a simplified model of a fabric and each pore space between the cross-over of the warp and weft to be a nozzle with an equal discharge coeffi-cient. His work was continued by Hoern-er [9], who used wire mesh for his model too, assumed that the wire mesh and a screen fabric both behave similarly under the same conditions and argues that the pressure drop is due to friction between the air and contact surface area of the me-dium, {{as well as to the}} speed of flow. Ac-tually he believed that the airflow through a fabric is similar to that through a tube, but with the effect of a greater aspect ra-tio. As a result his model was simple but not accurate enough.

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} {{biometric}} parameters, yield and fillet quality traits of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) belonging to the 2008 year class of the breeding nucleus of SalmoBreed AS, Norway. The offspring analyzed belonged to 213 dams and 111 sires, in total 1181 individuals. The salmon were transferred to seawater March 2009 and the different families were kept together in commercial net-pens until the fish was processed July 2010. The mean body weight of the immature male and female salmon was 5. 50 and 5. 30 kg, respectively. The difference between the sexes was even greater for the sexually mature fish, where the male salmon weight 1. 20 kg more than the females (7. 24 vs. 6. 02 kg). The mean slaughter yield was similar {{for male and female}} salmon (90. 7 %- 90. 8 %). The average fillet fat content for male fish was about 16 % whereas the fat content of female fish was about 15 %. The breaking force of the mature salmon was significantly higher than of the immature salmon regarding both sexes. The fillet color was significantly higher of the females compared with the males. The maturation had no significant effect on the fillet color, although mature males had higher frequency of pale patches on the anterior fillet part (pale back). Immature females had significantly highest melanin deposition whereas the mature male had lowest melanin. The body weight, fillet yield, slaughter yield, condition <b>factor,</b> <b>firmness,</b> color, and fat content, varied significantly between the families but no family variation in pale back, melanin deposition in the belly or gaping was observed regarding offspring from dams or sires. Positive correlations between yield and some quality traits (color, pale back and fat content) were observed. The body weight was found to be positively correlated with the yield and condition factor. The offspring from 5 % of the dams and 11 % of the sires had all the desirable quality traits: fat content less than 16 %, intense visual color and firm texture. Among the dams and sires with offspring with desirable quality, one dam and one sire were selected that in addition to superior quality, also had high body weight at slaughter. The body weight of these fish was 6. 7 and 7. 6 kg for the dam and sire, respectively. These results are encouraging, and suggest {{that it is possible to}} obtain future generations of salmon with superior growth performance, high muscularity and yield, and also desirable fillet quality characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Apples stored onshore in Australia and New Zealand, are {{maintained}} at optimal storage conditions {{with the aid}} of low temperatures; controlled atmospheres (CA) and new technologies that retard the production or effect of ethylene (AVG and 1 -MCP respectively). These technologies allow distribution of the highest quality apples to local and export markets on a year round basis. However, during distribution, maintenance of optimal storage conditions may be lost due to refrigeration system breakdown, operational constraints or management decisions. This thesis quantifies the influence of commercially realistic breaks in optimal storage conditions (temperature and CA) on fruit physiology and quality, both {{at the time of the}} break and in subsequent optimal storage conditions. The ‘Cripps Pink’ (‘Pink Lady™’) apple cultivar was chosen for consideration in this thesis because it is a high value cultivar that is of considerable importance to the Australian apple industry. The knowledge of the behaviour of ‘Cripps Pink’ apples in coolstorage conditions (in air and CA) was confirmed through comparison of physiological and quality change behaviour of fruit from three harvests collected in this research and those reported recently by other authors. The investigation of the influence of breaks in temperature control during storage in air at 0 °C, revealed that preclimacteric apples exposed to a break in temperature control, were advanced towards the establishment of the climacteric. Postclimacteric apple, responded by doubling ethylene production a short time after return to coolstorage. Harvest maturity, timing of break during coolstorage, length of break of temperature control and multiple breaks in temperature control, had little influence on the increase ethylene production response. Quality <b>factors</b> (<b>firmness,</b> background hue angle, and titratable acidity) were all reduced as a result of exposure to warmer temperatures, but on return to coolstorage temperatures rates of loss in these quality factors were not influenced by the increased ethylene production. Short-term (3 -day) breaks in CA while fruit remained at refrigerated temperatures were shown to have no substantial effect on fruit physiology or quality, either during the period of the break in CA or in subsequent CA storage. Breaks in temperature control in combination with breaks in CA were observed to cause a doubling of ethylene production on CA stored apples regardless of being returned to 0 °C in air or CA. Those apples that were exposed to a break in temperature control and returned to air storage at refrigerated temperature lost quality (firmness and background hue angle) more rapidly than apples not exposed to breaks in temperature control and transferred to air storage. This result strengthened the knowledge of the influence of ethylene on changes in apple quality, as found for many other apple cultivars. The influence of the decision to transport fruit in CA or air atmosphere shipping containers was initially investigated with a laboratory simulation. Physiology (respiration rate and ethylene production) of air shipped fruit was found not only to be more rapid, but more variable between fruit, than for apples shipped in CA. This more rapid and larger variation of possible fruit physiologies, suggests that in addition to losing quality at a faster rate, the variation in the quality of fruit shipped in air will also enlarge during shipment. This hypothesis was confirmed with data pooled from treatments subjected to 0 °C and 3 °C, simulating the likely temperature variability within a shipping container. Validation of the influence of shipping atmosphere on delivered fruit quality, was conducted in the commercial environment. This trial found that the length of time to ship fruit from Australia and New Zealand to European markets was not sufficient to induce commercially significant differences between ‘Cripps Pink’ apples shipped in the two atmospheres. Finally, as ethylene production was influenced by fluctuations in temperature control and subsequently affected quality of apples previously stored in CA, an investigative attempt to model ethylene production in temperature variable scenarios was conducted. Published models of ethylene production in apples were adapted to the variable temperature storage scenario and a new model was proposed. Unfortunately, none of the models investigated were able to predict all of the consistent behaviours of ethylene production observed during the experimental work, indicating that more knowledge of the ethylene production pathway is required, before modelling of ethylene production and subsequently apple quality can be conducted successfully...|$|R
