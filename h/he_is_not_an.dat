5|$|Townsend {{is married}} to Tracy Turner, his girlfriend since he was 19. She gave birth to their first son, Reyner Liam Johnstan Townsend, on October 4, 2006. In an {{interview}} in December 2011, Townsend stated {{that he has been}} a vegetarian {{for most of the last}} twenty years because of ethical reasons. However, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> activist.|$|E
5|$|A second movie, titled Terry, {{focused on}} the Marathon of Hope, was {{produced}} by the CTV Television Network in 2005. Fox was portrayed by Shawn Ashmore. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed his attitude more positively than the first movie. Canadian National Basketball Association star Steve Nash, who himself was inspired by Fox {{when he was a}} child, directed a 2010 documentary Into the Wind, which aired on ESPN as part of its 30 for 30 series.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} begins sinking as {{the creature}} {{in the ice}} escapes and runs amok. The TARDIS, which originally was on a course set for Las Vegas, materialises inside the submarine and the Doctor and Clara tumble out. The Doctor convinces Captain Zhukov (Liam Cunningham) to maneuver the submarine to the side, landing it safely and preventing it from imploding. During this the TARDIS inexplicably dematerialises. They then encounter the escaped Ice Warrior, Grand Marshal Skaldak (Spencer Wilding, voiced by Nicholas Briggs). The Doctor encourages the crew to be peaceful, but the ship's executive officer Stepashin (Tobias Menzies) knocks out Skaldak with a cattle prod, suspecting that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> alien but part of a Western plot. Knowing that Skaldak will desire vengeance for being attacked, the Doctor and the crew chain Skaldak, who sends out a distress call for others of his race to find him.|$|E
50|$|The apostolic nuncio usually attends {{meetings}} of the Bishops' Conference, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> member of it because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> bishop of a diocese within the Netherlands. The nuncio represents the Holy See.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{nothing was}} said in all those years that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> citizen of Tanganyika. It was only decades later, in the 1990s, that the {{government}} said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> Tanzanian but a Malawian. Others said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Mozambican.|$|R

25|$|Noa Ronkin {{states that}} while Buddha suspends all views {{regarding}} certain metaphysical questions, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> antimetaphysician: {{nothing in the}} texts suggests that metaphysical questions are completely meaningless, instead Buddha taught that sentient experience is dependently originated and that whatever is dependently originated is conditioned, impermanent, subject to change, and lacking independent selfhood.|$|E
25|$|Tubridy {{attracted}} {{criticism for}} {{his refusal to}} take a pay-cut in early 2009 even when colleagues such as Pat Kenny and Marian Finucane approved of their own salary cuts. He was soon {{the subject of a}} hate campaign on social networking site Facebook but later opted to take a 10 per cent pay cut. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> RTÉ employee, but is a contract employee and pays himself €283,756 a year from his production company, Tuttle Productions. He admits to not feeling particularly guilty about his €500,000 salary.|$|E
25|$|Membership in Cosa Nostra is {{open only}} to Sicilian men. A {{candidate}} cannot be {{a relative of}} or have any close links with a lawman, such {{as a police officer}} or a judge. There is no strict age limit; boys as young as sixteen have been initiated. A prospective mafioso is carefully tested for obedience, discretion, courage, ruthlessness, and skill at espionage. He is almost always required to commit murder as his ultimate trial, even if he doesn't plan to be a career assassin. The act of murder is to prove his sincerity (i.e., <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> undercover policeman) and to bind him into silence (i.e., he cannot break omertà without facing murder charges himself).|$|E

25|$|In Fear and Faith is an American post-hardcore {{band from}} San Diego, California. Formed in 2006, {{the group was}} signed to Rise Records and {{released}} three studio albums and two EPs. Their debut full-length, Your World on Fire, being released nearly {{a year after the}} band's signing to Rise in 2008, peaked at No.193 on the Billboard 200. Their second full-length album, Imperial was released the following year and sold even better, charting at No.4 on the Top Heatseekers chart in the US alone. Currently, the band does not feature any original members since the departure of guitarist Ramin Niroomand and drummer Mehdi Niroomand in 2014; vocalist Scott Barnes is the only current member of the band to have performed on all of the group's studio albums, though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> original member.|$|E
25|$|Argus Filch is the {{caretaker}} of Hogwarts. While <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> evil character, he is ill-tempered, {{which makes him}} unpopular with the student body, and occasionally with other staff. His knowledge of the secrets and short-cuts of the castle is almost unparalleled, except perhaps by the Weasley twins, Voldemort himself, Harry, Ron and Hermione, and other users of the Marauder's Map. He tends to favour almost sadistically harsh punishments, leading to his alliance with Umbridge. He has an obsessive dislike of mud, animate toys, and all other things that might interfere with his creation of an immaculately clean and orderly Hogwarts. He is also portrayed as having a constant antagonism towards Peeves the poltergeist and often tells Dumbledore that Peeves should be thrown out of Hogwarts. He also likes to wander Hogwarts corridors at night, presumably {{in the hope of}} catching a student out of bed.|$|E
25|$|McNulty {{waits for}} Bodie {{as he is}} {{released}} from jail and offers to buy him lunch. As they leave, Monk arrives with the bondsman and notices Bodie getting into McNulty's car. McNulty takes Bodie to Cylburn Arboretum. Bodie tells him that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> informant but admits his frustration with {{his life as a}} drug dealer and Marlo's leadership. He states that Marlo expects his people to stand behind him, yet he himself does not stand behind people who work for him. He tells McNulty that the game is rigged and that he feels like a pawn on a chessboard, showing that some of D'Angelo Barksdale's teachings were not lost on him. He offers McNulty information to bring down Marlo, but openly tells McNulty that he will not give any information on any former Barksdale associate. McNulty, out of genuine respect, tells Bodie that he is a soldier.|$|E

50|$|Beltzhoover {{was elected}} as a Democrat to the Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh Congresses. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> {{candidate}} for renomination in 1882. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> again {{elected to the}} Fifty-second and Fifty-third Congresses.

25|$|Von Hartmann is a pessimist, for {{no other}} view of life recognizes that evil {{necessarily}} belongs to existence and can cease only with existence itself. But <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> unmitigated pessimist. The individual's happiness is indeed unattainable either here and now or hereafter and in the future, {{but he does not}} despair of ultimately releasing the Unconscious from its sufferings. He differs from Schopenhauer in making salvation collective by the negation of the will to live depend on a collective social effort and not on individualistic asceticism. The conception of a redemption of the Unconscious also supplies the ultimate basis of von Hartmann's ethics. We must provisionally affirm life and devote ourselves to social evolution, instead of striving after a happiness which is impossible; in so doing we shall find that morality renders life less unhappy than it would otherwise be. Suicide, and all other forms of selfishness, are highly reprehensible. His realism enables him to maintain the reality of Time, and so of the process of the world's redemption.|$|E
500|$|In April 1943 a {{confidential}} analysis by Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office described Barkley as [...] "a Democratic party 'wheelhorse' who will pull the Administration wagon through thick and thin.

He has {{referred}} to himself as [...] "...too individualistic to be either right-wing or left-wing," [...] describing himself in 1974 as [...] "a political nothing" [...] and [...] "a moderate" [...] and in 1997 as a [...] "libertarian." [...] "I don't see myself as conservative," [...] Eastwood has stated, while noting in the same breath that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> [...] "ultra-leftist," [...] either. At times, he has supported Democrats in California, including Senator Dianne Feinstein in 1994, liberal United States House of Representatives member Sam Farr in 2002, and Governor Gray Davis, whom he voted for in 1998 and 2002 and hosted pricey fundraisers for in 2002 and 2003.|$|E

500|$|During the trip, Borat acquires a Baywatch booklet at a {{yard sale}} and {{continues}} gathering footage for his documentary. He meets gay pride parade participants, politicians Alan Keyes and Bob Barr, and African American youths. Borat is also interviewed on live television and disrupts the weather report. Visiting a rodeo, Borat excites the crowd with jingoistic American remarks, but then sings a fictional Kazakhstani national anthem {{to the tune of}} [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner", receiving a strong negative reaction. Staying at a bed-and-breakfast, Borat and Azamat are stunned to learn their hosts are Jewish. Fearful at the hands of their hosts, the two escape after throwing money at two woodlice, believing they are their Jewish hosts transformed. Borat attempts to buy a handgun to defend himself, but is turned away because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> American citizen; consequentially, Borat purchases a bear for protection.|$|E
500|$|On August 3, 2013, Frank {{expressed}} {{sympathy with}} the host's atheism on the television program Real Time with Bill Maher. [...] In his biography, however, Frank states unequivocally that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> atheist and is uncomfortable expressing firm views on questions {{for which he is}} unable to provide an answer. Frank's agnosticism led him to resolve (if he had been appointed as interim Senator) to take the oath of office on the United States Constitution, rather than the Bible. For most of his life and entire Congressional career, Frank was known as a Jew. Frank continues to identify strongly with the Jewish community and has been careful throughout his career that his agnosticism not reflect negatively on other Jews. For example, when he stopped going to temple services on the High Holy Days he was careful to remain at home and {{out of the public eye}} in order that other Jews would not be criticized using his example.|$|E
500|$|The topic {{came up in}} a 2013 {{interview}} of President Barack Obama, who stated {{that if he were}} the owner of the Redskins, he would consider changing the name because it offends many Native Americans, but {{that he did not have}} a stake in the issue as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> owner of a professional sports team. In November 2015 Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated [...] "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" [...] and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms. On May 22, 2014, fifty U.S. Senators, forty-eight Democrats and two Independents, sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Goodell asking the league, referencing the Donald Sterling case, to [...] "send the same clear message as the NBA did: that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports." [...] Five Democratic Senators declined to sign the letter, and Republicans were not invited to do so. [...] No Senators have publicly supported the name, but rather have either declined to give an opinion or stated their opposition to Senate involvement in the issue. During his campaign, President Donald Trump defended the name.|$|E

500|$|Primarily {{established}} {{to provide a}} successor {{in the event of}} the president's death, disability, or resignation, The vice president's sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility is to preside over the U.S. Senate as its president. The vice president also has the authority (ex officio, for <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Adams played {{an active role in the}} Senate's deliberations, particularly during his first term. On at least one occasion, he persuaded senators to vote against legislation he opposed, and he frequently lectured the body on procedural and policy matters. At the start of Washington's presidency, Adams became deeply involved in a month-long Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although the House of Representatives agreed in short order that the president should be addressed simply as [...] "George Washington, President of the United States," [...] the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [...] Liberties) for the president. Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency." [...] Anti-federalists in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as [...] "superlatively ridiculous." [...] In the end, Washington yielded to their objections and the House decided that the title of [...] "Mr. President" [...] would be used.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} casting was announced, Barber told a {{reporter}} for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus would get him into trouble. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents. Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> entirely good guy either. The actor explained [...] "He rides that line and that's {{a lot of fun to}} play. There are a lot of different dynamics. He can be very persuasive, bordering on manipulative, but he has a sensitive side as well, which is coming out gradually." [...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows how to have a good time, while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man". A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would [...] "rile" [...] his colleague, Karl Kennedy. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes. Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E
