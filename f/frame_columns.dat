Moreover, {{the results obtained}} were compared with experimental data. On this basis, a degenerated three-linearity (D-TRI) restoring force model was established which could reflect the hysteresis performance of corroded RC <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> through theoretical analysis and data fitting. Results indicated that the hysteretic bearing capacity of <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> decreased significantly due to corrosion of the rebar. In view {{of the characteristics of}} the hysteresis curve, the plumpness of the hysteresis loop for <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> decreased and shrinkage increased with increasing rebar corrosion. All these illustrated that the seismic energy dissipation performance of <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> reduced but their brittleness increased. As for the features of the skeleton curve, the trends for corroded and noncorroded members were basically consistent and roughly corresponded to the features of a trilinear equivalent model. Thereby, the existing Clough hysteresis rule can be used to establish the restoring force model applicable to corroded RC <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> based on that of the noncorroded RC members. The calculated skeleton curve and hysteresis curve of corroded RC <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> using the D-TRI model are closer to the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new finite element technique {{for the analysis}} of brickwork infilled plane frames subjected to lateral actions. The basic characteristic of this new method of analysis is that the infill/frame contact lengths and the contact stresses are estimated {{as an integral part of}} the solution, and are not assumed in an ad-hoc way. Using this technique, the response of multi-story fully or partially infilled frames under lateral static loads has been investigated. In particular, the redistribution of the action-effects of lateral loads on the infiiled frames has been studied. It is shown that the presence and continuity of the infiil panels critically influence the redistribution of shear forces and leads, in general, to decreased shear forces on the <b>frame</b> <b>columns.</b> However, in case the infilled frames are built with a soft ground story, the shear forces acting on the <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> are considerably higher than those obtained from the analysis of the bare frame.

The shear {{behaviors}} of steel reinforced high strength and high performance concrete (SRHSHPC) composite <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> are studied through the test {{on a number}} of SRHSHPC specimens with grade of concrete strength varied from C 80 to C 120 subjected to constant axial compression and cyclically varying horizontal load. Four influencing factors, namely, shear span ratio, axial compression ratio, stirrup ratio and concrete strength, are taken into consideration in the test, and strain gauges are respectively placed on steel web, stirrups as well as reinforcement bars to study the shear mechanism of SRHSHPC composite columns. According to test results, the shear failure patterns and shear mechanism of the specimens are discussed. By analyzing the contribution of the steel web, concrete, stirrups and reinforcement bars to the shear capacity, the shear mechanism of the SRHSHPC composite columns is figured out. Therefore, the influence of shear span ratio, axial compression ratio, stirrup ratios and concrete strength on shear {{behaviors of}} the SRHSHPC <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> is clear. Finally, concrete truss model and principle of accumulation are applied to discuss the shear capacity and a calculation model for shear strength of the SRHSHPC composite columns is established.

Therefore, if we construct a signature matrix that approximates the signature matrix of an ETF, using Eq. (4), we can obtain a frame that is close to an ETF. The method we propose here directly operates on the signature matrix of an initial m×N frame, in order to obtain a matrix that approximates the spectral and structural properties defined in Theorem 2. Then, the Gram matrix calculated by Eq. (4) yields a frame with small mutual coherence, almost tight, with the additional property of approximate equiangularity, that is, the <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> form similar angles. To our knowledge, this property is not achieved by any other method in the literature. Approximate equiangularity makes the produced frames appropriate for other applications besides compressed sensing.
