Over the years, {{she has learned}} how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E

[...] Geller called the last chapter, relating biology to sociology, a [...] "step from scientific study to speculation".

500|$|According to {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, [...] "If We Are the Body" [...] was {{originally}} written {{for use as}} a [...] "teaching tool" [...] in his youth group.

Everybody in the body of Christ is given gifts to minister with; and when Christians aren’t using these gifts, the body suffers". Hall's inspiration for writing the song came from the second chapter of the book of James, where the writer [...] "admonishes" [...] readers to [...] "steer clear of giving preferential treatment to any one particular group over another, such as favoring the rich over the poor".|$|E

500|$|Bart's rebellious {{attitude}} {{has made him}} a disruptive student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever and proud of it. He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it, having once declared, [...] "I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?" [...] On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster, although Bart ultimately outsmarts her in the end. In [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] (season three, 1992) Bart becomes hall monitor and his grades go up, suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention, not because he is stupid. This idea is reinforced in [...] "Brother's Little Helper", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention deficit disorder. His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family. Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has, on a few occasions, helped Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel: In [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] (season five, 1994), Bart accidentally got Skinner fired and befriended him outside the school environment. Bart missed having Skinner as an adversary and got him rehired, knowing that this would mean that the two could no longer be friends.|$|E
500|$|... "Take Me Home" [...] was {{released}} by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom on August 13, 2001 and in the United States as an import. It {{was released}} as a legal digital download and an enhanced maxi CD single; both featured the Ellis-Bextor cover, B-side [...] "Sparkle" [...] and a Jewels & Stone remix, while the latter contained the song's music video for the song. The single was also pressed as an edition dubbed the [...] "Mixes & Remixes" [...] EP, released only in France. A 12-inch single was also pressed in the United Kingdom, with remixes. Two AllMusic writers reviewed the song. Upon its release as a single, Dean Carlson gave it a negative rating of {{one and a half}} star out of five, commenting: [...] " [...] Ellis Bextor <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what's required for beating the likes of Victoria Beckham and Emma Bunton at their own game—simply take Cher's [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and add one disco beat circa ABBA's 'Fernando', being mindful to avoid its cocaine harmonies and the air of free love , techno-fy it with random fiddly bits, sing with the breathless detachment of someone getting a massage from a lumberjack, and chuck in some remixes just so everybody knows that you're not utterly out of step." [...] After its parent album's release, Kelvin Hayes denoted it as one of the album's strongest tracks, as did Toby Manning from Q. For Yahoo! Music, Gary Crossing wrote that the album [...] "start well with the song", while describing it as Spiller-esque. Betty Clarke of The Guardian regarded [...] "Take Me Home" [...] as a [...] "pleasant enough song", though she called the production and Ellis-Bextor's vocals [...] "more tired than sexy".|$|E

Uganda had just had the United Nations try to pressure them into passing pro-homosexual legislation in order to obtain a large sum of money offered to them (a bribe).

2500|$|Oyarsa listens {{carefully}} to Weston's speech and {{acknowledges that the}} scientist is acting {{out of a sense}} of duty to his species, and not mere greed. This renders him more mercifully disposed towards the scientist, who accepts that he may die while giving Man the means to continue. However, on closer examination Oyarsa points out that Weston's loyalty is not to Man's mind – or he would equally value the intelligent alien minds already inhabiting Malacandra, instead of seeking to displace them in favour of humanity; nor to Man's body – since, as Weston <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> and at ease with, Man's physical form will alter over time, and indeed would have to in order to adapt to Weston's programme of space exploration and colonisation. It seems then that Weston is loyal only to [...] "the seed" [...] – Man's genome – which he seeks to propagate. When Oyarsa questions why this is an intelligible motivation for action, Weston's eloquence fails him and he can only articulate that if Oyarsa does not understand Man's basic loyalty to Man then he, Weston, cannot possibly instruct him.|$|E

Cole is completely different, she declares on their wedding day - he loves and adores her and shows it, so she tolerates his dalliances. Her love for and devotion to him are strong enough for her to overlook his romantic flings outside their marriage. With Linda his fun with music turns into a top international career. Their lavish lifestyle is enviable worldwide. At film's end he tells her the songs were all about her - [...] "not all" [...] she corrects - but enough of them. The leaders in music praise his work and his amazing shows begin. Linda begins a tradition for his show opening nights - a Cartier cigarette case custom designed and engraved to commemorate each show, but almost misses one of his openings herself due to miscarriage and they remain childless.|$|E

2500|$|Published {{as one of}} {{four stories}} (78 pages {{out of a total}} 239), [...] "The Bab Deception" [...] in The Hidden Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by non-Bahá'í William [...] "Bill" [...] Paxton (not the actor Bill Paxton) was {{published}} in 2000-1. A published synopsis: Set in August, 1896, Sherlock Holmes expounds at great length on his occult beliefs and invites Watson to a (spiritualism based) séance. Lestrade & Macintosh take Holmes & Watson to the home of Sir Randolph Gretzinger, former Ambassador to Persia, who has been murdered along with his servant. Holmes finds a copy of the Bayán in Gretzinger's hand, and he expounds at length on Bábism. Side note: Holmes is presented as having a high regard for the religion and being current on its situation enough to know that [...] "Abo ol-Baha" [...] is a political prisoner at that time and knowing full well that the religion would never associate with such a plot having already suffered many martyrs and known to not organize any rebellion and instead maintained a peaceful, unified vision with all mankind. He deduces that the men have been injected with poison (from small wounds in their thumbs), and expounds at length on snake venom. The following day they are summoned to the Diogenes Club, where Mycroft expounds at great length on the politics of petroleum and how this may be the true reason for the murder. After visiting the dead man's widow and urging her to continue his oil negotiations with the Shah of Persia Holmes is visited by representatives of the Bahá'í Faith who fear that the book was planted on the body to implicate them. They expound at length on the assassination of the last Shah and feel an effort is being made to frame them, but Holmes assures them he <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the reputation of the Bahá'ís and believes in their innocence. Holmes & Watson are invited to a séance and Holmes expounds at length on the other guests. At the séance a spirit claiming to be Moriarty hurls a dagger at Holmes. Holmes organizes London Baha'is into a [...] "Baker Street Baha'i", including ones in the Russian Embassy, to locate Gretzinger's missing appointment book from which Holmes is able to learn the murderer's name and establish the innocence of the Bahá'ís.|$|E

Doubtless, Henry <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this, but he sees that when the young earl grows to manhood he might become dangerous; and might supplant him, as he supplanted Richard. Thus, then, I have no doubt the king will use every effort to obtain the release of Lord Grey, in order that he may act as a counterpoise, in the Welsh marches, to the influence of Mortimer.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{was created}} in the islands a situation, strange in the beginning, and which, as its inner {{significance}} is developed, becomes daily stranger to observe. On the one hand, Mataafa sits in Malie, assumes a regal state, receives deputations, heads his letters [...] "Government of Samoa," [...] tacitly treats the king as a co-ordinate; and yet declares himself, and in many ways conducts himself, as a law-abiding citizen. On the other, the white officials in Mulinuu stand contemplating the phenomenon with eyes of growing stupefaction; now with symptoms of collapse, now with accesses of violence. For long, even those well versed in island manners and the island character daily expected war, and heard imaginary drums beat in the forest. But for now close upon a year, and against every stress of persuasion and temptation, Mataafa has been the bulwark of our peace. Apia lay open to be seized, he had the power in his hand, his followers cried to be led on, his enemies marshalled him the same way by impotent examples; and he has never faltered. Early in the day, a white man was sent from the government of Mulinuu to examine and report upon his actions: I saw the spy on his return; [...] "It was only our rebel that saved us," [...] he said, with a laugh. There is now no honest man in the islands but <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it; none but knows that, if we have enjoyed during the past eleven months the conveniences of peace, it is due to the forbearance of [...] "our rebel." [...] Nor does this part of his conduct stand alone. He calls his party at Malie the government,--"our government,"--but he pays his taxes to the government at Mulinuu. He takes ground like a king; he has steadily and blandly refused to obey all orders as to his own movements or behaviour; but upon requisition he sends offenders to be tried under the chief justice.|$|E
6000|$|May 22d.--Yesterday, {{while we}} were at dinner, Mr. ------ called. I never saw him but once before, and {{that was at the}} door of our little red cottage in Lenox; he sitting in a wagon with {{one or two of the}} Sedgewicks, merely exchanging a {{greeting}} with me from under the brim of his straw hat, and driving on. He presented himself now with a long white beard, such as a palmer might have worn as the growth of his long pilgrimages, a brow almost entirely bald, and what hair he has quite hoary; a forehead impending, yet not massive; dark, bushy eyebrows and keen eyes, without much softness in them; a dark and sallow complexion; a slender figure, bent a little with age; but at once alert and infirm. It surprised me to see him so venerable; for, as poets are Apollo's kinsmen, we are inclined to attribute to them his enviable quality of never growing old. There was a weary look in his face, as if he were tired of seeing things and doing things, though with certainly enough still to see and do, if need were. My family gathered about him, and he conversed with great readiness and simplicity about his travels, and whatever other subject came up; telling us that he had been abroad five times, and was now getting a little home-sick, and had no more eagerness for sights, though his [...] "gals" [...] (as he called his daughter and another young lady) dragged him out to see the wonders of Rome again. His manners and whole aspect are very particularly plain, though not affectedly so; but it seems as if in the decline of life, and the security of his position, he had put off whatever artificial polish he may have heretofore had, and resumed the simpler habits and deportment of his early New England breeding. Not but what you discover, nevertheless, that he is a man of refinement, who has seen the world, and <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his own place in it. He spoke with great pleasure of his recent visit to Spain. I introduced the subject of Kansas, and methought his face forthwith assumed something of the bitter keenness of the editor of a political newspaper, while speaking of the triumph of the administration over the Free-Soil opposition. I inquired whether he had seen S------, and he gave a very sad account of him as he appeared at their last meeting, which was in Paris. S------, he thought, had suffered terribly, and would never again be the man he was; he was getting fat; he talked continually of himself, and of trifles concerning himself, and seemed to have no interest for other matters; and Mr. ------ feared that the shock upon his nerves had extended to his intellect, and was irremediable. He said that S------ ought to retire from public life, but had no friend true enough to tell him so. This is about as sad as anything can be. I hate to have S------ undergo the fate of a martyr, because he was not naturally of the stuff that martyrs are made of, and it is altogether by mistake that he has thrust himself into the position of one. He was merely, though with excellent abilities, one of the best of fellows, and ought to have lived and died in good fellowship with all the world.|$|E
