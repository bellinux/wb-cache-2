5|$|Examination of M87 at far {{infrared}} wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25μm. Normally such emission {{may be an}} indication of thermal emission by warm dust. However, {{in the case of}} M87, the emission appears to be fully explained by synchrotron radiation from the jet. Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in this galaxy <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way contains about a hundred million (108) solar masses worth of dust.|$|E

During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E

5|$|Mount Bailey {{heads the}} Mount Bailey chain, which {{consists}} of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes, and the two are almost equal in appearance.

Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey switched from erupting basaltic andesite to pure andesite (silicon dioxide).|$|E

5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E
5|$|The 767 {{features}} a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy. The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats {{need to be}} filled, and each passenger <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than one seat from the aisle. It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} royal burials to Thebes {{after the end}} of the Amarna period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the {{intermediate}} 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, but it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than a gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style) but later usurped for Ay's burial. This would mean that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more,</b> he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E
5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E

5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E
5|$|S. Sivasekaram's 1980 Tamil poem Ahalikai {{examines}} the stone motif in Ahalya's tale: she marries {{a husband who}} <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> interested in her than a stone and briefly encounters joy with Indra, only to end up cursed to become a lifeless stone. The poet asks if it was better for Ahalya to remain physically a stone and retain her dignity rather than return to a stony marriage. Uyir Maga ("Life-woman") by the Tamil poet Na. Pichamurthy (1900–76) presents Ahalya as an allegorical representation of life, with Gautama as the mind and Indra pleasure. The Marxist critic Kovai Gnani, in his poem Kallihai, represents Ahalya as the oppressed class and Rama as an ideal future without exploitation. Gautama and Indra represent feudalism and capitalism. The character of Ahalya played by Kamala Kotnis in the 1949 movie Sati Ahalya ("chaste Ahalya") was described as still relevant by contemporary film critics due to its portrayal of the predicament of a stained woman.|$|E
