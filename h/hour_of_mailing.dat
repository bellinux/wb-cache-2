25|$|The Imperial edict of 12 Ramasan 1256 {{and later}} {{ordinances}} made {{the distinction between}} three types <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> items: ordinary letters, registered letters (markings te'ahudd olunmoshdur), and official letters (markings tahirat-i mühümme). Fees were calculated by the type <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> the weight, and the distance (measured in hours): in 1840, an ordinary letter, weighing less than 10g, had a cost per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> 1 para. Special fees applied to samples, insured mail, special delivery, and printed matters, etc. These postal rates changed frequently, and new services were added over the years. Upon joining the Universal Postal Union on 1 July 1875, Ottoman overseas rates conformed to UPU rules.|$|R

Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|R

5000|$|Gousset was a {{component}} of late Medieval armor. During the transition from mail to plate armor, sections <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> covered parts <b>of</b> the body that were not protected by steel plate. These sections <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> were known as gousset. Gousset came into use in the fourteenth century as plate became a structural part of a suit of knightly armor rather than an addition strapped over a suit <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> During the fourteenth century there was considerable variation in the ratio of gousset to plate.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two threads in {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art: a networking approach dedicated to open participation and a crafted approach dedicated to the art object. It then follows these two threads across three generations. Mail art is an international phenomenon that evolved over the past sixty odd years due {{to the efforts of}} a dedicated and growing group of individuals. American artist Ray Johnson and the international artistic group operating under the banner of Fluxus are discussed as establishing mail art as a separate form through their creation <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network. The generation that followed Johnson and Fluxus expanded on the free and open ethos <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network, making it a cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and embracing new technology. Finally, this study examines work by contemporary mail artists who have not yet been historicized and who return to a craft approach in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art. Using Glenn Adamson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of craft, this thesis concludes that craft is an equally pertinent aspect <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and that, although it is underemphasized in mail art 2 ̆ 7 s first two generations, it is a dominant factor in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art today...|$|R

40|$|Formal art {{education}} equips students with skills to produce artworks. A formal {{art education}} {{may increase the}} opportunity for employment, however, art-related employment is very limited. Art graduates would be better equipped to market and manage art establishments or their own careers if art education were to be supplemented with basic business skills. Artists who wish to earn unsupplemented incomes from their art should undertake to acquire business acumen. This includes being presentable to the market place in attitude and appearance. It also includes aptitude in art, marketing and management. Role models and non-models {{of success and failure}} in business should also be observed. Art graduates should adopt applicable tried and tested business methods. Good marketing is a mix of business activities which identifies and creates consumer needs and wants. Marketing activities involve research, planning, packaging, pricing, promoting and distributing products and services to the public to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organisational objectives. Art products include artworks, frames, art books and art materials. Art-related services include the undertaking of commissions, consulting, teaching, free parking, convenient shopping <b>hours,</b> acceptance <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> or telephone orders, exhibitions, ease of contact, approval facilities, wrapping, delivery, installations (picture hanging), quotations, discounts, credit facilities, guarantees, trade-ins, adjustments and restorations. Good management is a mix of business activities which enables a venture {{to meet the challenges of}} supply and demand. There is a blueprint for management competence. The three dimensions of organisational competence are collaboration, commitment and creativity. Self-marketing and management is an expression of an artist's most creative being. It is that which can ensure and sustain recognition and income. Artists, like other competent organisations and entrepreneurs from the private sector, should operate with efficient manufacturing, marketing, management and finance departments. They are also equally important and therefore demand equal attention. Artistic skill together with business acumen should equip the artist to successfully compete in the market place. There are no short-cuts to becoming an artist but there are short-cuts to becoming a known and financially stable artist. Understanding marketing and management could mean the difference between waiting in poverty and frustration for a "lucky break" (which may only happen after an artists's death) and taking control. Success should be perpetuated through continuous effort. ...|$|R
