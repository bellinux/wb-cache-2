5|$|As a wanted criminal, Anarky's {{methods and}} goals were {{described}} as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or the public at large, relegating him to underground operation. When in need of assistance, he would call on {{the help of the}} homeless community in Gotham who <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> him since his first appearance.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Taft's presidency, {{protectionism}} {{through the use of}} tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party. The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition. The 1908 party platform <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> unspecified revisions to the Dingley Act, and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions. Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But as soon as he became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E

5|$|Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy {{who speaks}} in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone {{who is not a}} pure-blood wizard– and wizards who do not share his views. His parents <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, {{claiming}} they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations, and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.|$|E
5|$|From 1901 Gould {{maintained}} {{an interest in}} the procedure of the Senate, and {{was a member of the}} standing orders committee from its appointment in 1901 until 1907. He <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> the opening of Senate proceedings with prayer and had made frequent reference to the standing orders of the British House of Commons. He contested the Presidency of the Senate in 1904, but was defeated by the incumbent, Sir Richard Baker.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the band}} listened to {{hundreds}} of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane who <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them. Harris' preferred choice from the outset, Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.|$|E

Ultimately McQuaid {{was defeated in}} his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy. Lemond <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1540 Cromwell, Henry's {{longtime}} advisor {{and loyal}} servant, was executed. Different reasons were advanced: that Cromwell would not enforce the Act of Six Articles; that he <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> Barnes, Latimer and other heretics; {{and that he}} was responsible for Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves, his fourth wife. Many other arrests under the Act followed. Cranmer lay low.|$|E
5|$|Other {{opinions}} included Dr H Stern's, who {{postulated that}} the History was composed {{by a team}} of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of Magnentius on behalf of the Senatorial aristocracy who <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> the usurper. In the 21st century, Alan Cameron rebutted a number of Syme's and Barnes' arguments for a composition date c.395–400, suggesting a composition date between 361 and the 380s.|$|E

5|$|Secretariat {{members who}} <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> Shachtman were {{expelled}} by the emergency conference, {{with the support}} of Trotsky himself. While leader of the SWP James P. Cannon later said that he did not believe the split to be definitive and final, the two groups did not reunite. A new International Executive Committee was appointed, which came under the increasing influence of the Socialist Workers Party.|$|E
5|$|Taft sent {{a special}} message to Congress {{on the need}} for a revamped {{antitrust}} statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had taken no action (a decision Taft <b>had</b> <b>supported),</b> the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he <b>had</b> <b>supported.</b>|$|E
5|$|The King gave Sutton Valence to William de Valence, his half-brother, who <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> {{him during}} the conflict.

The Valences travelled around their estates, increasingly focusing their attention {{on a handful of}} their various great houses, and stayed at Sutton Valence on at least several occasions.|$|E

5|$|The Welles Declaration linked U.S. {{policy towards}} the Baltic {{states with the}} Stimson Doctrine, which did not {{recognize}} Japanese, German and Italian occupations during the 1930s. It broke with Wilsonian policies that <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> a strong Russian presence as a counterweight to German power. During the Cold War, the U.S. used the Baltic issue {{as a point of}} leverage in U.S.-Soviet relations.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's {{household}} {{was largely}} run by her childhood governess, Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover. Lehzen {{had been a}} formative influence on Victoria, and <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> her against the Kensington System. Albert, however, thought Lehzen was incompetent, and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.|$|E
5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E

5|$|Achieving her {{objective}} was, however, not straightforward. The Pope {{was only}} {{prepared to accept}} reunion when church property disputes had been settled—which, in practice, meant letting those who had bought former church property keep it. Thus did Cardinal Pole arrive to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer imprisoned as he was tried and executed for treason—he <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for heresy. His recantations of his Protestantism {{would have been a}} major coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at the last minute as he was to be burned at the stake, thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News spread of Macrinus' defeat, however, and many civilians who <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> him were slain {{in the city}} and on the roads. Macrinus then shaved off his beard and hair to disguise himself {{as a member of the}} military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia along with a few companions, masqueraded as a military courier, and secured a carriage to drive to Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu {{and several other}} {{prominent}} officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia {{turned a blind eye}} to Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and <b>had</b> <b>supported</b> attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another.|$|E
