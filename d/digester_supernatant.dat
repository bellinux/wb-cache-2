40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas and of special concern in wastewater treatment. It is formed in biological wastewater treatment under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A major reason for high N 2 O emissions is low oxygen concentration during nitrification. In this full-scale study of N 2 O emissions from a sequencing batch reactor for treating <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant,</b> the oxygen concentration was reduced stepwise to investigate how N 2 O emissions were influenced. N 2 O concentrations were measured online in water and off-gas. A distinct relationship was found between low oxygen concentration and high N 2 O emissions. N 2 O was formed in water during both nitrification and denitrification. Decreased oxygen concentration during nitrification led to increased nitrite concentration, which in turn led to increased N 2 O concentration in the subsequent denitrification phase.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a {{greenhouse}} gas formed during biological wastewater treatment under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Two reasons for high N 2 O emissions are low oxygen concentration during nitrification and low carbon/nitrogen-ratio during denitrification. In this full-scale study of N 2 O emissions from a sequencing batch reactor for treating <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant,</b> the oxygen concentration was reduced stepwise and the carbon/nitrogen-ratio was varied to investigate how N 2 O emissions were influenced. N 2 O concentrations were measured online {{in water and}} off-gas. A distinct relationship was found between low oxygen concentrations and high N 2 O emissions.

Decreased oxygen concentration during nitrification led to increased nitrite concentration, which in turn led to increased N 2 O concentration in the subsequent denitrification phase. When nitrification resumed, accumulated N 2 O was stripped off to the atmosphere. A too low carbon/nitrogen-ratio resulted in increased N 2 O emissions in off-gas under longer-term conditions and increased risk of separate peak emissions.

40|$|Completely {{autotrophic}} nitrogen removal (ANR) {{is based}} on the combination of partial nitritation (PN) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). It is a promising alternative for the subsequent treatment of biogas <b>digester</b> <b>supernatants</b> in livestock manure processing and nitrogen surplus scenarios. However, as no full-scale experiences in the treatment of manure digestates by ANR have been published to date, future field studies addressing treatment of this kind of effluent would be of great interest. Some topics to be considered in these studies would be coupling anaerobic digestion and ANR, analysis of the factors that affect the process, comparing reactor configurations, microbial ecology, gas emissions, and achieving robust performance. This paper provides an overview of published studies on ANR. Specific issues related to the applicability of the process for treating manure digestates are discussed. The energy requirements of ANR are compared with those of other technological alternatives aimed at recovering nitrogen from <b>digester</b> <b>supernatants.</b> The results of the assessment were shown to depend on the composition of the supernatant.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to show the potential additional insight that result from adding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to plant performance evaluation criteria, such as effluent quality (EQI) and operational cost (OCI) indices, when evaluating (plant-wide) control/operational strategies in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The proposed GHG evaluation is based on a set of comprehensive dynamic models that estimate the most significant potential on-site and off-site sources of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O. The study calculates and discusses the changes in EQI, OCI and the emission of GHGs as a consequence of varying the following four process variables: (i) the set point of aeration control in the activated sludge section; (ii) the removal efficiency of total suspended solids (TSS) in the primary clarifier; (iii) the temperature in the anaerobic digester; and (iv) the control of the flow of anaerobic <b>digester</b> <b>supernatants</b> coming from sludge treatment. Based upon the assumptions built into the model structures, simulation results highlight the potential undesirable effects of increased GHG production when carrying out local energy optimization of the aeration system in the activated sludge section and energy recovery from the AD. Although off-site CO 2 emissions may decrease, the effect is counterbalanced by increased N 2 O emissions, especially since N 2 O has a 300 -fold stronger greenhouse effect than CO 2. The reported results emphasize the importance and usefulness of using multiple evaluation criteria to compare and evaluate (plant-wide) control strategies in a WWTP for more informed operational decision makin...|$|R
40|$|Bioaugmentation of nitrifiers from a {{side-stream}} {{treatment is}} an efficient method for boosting the mainstream process at a {{wastewater treatment plant}} (WWTP).

For a WWTP approaching its critical nitrogen load capacity, the benefits are doubled if the introduced side-stream treatment for <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant</b> is combined with bioaugmentation. Not only is the nitrogen load to the mainstream process decreased by 10 - 25 %, but the mainstream process is also boosted with nitrifiers, increasing the nitrifying capacity. In this full-scale study, the increment of the nitrification rate is examined in the mainstream process at different temperatures and at different flow rates of returned activated sludge to the side-stream treatment. Our results show that the nitrification rate in the mainstream process was increased by 41 % during the coldest period of the study, implying that the examined WWTP could treat considerably higher nitrogen loads if bioaugmentation were permanently installed...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{nitrification}} of ammonium to nitrite under oxic conditions (nitritation) is {{a critical}} process for the effective use of alternative nitrogen removal technologies from wastewater. Here we investigated the conditions which promote establishment of a suitable microbial community for performing nitritation when starting from regular sewage sludge. Reactors were operated in duplicate under different conditions (pH, temperature, and dilution rate) and were fed with 50 mM ammonium either as synthetic medium or as sludge <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant.</b> In all cases, stable nitritation could be achieved within 10 to 20 days after inoculation. Quantitative in situ hybridization analysis with group-specific fluorescent rRNA-targeted oligonucleotides (FISH) in the different reactors showed that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira were only active directly after inoculation with sewage sludge (up to 4 days and detectable up to 10 days). As demonstrated by quantitative FISH and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analyses of the amoA gene (encoding the active-site subunit of the ammonium monooxygenase), the community of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria changed within the first 15 to 20 days from a more diverse set of populations consisting of members of the Nitrosomonas communis and Nitrosomonas oligotropha sublineages and the Nitrosomonas europaea-Nitrosomonas eutropha subgroup in the inoculated sludge to a smaller subset in the reactors. Reactors operated at 30 °C and pH 7. 5 contained reproducibly homogeneous communities dominated by one amoA RFLP type from the N. europaea-N. eutropha group. Duplicate reactors at pH 7. 0 developed into diverse communities and showed transient population changes even within the ammonia oxidizer community. Reactors at pH 7. 5 and 25 °C formed communities that were indistinguishable by the applied FISH probes but differing in amoA RFLP types. Communities in reactors fed with sludge <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant</b> exhibited a higher diversity and were constantly reinoculated with ammonium oxidizers from the supernatant. Therefore, such systems could be maintained at a higher dilution rate (0. 75 day− 1 compared to 0. 2 day− 1 for the synthetic wastewater reactors).

This isolate exhibited a temperature optimum of 55 to 60 °C {{and a maximum}} near 70 °C. Growth occurred throughout the pH range of 5. 5 to 9. 0, with optimal growth near pH 7. 2. Although 4 % salt was present in the isolation medium, salt was not required for optimal growth. The thermophile utilized formate or H 2 -CO 2 but not acetate, methanol, or methylamines for growth and methanogenesis. Growth in complex medium was very rapid, and a minimum doubling time of 1. 8 h was recorded in media supplemented with rumen fluid. Growth in defined media required the addition of acetate and an unknown factor(s) from <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant,</b> rumen fluid, or Trypticase. Cells in liquid culture were oval to coccoid, 0. 7 to 1. 8 μm in diameter, often occurring in pairs. The cells were easily lysed upon exposure to oxygen or 0. 08 mg of sodium dodecyl sulfate per ml.

Denitrification will occur simultaneously when organic carbon is also present. In this study, the activity of aerobic ammonia oxidizing, anammox and denitrifying bacteria in a full scale Sequencing Batch Reactor, treating <b>digester</b> <b>supernatants,</b> was studied by means of batch-assays. AOB and anammox activities were maximum at pH of 8. 0 and 7. 8 - 8. 0, rispectively. Short term effect of nitrite on anammox activity was studied, showing nitrite up to 42 mg/L {{did not result in}} inhibition. Both denitrification via nitrate and nitrite were measured. To reduce nitrite-oxidizing activity, high of NH 3 – N (1. 9 - 10 mg N-NH 3 /L) and low nitrite (3 - 8 mg TNN/L) are required conditions during the whole SBR cycle. Molecular analysis showed the nitritation-anammox sludge harbored a high microbial diversity, where each microorganism has a specific role. Using ammonia monooxygenase α –subunit (amoA) gene as a marker, our analyses suggested different macro- and micro-environments in the reactor strongly affect the AOB community, allowing the development of different AOB species, such as N. europaea/eutropha and N. oligotropha groups, which improve the stability of nitritation process. A specific PCR primer set, used to target the 16 S rRNA gene of anammox bacteria, confirmed the presence of the Ca. Brocadia fulgida type, able to grow in precence of organic matter and to tolerate high nitrite concentrations. The diversity of denitrifiers was assessed by using dissimilatory nitrite reductase (nirS) gene-based analyses, who showed denitifiers were related to different betaproteobacterial genera, such as Thauera, Pseudomonas, Dechloromonas and Aromatoleum, able to assist in forming microbial aggregates.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the influence of cationic flocculants (polyelectrolytes) on the performances of the anaerobic digestion process, a lab-scale experimentation was carried out using waste activated sludge conditioned with a cationic flocculant as substrate. The selected flocculant was a cationic organic polyelectrolyte, based on polyacrylamide: the PRAESTOL K 233 L by Stockhausen GmbH. A 15 litres stirred reactor was fed once a day with flocculated activated sludge originated from a large full-scale wastewater treatment plant. After a first trial (reference period), where only activated sludge fed the reactor, the activated sludge was then conditioned with increasing amounts of the cationic polymer dosed at 5, 15 and 30 g per kg of sludge (dry weight). The performances of the reactor were then studied in terms of biogas production, volatile matter removal and parameters indicating the process stability (pH, alkalinity, biogas composition). These were compared to the results obtained in the reference period. The digester worked in the mesophilic range of temperature (35 – 37 °C) with a hydraulic retention time of 20 days and an organic loading rate of some 1 kgVS/m 3 reactor per day. These were chosen as typical operational conditions for anaerobic digesters working with waste activated sludge. The experimental set up enabled to observe that the addition of the cationic flocculant did not affect the digester performances in terms of biogas production, the specific biogas production was 0. 15 – 0. 23 l/gVSfed in all the tested conditions, and that the flocculant was partially biodegradable. Also kinetic studies confirmed this situation and a value of the first order reaction kinetic constant, K, equal to some 0. 10 day- 1 was observed, no matter the flocculant concentration. On the other hand, the presence of the typical functional groups of the flocculant was observed in the <b>digester</b> <b>supernatants</b> by spectro-photometric analysis.

40|$|Formation of {{magnesium}} ammonium phosphate (struvite, MgNH 4 PO 4. 6 H 2 O), which has commercial value as fertiliser, is a sustainable technology for ammonia and phosphate removal and recovery from anaerobic <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant.</b> Considering that magnesium concentration relative to ammonia and phosphate {{concentrations in the}} supernatant is low, magnesium dosage is usually required to force struvite formation. This research was conducted to investigate the optimum reaction conditions and the feasibility of Mg-rich waste material as a magnesium source for ammonia and phosphate removal and recovery as struvite from anaerobic <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant.</b> Struvite formation {{was carried out by}} adding Na 2 HPO 4 and MgCl 2 or magnesium-rich waste material at different conditions: (i) pH; (ii) reaction time; (iii) molar ratios (Mg 2 + :NH 4 + :PO 4 3 -). Confirmation of struvite formation and measurement of struvite precipitation’s particles size were analysed by XRD and ESEM, respectively. Economic analysis was conducted to estimate the cost of using Mg-rich waste material in the process. A chemical equilibrium software Visual MINTEQ was used for predicting struvite formation using high range of the pH and molar ratio. Increasing the mixing rate and the reaction time had little effect on ammonia and phosphate removal. Crystal growth had only a minor relationship to the reaction time. pH change with time indicated that induction time was extremely short. The optimum pH was between 9 and 9. 5. The reaction time of 10 minutes was adequate for struvite formation due to a high reaction rate. The Mg 2 + :NH 4 + :PO 4 3 - ratio of 1. 2 : 1. 0 : 1. 0 was found to be the optimum molar ratio in order to use Mg 2 + and PO 4 3 - dosage efficiently. The chemical equilibrium software Visual MINTEQ successfully predicted struvite formation. The prediction indicated that struvite formation was at a wide pH range from 6. 5 to 11. 5. MgHPO 4. 3 H 2 O, Mg 3 (PO 4) 2 and Brucite (Mg(OH) 2) formed with struvite, but struvite was still the main product. The removal of ammonia and phosphate was achieved over 98. 00 % using Mg-rich waste material as a magnesium source at pH 9. 5 and the Mg 2 + :NH 4 + :PO 4 3 - ratio of 1. 2 : 1. 0 : 1. 0.

40|$|In {{wastewater}} treatment plants with anaerobic sludge digestion, 15 - 20 % of the nitrogen load is recirculated to the main stream with the return liquors from dewatering. Separate treatment of this ammonium-rich <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant</b> significantly reduces the nitrogen load of the activated sludge system. Two biological applications are considered for nitrogen elimination: (i) classical autotrophic nitrification/heterotrophic denitrification and (ii) partial nitritation/autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). With both applications 85 - 90 % nitrogen removal can be achieved, but there are considerable differences in terms of sustainability and costs. The final gaseous products for heterotrophic denitrification are generally not measured and {{are assumed to be}} nitrogen gas (N- 2). However, significant nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production can occur at elevated nitrite concentrations in the reactor. Denitrification via nitrite instead of nitrate has been promoted in recent years {{in order to reduce the}} oxygen and the organic carbon requirements. Obviously this achievement turns out to be rather disadvantageous from an overall environmental point of view. On the other hand no unfavorable intermediates are emitted during anaerobic ammonium oxidation. A cost estimate for both applications demonstrates that partial nitritation/anammox is also more economical than classical nitrification/denitrification. Therefore autotrophic nitrogen elimination should be used in future to treat ammonium-rich sludge liquors...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{usage of}} water {{associated with an}} industrialized civilization {{has resulted in the}} accumulation of waste products in the natural watercourses. One of the manifest deteriorations in water quality has been the overgrowth of algae and other aquatic plants which have been attributed to the presence of increased concentrations of fertilizer constituents, particularly nitrogen and phosphorous. One source of fertilizer elements is in treated sewage effluents inasmuch as nitrogen and phosphorous are incompletely removed in conventional processes. Substantial research along various avenues is currently underway with the object of upgrading sewage treatment in respect to removal of fertilizer ingredients. Since phosphorous is a non volatile constituent, it is necessary to fix it into the solids fraction leaving the sewage treatment process which is not discharged to a watercourse. The precipitation of phosphate with lime has been demonstrated as effective in the fixing of the constituent in the solids fraction, but the process has been accompanied by voluminous, slow settling sludges. The research reported herein was undertaken to increase the general understanding of the lime precipitation process as it applies to <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant</b> liquor and to investigate particle nucleation as a technique for improving sludge settling and dewatering characteristics.

40|$|The {{presence}} of sulfur compounds (e. g. protein, sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, etc.) in the feed stream generates highly corrosive and odorous hydrogen sulfide during anaerobic digestion. The high sulfide {{level in the}} biogas stream is not only poisonous to many novel metal catalysts employed in thermo-catalytic processes but also reduces the quality of methane to produce renewable energy. This study used an innovative, low-maintenance, low-cost biological sulfide removal technology to remove sulfides simultaneously from both gas and liquid phase. ORP (Oxidation-Reduction-Potential) {{was used as the}} controlling parameter to precisely regulate air injection to the sulfide oxidizing unit (SOU). The microaeration technique provided just enough oxygen to partially oxidize sulfides to elemental sulfur without inhibiting methanogenesis. The SOU was equipped with a diffuser at the bottom for the dispersion of sulfide-laden biogas and injected air throughout the column. The SOU can be operated as a standalone unit or coupled with an anaerobic digester to simultaneously remove sulfide from the biogas and effluent. The integrated system was capable of reducing hydrogen sulfide in biogas from 2, 450 to less than 2 ppmV with minimal sulfate production at the highest available sulfide loading rate of 0. 24 kg/m 3 -day. More than 98 % of sulfide removed was recovered as elemental sulfur. However, the standalone SOU was able to operate at high hydrogen sulfide loading of 1. 46 kg/m 3 -day at inlet sulfide concentration of 3000 ppmV and reduce the off-gas hydrogen sulfide concentrations to less than 10 ppmV. The experiment also revealed that the ORP controlled aeration was sensitive enough to prevent oxygen overdosing (dampening effect) during unexpected surges of aeration. Using generalized linear regression, a model predicting output H 2 S concentration based on input H 2 S concentrations, SOU medium heights, and biogas flow rates, was derived. With 95 % confidence, output H 2 S concentration was affected by changes in liquid heights the most, followed by changes in flow rates. Feasibility studies for H 2 S removal from biogas by micro-aeration were conducted at the Ames Water Pollution Control Facility (AWPCF) by using different types of liquid media available at the plant, i. e. plant effluent, mixed liquor, and <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant.</b> From the experiment at AWPCF, it was found that operating pHs were affected by the amount of alkalinity in the liquid media and that the removal efficiencies were affected by the operating pH. Among all the liquid media tested, <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant</b> showed the greatest potential with more than 99 % H 2 S removal at an operating pH of 7. 0 and volumetric biogas flow rate of 21. 6 m 3 /m 3 -hr. By increasing trace metal contents and temperature of the medium, the hydrogen sulfide removal rate was greatly improved. The operating cost of the full-scale system was estimated to be approximately $ 2 /kg-S-removed. In addition, it was also revealed that abiotic sulfide oxidation accounted for 95 % of overall sulfide oxidation. This technology is expected to widen the use of biogas as a renewable fuel since the maintenance requirements of biogas handling equipment, the methane purification costs, and the emissions of SOx will dramatically be reduced. Importantly, the technology does not require inoculation of special bacteria, addition of nutrients and trace elements, or chemicals for pH control...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhosphorus (P) is an {{essential}} and limited resource. Municipal wastewater is a promising source of P via reuse and {{could be used to}} replace P derived from phosphate rocks. The agricultural use of sewage sludge is restricted by legislation or is not practiced in several European countries due to environmental risks posed by organic micropollutants and pathogens. Several technologies have been developed in recent years to recover wastewater P. However, these technologies target different P-containing flows in wastewater treatment plants (effluent, <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant,</b> sewage sludge, and sewage sludge ash), use diverse engineering approaches and differ greatly with respect to P recycling rate, potential of removing or destroying pollutants, product quality, environmental impact and cost. This work compares 19 relevant P recovery technologies by considering their relationships with existing wastewater and sludge treatment systems. A combination of different methods, such as material flow analysis, damage units, reference soil method, annuity method, integrated cost calculation and a literature study on solubility, fertilizing effects and handling of recovered materials, is used to evaluate the different technologies with respect to technical, ecological and economic aspects. With regard to the manifold origins of data an uncertainty concept considering validity of data sources is applied. This analysis revealed that recovery from flows with dissolved P produces clean and plant-available materials. These techniques may even be beneficial from economic and technical perspectives under specific circumstances. However, the recovery rates (a maximum of 25 %) relative to the wastewater treatment plant influent are relatively low. The approaches that recover P from sewage sludge apply complex technologies and generally achieve effective removal of heavy metals at moderate recovery rates (~ 40 – 50 % relative to the WWTP input) and comparatively high costs. Sewage sludge ash is the most promising P source, with recovery rates of 60 – 90 % relative to the wastewater P.

The possible application of partial nitritation SHARON (Single reactor for High activity Ammonium Removal Over Nitrite) coupled with autotrophic ANAMMOX (ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation) or heterotrophic denitrification via nitrite processes would represent a technical- and cost-effective technology: partial nitritation has been studied and commonly applied at full scale to treat anaerobic <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant</b> and landfill leachates, while only few studies focusing on the treatment of industrial wastewater containing toxic substances {{have been carried out}} so far. In this study, a SHARON reactor was used to treat synthetic and real ammonium rich refinery wastewater (sour water) : since availability of inorganic carbon (IC) determines the amount of NH 4 +-N being converted into NO 2 [...] N by partial nitritation, different influent IC/N (as HCO 3 -/NH 4 +-N) molar ratios were tested and SHARON feasibility as the preliminary treatment in a double stage SHARON-ANAMMOX or SHARON-Denitrification via nitrite process was assessed. In order to retain only ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the system, the reactor was run at controlled temperature and operated as a chemostat (no biomass recirculation) at low hydraulic and solids retention time. A synthetic medium containing NH 4 +-N (2, 000 mg/L) was initially fed to promote biomass acclimation, then real sour water containing also organic substrate, cyanides, sulphides and phenols was supplied. In both synthetic and real wastewater, the IC/N molar ratio was progressively increased from 1 to 2. Effluent from the SHARON reactor fed with the synthetic medium (influent IC/N molar ratio of 1) was suitable for subsequent treatment by ANAMMOX; increasing the IC/N molar ratio up to 2 enhanced NH 4 +-N conversion into nitrite, producing a final effluent suitable for denitrification via nitrite.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to report the effects that control/operational strategies may have on plant-wide phosphorus (P) transformations in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The development of a new set of biological (activated sludge, anaerobic digestion), physico-chemical (aqueous phase, precipitation, mass transfer) process models and model interfaces (between water and sludge line) were required to describe the required tri-phasic (gas, liquid, solid) compound transformations and the close interlinks between the P and the sulfur (S) and iron (Fe) cycles. A modified version of the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM 2) (open loop) is used as test platform upon which three different operational alternatives (A 1, A 2, A 3) are evaluated. Rigorous sensor and actuator models are also included in order to reproduce realistic control actions. Model-based analysis shows that the combination of an ammonium (SNHX) and total suspended solids (XTSS) control strategy (A 1) better adapts the system to influent dynamics, improves phosphate (SPO 4) accumulation by phosphorus accumulating organisms (XPAO) (41 %), increases nitrification/denitrification efficiency (18 %) and reduces aeration energy (Eaeration) (21 %). The addition of iron XFeCl 3) for chemical P removal (A 2) promotes the formation of ferric oxides (XHFO−H, XHFO−L), phosphate adsorption (XHFO−H,P, XHFO−L,P), co-precipitation (XHFO−H,P,old, XHFO−L,P,old) and consequently reduces the P levels in the effluent (from 2. 8 to 0. 9 g P. m− 3). This also has an impact on the sludge line, with hydrogen sulfide production (GH 2 S) reduced (36 %) due to iron sulfide (XFeS) precipitation. As a consequence, there is also a slightly higher energy production (Eproduction) from biogas. Lastly, the inclusion of a stripping and crystallization unit (A 3) for P recovery reduces the quantity of P in the anaerobic <b>digester</b> <b>supernatant</b> returning to the water line and allows potential struvite (XMgNH 4 PO 4) recovery ranging from 69 to 227 kg. day− 1 depending on: (1) airflow (Qstripping); and, (2) magnesium (QMg(OH) 2) addition.
