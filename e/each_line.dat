5|$|As {{regards the}} line of battle, we are given a little {{information}} by Ammianus. He reports that the right flanks of <b>each</b> <b>line,</b> front and reserve, were held by two auxilia regiments and {{the centre of the}} reserve line was held by the Primani legion. A possible order of battle that fits the available evidence is shown in the diagram of the battle.|$|E
5|$|BART {{has five}} rapid transit lines; most of each line's length {{is on track}} shared with other lines. Trains on <b>each</b> <b>line</b> run every 15 minutes on weekdays and 20 minutes during evenings, {{weekends}} and holidays; stations on the section of track between Daly City and West Oakland are served by four lines and therefore see 16 trains an hour on each track.|$|E

5|$|In {{more recent}} years, Line A and Line B have been {{extended}} westwards, adding {{a total of}} 4 stations to <b>each</b> <b>line</b> between 2003 and 2013. During the same period, Line H was opened 2007, making it the first completely new line on the underground since Line E, excluding the Premetro. There have also been significant modernisations of infrastructure, signalling systems, stations and the network's rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|Months later, André 3000 {{worked with}} Pete Novak at the Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles. André improvised the lyrics {{based on a}} {{screenplay}} he had written. They experimented with various sound effects, including singing through a vocoder, and did 30 to 40 takes for <b>each</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with {{the direction of a}} celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with <b>each</b> <b>line</b> representing a fixed declination).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BART stated its {{intention}} to improve non-peak (night and weekend) headways for <b>each</b> <b>line</b> to 15 minutes. The current 20-minute headways at these times is a barrier to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position stating that the shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed {{the implementation of the}} plan by January 2008. Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Metrical rhythm {{generally}} involves precise {{arrangements of}} stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse {{the pattern of}} stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in <b>each</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Debates {{may also}} be done while singing. Batangueños are known for the duplo (a sung debate where <b>each</b> <b>lines</b> of the verse must be octosyllabic) and the karagatan (a sung debate where <b>each</b> <b>lines</b> of the verse must be dodecasyllabic.) The latter, whose literal meaning is [...] "ocean", got {{its name from the}} opening lines. Always, the karagatan is opened by saying some verses that alludes the depth of the sea and {{comparing}} it to the difficulty of joining the debate. And as mentioned above, the debate must be sung.|$|R

5|$|The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a {{flat file}} {{plaintext}} format to represent and store data which is typically {{referred to as}} EMBL-Bank format. EMBL-Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as taxonomies {{as defined by the}} NCBI Taxon database. <b>Each</b> <b>line</b> of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as AC to label the accession number and KW for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with //.|$|E
5|$|The GO system {{map shows}} seven train lines (or corridors), all departing from Toronto's Union Station and mostly named {{respectively}} after the outer terminus of train service. Although colours are assigned in a consistent fashion to <b>each</b> <b>line</b> in all official media, in colloquial parlance lines are only ever {{referred to by}} their names. Buses are numbered in blocks of 10, corresponding to the nearest train line, with the 40s and 50s reserved for express services along the 407 ETR corridor which {{does not have a}} corresponding train line.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of the Zhou yi is the hexagram (卦 guà), a figure {{composed}} of six stacked horizontal lines (爻 yáo). <b>Each</b> <b>line</b> is either broken or unbroken. The received text of the Zhou yi contains all 64 possible hexagrams, along with the hexagram's name (卦名 guàmíng), a short hexagram statement (彖 tuàn), and six line statements (爻辭 yáocí). The statements {{were used to determine}} the results of divination, but the reasons for having two different methods of reading the hexagram are not known, and it is not known why hexagram statements would be read over line statements or vice versa.|$|E

5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. <b>Each</b> <b>line</b> of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E
5|$|The first verse of {{the text}} {{is used for the}} opening and final {{sections}} of the aria; the second verse for the middle section. Both verses have an identical rhyming scheme. The form of the verses is based on the style perfected by Metastasio, including the placement of poetic stress. <b>Each</b> <b>line</b> has seven sung syllables; the first two lines of each verse close with the stress on the penultimate syllable (versi piani), the final line of each with stress on the last syllable (verso tronco).|$|E
5|$|The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) {{is a form}} {{of poetry}} common in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Urdu and Bengali poetry. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a refrain {{at the end of the}} second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. <b>Each</b> <b>line</b> has an {{identical}} meter. The ghazal often reflects on a theme of unattainable love or divinity.|$|E

5|$|The {{light rail}} station {{is served by}} lines 17 and 18 of the Oslo Tramway. <b>Each</b> <b>line</b> has a ten-minute headway during the day, with half the {{frequency}} during evenings and in the weekends. Travel time to Rikshospitalet is 2 minutes, while it is 14 minutes to Stortorvet. The service is provided using SL95 trams operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter. Forskningsparken is one of eight transfer points between the tramway and rapid transit systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Roseville Avenue station {{dates back}} to the opening of the Morris & Essex Railroad Station in 1856, when tracks were constructed through the Roseville district of Newark. These tracks went along Sixth and Seventh Avenues, while the original station served the Montclair Branch at a fork along Seventh Avenue and the Morris & Essex main line along Sixth Avenue. The station was designed with two platforms, one along <b>each</b> <b>line,</b> the Morris & Essex first made use of the Montclair Branch property in April 1868 after buying the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The rhyme is {{constructed}} of quatrains in trochaic tetrameter catalectic, (<b>each</b> <b>line</b> {{made up of}} four metrical feet of two syllables, with the stress falling on the first syllable in a pair; the last foot in the line missing the unstressed syllable), which is common in nursery rhymes. In its most common form it relies on a double repetition, rather than a rhyming scheme, which is a frequently employed device in children's rhymes and stories. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 502.|$|E
