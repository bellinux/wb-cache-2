(9.c3!? and Black is only {{slightly}} better; Gligorić) dxe5 10.dxe5 Na6! 11.0-0 Nc5, Fischer had the upper hand (Bagirov). The game swung one way, then another, and was finally adjourned at move 42 with Fischer having an edge in a sharp position but no clear win. The Soviet team's analysis convinced them that the position was drawn. Fischer stayed up until 8 a.m. the following morning analyzing it (the resumption being at 2:30p.m.). He had not found a win either. Amazingly, he managed to set traps for Spassky, who fell into them and lost. Spassky's seconds were stunned, and Spassky himself refused to leave the board {{for a long time}} after the game was over, unable to believe the result. He remarked, [...] "It is very strange. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>one</b> lose with the opponent's only rook locked in completely at g8?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1909 Merezhkovsky {{found himself}} in the center of another {{controversy}} after coming out with harsh criticism of Vekhi, the volume of political and philosophical essays written and compiled by the group of influential writers, mostly his former friends and allies, who promoted their work as a manifesto, aiming to incite the inert Russian intelligentsia into the spiritual revival. Arguing against vekhovtsys idea of bringing Orthodoxy and the Russian intellectual elite together, Merezhkovsky wrote in an open letter to Nikolay Berdyaev:Orthodoxy is the very soul of the Russian monarchy, and monarchy is the Orthodoxy's carcass. Among things they both hold sacred are political repressions, the [...] Union of Russian People, the death penalty and meddling with other countries' international affairs. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>one</b> entrust oneself to prayers of those whose actions one sees as God-less and demonic? ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{immediate}} question was <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>one</b> be sure there aren't infinitely many cuts necessary? Otherwise the cutting might progress forever. Perelman proved this can't happen by using minimal surfaces on the manifold. A minimal surface {{is essentially a}} soap film. Hamilton had shown that the area of a minimal surface decreases as the manifold undergoes Ricci flow. [...] Perelman verified {{what happened to the}} area of the minimal surface when the manifold was sliced. [...] He proved that eventually the area is so small that any cut after the area is that small can only be chopping off three-dimensional spheres and not more complicated pieces. This is described as a battle with a Hydra by Sormani in Szpiro's book cited below. This last part of the proof appeared in Perelman's third and final paper on the subject.|$|E
2500|$|Popular {{literature}} often misrepresents Zeno's arguments. For example, Zeno {{is often}} said to {{have argued that the}} sum of an infinite number of terms must itself be infinite–with the result that not only the time, but also the distance to be travelled, become infinite. [...] However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series. Simplicius has Zeno saying [...] "it is impossible to traverse an infinite number of things in a finite time". This presents Zeno's problem not with finding the sum, but rather with finishing a task with an infinite number of steps: <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>one</b> ever get from A to B, if an infinite number of (non-instantaneous) events can be identified that need to precede the arrival at B, and one cannot reach even the beginning of a [...] "last event"? ...|$|E

[...] Incredibly, Flagstad sang the role of Isolde 70 times on the Met stage from 1935 to 1941, making Tristan und Isolde {{one of the greatest}} box office attractions in Metropolitan Opera history.

2500|$|There {{had been}} much {{discussion}} in Denmark about the pseudonymous authors until the publication of Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, 27 February 1846, where he openly admitted to be {{the author of the}} books because people began wondering if he was, in fact, a Christian or not. Several Journal entries from that year shed some light on what Kierkegaard hoped to achieve. This book was published under an earlier pseudonym, Johannes Climacus. On 30 March 1846 he published , under his own name. A critique of the novel Two Ages (in some translations Two Generations) written by Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd, Kierkegaard made several insightful observations on what he considered the nature of modernity and its passionless attitude towards life. Kierkegaard writes that [...] "the present age is essentially a sensible age, devoid of passion ... The trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality, so that in all classes about so and so many uniformly make one individual". In this, Kierkegaard attacked the conformity and assimilation of individuals into [...] "the crowd" [...] which became the standard for truth, since it was the numerical. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>one</b> love the neighbor if the neighbor is always regarded as the wealthy or the poor or the lame? ...|$|E
