5|$|Villages {{were usually}} {{concentrated}} around irrigation reservoirs to enable {{easy access to}} water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between {{the water and the}} paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production. A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, shift crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial watercourse often took the place of the reservoir. <b>Inland</b> <b>fishing</b> was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.|$|E
25|$|The Yup'ik, {{like other}} Eskimo groups, were {{semi-nomadic}} hunter-fisher-gatherers who moved seasonally {{throughout the year}} within a reasonably well-defined territory to harvest fish, bird, sea and land mammal, berry and other renewable resources. Subsistence is the practice of hunting, fishing, or gathering food to live on (not to resell), and is practiced by almost all the Yup'ik. In the <b>inland,</b> <b>fishing</b> for red salmon and gathering berries in the summer as well as hunting caribou or moose {{in the fall and}} winter constitute the primary seasonal subsistence activities of the inland Yup'ik villages.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{inland water}} is the {{landlocked}} Caspian Sea. The biggest lakes are Baikal (23,000km²), Ladoga (19,100km²) and Onega (9,700km²). Russia has more than 2 million rivers, the largest of which are, in order, Severnaya Dvina, Pechora, Dnieper, Volga, Ob’, Don, Yenisei, Lena, Kolyma, Indigirka and Amur. The most important <b>inland</b> <b>fishing</b> area is the Ob’–Irtysh River Basin (about 27 percent). Sixty species {{are caught in the}} inland fisheries of Russia. In volume terms, whitefish (Coregonidae), cyprinids, zanders and perch are most important. Set nets are the most common gear used in inland water commercial fisheries. Seines are also used on big rivers and lakes, and small trawls on the big lakes. In 2005, the official catch in the inland waters was 72,000 tonnes.|$|E

25|$|Dairy {{farming is}} fairly well developed. Also {{there is a}} {{chilling}} plant in the city. Kollam is an important maritime and port city of the state. Fishing has a prominent place in {{the economy of the}} district. Neendakara and Sakthikulangara villages in the suburbs of the city have thriving fisheries. An estimated 134,973 persons are engaged in fishing and allied activities. Cheriazheekkal, Alappad, Pandarathuruthu, Puthenthura, Neendakara, Thangasseri, Eravipuram and Paravur are eight of the 26 important fishing villages. There are 24 <b>inland</b> <b>fishing</b> villages also. Recognizing the unique location and infrastructure available, the Government has initiated steps for establishing a fishing harbour at Neendakara which is expected to increase fish production by 15%. Average fish landing is estimated at 85,275 tonnes per year. One-third of the state's fish catch is from Kollam. Nearly 3000 mechanised boats are operating from the fishing harbour. FFDA and VFFDA promote fresh water fish culture and prawn farming respectively. A model fishing village with 100 houses is being built at Eravipuram. A model prawn farm is being built at Ayiramthengu, and several new hatcheries are also planned to cater {{to the needs of the}} aquaculturists.

The floodplains in turn are surrounded by low hills, covered with evergreen seasonal tropical forest with substantial dipterocarp vegetation or deciduous dry forest.

40|$|Technical {{factors related}} to the {{rejection}} of <b>Inland</b> <b>fish</b> farming in the West and North-West provinces of Cameroon. A basic assumption of "adoption diffusion theory" is that once an adaptor accepts a new idea, he/she will continue to use the innovation on a continuous basis. However, results obtained from data on <b>inland</b> <b>fish</b> culture in the North-West and Western Provinces of Cameroon cast doubts on the universal tenability of this assumption. From the study, {{it was observed that}} <b>inland</b> <b>fish</b> culture, an innovation, was abandonned after initial adoption by farmers. Several reasons were given by farmers for discontinuance : unprofitability of the activity, ignorance of pond maintenance techniques, lack of time to care for the fish, and inadequate access to reliable extension services.

40|$|VHS {{disease is}} a viral disease that spreads only between {{susceptible}} fish species and creates difficulties for fish farming in Finland. The disease results in high mortality especially among cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), but it can spread to several other fish species. VHS disease was found {{for the first time in}} Finland at the beginning of the 21 st century in fish farms in Åland and the Pyhtää area. Later on, the disease was also found in the Uusikaupunki-Rauma-Pyhäranta region on one farm. In this project, we have studied and described the operational connections in aquaculture in the year 2005, which could be expected to induce the spread of VHS disease to <b>inland</b> <b>fish</b> farms.

40|$|To date, {{there are}} few {{comprehensive}} assessments of how climate change affects inland finfish, fisheries, and aquaculture at a global scale, but one is necessary to identify research needs and commonalities across regions and to help guide decision making and funding priorities. Broadly, the consequences of climate change on <b>inland</b> <b>fishes</b> will impact global food security, the livelihoods of people who depend on inland capture and recreational fisheries. However, understanding how climate change will affect <b>inland</b> <b>fishes</b> and fisheries has lagged behind marine assessments. Building from a North American inland fisheries assessment, we convened an expert panel from seven countries to provide a first-step to a framework for determining how to approach an assessment of how climate change may affect <b>inland</b> <b>fishes,</b> capture fisheries, and aquaculture globally. Starting with the small group helped frame the key questions (e. g., who is the audience? What is the best approach and spatial scale?). Data gaps identified by the group include: the tolerances of inland fisheries to changes in temperature, stream flows, salinity, and other environmental factors linked to climate change, and the adaptive capacity of fishes and fisheries to adjust to these changes. These questions are difficult to address, but long-term and large-scale datasets are becoming more readily available {{as a means to}} test hypotheses related to climate change.
