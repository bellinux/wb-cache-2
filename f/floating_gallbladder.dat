30|$|Albeit exceptional, {{gallbladder}} torsion {{should be}} considered in acute complicated cholecystitis with abnormal imaging findings (herniation, twisted pedicles or <b>floating</b> <b>gallbladder).</b> Ultrasonography and CT-scan may be helpful to perform the correct diagnosis before surgical management.|$|E
40|$|A case of torsion of the {{gallbladder}} is reported. A 74 -year-old woman　presented with {{a complaint}} of sudden right hypochondralgia. Physical examination on admission revealed a distended abdomen with nausea, vomiting and fever. The patient was not jaundiced and her spine was kyphotic. A sonogram showed gangrenous cholecystitis with a gallbladder stone. We administered antibiotics, however her general condition did not improve. On the 7 th day of hospitalization an operation was performed. At surgery, an enlarged necrotic gallbladder was found which had rotated 360 ° in a clockwise direction. Cholecystectomy {{was carried out}} with an uneventful postoperative recovery. Kyphosis and the gallbladder stone have been suggested as predisposing causes of torsion in addition to <b>floating</b> <b>gallbladder.</b> When torsion of the gallbladder is suspected, early laparotomy is mandatory...|$|E
40|$|Torsion of the {{gallbladder}} {{is a rare}} {{entity that}} is difficult to diagnose preoperatively. The condition occurs most often in the elderly. Although its etiology is unknown, a constant finding is the presence of the gallbladder on a mobile mesentery (<b>floating</b> <b>gallbladder).</b> Torsion, or volvulus, of the gallbladder occurs when it twists axially, with the subsequent occlusion of bile and/or blood flow. Herein, a case of torsion of the gallbladder is presented where preoperative computed tomographic scan and laparoscopy were successfully used to diagnose and treat this condition without the usual requirement of open exploration. Given the possibility of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the increasing incidence with which torsion of the gallbladder is being witnessed today, the importance of a preoperative computed tomographic scan is emphasized when there is a high index of clinical suspicion.

40|$|Introduction: Gallbladder torsion {{is mainly}} {{associated}} with a <b>floating</b> <b>gallbladder.</b> From an anatomical perspective, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a more optimal treatment than open cholecystectomy. Presentation of case: An 84 -year-old woman visited the Onomichi General Hospital because of progressive pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. Physical examination revealed a positive Murphy sign and peritoneal irritation. Laboratory data demonstrated that inflammatory marker levels were increased. Abdominal ultrasonography showed that blood flow in the cystic artery was reduced and the gallbladder was swollen. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computerized tomography indicated that the swollen gallbladder was modestly enhanced and the fundus was displaced under the midline and detached from the gallbladder bed. The cystic duct was twisted. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed that {{the root of the}} cystic duct was unclear and the extrahepatic bile duct had V-shaped distortion. The gallbladder neck showed a tapering interruption with the common biliary duct. We made a preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder torsion. Accordingly, emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The intraoperative findings included a dark swollen gallbladder that was twisted in the counterclockwise direction. The patient was discharged without any postoperative complications on day 7. Discussion: Combined acute onset of abdominal pain with characteristic radiological findings made it possible to precisely diagnose gallbladder torsion. Conclusion: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be the gold standard treatment for gallbladder torsion after a preoperative diagnosis is made...|$|E
