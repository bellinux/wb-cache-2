5|$|Chamberlain {{was made}} {{chairman}} of the Town Planning Committee. Under Chamberlain's direction Birmingham soon adopted {{one of the first}} town planning schemes in Britain. The start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother Richard Chamberlain, William and George Kenrick, Charles Beale, who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Willis, {{with his}} {{business}} partner Arnold Rifkin, started a motion picture production company called Cheyenne Enterprises. He left the company to be run solely by Rifkin in 2007 after Live Free or Die <b>Hard.</b> <b>He</b> also owns several small businesses in Hailey, Idaho, including The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater and is a co-founder of Planet Hollywood, with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. In 2009, Willis signed a contract to become the international face of Belvedere SA's Sobieski Vodka in exchange for 3.3% ownership in the company.|$|E
5|$|Willis had {{his first}} lead role in a feature film in the 1987 Blake Edwards film Blind Date, with Kim Basinger and John Larroquette. Edwards cast him again to play the real-life cowboy actor Tom Mix in Sunset (1988). However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the film Die Hard (1988) as John McClane that catapulted him to movie star and action hero status. He {{performed}} most of his own stunts in the film, and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide. Following his success with Die <b>Hard,</b> <b>he</b> had {{a leading role in}} the drama In Country as Vietnam veteran Emmett Smith and also provided the voice for a talking baby in Look Who's Talking, as well as its sequel, Look Who's Talking Too.|$|E

5|$|Season two {{begins with}} Coach Taylor {{living and working}} in Austin as an {{assistant}} coach at fictional TMU, while wife Tami remains in Dillon with daughter Julie and newborn baby Gracie. Tami is struggling with the demands of the new baby and Julie's rebellious behavior. The Panthers' new coach, Bill McGregor, creates friction between Smash and Matt by showing blatant favoritism to Smash, drives Tim so <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> passes out during practice from dehydration and is hospitalized, alienates assistant coach Jason Street by his condescending manner, and alienates Boosters president Buddy Garrity by barring him from team practices. When Smash and Matt actually come to blows on the field and a crucial game is won by Smash, Buddy engineers the firing of the new coach and persuades Taylor that both the team and his family are suffering in his absence. Taylor agrees to return.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Chamberlain became {{deeply involved in the}} war effort. In addition to his duties as councillor, Chamberlain helped recruit men for the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and set up funds for injured soldiers. Late in 1914, he became an alderman of Birmingham, and the following year, became Lord Mayor. Chamberlain's biographer, Robert Self, suggested that as Joseph Chamberlain had died the previous year, the honour was due to Neville Chamberlain's hard work rather than to any family influence. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a tremendous burden of work, and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> set up crèches for workers, stockpiled coal to be distributed to the poor at cost in time of shortage, and reinvigorated Birmingham's various committees, which were ineffective and engaged in wasteful rivalries. He also chaired the local committee evaluating exemptions from conscription, and stated that he was more lenient than were other members of the tribunal. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance, and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E
5|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via radio {{that he was}} losing rear grip in his tyres after pushing <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers had taken their pit stops. The running order was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions in which they had qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an hydraulic failure, becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed suit on the following lap, after Kovalainen's power steering failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.|$|E

5|$|Hammond {{was posted}} to a {{training}} {{wing of the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) at Hastings in Sussex before he moved with his unit to Torquay. He had mainly administrative duties, including instructing recruits, for whom he made life <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> played some games of cricket in 1940 for various teams before being posted to Cairo in December. His responsibilities in Egypt included organising, promoting and playing in cricket matches. Posted there until 1943, {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant and then to squadron leader. While Hammond may have helped to raise morale, Cairo was an easy posting during the war and he was not involved directly in combat. He also spent much time in South Africa, where he played cricket and was reunited with Sybil Ness-Harvey. At the beginning of 1944, Hammond was posted back to England, where he lectured and drilled cadets. Playing as captain in many one-day cricket matches, he was praised by Wisden for encouraging exciting contests. Others applauded his batting, including his hitting of many sixes, fitting the games' relaxed atmosphere. In December 1944, Hammond, suffering from fibrositis, was discharged from the RAFVR on health grounds and returned to work at Marsham Tyres. Once the war ended in Europe in May 1945, several first-class matches were organised. Hammond played in six, scoring 592 runs at an average of 59.20 with two centuries. In a match for an England team against the Dominions at Lord's, he made a century in each innings, becoming the first man to do this seven times.|$|E
25|$|Brock {{remained}} {{best known}} for base-stealing and starting Cardinals rallies. He {{was said to have}} disdained Maury Wills' method of base-stealing, instead shortening his leads and going <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> was also an early student of game films. He used an 8mm movie camera from the dugout to film opposing pitchers and study their windups and pickoff moves to detect weaknesses he could exploit.|$|E
25|$|There {{was more}} action as both Ukyo Katayama and then Rubens Barrichello passed Wendlinger {{to get into}} the points. Both then stopped, with Barrichello getting ahead. Senna had reduced the gap to Schumacher to 5 seconds, but then spun off on lap 56, just pushing too <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> was out. Schumacher won ahead of Hill, Alesi, Barrichello, Katayama and Wendlinger.|$|E
60|$|He was in {{a perfect}} panic of fear. He quite lost his head, did Whitefoot. The <b>harder</b> <b>he</b> struggled, the more tired he became, and the greater was his danger of drowning.|$|R

25|$|Brumowski {{took the}} {{dissolution}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire very <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> indulged in hazardous pursuits, seeking the thrill of danger by racing automobiles about on the poor local roads, riding horses into exhaustion, hunting in the mountains. He threw parties, danced, swam, ice skated to distract himself. He finally left his wife and daughter and began a flying school in Vienna in 1930, and remarried.|$|E
25|$|Die Fliegertruppen reorganized {{into the}} Luftstreitkräfte (German Air Force) on 8 October. Jagdstaffel 14 was newly formed when Berthold took command. It was {{equipped}} with two Fokker E.IIIs, a Halberstadt D.II, and seven Fokker D.IIs, and had no success {{when it was still}} the ad hoc Fokker Kampstaffel Falkenhausen. Berthold took advantage of being in a quiet sector, and trained his troops <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> brought in new Albatros D.I and Albatros D.II replacement aircraft, and renovated the officers' mess. In mid-December, just after the unit's first victory, they were visited on an inspection tour by Kaiser Wilhelm II and Crown Prince Wilhelm.|$|E
25|$|A huge man, {{standing}} {{well over}} six feet tall and weighing more than 16 stone (102kg), Thompson was an excellent all-rounder. Despite his huge frame, his batting relied chiefly on a very watchful eye that made him a very hard man to dismiss when pitches were hard and firm. Though at times he would hit very <b>hard,</b> <b>he</b> had very little backlift and could play only a restricted range of strokes, and his size made him rather slow of foot and hence seldom likely to make many runs on the numerous rain-affected pitches of his day. As a bowler, he was above medium pace and could gain a great deal of spin, which made him respected when pitches were hard and frequently unplayable after rain or on a crumbling pitch. His large hands and long reach made him an excellent fieldsman at slip: in 1914 he achieved the unequalled feat of taking three catches off consecutive balls against Warwickshire.|$|E

25|$|Federline {{appeared}} on WWE programming {{to promote his}} album, Playing with Fire, and participate in an angle. He first {{appeared on}} the October 16, 2006, and October 23, 2006, editions of WWE Raw, in which he got into physical altercations with WWE Champion John Cena. The following week, {{he came to the}} ring to aid Johnny Nitro in his match against John Cena. After Cena got in Federline's face, Federline slapped him <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> appeared again during the November 5, 2006, pay-per-view event Cyber Sunday, hitting Cena with King Booker's World Heavyweight Championship belt and helping Booker win the Champion of Champions match that was organized between Cena, Booker, and Big Show. The next night, November 6, 2006, he challenged Cena to a match at the New Year's Day edition of Raw, which Cena accepted. He went on to win this no-disqualification match thanks to interference from Johnny Nitro and Umaga. Later in the night, after John Cena's main event match, Cena went after Federline and brought him into the ring and delivered his FU finishing move twice before cameras stopped rolling.|$|E
25|$|Fr. Giovanni Zucca from Murialdo, who {{was then}} the {{chaplain}} at Murialdo when Dominic was five years old, notes in a statement to John Bosco that he came to notice Dominic due to his regular church attendance with his mother, and his habit of kneeling down outside the church to pray (even in the mud or snow) if he happened to come to Church before it had been unlocked in the morning. The chaplain also notes that Savio made good progress at the village school not merely due to his cleverness, but also by working <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> would not join the other boys in doing something that he believed to be morally wrong and would explain why he thought a particular deed was wrong. At the age of five, he learned to serve Mass, and would try to participate at Mass every day as well as go regularly to Confession. Having been permitted to make his First Communion at an early age, he had much reverence for the Eucharist.|$|E

50|$|Alison Eavis Harding Frew {{was born}} in 1883 in Roma, Queensland, the son of Robert Dickson Alison Frew (a civil engineer) and his wife Elizabeth Constance (née <b>Harding).</b> <b>He</b> was educated at Brisbane Grammar School and University of Sydney.|$|R
50|$|On 2 October 2011 {{he joined}} Gloucester City on loan, along with {{teammate}} Mitch <b>Harding.</b> <b>He</b> scored his first goal on his debut {{for the club}} on 2 October 2012, in a 5-1 win at home against Bishop's Stortford.|$|R
500|$|During an interview, Ryan O'Neal {{recalled}} Kubrick's directing style: [...] "God, {{he works}} you <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, {{but above all}} he teaches you {{the value of a}} good director. Stanley brought out aspects of my personality and acting instincts that had been dormant... My strong suspicion [...] that I was involved in something great". He further added that working with Kubrick was [...] "a stunning experience" [...] and that he never recovered from working with somebody of such magnificence.|$|E
500|$|In 1870 Ge again {{returned}} to Saint Petersburg there {{he turned to}} Russian history for subject matter. The painting [...] (1871) was a great success, but other historical paintings were met without interest. Ge took the cold response to his work very <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> wrote that a man should live by doing agricultural work, and the art should not be for sale. He bought a small khutor (farm) in Chernigov gubernia (currently Ukraine) and moved there. He became acquainted with Leo Tolstoy and became an enthusiastic follower of his philosophy.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, space science became a topical field of {{research}} {{in the wake of the}} launch of Sputnik I. Urey helped persuade NASA to make unmanned probes to a moon a priority. When Apollo 11 returned moon rock samples from the moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. The samples supported Urey's contention that the moon and the Earth shared a common origin. While at UCSD, Urey published 105 scientific papers, 47 of them about lunar topics. When asked why he continued to work so <b>hard,</b> <b>he</b> joked, [...] "Well, you know I’m not on tenure anymore." ...|$|E
