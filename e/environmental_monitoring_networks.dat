40|$|The {{quality of}} {{environmental}} data analysis and propagation of errors are heavily {{affected by the}} representativity of the initial sampling design [CRE 93, DEU 97, KAN 04 a, LEN 06, MUL 07]. Geostatistical methods such as kriging are related to field samples, whose spatial distribution is crucial for the correct detection of the phenomena. Literature about the design of <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>networks</b> (MN) is widespread and several interesting books have recently been published [GRU 06, LEN 06, MUL 07] in order to clarify {{the basic principles of}} spatial sampling design (monitoring networks optimization) based on Support Vector Machines was proposed. Nonetheless, modelers often receive real data coming from <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>networks</b> that suffer from problems of non-homogenity (clustering).

40|$|Changes in {{the natural}} {{environment}} affect our quality of life. Thus, government, industry, and the public call for integrated environmental management systems capable of supplying all parties with validated, accurate and timely information. The `near real-time' constraint reveals two critical problems in delivering such tasks: the low quality or absence of data, and the changing conditions over a long period.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a method to}} optimize the sampling design of <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>networks</b> in a multi-objective setting. We optimize the permanent network of radiation monitoring stations in the Netherlands and parts of Germany as an example. The optimization method proposed combines minimization of prediction error under routine conditions with maximizing calamity detection capability in emergency cases. To calculate calamity detection capability, an atmospheric dispersion model was used to simulate potentially harmful radioactive releases. For each candidate monitoring network, we determined if the releases were detected within one, two and three hours. Four types of accidents were simulated: small and large nuclear power plant accidents, deliberate radioactive releases using explosive devices, and accidents involving the transport of radioactive materials. Spatial simulated annealing (SSA) was used {{to search for the}} optimal monitoring design. SSA was implemented by iteratively moving stations around and accepting all designs that improved a weighted sum of average spatial prediction error and calamity detection capability. Designs that worsened the multi-objective criterion were accepted with a certain probability, which decreased to zero as iterations proceeded. Results were promising and the method should prove useful for assessing the efficacy of <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>networks</b> designed to monitor both routine and emergency conditions in other applications as well...|$|E

30|$|The VDI Guideline 4330 Part 1 [2], the German Federal Nature Protection Law (Section 6 of the Bundesnaturschutzgesetz), the {{environmental}} monitoring {{concept of the}} Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety [42] {{as well as the}} preamble of the administrative agreement between the German government and the federal states on the exchange of environmental data specify the following targets that should be complied with when carrying out environmental monitoring: The monitoring should be coordinated and based on harmonised or standardised methods [43] so that the data can be compared and used for statistical analysis and modelling. The monitoring data should allow for spatial extrapolation in order to bridge geographical gaps and for supporting long-term research on environmental changes. The flow of data should be efficient, and the data should be available for scientists, especially for statistical testing of hypotheses and modelling data. The latter aspect also implies important technical issues because of the enormous amount of information and data collected. For example, <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>networks</b> require information exchange, which has to be supported by an adequate and efficient information platform that handles documentation and exchange of metadata (site descriptions, quality control data), measuring data and geodata. An appropriate tool to achieve these goals is the implementation of a web-based GIS that contains relevant geodata and offers tools for integration of information of related <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>networks</b> and tools for data analysis. Such information platforms help in reducing GMP EM costs and enable data and information exchange between different stakeholders, involving farmers, legal authorities and the public.|$|E
