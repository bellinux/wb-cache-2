40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{production}} control of a manufacturing system with time-delay, demand uncertainty and extra capacity. Time-delay is a typical feature of networked manufacturing systems (NMS), because an NMS is composed of many manufacturing systems with transportation channels among them and the transportation of materials needs time. Besides this, for a manufacturing system in an NMS, {{the uncertainty of the}} demand from its downstream manufacturing system is considered; and it is assumed that there exist two-levels of <b>demand</b> <b>rates,</b> i. e., the normal one and the higher one, and that the time between the switching of <b>demand</b> <b>rates</b> are exponentially distributed. To avoid the backlog of demands, it is also assumed that extra production capacity can be used when the work-in-process (WIP) cannot buffer the high-level <b>demands</b> <b>rate.</b> For such a manufacturing system with time-delay, demand uncertainty and extra capacity, the mathematical model for its production control problem is established, with the objective of minimizing the mean costs for WIP inventory and occupation of extra production capacity. To solve the problem, a two-level hedging point policy is proposed. By analyzing the probability distribution of system states, optimal values of the two hedging levels are obtained. Finally, numerical experiments are done to verify the effectiveness of the control policy and the optimality of the hedging levels. © 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{capacity}} investment decision for make-to-order manufacturing firms that utilize a fixed capacity, {{operate in a}} stochastic, stationary market, and can influence their <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> by increasing or decreasing their sales effort. We consider manufacturing situations that differ in sales contribution, in market elasticity to sales effort, work-in-process costs, and demand sensitivity to lead time. If demand is insensitive to lead time we find that for situations with a low sales contribution and high work-in-process costs (for example the manufacturing of capacity equipment {{that is at the}} end of the innovative life cycle, such as food processing machines and textile printing machines), using a dynamic <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> policy can bring substantial improvements in profit. Moreover, when using the optimal <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> policy, the profit is quite insensitive to the initial capacity investment. If demand is sensitive to lead time, using a dynamic <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> policy brings substantial increases in profit in all situations considered. The profit again is quite insensitive to the initial capacity investment. Consequently, without much loss in profit, for all cases the capacity investment decision can be based on the stochastic model with stationary demand, neglecting the possibility of influencing the <b>demand</b> <b>rate.</b> However, the profit that results from this investment, and the return-on-investment, should be determined from a model that includes the optimal <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> policy, since the stationary stochastic model can significantly underestimate the profit and could lead to the abandonment of the investment...|$|E
30|$|In {{classical}} inventory models, {{the demand}} whether deterministic or stochastic was often {{treated as an}} exogenous variable, without considering the effect of operating strategy. However, marketing practitioners and researchers have noticed that in many practical cases the <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the stock quantity displayed in the store {{as well as the}} sales price. Generally, <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> decreases with sales price yet increases with the stock quantity on display. In recent decades, extensive literature has focused on this phenomenon that <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the stock quantity displayed in the store. Levin et al. [1] observed that large piles of consumer goods displayed in a supermarket would lead consumers to buy more. Gupta and Vrat [2] first set up a model to look into this phenomenon where it was assumed that the <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> was a function of initial stock level. Baker and Urban [3] developed an economic order quantity (EOQ) model with a power-form inventory-level-dependent <b>demand</b> <b>rate,</b> decreasing with the inventory level throughout the sales period. Datta and Pal [4] extended the model developed by Baker and Urban [3] {{on the basis of a}} hypothesis that the <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> was dependent on the inventory level until a given level, beyond which it was a constant and the inventory level fell to zero at the end of the order period. Later, Urban [5] modified this model by relaxing the condition of zero-ending inventory. Ray et al. [6] developed an inventory model by assuming that the <b>demand</b> <b>rate</b> was stock dependent and two separate warehouses were used. When the stock level exceeded the capacity [5] gave a comprehensive review of the literature with inventory-level-dependent demand. Recently, Glock et al. [7] have published an optimal ordering policy for stock-dependent demand under progressive payment scheme. Some interesting results about the inventory-level-dependent demand were proposed in [8 – 15] and so on.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{key issue}} {{in the design of}} a {{cellular}} manufacturing system is the formation of the machines and parts into groups or production cells. The production cells are designed to minimize the costs of inter-cell part movements and intra-cell processing, while balancing the workload within each cell. Most of the prior research represents the cell formation problem as a binary machine-part incidence matrix. The workload balance within each production cell may be precisely calculated only if the processing times and <b>demand</b> <b>rates</b> are included in the analysis. For this reason, a heuristic-based procedure that uses processing times and <b>demand</b> <b>rates</b> to form the production cells is proposed. The procedure considers the cell imbalance costs as well as the costs associated with the inter-cell part movements and intra-cell processing. The efficiency and effectiveness of the heuristic is compared to other methods, and an industrial application of the proposed heuristic is presented...|$|R
