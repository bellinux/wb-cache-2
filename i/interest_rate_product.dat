40|$|We {{introduce}} a tractable multicurrency model with stochastic volatility and correlated stochastic interest rates {{that takes into}} account the smile in the foreign exchange (FX) market and the evolution of yield curves. The pricing of vanilla options on FX rates can be efficiently performed through the FFT methodology thanks to the affine property of the model. Our framework is also able to describe many nontrivial links between FX rates and interest rates: a calibration exercise highlights the ability of the model to simultaneously fit FX implied volatilities while being coherent with <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E

The method, which is based on a Monte Carlo procedure for standard Bermudans recently developed and further extended in Kolodko and Schoenmakers [8], Bender and Schoenmakers [2], is compared to and also combined with popular known approaches by Andersen [1], Longstaff and Schwartz [9], and Piterbarg [10].

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The cap option (caption) is one {{of common}} European exotic options {{discussed}} in literature. This (interest rates) exotic option has no closed form solution and its accurate pricing and hedging in a volatile market is a challenge for traders. The {{reason for this is}} that, comparatively, the behaviour on an individual interest rate is more complex than that of a stock price. To price any <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>product,</b> it is essential to develop an interest rates model describing the behaviour of the entire zero coupon yield curve. The equity and yield curve, respectively, relate to the difference in the dynamics of a scalar variable and vector variable. Moreover, captions are second order with respect to the discount bonds in that they are options on caps (which are also options on bonds). These reasons make it of particular interest to study efﬁcient numerical solutions to price captions. Monte Carlo simulation provides a simple method for pricing this option, and a suitable interest rate model to use is the Libor market model. The approach of describing the behaviour of the entire zero coupon yield curve, in the era post the 2007 credit crunch crisis, is what is called a standard single-curve market practice, and Part l of this work is based on it.. After introducing the framework for option pricing in the interest rate market, the theory and implementation procedure for Monte Carlo simulation using Libor market models is described. A detailed analysis of the results is presented together with a sensitivity analysis, and finally suggestions for efﬁcient pricing of captions are given. In Part II we review the recent financial market evolution, triggered by the credit crunch crisis towards double-curve approach. Unfortunately, such a methodology is not easy to build. In practice an empirical approach to price and hedge interest rate derivatives has prevailed in the market. Future cash flows are generated through multiple forwarding yield curves associated to the underlying rate tenors, and their net present value is calculated through discount factors front a single discounting yield curve...|$|E

40|$|The {{crisis that}} {{affected}} financial {{markets in the}} last years leaded market practitioners to revise well known basic concepts like the ones of discount factors and forward rates. A single yield curve is not sufficient any longer to describe the market of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>products.</b> On the other hand, using different yield curves at the same time requires a reformulation of most of the basic assumptions made in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models. In this paper we discuss market evidences that led to the introduction of a series of different yield curves. We then define a HJM framework based on a multi-curve approach, presenting also a bootstrapping algorithm used to fit these different yield curves to market prices of plain-vanilla contracts such as basic <b>Interest</b> <b>Rate</b> Swaps (IRS) and Forward Rate Agreements (FRA). We then show how our approach can be used in practice when pricing other <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>products,</b> such as forward starting IRS, plain-vanilla European Swaptions, Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) and CMS spread options, with the final goal to investigate whether the market is actually using a multi-curve approach or not. We finally present some numerical examples for a simple formulation of the framework which embeds by construction the multi-curve structure; once the model is calibrated to market prices of plain-vanilla options, it can be used via a Monte Carlo simulation to price more complicated exotic options. ...|$|R

Market participants subscribe this aspect to a lack of demand and sophistication of investors within the market. This is, however, expected to change given the influx of international banks into the South African market {{over the past couple of}} years. The current market methodology, for the pricing of vanilla <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> options in the South African market, is the standard Black model with some mechanism to incorporate <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> smiles. This mechanism is typically in the form of the SABR model. The most signi cant drawback of this approach is the fact that it models each forward rate in isolation. Hence, there is no way to incorporate the joint dynamics between different forward rates and consequently cannot be used for the pricing of exotic <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> options. In anticipation of these new market developments, we explore the possibility of calibrating the LIBOR market model to the South African market.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has brought about two key changes to the pricing of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>products</b> in the European fixed income markets. In 2007, the Euribor-EONIA spread widened, which called into {{question}} the use of Euribor rates {{as a proxy for}} the risk-free rate. Nine years later, all of the main Euribor rates had fallen below zero. These changes forced market practitioners to reassess their assumptions, which resulted in the development of new models. The Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) and Brace-Gatarek-Musiela (BGM) frameworks, which had gained popularity before the crisis, have served as a foundation for these models. In this thesis, we present two applications of Malliavin calculus to the pricing of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> derivatives within a multicurve BGM framework. Although the framework simplifies the pricing of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> derivatives, as it takes market rates as primitives, the pricing of exotic <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> derivatives can pose a number of problems. The complexity of these products can lead to situations that require the use of computational techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation. This, in turn, provides an opening for the application of Malliavin calculus. We end this thesis by presenting a Malliavin-based formula for the price and the delta-sensitivity of a snowball, and discuss the merits of these representations in the context of Monte Carlo simulation. With reference to advances within the field during the last 5 years, we discuss the possible developments within the field that might garner further interest towards Malliavin calculus in the near future...|$|R
