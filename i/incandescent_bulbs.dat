5|$|In 2014, the {{hardware}} and software behind the fountain's operation were replaced. At the time there were plans to replace LED lighting with <b>incandescent</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{on each of the}} non-video display surfaces and to replace the video surface LEDs. Plensa, who maintained control of the video faces for {{the first two years of}} the fountain's operation, understands that future generations may wish to update the faces used in the rotation of videos to reflect changes in humanity going forward. In 2014, an additional 1000 faces were anticipated for 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light <b>incandescent</b> <b>bulbs</b> using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E

50|$|In {{comparison}} with <b>incandescent</b> light <b>bulbs,</b> neon lamps have much higher luminous efficacy. Incandescence is heat-driven light emission, so {{a large portion}} of the electric energy put into an <b>incandescent</b> <b>bulb</b> is converted into heat. Non-incandescent light sources such as neon light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs, and light emitting diodes are therefore much more energy efficient than normal <b>incandescent</b> light <b>bulbs.</b> Green neon bulbs can produce up to 65 lumens per watt of power input, while white neon bulbs have an efficacy of around 50 lumens per watt. In contrast, a standard <b>incandescent</b> light <b>bulb</b> only produces around 13.5 lumens per watt.|$|R
25|$|<b>Incandescent</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{are much}} less {{efficient}} than most other types of electric lighting; <b>incandescent</b> <b>bulbs</b> convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb (such as heat lamps) deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. <b>Incandescent</b> <b>bulbs</b> typically have short lifetimes compared {{with other types of}} lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{activities}} defined under PRONUREE is the national program to phase out <b>incandescent</b> <b>bulbs</b> by 2011 in Argentina. The program, financed by the government, aims to replace <b>incandescent</b> <b>bulbs</b> with energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) in all households connected to the electricity grid and selected public buildings. The program, which has initially undergone a pilot phase and expects to replace 5 million incandescent lamps {{in the next six}} months, foresees the distribution of 25 million lamps overall. Staff from the distribution companies will visit each household to replace the incandescent lamps and to inform residential users on the advantages of replacing the bulbs and of the efficient use of energy in general.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian federal {{government}} banned the import {{and sale of}} 75- and 100-watt <b>incandescent</b> <b>bulbs,</b> effective 1 January 2014.
