2500|$|Who You Are {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{anticipated}} releases of 2011, due to Jessie J winning the Critics Choice award at the 2011 BRIT Awards and topping the BBC's Sound of 2011 poll. On Twitter, Jessie J confirmed that it took her 6 years to completely finish the album - it was completed on 19 January 2011. In an interview Jessie J stated that she wrote her first song, [...] "Big White Room", at the age of 17, about when she was in hospital, at 11 years old. A ward mate of hers, a little boy, died. She recalls waking up in the middle of the night and seeing him praying, and her mother explaining that he was having an operation the next day and was asking God to save him. [...] "He died the next day so I said to my mum 'but God didn't save him'. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> and it really confused me. I always wanted to write a song about the experience, but I knew I had to be of an age where it wasn't tacky or depressing and had a lightness to it." [...] She prefers the song with just an acoustic guitar; stripped down and bare.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2004, Moulitsas and Daily Kos {{became the}} focus of {{controversy}} over a statement that he posted in the comments section of a blog post about Blackwater USA employees who were killed and mutilated in Fallujah:"Let the people see what war is like. This isn't an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of merceneries [...] They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry.</b> I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave {{men and women in uniform}} make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay. I was angry that these mercenaries would leave their wives and children behind to enter a war zone on their own violition [...] So I struck back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Then you're a wicked, wicked old man," [...] I said, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that I couldn't help crying, and {{of course}} that made me cough.|$|E
5000|$|Just at {{the moment}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with that infernal little Cuban {{republic}} that I would like to wipe its people {{off the face of}} the earth. All that we wanted from them was that they would behave themselves and be prosperous and happy so that we would not have to interfere. Theodore Roosevelt ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may trust me: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not trying}} to entrap you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with the Yellow Dwarf and the Fairy of the Desert that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not likely to wish to help them, {{especially}} since I constantly see your poor Princess, whose beauty and goodness make me pity her so much; and I tell {{you that if you}} will have confidence in me I will help you to escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it will be}} such a {{bother to}} {{have to talk about}} it. He looks at me, and is such an idiot. Then Augusta frowns. When I see Augusta {{frowning}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that <b>I</b> feel like boxing her ears. Do you know, Lucy, that I often think that it will not do, and that I shall have to <b>be</b> sent away. <b>I</b> wish it had been you that they had chosen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't, {{it was so}} {{embarrassing}} for me. I couldn't help hearing at first, and then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> and ashamed, I didn't remember that I ought to go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Armand brought him," [...] {{said the}} young lady. [...] "I {{think you are}} awfully mean not to let me have that St. Bernard. I sent Armand for Walter. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I had {{had such}} wicked {{feelings}} {{for a long}} while. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry,</b> and I hated Miss Assher so, and I didn't care what came to anybody, because I was so miserable myself. I was full of bad passions. No one else was ever so wicked.' ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know what}} is the matter with me tonight. <b>I</b> have {{positively}} <b>been</b> to bed, without going to sleep! After tossing and twisting and trying all sorts of positions, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with myself that I have got up again. Rather than do nothing, I have opened my ink-bottle, and I mean {{to go on with}} my journal. Now I think of it, {{it seems likely that the}} exhibition of works of art may have upset me.|$|R
6000|$|When bent on exhibiting them, {{nothing could}} exceed Beatrix Bernstein's grace or good-humour. [...] "I can't help loving you, child," [...] she continued, [...] "and yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> {{with you that}} I have scarce the {{patience}} to speak to you. So you have actually engaged yourself to poor Maria, who {{is as old as}} your mother? What will Madam Esmond say? She may live three hundred years, and you will not have wherewithal to support yourselves." ...|$|R
60|$|There farther {{progress}} {{stopped for}} both of us. Cubby had gone down {{on one side of}} a sapling and I on the other, with the result that we were brought up short. I crashed through some low bushes and bumped squarely into the cub. Whether it was his frantic effort to escape, or just excitement, or deliberate intention to beat me into a jelly I had no means to tell. The fact was he began to dig at me and paw me and maul me. Never had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry.</b> <b>I</b> began to fight back, to punch and kick him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would {{you believe}} it, that when that farmer woke {{and found his}} horse shod he rode away without one word of thanks? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that I wheeled his horse right round and walked him back three miles to the Beacon, just to teach the old sinner politeness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} so. And swamped--swamped with her dirty old carrot water. Oh <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry.</b> And {{all she could}} say was, 'Well, I didn't want to waste it!' Didn't want to waste her old carrot water, and so ruined my champignons. Can you imagine such a person?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first person}} I {{met on the}} pier was Rectus. He had had his supper, and had come down to watch for me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that I would not speak to him. He kept by my side, though, as I {{walked up to the}} house, excusing himself for going off and leaving me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} it isn't and never has been. A woman's life is her husband's and her children's, and that's why--but it is no use arguing. You have taken your own line. Perhaps you are right, God knows. At any rate, it isn't mine, so we had better part. Still, I rather admire your courage. I wonder what this young fellow is like for whose sake you are {{prepared}} to lose so much; more than you think, maybe, for I had grown fond of you. Well, good-bye, I'll see about your getting off. There, don't think that I bear malice although <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with you. Write to me {{when you get into}} a tight place," [...] and rising, she kissed her, rather roughly but not without affection, and flung out of the room like one who feared to trust herself there any longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>angry,</b> <b>so</b> {{please leave}} me alone!" [...] And now Dora turned still further away, while {{something}} like tears began to spring into her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dismissal!" [...] he cried, {{holding up}} his hands. [...] "Of course not. Who is talking of dismissal? But I owe a duty to my firm. Such actions as yours, in running away from rehearsals, must have a--a--{{reprimand}}. Not severe; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> as grieved; but a reprimand is your due--and that fly-away sister of yours is just as bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} observing, Monsieur," [...] she said. [...] "That was my uncle, Monsieur de Beausejour. You saw me quarrelling with my brother, Auguste," [...] {{she went on}} a little excitedly. [...] "Oh, I am very much ashamed of it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry.</b> My cousin, Mademoiselle Helene de Saint-Gre, has just sent me from France such a {{beautiful}} miniature, and Auguste {{fell in love with}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so {{aggravated by}} the foolish talk {{among the women}} servants, all {{wondering}} who was to be suspected first; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with you (knowing no better at that time) for the pains you took in hunting for the jewel, and sending for the police, that I kept {{as much as possible}} away by myself, until later in the day, when the officer from Frizinghall came to the house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> myself that, sapperment! I {{did give}} him a tip over the side; but split him! the comical little devil swam like a duck; so I made him swim astern for a mile to teach him manners, and then took him in when he was sinking. By the {{knocking}} Nicholas I he'll plague you, now he's come over the herring-pond! When he was so high he had the spirit of thunder and lightning.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Complex magazine, Cudi {{shed light on the}} song's meaning: [...] "This song is about someone who is fed up with reality, who looks for thrills and excitement by any means. It's just kind of how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> feeling at that point. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just <b>so</b> <b>angry.</b> Doing coke revived me, and knowing <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> close to death every time intrigued me. I liked the thought of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Emmeline! Yes, she had noticed. It {{was very}} sad and wicked! She hinted, {{but would not}} do more than hint, at {{the son of the}} miller, but he was back again, {{fighting}} in France now, and, after all, her evidence amounted to no more than his reputation with girls. Besides, one is very careful what one says in a country village. <b>I,</b> however, <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that <b>I</b> should not have <b>been</b> careful if <b>I</b> could have got hold of anything at all definite.|$|R
6000|$|... 16. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> this noon at Lady Masham's, who {{was just}} come from Kensington, where her eldest son is sick. She said much to me {{of what she had}} talked to the Queen and Lord Treasurer. The poor lady fell a {{shedding}} tears openly. She could not bear to think of my having St. Patrick's, etc. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never more moved than to see so much friendship. I would not stay with her, but went and dined with Dr. Arbuthnot, with Mr. Berkeley, one of your Fellows, whom I have recommended to the Doctor, and to Lord Berkeley of Stratton. Mr. Lewis tells me that the Duke of Ormond has been to-day with the Queen; and she was content that Dr. Sterne should be Bishop of Dromore, and I Dean of St. Patrick's; but then out came Lord Treasurer, and said he would not be satisfied but that <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> Prebend(ary) of Windsor. Thus he perplexes things. I expect neither; but I confess, as much as I love England, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> at this treatment that, if I had my choice, I would rather have St. Patrick's. Lady Masham says she will speak to purpose to the Queen to-morrow. Nite,... dee MD.|$|R
6000|$|... "He did. I don't {{remember}} half he said, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry.</b> Oh, {{but such}} a funny thing happened! I can't help laughing at it now, though I felt nearly ready to cry with rage. He raved and I stormed--I'm afraid we must have made an awful noise in our kala juggah. Protect my character, dear, if it's all over Simla by tomorrow--and then he bobbed forward {{in the middle of}} this insanity--I firmly believe the man's demented--and kissed me!" ...|$|E
60|$|The speaker ceased, a {{smile of}} {{conscious}} merit upon his face. For the moment I could not {{say a word to}} him, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry.</b> But had I been able to say or do anything to indicate the wild indignation that filled my brain, I should have had no opportunity, for Mrs. Lecks stepped up to me and took me by the arm. Her face was very stern, and her expression gave one the idea of the rigidity of Bessemer steel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He did. I don't {{remember}} half he said, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry.</b> Oh, {{but such}} a funny thing happened!

6000|$|... "Intentionally." [...] He {{was calm}} again; {{and he was}} masterful {{for the first time}} in all his {{dealings}} with her. [...] "We are very far from any understanding. Indeed, we are overhead in a misunderstanding already. You misconstrue my words. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very angry with you. I do not think that in all my life <b>I</b> have ever <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with anybody. But you are not to mistake the source of my anger. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> angry with you for the great wrong you have done yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Even {{the fairest}} of his virtues are against him. That {{independent}} spirit, and that ingenuous modesty, qualities inseparable from a noble mind, are, with the million, circumstances {{not a little}} disqualifying. What pleasure is {{in the power of}} the fortunate and the happy, by their notice and patronage, to brighten the countenance and glad the heart of such depressed youth! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with mankind for their deaf economy of the purse--the goods of this world cannot be divided without being lessened--but why be a niggard of that which bestows bliss on a fellow-creature, yet takes nothing from our own means of enjoyment? We wrap ourselves up in the cloak of our own better fortune, and turn away our eyes, lest the wants and woes of our brother-mortals should disturb the selfish apathy of our souls! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And that," [...] he continued, [...] "is {{the source}} of all my anger, against you, against myself, and against circumstances. If I had deemed myself {{remotely}} worthy of you," [...] he continued, [...] "I should have asked you weeks ago to be my wife. Oh, wait, and hear me out. I have more than once been upon the point of doing so--the last time was that night on the balcony at Count Redondo's. I would have spoken then; I would have taken my courage in my hands, confessed my unworthiness and my love. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> restrained because, although I might confess, there <b>was</b> nothing <b>I</b> could ask. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a poor man, Sylvia, you are the daughter of a wealthy one; men speak of you as an heiress. To ask you to marry me--" [...] He broke off. [...] "You realise that I could not; that <b>I</b> should have <b>been</b> deemed a fortune-hunter, not only by the world, which matters nothing, but perhaps by yourself, who matter everything. I--I--" [...] he faltered, fumbling for words to express thoughts of an overwhelming intricacy. [...] "It was not perhaps that so much as the thought that, if my suit should come to prosper, men would say you had thrown yourself away on a fortune-hunter. To myself I should have accounted the reproach well earned, but {{it seemed to me that}} it must contain something slighting to you, and to shield you from all slights must be the first concern of my deep worship for you. That," [...] he ended fiercely, [...] "is why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry,</b> <b>so</b> desperate at the slight you have put upon yourself for my sake--for me, who would have sacrificed life and honour and everything I hold of any account, to keep you up there, enthroned not only in my own eyes, but in the eyes of every man." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> at hearing Hiram thus lay {{himself down}} {{at the feet of}} the man whom it surely seemed we had every reason to distrust, that I could have risen up against him, crying out all which was in my mind; but, fortunately, I checked the words which were on the tip of my tongue, and threw myself sulkily upon one of the beds, vowing mentally that never again would I put faith in any human being howsoever fair might be his speech.|$|E
60|$|These clever people {{sometimes}} overreach themselves. How she suggested it to me, I cannot pretend to have discovered. But I did certainly suspect {{that she had}} led Philip, while they were together downstairs, into saying to her what he had already said to Miss Jillgall. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> that I tried to pump my excellent friend, {{as she had been}} trying to pump me--a vulgar expression, but vulgar writing is such a convenient way of writing sometimes. My first attempt to entrap the Masseuse failed completely. She coolly changed the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} hasn't. We {{all know what}} Gerald is. Before I came home, I {{asked him what he}} thought of Wallace. He said he was a good sort, or {{something}} like that, and I saw that he had a reason for saying it; but he must go on in his patronizing style that Wallace was rather Colonial, though he hadn't drifted too far--not beyond reclamation. After all, Wallace was one of--us--before he went out; and if Carroll's Colonial he's the kind of man I like. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with Gerald I wanted to slap him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wanted to}} see him particular. There's a thing lays heavy on my mind. You see that place down in Ferny dell--there's a steep bank down to the water. Well, my young Lord was very keen about {{building}} a kind of steps there in the summer, and he and I settled the stones, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to cement 'em. By comes Mr. Frost, and finds faults, what I thought he'd no call to; so I flings down my trowel, and wouldn't go on for he! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> mortal <b>angry,</b> <b>I</b> would not go back to the work; and I believe my Lord forgot it--and then he went back to college; and Frampton and Gervas, they put on me, and you know how 'twas I come away from Ormersfield. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not going to say a word to one of that lot! but if I could see Lord Fitzjocelyn, I'd tell him they stones arn't fixed; and if the frost gets into 'em, there'll be a pretty go next time there's a tolerablish weight! But there--it is his own look-out! If he never thought it worth his while to keep his promise, and come and see me--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{that he may}} do so at leisure,' said Joshua, 'we will pray him, Rachel, to tarry a day or twain with us: he is young, and is but now {{entering}} {{upon the}} world, and our habitation may, if he will, be like a resting-place, from which he may look abroad upon the pilgrimage which he must take, and the path which he has to travel.--What sayest thou, friend Latimer? We constrain not our friends to our ways, and thou art, I think, too wise to quarrel with us for following our own fashions; and if we should even give thee a word of advice, thou wilt not, <b>I</b> think, <b>be</b> <b>angry,</b> <b>so</b> that it <b>is</b> spoken in season.' ...|$|R
50|$|During a PodCast interview, {{reporter}} Martha Debayle asked “How {{many times}} have you been married?” Gualberto paused, as if trying to recall, then said five times. Debayle replied, “Wasn’t it seven times?” When Gualberto was adamant with his count, Debayle began to ask questions concerning each marriage that he could remember. “I was very young,” Gualberto said, “When I married Altia “Mitchel” Herrera, she was a ballet dancer, later Suzanne Edwards, who was also a dancer. Then I lived with the actress Macaria for 6 or 7 years. She never wanted to marry me. … Next I married Alejandra Walliser, but she left, taking everything she wanted from the house, and went to live with her mother. Then I married an American girl, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> with her that I cannot even say her name because she took my Mercedes Benz. Now, I’m married to Gudrun Becker. We’ve been together for twenty-two years.” After researching legal documents, Gualberto forgot to mention that he married Suzanne Edwards two times and overlooked his marriage to Alexis Cordova. If it is true that he has been married to his present wife, Gudrun Becker for twenty-two years, then he must be a bigamist {{due to the fact that}} his divorce to Alejandra Walliser ended in 2003, and his marriage to Alexis Cordova ended in 2006.|$|R
