25|$|A main aim of {{this study}} was to compare if {{foodborne}} illness incidence had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2–7.3 million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these <b>equivalent</b> <b>methods</b> suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.|$|E

Japanese has a language degree {{as the result of the}} system of social stratification within certain groups. Japanese is a language that always represents both the speaker’s and the interlocutors’ feelings. One way to express these feelings is through the expression of yarimorai. Yarimorai is the Japanese way to express his feelings in an act of handling over both services and objects. This research aims at investigating the realization of yarimorai verbs. The data were collected by non-participant observation method, that is, to look closely the sentences using verbs of yarimorai that describe the status relationship among the speakers. Furthermore, the data were analyzed by using <b>equivalent</b> <b>method.</b> The methods used are referential, translational <b>equivalent</b> <b>method</b> and pragmatic <b>equivalent</b> <b>method.</b> The result showed that there is a different relationship pattern in the use of verbs yarimorai when used in an expression that consider the value of sense and purpose of the speaker’s feelings towards the interlocutors. The relationships that appear in the expressions of yarimorai always describe the speakers’ consideration based on a hierarchy of office or position, social status, closeness, intimacy, and inclusiveness in interacting with the interlocutors. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} gamble has a firm {{basis in}} the theory of risk and, for this reason, is the preferred method of health state value elicitation for many researchers. However, it is widely recognised that the use of immediate death as the failure outcome in the standard gamble renders the method insufficiently sensitive for the direct valuation of minor and temporary health states. Consequently, the indirect valuation of minor and temporary health states through a process of 'chaining' has been recommended. Unfortunately, a number of researchers have observed internal inconsistency in the standard gamble. That is, for health states that are not thought to be subject to the above mentioned insufficient sensitivity, the values elicited from indirect chained questions quite often significantly and systematically exceed those elicited from the direct procedure. A potential explanation for this is the possible influence of loss aversion when people are asked to weigh certainty against risk. The lottery <b>equivalents</b> <b>method,</b> an alternative value elicitation instrument that also has a firm grounding {{in the theory of}} risk, modifies the standard gamble approach of certainty versus risk to one of risk versus risk. The absence of certainty offers reason to suspect that the influence of loss aversion will be diminished (or even removed), and that the lottery <b>equivalents</b> <b>method</b> will thus prove to be internally consistent. The study reported in this article tests {{the internal consistency of the}} lottery <b>equivalents</b> <b>method.</b> In a manner similar to that observed with the standard gamble, the results indicate that the internal consistency of the lottery <b>equivalents</b> <b>method</b> is also to some extent compromised.

5000|$|Evidence {{was also}} found in {{consumer}} research in support of FTT's [...] "editing" [...] hypothesis, namely that extremely low-probability risks can be simplified by gist processing to be represented as [...] "essentially nil." [...] For example, {{one study found that}} people were willing to pay more for a safer product if safety was expressed relatively (i.e., product A is safer than product B) than they were if safety was expressed with statistics of actual incidence of safety hazards.This result is in contrast to most prescriptive decision rules that predict that formally <b>equivalent</b> <b>methods</b> of communicating risk information should have identical effects on risk-taking behavior, even if the pertinent displays are different. These findings are predicted by FTT (and related models), which suggest that people reason on the basis of simplified representations rather than on the literal information available.|$|E

50|$|Comparisons of {{election}} campaign communication {{can either be}} conducted by one team looking at different countries (leading to theoretical diversity) or by scholars compiling case studies and drawing conclusions from them. Drawing conclusions from a compilation of case studies can lead to methodological problems. Country experts provide single report about the election campaign communication in different countries, eventually following guidelines designed by the editors. The methodological problem refers {{to the lack of}} a unified data set, i.e. the research within the countries does not use <b>equivalent</b> <b>methods</b> and measurements especially designed for the sample of countries (either using a more etic or emic approach to achieve equivalence). To deal with methodological problems rising from a compilation approach, several aspects have to be considered: creation of chapter homogeneity by following a guideline, awareness for the logic of comparative research, and creation of a systematized synthesis when drawing conclusions. Nevertheless, the validity of cross-national conclusions remains comprised, since no aggregate data set, derived from identical research conduction, exists. Nevertheless, the compilation approach can provide an insight into communication differences in election campaigns around the globe. Swanson and Mancini published such a compilation in 1996 to compare election campaign styles of eleven countries.|$|E

40|$|Base {{isolation}} system, {{as one of}} {{the most}} popular means to mitigate the seismic risks, often exhibits strong nonlinearity. To simplify the procedure of structural design, bilinear force-deformation behavior is recommended for isolation systems in most modern structural codes. Although base isolation system can be analyzed through nonlinear time history method, solving of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom may require an exorbitant amount of time. As a substitute, the <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>method</b> is frequently used. Apparently, under given earthquake ground motions, the accuracy of <b>equivalent</b> linearization analysis <b>method</b> is significantly related to the estimation of equivalent linear properties. How to improve the estimation accuracy of this approximate method constitutes a subject of wide and deep interest among researchers around the world. In this research, the <b>equivalent</b> linearization analysis <b>method</b> for base-isolated buildings was investigated. The literature survey on related aspects of base-isolated buildings was carried out firstly. Then, the estimation accuracy of fifteen <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>methods</b> selected from the literatures was evaluated when subjected to twelve earthquake ground motions. After that, from simplicity to complexity, the base-isolated buildings were modeled using single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems and multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, respectively. For both considered systems, more comprehensive parametric analyses were performed with varying the parameters selected from the isolation system and the superstructure. Accordingly, improved <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>methods</b> were derived for SDOF and MDOF systems to improve the prediction accuracy of the maximum displacement of isolation systems. Based on the proposed <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>methods,</b> different analysis methods for base-isolated buildings were assessed, including equivalent static linear analysis, response spectral analysis, linear and nonlinear time history analyses. It was found that with the proposed <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>methods</b> <b>equivalent</b> linear analyses could yield more accurate results when compared with the <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>method</b> recommended by structural codes. As a result, the proposed <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>method</b> could be potentially useful for the design and analysis of baseisolated buildings, as least in the preliminary stage of structural design...|$|R
30|$|With the {{proposed}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>method,</b> conformity with the detailed WPP {{of the active}} and reactive powers of the equivalent WPP is generally improved except a few cases. These cases {{are related to the}} following situations: (1) the group number of the equivalent model A is lower than that of the equivalent model B. This phenomenon occurs in the event that all of 30 PMSGs’ DC link voltages reach the chopper circuit threshold or fluctuate near the normal value. Based on {{the proposed}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>method,</b> these 30 PMSGs are clustered into one group. However, the 30 PMSGs are clustered into two groups using the traditional <b>equivalent</b> <b>method</b> in which the clustering principle is dependent on the diversity in wind speeds. Simulation results reveal that both the equivalent model A and B can reflect the phenomenon that all of 30 PMSGs’ DC link voltages reach the chopper circuit threshold or fluctuate near the normal value, but equivalent model B also takes into account the diversity in wind speeds. On the basis of increasing the order of equivalent model, the equivalent model B improves its precision somewhat. (2) The equivalent model A and B have a same clustering result, as can be seen when wind energy and transfer coefficient are 0.8  MW, 0.9  pu, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Software {{repackaging}} is {{a common}} approach for creating malware. In this approach, malware authors inject malicious payloads into legitimate applications; then, to ren- der security analysis more difficult, they obfuscate {{most or all of}} the code. This forces analysts to spend a large amount of effort filtering out benign obfuscated methods in order to locate potentially malicious methods for further analysis. If an effective mechanism for filtering out benign obfuscated methods were available, the number of methods that must be analyzed could be reduced, allowing analysts to be more productive. In this thesis, we introduce SEMEO, a highly effective and efficient fil- tering approach that can determine whether an obfuscated and an original version of a method are semantically equivalent. Our approach handles seven common, com- plex types of obfuscation and can be effective even when all types are compositely applied. In an empirical evaluation, we applied SEMEO to nine Android apps of varying complexity, and the approach provided over 76 % recall and 100 % precision in identifying semantically <b>equivalent</b> <b>methods.</b> We then performed three additional studies, that showed that: (1) SEMEO is much more effective at identifying semantically <b>equivalent</b> <b>methods</b> than FSquaDRA, an existing technique; (2) SEMEO is also effective for identifying repackaged apps that have been previously obfuscated by ProGuard, a popular obfuscation tool; and (3) SEMEO is effective at identifying semantically <b>equivalent</b> <b>methods</b> in a repackaged, malicious version of Pokemon Go...|$|E
