This work investigates what phase transformations {{are taking}} place during a {{continuous}} heating {{as well as the}} influence of the solution temperature on the isothermal formation of martensite in a precipitation hardening semi-austenitic stainless steel. In previous studies in the stainless steel under investigation (12 Cr- 9 Ni- 4 Mo- 2 Cu) only the isothermal mode of martensitic transformation has been experimentally detected. In this work it is shown that: 1) The AF temperature is located around 1040 K; 2) The χ-phase present in the initial microstructure dissolves above ~ 1323 K; 3) above 1448 K the formation of delta ferrite is promoted at austenite grain boundaries; 4) the kinetics of isothermal martensite formation is strongly accelerated with increasing solution temperature.

Neutron diffraction patterns were quantitatively processed using the Rietveld refinement method, allowing {{the determination of the}} temperature-dependence of martensite (α′, bcc) and austenite (γ, fcc) phase fractions and lattice parameters on heating to 1000  °C and then cooling to room temperature. It is demonstrated in this work that <b>dilatometry</b> doesn't permit an accurate determination of the end temperature (Ac 3) of the α′ → γ transformation which occurs upon heating to high temperature.

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the inhibition mechanism of N,N-dibenzylhydroxylamine (DBHA) and 2, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (2, 5 -DTBBQ) mixture towards auto-initiated styrene polymerisation. This non-toxic composition represents a valid alternative to the quite efficient, but harmful 2, 4 -di-nitro- 6 -sec-butyl phenol. A <b>dilatometry</b> study revealed that DBHA/ 2, 5 -DTBBQ mixture shows synergism, therefore in order to decipher its mechanism of inhibition, the inhibitors were first investigated individually and then together. DBHA is a good inhibitor only in oxygenated systems. The main mechanism of inhibition of DBHA is the quenching of peroxyl radicals {{at the end of the}} propagating chains by hydrogen abstraction. In the presence of oxygen N,N-dibenzylnitroxide also contributes to the inhibition to some extent. During the inhibition of styrene with DBHA/ 2, 5 -DTBBQ, 2, 5 -DTBBQ is reduced to 2, 5 -di-tert-butyl-hydroquinone (2, 5 -DTBHQ). <b>Dilatometry</b> study revealed that the 2, 5 -DTBHQ/ 2, 5 -DTBBQ mixture shows a limited retardation towards the styrene polymerisation. The ability of these compounds to stop propagation radicals by addition reactions was ruled out, since no addition products were detected. Product analysis of the inhibition of styrene polymerization in the presence of DBHA and 2, 5 -DTBBQ allowed the detection of a few compounds, which were tested by <b>dilatometry</b> either singularly or as a mixture. This approach provides a way to rule out several molecules as responsible for the synergism of DBHA- 2, 5 -DTBBQ. N,N-Dibenzylnitroxide is formed during the inhibition, and a combination of <b>dilatometry</b> and EPR analyses revealed a correlation between its concentration in the mixture and inhibition time. N,N-Dibenzylnitroxide is likely to be involved in the inhibition but not in the retardation.
