How have these various volcanic rocks, which he sees marked as Felspathic Traps, Quartz Porphyries, Greenstones, and so forth, got intermingled with beds which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> to believe <b>are</b> volcanic ashes, and those again with fossil-bearing Silurian beds and Cambrian slates, which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> to believe <b>were</b> deposited under water?
