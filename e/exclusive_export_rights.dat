40|$|In {{this paper}} we report an {{economic}} {{analysis of the}} activities of the NSW Grains Board over the period 1992 - 1998. This work was undertaken in conjunction with a NSW State Government review of the legislation that grants powers of vesting and single desk selling to the Board, powers that can be considered as restrictions to competition. A net public benefit test was used {{as the basis for the}} review. Economic trade theory, institutional arrangements and econometric analysis were used to conceptualise conditions necessary and sufficient for price discrimination to be present, and then estimates were made of the dimensions of the social benefits and costs associated with the price discrimination behaviour. The main results were that for sales of malting barley the Board's activities were found to deliver a net benefit to producers, but domestic prices were higher resulting in a net overall social cost. No net benefit to producers was found for feed barley or canola. Resulting from the review, a report was submitted to the NSW Minister for Agriculture in July 1999. The Government announced in August 2000 that the NSW Grains Board would continue to hold vesting powers for the next five years. Following a concurrent investigation of the Board's financial position, severe financial problems were identified and the Board acted to find an equity partner. In October 2000 the Minister announced an agreement between the NSW Grains Board and Grainco Australia Ltd of Queensland, whereby Grainco purchased <b>exclusive</b> <b>export</b> <b>rights</b> for barley, canola and sorghum grown in NSW and domestic vestin...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explains}} that the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, has failed to invest adequately, resulting in very little development of new gas supplies in Russia. The result has been progressively increasing use by Gazprom of central Asian gas supplies, at progressively higher prices for Russia. The increased prices of gas for Russian consumers have shown that it is crucial for Russian welfare to allow new entrants, and to introduce competition in the Russian domestic market. Competition among multiple gas suppliers from Russia, however, would erode or eliminate the monopoly profits of the Russian Federation on gas exports. Thus, with a more competitive domestic market, the Russian government {{would be expected to}} grant <b>exclusive</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>rights</b> to a single entity (as it presently does with Gazprom) or impose export taxes. Thus, Europe should not expect to achieve cheaper Russian gas as a result of structural reforms within the Russian gas market.

40|$|Export {{restraints}} by the Russian Federation {{on natural}} gas and timber have {{been the source of}} major controversy between the European Union and the Russian Federation. The analysis of this paper suggests that the export restraints in natural gas very substantially benefit Russia. On the other hand, in raw timber the analysis suggests that a substantial reduction of Russian export taxes would increase Russian welfare. The paper explains that Gazprom has failed to invest adequately, resulting in little development of new gas supplies. The result has been progressively increasing use by Gazprom of Central Asian gas supplies, at progressively higher prices for Russia. The increased prices of gas for Russian consumers have shown that it is crucial for Russia to allow new entrants and to introduce competition in the Russian domestic market. Without export restraints, however, competition among multiple gas suppliers from Russia would erode or eliminate the monopoly profits of the Russian Federation on gas exports. Thus, with a more competitive domestic market, the Russian government would be expected to grant <b>exclusive</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>rights</b> to a single entity (as it presently does with Gazprom) or impose export taxes.

Digital Rights Management (DRM) was introduced to govern the usage and distribution of digital content. The reception of DRM has been mixed in the content industry.

Solutions towards System interoperability of DRM promised to solve most of the issues related to the lack of DRM interoperability. <b>Rights</b> <b>exporting,</b> as a critical task of DRM system interoperability, is the main topic of this dissertation. This dissertation focuses on the effectiveness of <b>rights</b> <b>exporting.</b> This dissertation started with a thorough literature review.

Honduran etymologists say that since the Pipil language is so close to the Nahuatl language, the Honduran Nahua tribe could have created the dish.

40|$|Digital rights {{management}} (DRM) {{has been}} widely used in copyright protection. The nature of DRM leads to incompatibility between different DRM systems. Many authors have produced solutions for generating DRM interoperability. However, decisions making in <b>rights</b> <b>exporting,</b> identified {{as one of the}} most important aspects in DRM interoperability, still requires intensive research effort. This thesis studies how the characteristics of rights influence decisions making in <b>rights</b> <b>exporting,</b> and how to mitigate their negative impacts. In order to study how rights can be transferred from one DRM system to another, we built a generic rights model to illustrate the basic elements within rights, i. e. permission and condition, and two types of linkage relationship between the basic elements, the valid-checking path and influential path. Furthermore, the direction and mode of rights flow have been analysed. On the basis of our rights model, we propose a process model for <b>rights</b> <b>exporting</b> and methods for rights decomposition and adaptation. These are further verified in a case study of interoperability between two major DRM standards: OMA DRM version 2 and Windows Media DRM version 10. In summation, this study defines a generic rights model, upon which a process and methods for <b>rights</b> <b>exporting</b> between different DRM systems are proposed and verified in a case study. The rights model and the <b>rights</b> <b>exporting</b> methods can be further specialised for specific DRM systems. Together with the case study, this provides a good starting point for further study of the interoperability between DRM systems.

40|$|A general equilibrium, linear {{programming}} land-use model formulated in {{the heritage of}} Edwin Mills is extended to include a profit-maximizing objective function. This analog of the existing, cost-minimizing formulations in the literature is driven by exogenous export prices rather than by minimum-export requirements. It is demonstrated {{that the absence of}} minimum-export constraints results in an optimum corresponding to the <b>exclusive</b> <b>export</b> of the most profitable good. In addition, the outputs of the model are shown to be arbitrarily dependent on assumptions about zone geometry if export prices are high. A static, spatially disaggregate version of the model is specified by means of hexagonal land-use zones. Perfect market conditions are assumed and spatial markets identified. Production technologies are of the fixed-coefficient type with constant returns to scale. Import flows are treated explicitly {{for the first time in}} a model of this class, and their inclusion is shown to have a significant impact on optimal land-use configurations. ...|$|R

The analytical framework adopted is very simple and three extreme imperfect market structures are considered. In the first case, the exporting country maximizes its producer and consumer surplus by intervening in the world market. The second market imperfection considered is {{the existence of a}} private firm playing the role of "pure middleman" in the world market. Then the case of a producer-owned marketing board which is granted <b>exclusive</b> <b>export</b> authority is addressed. It is shown that under all three scenarios, if perfect competition is assumed when market imperfections exist, the impact of a tariff reduction on prices and volume traded is overestimated. A ranking of the size of such distortions in the three cases analyzed is provided. Finally, it is proved that when a private firm exerts monopoly and monopsony power in the world market, both the importing and the exporting countries may well be better off if, rather than making a move towards trade liberalization, the importing country "compensates" the exporting country by means of a direct transfer. trade liberalization, imperfect markets, monopoly, monopsony, marketing board, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
