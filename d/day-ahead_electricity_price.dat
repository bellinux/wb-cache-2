Constrained least squares regression (CLS) offers a balance between robustness against such well performing individual methods and relatively accurate forecasts, on average better than those of the individual predictors.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dependency of the hourly <b>day-ahead</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> on fundamentals in the Nord Pool power market. We examine whether power prices depend differently on {{supply and demand}} variables when hydro reservoir levels are low than when they are high as we expect that the competitive environment changes as a consequence. When reservoir levels are high, all hydro power producers want to sell to prevent invaluable spillovers, which leads to competitive pressure. With lower reservoir levels, hydro power agents are more preserved about their actions. We examine the change in dynamics using a supply and demand model and split the sample in observations from periods with extreme low and high reservoir levels. We show that {{the parameters of the}} supply curve model significantly differ over the two samples.

40|$|A {{combined}} forecast with weights adaptively {{selected and}} errors calibrated by Hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed {{to model the}} <b>day-ahead</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>price.</b> Firstly several single models were built to forecast the electricity price separately. Then the validation errors from every individual model were transformed into two discrete sequences: an emission sequence and a state sequence to build the HMM, obtaining a transmission matrix and an emission matrix, representing the forecasting ability state of the individual models. The combining weights of the individual models were decided by the state transmission matrixes in HMM and the best predict sample ratio of each individual among all the models in the validation set. The individual forecasts were averaged to get the combining forecast with the weights obtained above. The residuals of combining forecast were calibrated by the possible error calculated by the emission matrix of HMM. A case study of day-ahead electricity market of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), USA, suggests that the proposed method outperforms individual techniques of price forecasting, such as support vector machine (SVM), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), day-ahead modeling, and self-organized map (SOM) similar days modeling...|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} forecasting {{of energy}} price {{is important for}} generation companies (GENCOs) to develop their bidding strategies or to make investment decisions. Nowadays, day-ahead electricity market is closely associated with other commodity markets such as fuel market and emission market. Under such an environment, <b>day-ahead</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> is volatile and its volatility changes overtime due to the uncertainties from the multi-market. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid model based on panel cointegration and particle filter (PCPF). Panel cointegration (PC) model, which utilizes information of both the inter-temporal dynamics and the individuality of interconnected regions, provides powerful forecasting tool for electricity price. Particle filter (PF) has achieved significant successes in tracking applications involving non-Gaussian signals and nonlinear systems. This paper has two main focuses: (1) To expand the dimension of electricity price dataset from time series to panel data so that the dynamics of interconnected regions can be analyzed simultaneously and considered as a whole. (2) Regarding the model coefficients as a time-varying process, PF is used to forecast electricity price adaptively.

40|$|The {{day-ahead}} electricity {{market is}} closely related to other commodity markets such as the fuel and emission markets and is increasingly playing a significant role in human life. Thus, in the electricity markets, accurate electricity price forecasting plays significant role for power producers and consumers. Although many studies developing and proposing highly accurate forecasting models exist in the literature, there have been few investigations on improving the forecasting effectiveness of electricity price from the perspective of reducing the volatility of data with satisfactory accuracy. Based on reducing the volatility of the electricity price and the forecasting nature of the radial basis function network (RBFN), this paper successfully develops a two-stage model to forecast the <b>day-ahead</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>price,</b> of which the first stage is particle swarm optimization (PSO) -core mapping (CM) with self-organizing-map and fuzzy set (PCMwSF), and the second stage is selection rule (SR). The PCMwSF stage applies CM, fuzzy set and optimized weights to obtain the future price, and the SR stage is inspired by the forecasting nature of RBFN and effectively selects the best forecast during the test period. The proposed model, i. e., CM-PCMwSF-SR, not only overcomes the difficulty of reducing the high volatility of the electricity price but also leads to a superior forecasting effectiveness than benchmarks...|$|E

40|$|Article 1 : Residual demand, the {{difference}} between demand and renewable production, is important variable in predicting the future price and the future need for energy storage for intermittent renewables production. The residual demand represents the load {{that can not be}} met by renewable production and must be served by conventional power plant, electricity imports or storage capacity. However, little is known about predicting the residual demand itself as well as its quantiles. We therefore model demand and residual demand using ordinary and linear quantile regression, and thereafter compare the results for the hourly electricity consumption in Germany. We find that that the residual demand is less predictable than demand. Our paper makes two contributions to the literature: (1) unlike other studies it analyses the residual demand by using quantile regression (2) it compares the results of demand and residual demand. Article 2 : This paper analysis the relation between several fundamental variables and German <b>day-ahead</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> for each hour.

The results indicate that the effect from the factors on electricity price vary substantially across the quantiles, thus confirming the high complexity of the electricity price...|$|E

As an effective method for energy management, the tariff structure designed before is usually based on the type of activity, which is not able to indicate the electrical behavior in a comprehensive way (Ahmed et al., 2017). Reference (Bo et al., 2016) utilized a two-stage clustering algorithm to classify customers according to their load curves. In the first-stage, the load patterns are clustered into different categories according to the evaluation index, and then the customers are classified according to the comprehensive load shape factors defined in the first-stage with SVM algorithm. In contrary to the time domain analysis (Al-Otaibi et al., 2016), the DFT method is adopted in (Zhong & Tam, 2012) to discover the information of customers’ behavior, which can be accurately reconstructed using limited frequency components and still satisfy the strict requirements. The residential electricity consumption usually can be divided into three parts: fixed, regulable and deferrable loads, which is the theoretical basis for the optimal energy management of the demand response (DR) mechanism. DR is used to initiate a change in the customers’ consumption or feed-in pattern with an incentive from costs or ecological information. Reference (Li et al., 2017) utilizes the spectral domain analysis methods DWT and DFT to decompose smart metering data with the extracted coefficients. Results show that DWT performs better than DFT in individual level while DFT is more suitable {{to be used in the}} analysis at a highly aggregated level. A learning based DR strategy combining data analytics and optimization is developed for regulatable loads focusing on the residential HVAC (Zhang et al., 2016 b). Because when the customers’ behavior is obtained, an optimal DR technique for household HVAC unit can be designed based on weather prediction, <b>day-ahead</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>price.</b> Reference (Jindal et al., 2016) takes the advantage of the social networking to minimize the peak power consumption of the electrical appliances by proposing a “family plan” approach which leverages the social network topology and statistical energy usage patterns of the users.|$|E
