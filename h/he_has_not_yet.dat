5|$|Lucas {{was born}} on November 3, 1982 in Oklahoma. He attends Smith College, a private, women-only college in Massachusetts. Lucas is a {{neuroscience}} major in his senior year; he has fought for transgender rights for his entire college career. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> started hormone replacement therapy, and is cautious about it. Lucas' parents are divorced; his mother and brother {{know that he is}} trans, but his father does not. Lucas plays guitar in a punk band, and lives in an apartment with his friend Kasey, a trans man who has been on HRT for eight months.|$|E
5|$|T.J. {{was born}} on June 6, 1981 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is of Armenian descent; {{he grew up in}} Cyprus, and came to the US {{for the first time in}} 1999. He is a Fulbright Scholar {{pursuing}} a master's degree in student affairs administration at Michigan State University. Outgoing and involved, T.J. is active in several student organizations pertaining to performance art, gender, and social change. He lives with other students in a housing cooperative. His mother lives in a close-knit Armenian community in Cyprus, where the news would surely travel if T.J. transitions. Because his mother opposes his transition, and because he must return to Cyprus for two years due to a travel visa requirement, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> started HRT.|$|E

25|$|After the Clans {{move into}} their new camps, Barkface, the WindClan {{medicine}} cat, goes to Firestar {{and tells him}} that Tallstar, leader of WindClan, is dying. Firestar asks Brambleclaw to follow him as well as Onewhisker of WindClan, at Tallstar's request. Tallstar tells them {{that he does not}} wish for Mudclaw, the WindClan deputy, to lead WindClan, and wishes to switch to Onewhisker as deputy. He dies soon after telling the cats. The next morning, Firestar and Onewhisker announce this to the other Clans, much to Mudclaw's anger. Onewhisker appoints Ashfoot as his deputy, although <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> received his nine lives and leader name from StarClan, the cats' ancestors. The medicine cats worry about whether there is another Moonstone (a sacred stone in the old territory which they can communicate with StarClan, their warrior ancestors) for Onewhisker to visit for his leadership ceremony.|$|E

500|$|On defense, Michigan {{shut out}} a Minnesota offense that had scored 34 points against Northwestern and 20 against Iowa. [...] The Golden Gophers threw eight passes for zero {{completions}} and two interceptions. [...] Left tackle Stanley Muirhead, playing his final game for Michigan, {{was credited with}} the success of the defense:In his last game against Minnesota, November 24, Muirhead was everywhere. He made three-fourths of the tackles under punts, and was always on the ball. A check was made during the game of Muirheads's tackles. No less than twenty-two times did this stalwart tackle bring down his man. He was a veritable demon on the field. [...] He could not be stopped.

He surprises Erin by popping out of a {{delivery}} box and singing [...] "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours", but she is not particularly excited to see him, and states she does not {{want to go back to}} Scranton with him. The situation is further complicated when Andy reveals to Erin that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> broken up with his current girlfriend, Jessica. Andy tells Erin he loves her, but she rejects him; Andy subsequently leaves, his feelings crushed. Irene, who had been treating Andy with disdain over the way Erin spoke of him, sees that he is a nice person and encourages Erin to go back with him. She runs up to him as he is leaving in his car and they share a kiss before heading back to Scranton.|$|E
500|$|Zur {{typically}} {{is brought}} in to compose for a game once it is mostly complete, though he notes that that is earlier than for films and television—where nothing changes after he starts besides post-production effects—making video game music composition a more [...] "flexible" [...] process. He finds that it is [...] "crucial" [...] for him {{to play a game}} before he can compose music for it, even if it only a development version. Rather than compose music based around the setting in the game where it will be played, Zur composes music around the emotion that he wants the player to feel at that point in the game. While he feels that music composition technology has come far enough in recent years to no longer be a limiting factor in his music, he does feel that the music budgets for games limit what he can create. Zur feels that he is considered in the industry to be a very fast composer, which he attributes to his tendency to compose music [...] "intuitively", rather than {{spending a lot of time}} planning it out. When not composing, Zur likes to play video games, especially those he has composed for, as well as play basketball and spend time with his family. The types of projects that he would like to work on in the future that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> done are children's games and soundtracks incorporating jazz music.|$|E
500|$|Hogan's {{obituary}} stated that, at {{some point}} in his playing career, he set a record for baserunning. [...] Several sources trace this record to a field day event held in Indianapolis in 1895, when he reportedly rounded the bases in 13.2 seconds. The World Almanac and Encyclopedia 1906, for instance, reported that Hogan [...] "lowered the base-running record" [...] in 1895, noting that [...] "he distance around the bases is 120 yards". [...] In January 1906, Sporting Life reported that Hogan had [...] "taken steps to have the base running record awarded to him". [...] The report added, [...] "Under proper conditions [...] turned the route in 13 15 seconds at Indianapolis in 1895". [...] Some observers questioned the veracity of the record, however. [...] In 1907, for instance, Washington Post sports columnist J. Ed Grillo conceded that [...] "Hogan was a great sprinter" [...] but described his unofficial record as [...] "out of reason". [...] Grillo, who argued that [...] "the fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near the mark", lent his support to an official record of 14.1 that had been set more recently by Eastern League player Wally Clement. [...] An article published in the Washington Herald days earlier also raised questions about Hogan's baserunning record. [...] In this case, however, the writer claimed that the most [...] "authentic" [...] record had been set by Harry Berthrong in the 1860s. [...] The article stated that, while Hogan was [...] "said to have beaten Berthrong's base-circling record of 13 25 seconds by a fifth of a second", this alleged feat was not [...] "performed under official sanction". [...] One year earlier, in 1906, Berthrong, himself, weighed in on the debate. [...] According to an article that appeared in [...] Sporting Life in March of that year, Berthrong disputed Hogan's claim. [...] "My time...around the bases was made in Washington, D.C., in July 1868, after the old Nationals of Washington, D.C., had played a game with the Pastimes of Baltimore, Md.", Berthrong was quoted as saying in an interview. [...] "Three stop watches were held over me, the slowest giving me 14 1/4". [...] The retired player added: [...] "I am skeptical about this man Hogan doing the bases in 13 1-5: nobody but an Arthur Duffey could possibly do it, and I doubt if he could". [...] For reasons that are unclear, the article indicated that Hogan claimed to round the bases in 1889, six earlier than other reports. (A similar description of Hogan's claim appeared elsewhere in the same edition of Sporting Life; a brief news item suggested he claimed to set the record [...] "in Indianapolis in the 80's".) Baseball historian Jon Daly traced Hogan's contested record to 1898; he speculated that Ben Morgan, an official of the National Association, [...] "disputed that claim when doing a study of field day records". [...] The most widely accepted national baserunning record was set by Evar Swanson, who rounded the bases in 13.4 seconds in 1929. [...] Despite questions surrounding Hogan's baserunning record, he became popularly known as the [...] "Indianapolis Ringer". [...] Newspaper reports suggest he defended his position as baserunning champion of the Western League in various pre-game competitions. [...] On August 2, 1895, the Vindicator noted that the outfielder had [...] "a rival for the base running honors in the western league in George Nichol of the Milwaukees who, it is claimed, can get down to first quicker than Hogan". [...] The article added, [...] "A race between the two is talked of". [...] Then, on August 17, 1895, the Vindicator reported that Hogan had defeated Detroit outfielder Frank Tower in a baserunning contest. [...] "The Hoosiers have in Mart Hogan a pretty good extra card", the article added. [...] "Indianapolis goes around the land, and their sprinting outfielder meets all comers in foot races before the game. [...] <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> been defeated". [...] Several days earlier, the same newspaper quoted a journalist from Sporting Life, who reportedly commented: [...] "Mart Hogan, the Indianapolis outfielder, is showing such astonishing speed that he will probably be taken to England next year for the Sheffield Handicap".|$|E

2500|$|The {{first to}} offer a {{solution}} was the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James, written about 150 AD.
