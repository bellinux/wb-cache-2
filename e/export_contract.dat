5|$|The Su-35 {{project was}} aimed {{primarily}} at the export market. During {{the early stages}} of the flight-test programme, Sukhoi estimated that there was such a market for 160 aircraft, with a particular emphasis on Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Some of the candidate countries, such as Algeria, Malaysia, and India, were already operators of the Su-30MK family. As the aircraft was to be available for export starting in 2010, the actual launch order for 48 Su-35S aircraft was placed by the Russian Defence Ministry at the 2009 MAKS Air Show (as part of a larger deal worth US$2.5billion for 64 fighter aircraft). During the type's international debut at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Mikhail Pogosyan, General Director of Sukhoi's parent company United Aircraft Corporation, stated that there was an estimated demand for 200 aircraft, split evenly between the domestic and export markets. It was not until the end of 2015 when the first <b>export</b> <b>contract</b> was signed with China; by then, the Russian government had placed a follow-up order for 50 aircraft.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Spain looked towards its European neighbors {{for a new}} tank. The Spanish {{government}} first approached Krauss-Maffei, the German manufacturer of the Leopard 1, and the company applied for an export license from the German Economics Ministry. Spain's status as a non-NATO country meant {{that the decision to}} grant the export license had to be reviewed by the Bundessicherheitsrat (Federal Security Council), or the BSR, which was responsible for the coordination of the national defense policy. [...] Ultimately, the council ruled that Krauss-Maffei could sign an <b>export</b> <b>contract</b> with Spain. [...] The deal was, however, stalled by pressure from the United Kingdom's Labour Party on the basis that the Leopard's 105-millimeter (4.13in) L7 tank gun was British technology.

One of 30 attorneys {{in the law}} firm, she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration. [...] She later said, [...] "I wanted to complete myself as an attorney." [...] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job. [...] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than {{be part of a}} larger law firm. Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States; much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods. In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle. She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run [...] "much like a drug operation", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by [...] "Fendi Crush", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green. At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain <b>export</b> <b>contract</b> disputes. In a 1986 appearance on Good Morning America that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college. [...] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm; she was paid well but not extravagantly. She left in 1992 when she became a judge.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} under a {{commercial}} export milk program {{the market value}} of quota will be determined by the spread between the domestic market price and the export price rather than the conventional wisdom that it is determined by the spread between the domestic milk price and the marginal cost of production. Under this new economy it was argued that ultimately the market price of dairy quota will be priced independently of firm marginal costs, which implies that low cost (or high margin) producers will not hold an economic advantage in bidding for quota over higher cost producers. Regression results are consistent with the hypothesized positive relationship between quota value and the difference between domestic and export milk price. The average export price has generally increased over time and is approximately equal to the marginal cost for an average producer. The results have implications for the WTO challenge. New Zealand and US feel the domestic program acts as an export subsidy by cross-subsidizing production of commercial export milk. The results here suggest that the prices for the filled <b>export</b> <b>contracts</b> are approximately the marginal cost of production for the average producer, and not lower as suggested by the challenge. <b>Export</b> <b>contracts</b> were found to have higher price risk than domestically produced milk. The risk is compounded by the short-term nature of most <b>export</b> <b>contracts.</b> The increase in risk for the CEM implies that it is unlikely many farmers will greatly diversify into CEM contracts unless the uncertainty is reduced.
