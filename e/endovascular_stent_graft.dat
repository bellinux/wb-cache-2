40|$|AbstractPurpose: This report {{describes}} {{our experience}} with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> <b>graft</b> repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and other arterial lesions. Methods: Between September 1990 and April 1994, 57 patients {{were treated with}} <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> <b>grafts</b> (50 with abdominal aortic aneurysms or iliac aneurysms; five with traumatic arteriovenous fistulas; one with an infected femoral false aneurysm; and one with a false aneurysm of the proximal right common carotid artery). The devices consist of either a Dacron or an autogenous vein graft sutured to a balloon-expandable <b>stent.</b> The <b>stented</b> <b>grafts</b> are placed through remote arteriotomies, advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to their predetermined sites, and secured into position. Results: Forty of the 50 <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> <b>graft</b> procedures used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms or iliac aneurysms were considered successful, even though some secondary treatment was required in six patients (two open operations; four secondary endovascular procedures). The 10 failures include four early procedural deaths, one late procedural death, and five leaks. All five arteriovenous fistulas and the two false aneurysms were successfully treated with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> <b>grafts.</b> Conclusions: Although our experience with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> <b>grafts</b> has been promising, remaining problems require resolution, and further follow-up is needed.

40|$|<b>Endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> {{placement}} {{has become}} a major treatment for thoracic and abdominal aneurysms. While endovascular therapy is less invasive than open surgery, it involves the use of a contrast medium. Contrast media can cause renal impairment, a condition termed as contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). This study sought to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of CIN following <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> placement for aortic aneurysm repair. The study included 167 consecutive patients who underwent <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> placement in our hospital from October 2013 to June 2014. CIN was diagnosed using the European Society of Urogenital Radiology criteria. Patients with and without CIN were compared.

Left ventricular dysfunction and intraoperative blood transfusion were significantly more frequent in the CIN group (P= 0. 017 and P= 0. 032, resp.). Multivariate analysis showed that left ventricular dysfunction had the strongest influence on CIN development (odds ratio 9. 34, P= 0. 018, and 95 % CI = 1. 46 – 59. 7).

40|$|Objective: Open {{surgical}} repair for infected thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysms carries significant {{mortality and}} morbidity. <b>Endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> repair {{has been our}} preferred approach, although its role remains controversial because persistent infection is always a concern. We aimed to assess the efficacy and durability of <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> repair in these patients. Methods: Between August 2000 and November 2005, seven consecutive patients with eight infected pseudoaneurysms of the thoracic aorta were treated with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> repair. Patients were diagnosed based on a typical appearance of an infected pseudoaneurysm on imaging together with a positive bacteriology culture or clinical evidence of sepsis. The follow-up protocol included regular clinical examination, hematologic tests, and computed tomography scans. Results: There were six men and one woman with a median age of 68 years at operation. Three patients presented with an aortoenteric fistula. The operations were performed {{in the operating room}} with the image guidance of a mobile C-arm. Endovascular stent grafts were deployed successfully in all patients, with complete exclusion of the pseudoaneurysms. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 1 to 6 weeks and followed by lifelong maintenance oral antibiotics. The median hospital stay was 27 days, with no hospital deaths. No paraplegia or other major complications occurred. Two patients with aortoesophageal fistula where the fistula tracts were persistent died during follow-up. The other five patients remained well, with no evidence of graft infection at a median follow-up of 34 months. A significant reduction in the diameter of the pseudoaneurysm (> 5 mm) was noted on computed tomography scans after 12 months.

40|$|Open {{repair of}} {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAAs) or occlusive disease can be complicated by pseudoaneurysm formation and aneurysmal dilatation of native vessels. Reports of reoperation for these new lesions have a mortality rate of 5 – 17 % electively, and 24 – 88 % if ruptured. These complications are commonly {{several years after}} initial repair, and progression of other comor-bidities can further complicate a repeat exploration. The authors reviewed 5 cases of late complications of open aortic bypass surgery treated with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> {{as an alternative to}} reexploration in patients with increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Over a 6 -year experience, 5 patients underwent <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> to repair paraanasto-motic aneurysms. Patient records were reviewed and clinical cardiac risk evaluation was per-formed. Follow-up clinic notes and computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated. Between October 1996 and February 2002, 5 patients underwent 6 endovascular procedures to repair paraanastomotic aneurysms. Mean period between interventions was 16. 6 ± 6. 27 years (range 10 – 25); mean age at endovascular procedure 74. 2 ± 6. 37 years (range 67 – 84). Cardiac clinical risk index increased in 80 % of patients by Goldman Risk Index and in 40 % by the Modified Cardiac Risk Index. On completion angiography, there was complete exclusion of the paraanas-tomotic aneurysms in all cases (100 %). Length of postoperative stay was 1. 5 ± 0. 547 days. Mean estimated blood loss at conclusion of endovascular procedure was 577 ± 546. 504 cc (range, 60 cc– 1, 500 cc). Mean follow-up was 24. 4 ± 24. 593 months (range, 5 – 67 months). On repeat imaging, all <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> remain patent without rupture or endoleak. <b>Endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> to repair late complications of open AAA repair is a viable alternative to reexploration in patients with significant comorbidities. These procedures can be performed without violating the previous surgical planes of sites. The operations can be performed under local anesthesia and with reduced hospitalizations.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{summarized}} all {{published studies}} for <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> placement among patients with type B aortic dissection in China {{with respect to}} clinical success, complications, and outcomes. MethodsA meta-analysis was performed on all published studies of retrograde <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> placement encompassing 3 or more patients with type B aortic dissection. Thirty-nine studies, involving a total of 1304 patients from January 2001 to December 2007, were included. ResultsThe average patient age was 52 years. Procedural success was reported in 99. 2 % ± 0. 1 % of patients. Major complications were reported in 3. 4 % ± 0. 1 % patients, with the most severe neurologic complications in 0. 6 %. Periprocedural stroke was encountered more frequently than paraplegia (0. 2 % vs 0 %). The overall 30 -day mortality was 2. 6 % ± 0. 1 %. In addition, 1. 5 % ± 0. 1 % of patients died over a mean follow-up period of 27. 1 ± 17. 5 months. Life-table analysis yielded overall survival rates of 96. 9 % at 30 days, 96. 7 % at 6 months, 96. 4 % at 1 year, 95. 6 % at 2 years, and 95. 2 % at 5 years.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} feasibility and safety of <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> for the treatment of patients with rupture of the descending thoracic aorta. Methods: Thirteen patients with rupture of the descending thoracic aorta were treated with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>grafting.</b> Six patients were treated on the day of diagnosis because their vital signs were unstable, and the other seven patients were treated electively. Five patients had infection or potential infection, and the other eight patients did not. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-covered or polyester-covered Z stents were used in all patients. Results: <b>Stent</b> <b>grafts</b> were successfully placed in all patients. No endoleaks were observed at the end of the procedure. However, rebleeding was observed within 2 weeks of the procedure in two patients with infection. Six patients (46 %) died within 5 months of the procedure (mean survival period, 61 ± 60 days). All five patients with infection (100 %) died, and only one of eight patients without infection (13 %) died (P <. 01). The remaining seven patients are alive during the mean follow-up period of 21 months (overall survival rate, 54 %), although additional surgical interventions, including surgical conversion in one case and upper extremity extraanatomic bypass in the other, were necessary in two of these patients. Conclusion: <b>Endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> may be a safe and feasible method for the treatment of rupture of the descending thoracic aorta in selected patients without infection.

40|$|Background: Aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is a {{critical}} clinical condition, which may present with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, with or without signs of sepsis. Conventional open surgical repair is associated with high morbidity and mortality. <b>Endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> repair has been attempted, but recurrent infection remains of major concern. We conducted a systematic review to assess potential factors associated with poor outcome after endovascular treatment. Methods: The English literature was searched using the MEDLINE electronic database up to April 2008. All studies reporting on the primary management of primary or secondary AEF with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> repair were considered. Results. Data were extracted from 33 reports that included 41 patients and were entered in the final analysis. Persistent/recurrent/new infection or recurrent hemorrhage developed in 44 % of the patients, after a mean follow-up period of 13 months (range, 0. 13 - 36). Secondary, as compared to primary, AEF had an almost threefold increased risk of persistent/recurrent infection.
