40|$|<b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} symptom in patients with parkinsonism, characterised by sudden and brief episodes of inability to produce effective forward stepping. These episodes typically occur during gait initiation or turning. Treatment is important because <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait is a major risk factor for falls in parkinsonism, {{and a source of}} disability to patients. Various treatment approaches exist, including pharmacological and surgical options, as well as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, but evidence is inconclusive for many approaches, and clear treatment protocols are not available. To address this gap, we review medical and non-medical treatment strategies for <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait and present a practical algorithm for the management of this disorder, based on a combination <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> when available, and clinical experience of the authors. Further research is needed to formally establish the merits of our proposed treatment protocol...|$|R

40|$|<b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait is a common, {{debilitating}} {{feature of}} Parkinson’s disease. We have studied gait planning {{in patients with}} <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait, using motor imagery of walking in combination with {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}}. This approach exploits the large neural overlap that exists between planning and imagining a movement. In addition, it avoids confounds introduced by brain responses to altered motor performance and somatosensory feedback during actual freezing episodes. We included 24 patients with Parkinson’s disease: 12 patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait, 12 matched patients without <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait and 21 matched healthy controls. Subjects performed two previously validated tasks—motor imagery of gait and a visual imagery control task. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, we quantified imagery performance by measuring the time required to imagine walking on paths of different widths and lengths. In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry to test whether between-group differences in imagery-related activity were related to structural differences. Imagery times indicated that patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait, patients without <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait and controls engaged in motor imagery of gait, with matched task performance. During motor imagery of gait, patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait showed more activity than patients without <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait in the mesencephalic locomotor region. Patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait also tended to have decreased responses in mesial frontal and posterior parietal regions. Furthermore, patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait had grey matter atrophy in {{a small portion of the}} mesencephalic locomotor region. The gait-related hyperactivity of the mesencephalic locomotor region correlated with clinical parameters (<b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait severity and disease duration), but not with the degree of atrophy. These results indicate that patients with Parkinson’s disease with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait have structural and functional alterations in the mesencephalic locomotor region. We suggest that <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait might emerge when altered cortical control of gait is combined with a limited ability of the mesencephalic locomotor region to react to that alteration. These limitations might become particularly evident during challenging events that require precise regulation of step length and gait timing, such as turning or initiating walking, which are known triggers for <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait is {{a common}} cause of {{disability}} and falls in patients with Parkinson's disease. We studied brain functional connectivity, by means of resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}}, in patients with Parkinson's disease and <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T was collected in 29 patients with Parkinson's disease, of whom 16 presented with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait as determined by a validated <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait questionnaire, and 15 matched healthy controls. Single-subject and group-level independent component analysis was used to identify the main resting-state networks differing between Parkinson's disease patients with and without <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait. Statistical analysis was performed using BrainVoyager QX. RESULTS: Between-group differences in resting-state networks revealed that patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait exhibit significantly reduced functional connectivity within both "executive-attention" (in the right middle frontal gyrus and in the angular gyrus) and visual networks (in the right occipito-temporal gyrus) [p < 0. 05 corrected for multiple comparisons]. <b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait clinical severity was significantly correlated with decreased connectivity within the two networks. Consistent with their "executive-attention" network impairment, patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait scored lower on tests of frontal lobe functions (phonemic verbal fluency: p = 0. 005; frontal assessment battery: p < 0. 001; ten point clock test: p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a resting-state functional connectivity disruption of "executive-attention" and visual neural networks may be associated with the development <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait in patients with Parkinson's disease...|$|R

40|$|Parkinson's disease {{patients}} with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait also experience sudden motor blocks (freezing) during other repetitive motor tasks. We assessed {{the proportion of}} {{patients with}} advanced PD and <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait who also displayed segmental "freezing" in tapping tasks. Fifteen Parkinson's disease patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait were assessed. <b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait was evaluated using a standardized gait trajectory with the usual triggers. Patients performed repetitive tapping movements (as described in the MDS-UPDRS task) with the hands or the feet in {{the presence or absence}} of a metronome set to 4 Hz. Movements were recorded with a video motion system. The primary endpoint was the occurrence <b>of</b> segmental <b>freezing</b> in these tapping tasks. The secondary endpoints were (i) the relationship between segmental episodic phenomena and FoG severity, and (ii) the reliability of the measurements. For the upper limbs, freezing was observed more frequently with a metronome (21 % of trials) than without a metronome (5 %). For the lower limbs, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> was higher than for the upper limbs, and was again observed more frequently in the presence of an auditory cue (47 %) than in its absence (14 %). Although <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> the lower limbs was easily assessed during an MDS-UPDRS task with a metronome, it was not correlated with the severity <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait (as evaluated during a standardized gait trajectory).

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} during <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> nanofluid droplets is of importance from a fundamental and practical viewpoint. While the <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> a water droplet {{has been extensively}} studied, little information is available about the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> a nanofluid droplet. Here, we report unique shape changes observed during the <b>freezing</b> process <b>of</b> a nanofluid droplet. Instead of forming a pointy tip on the frozen deionized water droplet, {{we found that the}} top of a frozen nanofluid droplet exhibits a flat plateau shape and such plateau becomes larger with increasing nanoparticle concentration. We ascribe this characteristic shape change to an outward Marangoni flow which moves liquid from the droplet interior to its vertexes, thus engendering the volume redistribution and shape changes. Moreover, we also observed a particle ring pattern formed during <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> a nanofluid droplet, which is similar to the well-known coffee stain phenomenon occurring during evaporation of a water droplet with dispersed particles.

It was hypothesized that the more limited the sensory information, the greater the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait. Nineteen patients with Parkinsoǹs disease who experience <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait (PD-FOG) walked through a doorway or into open space in complete darkness. The three doorway conditions included: (i) FRAME (DARK) – walking through the remembered door frame; (ii) FRAME- walking through the door with the door frame illuminated; (iii) FRAME+BODY- walking through the door (both the door and the limbs illuminated). Additionally, two conditions of walking away from the doorway included: (iv) NO FRAME (DARK) - walking into open space; (v) NO FRAME+BODY- walking into open space with the limbs illuminated, to evaluate whether perception (or fear) of the doorway might account for FOG behaviour. Key outcome measures included: the number <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait episodes recorded, total duration <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait, and the percentage of time spent frozen. Significantly more <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait episodes occurred when participants walked toward the doorway in complete darkness compared to walking into open space (p, 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: <b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait is a {{frequently}} disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease, poorly {{responding to}} dopaminergic treatment. We investigated the short-term {{effectiveness of a}} rehabilitation protocol in parkinsonian patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait. Design: Prospective, uncontrolled pilot study with open label design. Setting: Outpatient service for rehabilitation of neurological disorders. Subjects: Twelve patients (8 male, 4 female; aged 59 - 78 years; Hoehn-Yahr stage: 2 - 3; mean disease duration: 14. 2 +SD 4. 1 years). Interventions: Patients attended three (45 min) sessions every week, over a sixweek period, of physical therapy focused to improve balance, postural control and walking, and to learn new strategies for overcoming <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait. Main outcome measures: Patients were evaluated before (TO), at the end (Ti), and one month after (T 2) rehabilitation by means of clinical rating scales (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale - Motor Section; <b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> Gait Questionnaire; Parkinson Disease Quality of Life Score) and gait parameters (number of strides, stride length and velocity) during a standardized walking test. Results: The scores <b>of</b> <b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> Gait Questionnaire and of Parkinson Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (but not of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale- Motor Section) were significantly improved after treatment (Ti).
