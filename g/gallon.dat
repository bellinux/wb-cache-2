5|$|The {{imperial}} and US systems {{differ in}} the size of the basic unit (the <b>gallon</b> or the pint, one <b>gallon</b> being equal to eight pints), and in the number of fluid ounces per pint. Apothecaries' systems for volumes were internationally much less common than those for weights. Before introduction of the imperial units in the UK, all apothecaries' measures were based on the wine <b>gallon,</b> which survived in the US under the name liquid <b>gallon</b> or wet <b>gallon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{higher the}} sugar {{content of the}} sap, the fewer the gallons of sap are needed to obtain one <b>gallon</b> of syrup. 57 gallons of sap with 1.5% sugar content will yield 1 <b>gallon</b> of syrup, but only 25 gallons of sap with a 3.5% sugar content are needed to obtain one <b>gallon</b> of syrup. The sap's sugar content is highly {{variable}} and will fluctuate even within the same tree.|$|E
5|$|The wine <b>gallon</b> was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial <b>gallon.</b> Since the imperial <b>gallon</b> is 20% more than the liquid <b>gallon,</b> {{the same is true for}} the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per <b>gallon</b> had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% less than the US fluid ounce, and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E

The pumping plant at El Abd pumped 405,000 <b>gallons</b> to Mazar where 75,000 <b>gallons</b> were required by the railway and troops. The pumping plant at Mazar pumped 330,000 <b>gallons</b> to El Arish where 100,000 <b>gallons</b> were required by the railway and troops. El Arish distributed 230,000 <b>gallons</b> to the area east of the town while 100,000 <b>gallons</b> were shipped by railway to Deir el Belah. The pumping plant at El Arish pumped 130,000 <b>gallons</b> on to Rafa where 93,500 <b>gallons</b> were required for the railway, leaving 36,500 <b>gallons</b> available.

5|$|Several other {{oral traditions}} about the castle survive. One of these {{involves}} a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing {{the key to}} her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile. Another centres on a man called <b>Gallon</b> who was left {{in charge of the}} castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six Venetian glasses. The historian Katrina Porteous has noted that in the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the <b>Gallon</b> of this story.|$|E

5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003.

Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account for the cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per <b>gallon,</b> whereas the Air Force had failed to account for the cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per <b>gallon.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{prototype}} E850 named Lord Nelson {{was ordered}} from Eastleigh railway works in June 1925 but production proceeded slowly, at Maunsellâ€™s insistence, {{to ensure that}} the weight was kept to a minimum at every stage, so the locomotive did not appear until August 1926. It was tested on a variety of duties over the next year, with sufficiently encouraging results for an initial order for ten more locomotives for delivery between May 1928 and April 1929 to be placed. These were originally scheduled to be allocated to Battersea depot and fitted with 4,000 <b>gallon</b> 6-wheeled tenders suitable for the Continental ports. However, during construction, it was decided to equip half of the class with 5,000 <b>gallon</b> 8-wheeled tenders necessary for the longer West of England routes and to allocate them to Nine Elms depot. A further batch of ten locomotives was ordered in 1928, before the previous batch had been delivered, but when it became apparent that the Stock Market Crash of 1929 would be likely to reduce the demand for Continental travel, this second order was reduced to five.|$|E
