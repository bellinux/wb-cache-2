40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to evolve a bleak {{landscape}} into something that the home owner can appreciate and love. This project will demonstrate the knowledge of this process to provide {{as a guide for}} others. This project gives an overview of all aspects of a landscape project including: drawings of an <b>irrigation</b> <b>layout,</b> planting plan, drainage plan, and a construction plan. This project takes place in Riverbank, California, which is located in the Central Valley. The property’s main centerpiece is a pool and adjacent waterfall. However, the landscape currently surrounding the pool is very bare and lacks aesthetic appeal. This location is subject to scorching heat in the summer and freezing temperatures in the winter. Dealing with vast temperature fluctuations requires consideration in choosing ideal plant species. Also, an estimate plan and maintenance plan was constructed in accordance to the design. In addition, this project should serve as a template for someone interested in hiring someone to design, install, and maintain residential landscapes...|$|E
40|$|It covers {{an area of}} {{approximately}} 150, 000 acres, of which 24, 000 are planted to sugar cane, including 42 Settler farmers. The climate is somewhat different from other sugarcane growing areas of the world. With an annual rainfall of about 20 inches, restricted mainly to the months of November to March, mean monthly temperatures vary from 80 °F in November to 60 °F in June, and diurnal temperature ranges of up to 40 °F. 30 °F are very common. Maxinlunl temperatures of 108 °F and minimum of 32 °F have been recorded. Generally speaking the atmosphere is dry, except during the rainy season. About 80 % of the sugar cane is grown on reddish brown fine grained sandy clay loams derived from Paragneiss. The rest is either on deep forest sands or dark heavy active clays of basaltic origin. The pH varies from neutral to alkaline on the Paragneiss to very alkaline in the basaltic clays. Full irrigation is being practised and the yearly water consuniption averages 6. 5 acre feet including rainfall {{and is based on}} Class "A " pan evaporation figures. The water comes from a large storage dam of a maximum capacity of 1, 100, 000 acre feet and is of almost perfect quality for sugarcane and, indeed, any crop. It reaches the fields through an extensive system of concrete-lined canals and then fed into a furrow <b>irrigation</b> <b>layout</b> based on a contour system, with an average slope of 1 : 150. Only two varieties are grown on a commercial scale. N:Co. 310 and N:Co. 376. Many varieties have been imported and are being tested. Those showing signs of promise such as Co 462, B 4362, B 42231, CB 38 / 22 and M 31 / 45 are being bulked up to produce sufficient cane for a long factory mill test. Many more varieies have been included in trials but have been rejected because of their susceptibility to either or both of the major diseases of Hipp...|$|E
40|$|The current energy {{situation}} {{in the world where}} most of the energy needed is generated from non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels is no longer sustainable. During few years, nonrenewable sources have become an interesting solution to provide energy to areas with small needs of electricity, rather than using non-renewable sources. Therefore, this project has pursued to implement photovoltaics panels to supply energy in a rural region in central Africa, contributing {{to the development of the}} area and proving that this technology is viable to pump water for irrigation instead of the conventional electric grid. A rural area between Kidogo Lake and Rilima town, in Bugesera district of Rwanda, has been chosen as target. This analysis has focused on typical plantations of the country, being the main crops banana, cassava and maize, each one with very similar maximum water needs; 71 m 3 /ha_day, 70 m 3 /ha_day and 67 m 3 /ha_day, respectively. The eastern province of Rwanda is formed by seven districts. A preliminary study was developed in order to find the target area in terms of weather conditions, high temperature and low rainfall. Therefore, parameters such as precipitation, solar irradiance and evapotranspiration, among others, have been crucial for deciding the driest zone. Indeed, the Bugesera district is an ideal candidate due to the reception of a large amount of solar irradiation, with an annual average of 5, 28 kWh/m 2 _day. In order to dimension the photovoltaic and water-pumping system, a preliminary research including a large amount of background was required to determine the best structure. Indeed, knowing the water demand, we decided the water should be pumped up into a tank, letting it irrigate the field via gravitation only. A sample <b>irrigation</b> <b>layout</b> was then designed to ensure that with a number of pipes, water was conveyed to every plant. The use of a tank not only for storing water, but also as a source of system’s pressure lead us to calculate the minimum distance from the ground to the bottom. The height obtained of 2, 2 meters provides the necessary pressure to distribute water and irrigate the field. With the energy needed for the water supply, a photovoltaic pumping system, consisting of a PV generator, inverter and pump, was selected. Our main findings was that the photovoltaic system must have a rated power of 1, 73 kW in order to guarantee proper functioning. For the photovoltaic system, six STP 290 - 24 /Vd solar modules from Suntech were chosen, for the water pumping system, a B 50 Electric Drive from the company BBA Pumps. Moreover, and regarding the inverter system, model Galvo 1. 5 - 1 from company Fronius with a nominal output power capacity of 1. 500 watts was chosen...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{irrigation}} currently {{accounts for}} 70 - 80 % of irrigation water use in Australia and surface application {{is by far}} the dominant irrigation method applied throughout the world. However, water use efficiencies with surface irrigation methods tend to be low. In recent years a number of surface irrigation simulation models for assessing surface irrigation system performance have been developed. One of the most commonly used models SIRMOD, developed by Utah State University, has seen wide use and evaluation throughout the world particularly by researchers and has been shown to offer potential for increasing surface irrigation water use efficiencies. Considerable efforts are now being undertaken to move use of the model from the realm of a research domain to the farmer domain. Maximum benefit from the use of such models will only occur when farmers have the ability to use Decision Support Systems (DSS) such as SIRMOD in a near real time environment i. e. for individual irrigations. An extensive field investigation of the model was undertaken on a range of <b>irrigation</b> <b>layouts</b> and two different soil types commonly found in south eastern Australia. The regression analysis of measured infiltrated volumes showed a strong correlation with modeled results (Figure 1 r 2 = 0. 9474). The SIRMOD simulation model was found to adequately predict furrow irrigation characteristics on <b>irrigation</b> <b>layouts</b> and soil conditions typically found in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA). Comparisons of infiltrated volumes predicted by SIRMOD with measured infiltrated volumes gave a strong relationship providing confidence that SIRMOD was able to adequately model furrow irrigation systems typically used in the MIA. y = 1. 0658...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} work {{was carried out}} at El-Gemmeiza Agricultural Research Station, Gharbia Governorate,Egypt during 2009 / 2010 winter growing season to study the effect of using sprinkler irrigation in clay soil condition and barley production. The sprinklers layouts were square and triangular. Also, two irrigation levels and two fertilizers levels were used. The {{results showed that the}} amounts of applied water were 5077, 4201 and 3068 m 3 ha- 1 for flood and sprinkler 100 % ETc and 50 % ETc, respectively. The highest values of coefficient of uniformity, distribution uniformity and application efficiency of low quarter were achieved by the square layout. Grain yield increased from 4. 55 Mg ha- 1 with flood to 5. 70 Mg ha- 1 under sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> with square <b>layout</b> at 100 % ETc and 100 % fertilizer. Straw yield increased from 5. 36 Mg ha- 1 with flood to 9. 65 Mg ha- 1 under sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> with square <b>layout</b> at 100 % ETc and 100 % fertilizer. Water use efficiency increased from 0. 90 kg m- 3 with flood to 1. 64 kg m- 3 under sprinkling method with triangular layout at 50 % ETc and 100 % fertilizer. Energy use efficiency increased from 13. 66 kg kW- 1 h- 1 with flood to 18. 20 kg kW- 1 h- 1 under sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> with triangular <b>layout</b> at 50 % ETc and 100 % fertilizer.

The genotyping cost was calculated for the whole population across successive generations (F 3 to F 7 /F 8) and compared with the genotyping cost (F 3 to F 7 /F 8) considering only the QTL classes that performed better in F 3. The genotyping cost was calculated considering five markers per QTL (one peak/near the peak, two right-hand-side flanking markers, and two left-hand-side flanking markers) using USD 0.50 per data point (Xu et al. 2002; Xu 2010).|$|R
40|$|The Aba’ala spate {{irrigation}} systems, {{traditional and}} modern, have experienced {{different set of}} floodwater and sediment management problems. Despite the dire need of alternative spate <b>irrigation</b> system <b>layout,</b> operational strategy and locally maintainable structures, efforts made to manage floodwater and control sedimentation had been structural. Hence, {{the study was conducted}} to evaluate the existing flood and sediment management practices and identify alternative options for optimum management of floods and sediments in Aba’ala plain. Primary data including discharge, sediments and river cross-sections were collected through direct field measurement. Interviews and focal group discussions were also employed to understand the operational and maintenance activities. Delft 3 D model was used to simulate flow and sedimentation under different scenarios. For the existing condition, the model showed high sediment deposition and low flood water abstraction. The floodwater diverted is 2. 1 and 1. 16 Mm 3 from the traditional intake and 1. 52 and 0. 51 Mm 3 from the modern intake at medium and low floods respectively which is far below the required 2. 8 Mm 3 of water. Under Scenario-II, the modern intake diversion capacity is improved to 5. 38 and 2. 36 Mm 3 at medium and low floods. However, a water level decline of 15 cm is observed at the downstream traditional intake which could be a cause for conflict between upstream and downstream users. Under Scenario-III, the diversion capacity of the modern intake is increased to 6. 23 and 2. 67 Mm 3 at medium and low floods respectively. Moreover, no decline in water level is shown at the downstream intake...|$|R
40|$|In this work, maize (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were {{irrigated}} in two adjoining plots {{with the}} same sprinkler solid-set system. Irrigation was evaluated between four sprinklers in the central position within each plot, above the canopy with pluviometers and in the soil with a FDR probe. Maize and alfalfa were simultaneously irrigated under the same operational and technical conditions during two seasons: in 2005, the solid-set <b>irrigation</b> system <b>layout</b> was rectangular, 15 Â m between sprinklers along the irrigation line and 15 Â m among lines (R 15 Â xÂ  15), and the seasonal irrigation applied according to the crop evapotranspiration (ETc); in 2006, the solid-set layout was R 18 Â xÂ  15 and the seasonal irrigation was around 30 % lower than the ETc. The irrigation depth above the canopies (IDC) and the soil water recharge after irrigation (RW) were monitored using a 3 Â mÂ xÂ  3 Â m grid (25 points in 2005 and in 30 points in 2006). For maize, RW was assessed both in the lines of plants (CL) and between the lines (BCL). The average values of IDC were similar between crops during both seasons but the uniformity (CUC) of the IDC noticeably depended on the crop: the differences were greater between crops than between sprinklers spacings (R 15 Â xÂ  15 and R 18 Â xÂ  15). The CUC of IDC, the RW and the CUC of RW were greater for alfalfa than for maize. The CUC of IDC was greater than the CUC of RW for both crops. The RW was significantly related with the IDC throughout the irrigation season for alfalfa. The correlation was weaker for maize, with important differences between positions and between growth stages. At {{the beginning of the}} season, the RW significantly correlated with the IDC, both in the CL and BCL positions. However, the correlation weakened when the maize grew, especially in the CL, because the maize plants redistributed the water. The results show that the height and canopy architecture of the crop must be considered in the analysis of the sprinkler water distribution as factors influencing the irrigation performance.
