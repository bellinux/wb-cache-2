Colonies are then developed, and screened with fluorescently–labelled oligonucleotide sequences that will hybridize to a microsatellite repeat, if present on the DNA segment. If positive clones {{can be obtained from}} this procedure, the DNA is sequenced and PCR primers are chosen from sequences flanking such regions to determine a specific locus. This process involves significant trial and error on the part of researchers, as microsatellite repeat sequences must be predicted and primers that are randomly isolated may not display significant polymorphism. Microsatellite loci are widely distributed throughout the genome and can be isolated from semi-degraded DNA of older specimens, as all that is needed is a suitable substrate for amplification through PCR.|$|E
25|$|The Milk River Natural Area {{is part of}} the Grasslands Natural Region, one of six natural {{regions in}} Alberta. Within the Grasslands Region, it {{is part of the}} Dry Mixedgrass Natural Subregion, {{characterized}} by the most arid conditions in Alberta, with hot summers, cold winters with little snow cover, and high evaporation leaving a large moisture deficit in the growing season. Annual precipitation averages less than 300mm (12 inches). Soils of the area are primarily solonetzic and brown chernozemic. At the next sub-level, {{it is part of the}} Northwestern Glaciated Plains Ecoregion, the predominant ecoregion throughout the Milk River watershed. With its diverse landscape of grasslands, shrubs, badlands, wetlands, and riparian woodlands, the Milk River Natural Area supports a large number of rare, threatened, and endangered species in a relatively small amount of space. Overall, 80% of Alberta's species at risk are concentrated in the Milk River Watershed area as a whole. Fire is a significant ecological process, with the last large wildfire having occurred in August 2007. It was caused by a lightning strike in Montana and crossed the international border, but was quickly suppressed after burning 125 hectares of the natural area and 38 hectares in neighboring Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve. As a relatively large and undisturbed representation of natural mixedgrass containing rare or unique landforms, habitat for <b>focal</b> <b>species,</b> and intact riparian areas, it has been identified as an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) with national significance.|$|E

40|$|Niche {{theory is}} central to {{understanding}} how species respond geographically to climate change. It defines a species' realized niche in a biological community, its fundamental niche as determined by physiology, and its potential niche [...] the fundamental niche in a given environment or geographic space. However, most predictions {{of the effects of}} climate change on species' distributions are limited to correlative models of the realized niche, which assume that species are in distributional equilibrium with respect to the variables or gradients included in the model. Here, I present a mechanistic niche model that measures species' responses to major seasonal temperature gradients that interact with the physiology of the organism. I then use lethal physiological temperatures to parameterize the model for bird species in North and South America and show that most <b>focal</b> bird <b>species</b> are not in direct physiological equilibrium with the gradients. Results also show that most <b>focal</b> bird <b>species</b> possess broad thermal tolerances encompassing novel climates that could become available with climate change.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the effect of {{diversity}} surrounding a <b>focal</b> plant <b>species</b> on the belowground community under that species. At least two alternative hypotheses exist. First, studies involving a range of ecosystems and taxonomic groups have shown that changes in diversity in one group of species can promote diversity in other groups. Alternatively, many studies in soil ecology have shown that belowground communities are strongly determined by the dominant aboveground species. To better understand the role of aboveground diversity on belowground communities, we examined soil nematode communities directly under Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) in areas of high and low surrounding plant diversity. We found that soil nematode diversity under switchgrass in areas of high plant diversity (native prairies) was not significantly different from soil nematode diversity under switchgrass in areas of extremely low plant diversity (switchgrass monocultures), indicating that an agricultural monoculture can maintain high levels of belowground diversity on a plant scale. However, reduced plant diversity surrounding focal switchgrass plants resulted in a compositional shift in the belowground community toward fewer herbivorous nematodes. This evidence for the influence of surrounding diversity on belowground communities under a <b>focal</b> plant <b>species</b> is a major shift in perspective from the conventional view on belowground community ecology. Furthermore, the work has broad implications for ecological perspectives on agricultural systems...|$|R

30|$|Weather {{and ocean}} {{conditions}} vary {{from year to}} year and this could have explained why some of our results showed annual differences. Still, most patterns were consistent {{from year to year}}. Decadal differences between our data and the data of McCrary and Pierson (2002) were mixed for their six <b>focal</b> shorebird <b>species.</b> In contrast, Ventura Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs) show consistent increases in counts for the period after McCrary and Pierson’s (2002) study through the last year of our surveys, indicating that declines in willet and black-bellied plover have not been gradual over this time. One possible explanation is the strong ENSO in the winter of 1997 - 1998 led to a decline and eventual recovery of shorebirds. This hypothesis cannot be evaluated in Ventura county because the Ventura CBC data started after the ENSO and the data of McCrary and Pierson (2002) predate the ENSO. However, in neighboring Santa Barbara County, the CBC extends farther back in time and indicates that the ENSO was associated with sharp drops in the six <b>focal</b> shorebird <b>species.</b> Trends in these shorebirds over time have been positive since the 1997 - 1998 El Nino in both the Santa Barbara and Ventura CBCs. So, although snowy plover, marbled godwit, and whimbrel eventually exceeded the immediate pre-El Nino period sampled by McCrary and Pierson (2002), willet and black-bellied plover have been slower to recover. Although an ENSO effect seems plausible, we cannot, from the available data, determine if there have been any additional human-induced changes in shorebirds over the last decade in Ventura County.|$|R

40|$|Amazonian {{tropical}} rainforests harbor {{the largest}} biodiversity on Earth. Over the past decade, {{there has been}} increasing interest in understanding how such diversity can coexist in small areas. One broadly accepted explanation is the Negative Density Dependence hypothesis (NDD) that promotes species coexistence through a spacing mechanism that prevents species from becoming locally abundant. This may happen due to seedling mortality caused by intraspecific competition, or the attack of natural enemies. However, there are organisms such as particular plant tree species that are adapted to live in aggregation. How does this particular group of plants cope with the above mentioned survival constraints? A potential mechanism would be the efficient use of nutrients mainly coming from their own litter resources that are invested by plants in growing and defense. If that is so, one would expect detritivore communities within the sites of plants aggregation {{to be different from}} what is found outside these microhabitats. Here, using two different sampling methodologies, we provide a detailed description of soil fauna community diversity in areas of aggregation of six common tree species in the Yasuní National Park (Amazonian Ecuador). We hypothesized that (i) both capture methodologies used in our survey (i. e. Winkler extraction and pitfall traps) are complementary between them in terms of species composition; (ii) the ‘litter transformers’ guild represents the largest portion of the soil invertebrate fauna in both, the number of species and abundance; and (iii) soil fauna communities in areas of plants aggregation are significantly different {{in terms of the number}} of species, composition, abundance and functionality, compared to the sites where the <b>focal</b> plant <b>species</b> are absent. Agreeing with our hypotheses, our results showed that Amazonian soil fauna are predominantly represented by species included within the litter transformers functional group (65 % of total collection), and they are clustered in small-scale patches and specific to the areas of aggregation of our <b>focal</b> plant <b>species.</b> This suggests that plant species living in aggregation may create microhabitats that promote the association of particular soil fauna species that may be adapted to exploit specific combinations of nutrients in the Yasuní forest floor...|$|R
40|$|Five {{species of}} {{reptiles}} present in tropical Australia are considered in this study. These are the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata); the northern long-necked turtle (Chelodina rugosa); the taipan snake (Oxyuranus scutellatus); the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnstoni); and the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). Background information is provided on the ecological status {{of each of}} these species and after outlining their human use (including commercial use) and management in Australia, an experimental survey method is introduced and results from its application are reported and analysed. The survey method involves two serial surveys of a sample of 204 Brisbane (Australia) residents. The first survey is based on the initial knowledge of the respondents of the reptile species and for the subsequent survey the knowledge available to participants about these species is experimentally increased. These surveys provide information on the amount of knowledge possessed by this sample of the public about the relevant reptile species, the respondents’ attitudes to these species (including their attitudes to commercial use), respondents’ support for the survival of these reptiles and for their conservation. Furthermore, data is gathered from the surveys on the comparative amount respondents’ state they would be prepared to contribute to support the conservation {{of each of these}} <b>focal</b> reptile <b>species.</b> Respondents are asked to assume that they are given $ 1, 000 and that this can only be allocated to the conservation of these reptiles. Later, however, they are also given the option to donate this money to any charity concerned with human welfare. The contingent valuation data for each of the reptile species are used to isolate factors that influence the comparative allocation of conservation funds to each of the relevant reptile species.

Ventura County CBC data were available for December 1997 - December 2010 (National Audubon Society 2011). These surveys were not matched to our sites so they were not directly compared to our data.

We partitioned herbivores' total effects on seaweeds into their consumptive and facilitative effects and evaluated how community context (the presence of another seaweed species) modified the effects of Littorina on a <b>focal</b> seaweed <b>species.</b> Ulva, the more palatable species, enhanced the facilitative effects of Littorina on Fucus.
