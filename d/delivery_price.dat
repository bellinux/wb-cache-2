40|$|Online grocers accept {{delivery}} bookings {{and have}} to deliver groceries to consumers' residences. Grocery stores operate on very thin margins. Therefore, a critical question that an online grocery store needs to address {{is the cost of}} home delivery operations. In this paper, we develop a Markov decision process-based pricing model that recognizes the need to balance utilization of delivery capacity by the grocer and the need to have the goods delivered at the most convenient time for the customer. The model dynamically adjusts <b>delivery</b> <b>prices</b> as customers arrive and make choices. The optimal prices have the following properties. First, the optimal prices are such that the online grocer gains the same expected payoff in the remaining booking horizon, regardless of the delivery option independently chosen by a consumer. Second, with unit order sizes, <b>delivery</b> <b>prices</b> can increase due to dynamic substitution effects as there is less time left in the booking horizon.

The fact that forwards are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the underlying asset, a large differential can build up between the forward's <b>delivery</b> <b>price</b> and the settlement price, and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.|$|E

This means that the [...] "mark-to-market" [...] calculation would requires the holder of {{one side of the}} future to pay $2 on day 51 to track the changes of the forward price ("post $2 of margin").

40|$|We {{consider}} a linear city model where both firms and consumers have to incur transport costs. Following a standard Hotelling (1929) type framework we analyze a duopoly where firms facing {{a continuum of}} consumers choose locations and prices, with the transportation rate being linear in distance. From a theoretical point of view such a model is interesting since mill <b>pricing</b> and uniform <b>delivery</b> <b>pricing</b> arise as special cases. Given the complex nature of the profit function for the two-stage transport cost sharing game, we invoke simplifying assumptions and solve for two different games. We provide a complete characterization for the equilibrium of the location game between the duopolists by removing the price choice from the strategy space. We then find that if the two firms are constrained to locate at the same spot, the resulting price competition leads to a mixed strategy equilibrium with discriminatory rationing. In equilibrium both firms always have positive expected profits. Finally, we derive a pure strategy equilibrium for the two-stage game. Results are then compared with the mill <b>pricing</b> and uniform <b>delivery</b> <b>pricing</b> models. Spatial competition; Cost sharing...|$|R
40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{challenges}} due to increasing peak load, an optimal day-ahead scheduling problem for social welfare maximization is proposed, in which not only the comfort level of consumers and costs of power suppliers but also the power losses in transmission and operation costs of transmission owners are taken into account. Then this optimal day-ahead scheduling problem is reformulated and solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), by which fast convergence is guaranteed and the privacy of participants is ensured, in a distributed manner. Specifically, in the proposed distributed optimal day-ahead scheduling, the hourly prices for consumers are divided into hourly supply <b>prices</b> and hourly <b>delivery</b> <b>prices,</b> which will be updated by the independent system operator based on the hourly demand-supply situations and hourly demand-delivery situations, respectively. And the consumers, power suppliers, and transmission owners make their individual optimal day-ahead scheduling based on their individual hourly prices, hourly supply <b>prices,</b> and hourly <b>delivery</b> <b>prices,</b> respectively, until the hourly demand-supply balances and hourly demand-delivery balances are achieved. Effectiveness of the proposed distributed optimal day-ahead scheduling is verified by the cases studied...|$|R

40|$|Current {{shipping}} pricing for BTO notebooks on Dell. com is uniform across {{products and}} provides customers with {{three levels of}} service Express, Expedited, and Standard. In October 2016, Dell launched a program to give customers more information and better choices when they select their shipping method {{with the goal of}} improving the customer order experience. The goal of this research was to develop an optimization model that will recommend shipping prices to maximize the value that Dell realizes across three levers: customer experience, profitability, and working capital. The value of customer experience is measured by the cost of customer dissatisfaction associated with different shipping levels including the cost of returns, exchanges, customer contacts, and order disruptions. Key components of logistics profitability are logistics costs and shipping price. Dell does not have current shipping price elasticity data to forecast attach rates to upgraded shipping at different price points. To collect this data, an experiment has been designed to measure the results of three price treatments across three BTO product brands. This experiment is scheduled to launch in summer 2017. The optimization model would have to be updated following the results of this experiment and rerun before implementation of changes to <b>delivery</b> <b>pricing.</b> The third lever of the model, working capital, becomes increasingly important as customers move to the new fastest shipping option, Express, which was first launched in October 2016. This lane provides the fastest delivery times on BTO products in the industry. It also reduces the number of days the product is in Dell inventory leading to an inverse relationship between express shipping attach rate and working capital required. Finally, it allows Dell to bill the customer faster improving their cash conversion cycle. The optimization model indicated that there is the opportunity to increase delivery value by 28 % through reduced <b>delivery</b> <b>pricing</b> leading to increased attach rates. This value based approach to <b>delivery</b> <b>pricing</b> can be applied across industries to online retailers looking to create value through their <b>delivery</b> <b>pricing.</b> by Carrie Beyer.
