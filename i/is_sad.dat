25|$|Behavioral {{disorders}} {{are difficult to}} study in animal models because {{it is difficult to}} know what animals are thinking and because animal models used to assess psychopathologies are experimental preparations developed to study a condition.

25|$|The art {{of playing}} the dhak is now being {{referred}} to as a dying profession,this <b>is</b> <b>sad</b> but true. While some of the dhakis may be lucky to retain old contacts, many are facing a decline and some are moving away from the traditional profession. Take the example of the seventy dhaki families in Amrul, a village in Bankura district. Ancestors of the dhakis were on the rolls of Malla kings of Bishnupur. Daily pujas were organised for the deities in the palace and the dhakis played a significant role. Times have changed. One of them was offered Rs. 800 for playing the dhak for five days. It is a pittance. Some of the younger generation even took to work as shoe shine boys, but the older generation still has pride in being artists. They look down upon such misadventures of the younger generation, but do not have an alternative before themselves.|$|E
