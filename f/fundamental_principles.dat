5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic. The German {{political system}} operates under a framework {{laid out in}} the 1949 constitutional document known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the <b>fundamental</b> <b>principles</b> of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, {{and the rule of law}} are valid in perpetuity.|$|E
5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was split {{on whether to}} purge its leadership of communists. Norman Thomas, John Haynes Holmes, and Morris Ernst were anti-communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were Harry Ward, Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was {{considered by many to}} be a betrayal of its <b>fundamental</b> <b>principles.</b> The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Karmal was {{promoted}} to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Principles</b> of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki's and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the Afghan people.|$|E

5|$|Karmal's {{three most}} {{important}} promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Principles</b> of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and {{the adoption of a}} new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, {{with the exception of the}} general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to <b>fundamental</b> <b>principles</b> of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from <b>fundamental</b> <b>principles,</b> such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E
