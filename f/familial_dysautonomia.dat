2500|$|Scoliosis {{associated}} with known syndromes is often subclassified as [...] "syndromic scoliosis". Scoliosis can be {{associated with}} amniotic band syndrome, Arnold–Chiari malformation, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, cerebral palsy, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia,</b> CHARGE syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hyperflexibility, [...] "floppy baby" [...] syndrome, and other variants of the condition), fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, hemihypertrophy, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, nail–patella syndrome, neurofibromatosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, Prader–Willi syndrome, proteus syndrome, spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy and syringomyelia.|$|E
2500|$|When an {{affected}} {{individual has}} fully developed the three clinical elements of uric acid overproduction, neurologic dysfunction, and {{cognitive and behavioral}} disturbances, diagnosis of LNS is easily made. [...] Diagnosis is less easy in the early stages, when the three features are not yet obvious. Suspicion often comes about when the developmental delay of the individual is associated with hyperuricemia. Otherwise, the diagnosis should be alleged when developmental delay is associated with kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) or blood in the urine (hematuria), caused by uric acid stones. For the most part, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is first suspected when self-inflicted injury behavior develops. However, self-injurious behaviors occur in other conditions, including nonspecific intellectual disability, autism, Rett syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Tourette syndrome, <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia,</b> choreoacanthocytosis, sensory neuropathy including hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1, and several psychiatric conditions. Of these, only individuals with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, de Lange syndrome, and <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> recurrently display loss of tissue as a consequence. Biting the fingers and lips is a definitive feature of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; in other syndromes associated with self-injury, the behaviors usually consist of head banging and nonspecific self-mutilation, but not biting of the cheeks, lips and fingers. Lesch–Nyhan syndrome ought to be clearly considered only when self-injurious behavior takes place in conjunction with hyperuricemia and neurological dysfunction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} {{that affects the}} development and survival of certain nerve cells. The disorder disturbs cells in the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary actions such as digestion, breathing, production of tears, and the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. It also affects the sensory nervous system, which controls activities related to the senses, such as taste {{and the perception of}} pain, heat, and cold. <b>Familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> is also called hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, type III.|$|E
5000|$|Diseases {{categorized}} as primary autonomic failure usually include pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. Many scientists also categorize Parkinson disease and <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> as [...] "primary".|$|E
50|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the IKBKAP gene. Nearly all individuals with <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> have two copies of the same mutation in each cell, which causes part of the IKBKAP gene to be skipped during transcription. (This alteration is often called exon skipping.) This skipping mutation results in a decreased amount of IKAP protein in their cells. This mutation, however, behaves inconsistently. As a result, some cells produce near normal amounts of IKAP protein, and other cells (particularly cells in the nervous system) have very little IKAP protein.|$|E
50|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> is seen almost {{exclusively}} in Ashkenazi Jews and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Both parents must be carriers {{in order for a}} child to be affected. The carrier frequency in Jewish individuals of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) ancestry is about 1/30, while the carrier frequency in non-Jewish individuals is unknown. If both parents are carriers, there is a one in four, or 25%, chance with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing is recommended for families who may be carriers of <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormalities of sensory and sympathetic neurons. The SCG is significantly {{affected by this}} loss of neurons and {{may be responsible for}} some of the resulting symptoms. In post-mortem studies the SCG is, on average, one-third of normal size and has only 12 percent of the normal number of neurons. Defects in the genetic coding for NGF, which result in less functional, abnormally structured NGF, may be the molecular cause of <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia.</b> NGF is necessary for survival of some neurons so loss of NGF function could be the cause for neuronal death in the SCG.|$|E
50|$|Prenatal {{testing for}} several genetic {{diseases}} is offered as commercial panels for Ashkenazi couples by both CIGNA and Quest Diagnostics.

The Quest panel is for parental/preconception testing and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia,</b> Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, Neimann-Pick disease types A and B and Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{recommendations of}} the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is that Ashkenazi individuals be offered screening for Tay Sachs, Canavan, cystic fibrosis, and <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> as part of routine obstetrical care.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all {{individuals}} with <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> have {{two copies of}} the same IKBKAP gene mutation in each cell. This mutation can disrupt how information in the IKBKAP gene is pieced {{together to make a}} blueprint for the production of IKAP protein. As a result of this error, a reduced amount of normal IKAP protein is produced. This mutation behaves inconsistently, however. Some cells produce near normal amounts of the protein, and other cells—particularly brain cells—have very little of the protein. Critical activities in brain cells are probably disrupted by reduced amounts or the absence of IKAP protein, leading to the signs and symptoms of <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> (Riley-Day syndrome), {{which causes}} vomiting, speech problems, an {{inability}} to cry, and false sensory perception, is almost exclusive to Ashkenazi Jews; Ashkenazi Jews are almost 100 {{times more likely to}} carry the disease than anyone else.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{mutations}} in the IKBKAP gene lead to the {{signs and symptoms of}} <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia.</b> Critical activities in brain and nerve cells are probably disrupted by reduced amounts or the absence of functional IKAP protein.|$|E
50|$|Current {{research}} efforts also include directing the fate {{and age of}} human pluripotent stem cells, and using pluripotent stem cells as valuable tools for modeling human diseases such as <b>Familial</b> <b>Dysautonomia,</b> Hirschsprung's disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as melanocyte-related diseases.|$|E

50|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> is {{the result}} of {{mutations}} in IKBKAP gene on chromosome 9, which encodes for the IKAP protein (IkB kinase complex-associated protein). There have been three mutations in IKBKAP identified in individuals with FD. The most common FD-causing mutation occurs in intron 20 of the donor gene. Conversion of T→C in intron 20 of the donor gene resulted in shift splicing that generates an IKAP transcript lacking exon 20. Translation of this mRNA results in a truncated protein lacking all of the amino acids encoded by exons 20-37. Another less common mutation is a G→C conversion resulting in one amino acid mutation in 696, where Proline substitutes normal Arginine. The decreased amount of functional IKAP protein in cells causes <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Accepted {{examples}} are piebaldism, Waardenburg syndrome, Hirschsprung disease, Ondine's curse (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome), pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, Merkel cell carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia, neurofibromatosis type I, CHARGE syndrome, <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia,</b> DiGeorge syndrome, Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome (a.k.a. hemifacial microsomia), craniofrontonasal syndrome, congenital melanocytic nevus, melanoma, and certain congenital heart defects of the outflow tract, in particular.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is a form}} of dysautonomia but {{differentiated}} from <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> by a lack of familial dysautonomic symptoms such as loss {{of sense}} of pain and smell.

Diagnoses include <b>Familial</b> <b>Dysautonomia,</b> Muscular Dystrophy and Childhood Cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> is {{inherited}} in an {{autosomal recessive}} pattern, which means 2 {{copies of the}} gene in each cell are altered. If both parents are shown to be carriers by genetic testing, there is a 25% chance that the child will produce FD. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies {{at increased risk for}} FD by amniocentesis (for 14-17 weeks) or chorionic villus sampling (for 10-11 weeks) is possible.|$|E
5000|$|Scoliosis {{associated}} with known syndromes is often subclassified as [...] "syndromic scoliosis". Scoliosis can be {{associated with}} amniotic band syndrome, Arnold-Chiari malformation, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, cerebral palsy, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia,</b> CHARGE syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hyperflexibility, [...] "floppy baby" [...] syndrome, and other variants of the condition), fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, hemihypertrophy, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, nail-patella syndrome, neurofibromatosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, Prader-Willi syndrome, proteus syndrome, spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy and syringomyelia.|$|E
50|$|In a {{small number}} of {{reported}} <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> cases, researchers have identified other mutations that cause a change in amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). In these cases, arginine is replaced by proline at position 696 in the IKAP protein's chain of amino acids (also written as Arg696Pro), or proline is replaced by leucine at position 914 (also written as Pro914Leu). People with one of these improper amino acid substitutions also have the skipping mutation. Together, these mutations cause the resulting IKAP protein to malfunction.|$|E
50|$|The {{final chapter}} of The 10,000 Year Explosion expands on their {{paper from the}} Journal of Biosocial Science {{on the issue of}} Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence. Harpending and Cochran argue the cause of the claim of Ashkenazim having higher mean verbal and {{mathematical}} intelligence than other ethnic groups (as well as having a relatively high number of genetic diseases, such as Tay-Sachs Disease, Canavan, Niemann-Pick, Gaucher, <b>Familial</b> <b>Dysautonomia,</b> Bloom Syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Cystic Fibrosis and Mucolipidosis IV) is due to the historically isolated population of Jews in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Problems {{related to}} this {{disorder}} first appear during infancy. Early signs and symptoms include poor muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, poor growth, lack of tears, frequent lung infections, and difficulty maintaining body temperature. Older infants and young children with <b>familial</b> <b>dysautonomia</b> may hold their breath for prolonged periods of time, which may cause a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis) or fainting. This breath-holding behavior usually stops by age 6. Developmental milestones, such as walking and speech, are usually delayed, although some affected individuals show no signs of developmental delay.|$|E
