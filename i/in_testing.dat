5|$|<b>In</b> <b>testing</b> {{conducted}} by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1999, the SS190 fired from the P90 {{at a distance of}} 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic gelatin covered with a Level II vest. The SS190 exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in) when fired from the P90 into bare ballistic gelatin, in tests {{conducted by}} Houston Police Department SWAT. <b>In</b> <b>testing,</b> the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Counseling and {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of genetic testing for HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. Presymptomatic testing for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with genetic variants such as polycystic kidney disease, familial Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer.

5|$|Ensemble Studios worked {{together}} with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires IIIs second expansion. This {{was the first}} joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games {{did most of the}} work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> the game before its release.|$|E

40|$|Background A {{surgical}} safety checklist (SSC) {{was implemented}} and routinely evaluated within our hos-pital. The {{purpose of this}} study was to analyze compliance, knowledge of and satisfaction with the SSC to determine further improvements. Methods The implementation of the SSC was observed in a pilot unit. After roll-out into each operat-ing theater, compliance with the SSC was routinely measured. To assess subjective and objective knowledge, as well as satisfaction with the SSC implementation, an online survey (N = 891) was performed. Results During two <b>test</b> runs <b>in</b> a piloting unit, 305 operations were observed, 175 <b>in</b> <b>test</b> run 1 and 130 <b>in</b> <b>test</b> run 2. The SSC was used in 77. 1 % of all operations <b>in</b> <b>test</b> run 1 and in 99. 2 % <b>in</b> <b>test</b> run 2.

5|$|In 2002 and 2003, NATO {{conducted}} {{a series of}} tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7×28mm cartridge and the 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm cartridge, citing superior performance <b>in</b> <b>testing,</b> but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted.|$|E
5|$|The Arena browser (also {{known as}} the Arena WWW Browser) is an early (now discontinued) testbed Web browser and Web {{authoring}} tool for Unix. Originally authored by Dave Raggett in 1993, the browser continued its development at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing. As a testbed browser, Arena was used <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww.

5|$|The Big King was {{introduced}} {{at a time}} when McDonald's was planning a similar move with a direct competitor to Burger King's signature Whopper sandwich. The Big N' Tasty {{was introduced}} in California at approximately the same time Big King was being nationally introduced in 1997. Other similar products from McDonald's were also undergoing testing at the same time; either called the Big Xtra or the MBX, these other two sandwiches were being test marketed in the Northeastern United States. The Big N' Tasty eventually won out <b>in</b> <b>testing,</b> however its national roll-out was delayed due to a corporate reorganization at McDonald's.|$|E

5|$|The Bold Orion missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 199B (WS-199B), was a {{prototype}} air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) developed by Martin Aircraft during the 1950s. Developed in both one- and two-stage designs, the missile was moderately successful <b>in</b> <b>testing,</b> and helped {{pave the way for}} development of the GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. In addition, the Bold Orion was used in early anti-satellite weapons testing, performing the first interception of a satellite by a missile.|$|E
5|$|The Douglas XCG-17 was an American assault glider, {{developed}} by the conversion of a C-47 Skytrain twin-engine transport during World War II. Although the XCG-17 was successful <b>in</b> <b>testing,</b> the requirement for such a large glider had passed, and no further examples of the type were built; one additional C-47, however, was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration briefly during 1946 for evaluation, but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration.|$|E

30|$|Results {{of studies}} of change <b>in</b> <b>test</b> {{motivation}} are heterogeneous: while some indicate an increase <b>in</b> <b>test</b> motivation (e.g., Barry and Finney 2016), others indicate a decrease over {{the duration of the}} test (e.g., Penk and Richter 2017; Sundre and Kitsantas 2004; Wise et al. 2009). This heterogeneity in findings may be because both personal characteristics of the test-takers (e.g. ability) and item characteristics (e.g., difficulty) are responsible for changes <b>in</b> <b>test</b> motivation.|$|R

5|$|The SS192 was {{discontinued}} in late 2004. It used a 1.8g (28grain) {{hollow point}} bullet with a copper jacket and an aluminum core. The projectile had {{a length of}} 21.6mm (.85in). It had an unmarked hollow nose with a depth of 7.6mm (0.3in) and a 0.8-mm (0.03in) opening. The SS192 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level IIIA vest when fired from the Five-seven.|$|E
5|$|The SS196SR was {{introduced}} in 2005 {{and it is now}} discontinued in favor of the SS197SR cartridge. It featured a lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max bullet which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 500m/s (1,650ft/s) when fired from the Five-seven. The polycarbonate tip used in the V-Max bullet acted as a wedge, enhancing expansion of the bullet. The SS196 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level II vest when fired from the Five-seven. The SS196 could be identified by its red polymer tip.|$|E
