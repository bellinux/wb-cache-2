2500|$|Between 1919 and 1921 Ireland {{experienced}} the Irish War of Independence -a guerrilla {{conflict between the}} British forces and the Irish Volunteers, now reconstituted as the Irish Republican Army. The <b>Dublin</b> IRA <b>units</b> waged an urban guerrilla campaign against police and the British army in the city. In 1919, the violence began with small numbers of IRA men (known as [...] "the Squad") under Michael Collins assassinating police detectives in the city. By late 1920, this had expanded into much more intensive operations, including regular gun and grenade attack on British troops. The IRA in Dublin tried to carry out three shooting or bombing attacks a day. Such was the regularity of attacks on British patrols, that the Camden-Aungier streets area (running from the military barracks at Portobello to Dublin Castle) was nicknamed the [...] "Dardanelles" [...] (site of the Gallipoli campaign) by British soldiers.|$|R

2500|$|Like the anti-Treaty IRA, the Free State's National Army was {{initially}} {{rooted in the}} IRA that fought against the British. Collins' most ruthless officers and men were recruited from the <b>Dublin</b> Active Service <b>Unit</b> (the elite unit of the IRA's Dublin Brigade) and from Michael Collins' Intelligence Department and assassination unit, The Squad. In the new National Army, they were known as the Dublin Guard. Towards {{the end of the}} war, they were implicated in some notorious atrocities against anti-treaty guerrillas in County Kerry. Up to the outbreak of Civil War, it had been agreed that only men with service in the IRA could be recruited into the National Army. However, once the war began, all such restrictions were lifted. A 'National Call to Arms' issued on July 7 for recruitment on a six-month basis brought in thousands of new recruits. Many of the new army's recruits were veterans of the British Army in [...] World War I, where they had served in Irish Divisions of the British Army. Many other were raw recruits without any military experience. The fact that at least 50% of the other ranks had no military experience in turn led to ill-discipline becoming a major problem.|$|R
40|$|The {{area under}} {{investigation}} was {{the phenomenon of}} criminological behaviour occurring on Dublin Bus Routes. Research questions were based around: 1) what anti-social behaviour is occurring on buses, 2) when is this behaviour occurring, 3) who is perpetrating this behaviour and 4) how is anti-social behaviour on buses being tackled? Two problematic bus routes and one control route were selected based on geographic spread and the comparative ratio of criminal incidents involved (the 78 A, 77 and the control case: 46 A). A statistical analysis of existing information from Dublin Bus surrounding anti-social behaviour on these routes was conducted. The researcher then performed equivalent systematic observation {{over a period of}} three weeks on the proposed routes. This data was supplemented with four semi-structured interviews obtained from members of the <b>Dublin</b> Bus Zero-Tolerance <b>Unit.</b> The data garnered from the observation and the interviews was then cross-examined against the statistical analysis of existing data to see how comparable it was. The results showed a bias in the reporting of more serious crime with a lot of minor incidents never being recorded. The findings were used to inform academic recommendations for future research with regard to the nature of anti-social behaviour on buses and how it is policed. Practical solutions to effective management strategies in dealing with crime were also suggested...|$|R

Swabs were plated onto CHROMagar Candida medium and 155 isolates, presumptively identified as C. albicans or C. dubliniensis were further investigated. in a preliminary screen for C dubliniensis, 13 of the 155 isolates showed no or poor growth at 42 degreesC, and all them were subjected to randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using C. dubliniensis-specific primers. We confirmed that 4 out of 13 isolates were C. dubliniensis, representing an incidence rate of 2. 8 % for the Brazilian HIV-infected population infected with yeasts exhibiting green colonies on CHROMagar Candida. This value is significantly lower than those reported in Ireland and the United States. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.
