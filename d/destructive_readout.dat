A new approach for a nondestructive readout based on capacity measurement potentially lowers the requirements for both material endurance and power consumption. Bi-layer structure is used to produce the nonlinearity in LRS to avoid the sneak path problem. A single-layer device exhibiting a strong nonlinear conduction in LRS was reported. Another bi-layer structure was introduced for bipolar RRAM to improve the HRS and stability.|$|E

50|$|Core uses tiny {{magnetic}} toroids (rings), the cores, {{through which}} wires are threaded {{to write and}} read information. Each core represents one bit of information. The cores can be magnetized in two different ways (clockwise or counterclockwise) and the bit stored in a core is zero or one depending on that core's magnetization direction. The wires are arranged to allow for an individual core to be set to either a one or a zero and for its magnetization to be changed by sending appropriate electric current pulses through selected wires. The process of reading the core causes the core to be reset to a zero, thus erasing it. This is called <b>destructive</b> <b>readout.</b> When not being read or written, the cores maintain the last value they had, even when power is turned off. This makes them nonvolatile.|$|E

Here it is shown that high-resolution non-destructive imaging of conductive nanostructures can be achieved using a specific piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique.

30|$|Although the {{ferroelectric}} probe memory {{exhibits a}} capability of providing densities of multi-Tbit/in 2, its <b>destructive</b> <b>readout</b> mechanism requires {{data to be}} refreshed after readout and this would cumulate read/write cycles and eventually causes severe fatigue. In order to overcome the adverse effects of the <b>destructive</b> <b>readout,</b> several non-destructive readout methods have been recently proposed including piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) readout [73 – 75] and scanning nonlinear dielectric microscopy (SNDM) readout [64, 76 – 78]. For PFM readout, a conductive probe where a small AC tip-sample voltage is applied is brought {{in contact with the}} sample, and the response of the probe related to the polarization state of ferroelectric domains is detected by PFM as a readout signal at a frequency below the cantilever resonance. It {{should be pointed out that}} the resulting electric field would possibly change the permittivity of the ferroelectric domain, thus resulting in an advent of second harmonics [73]. An alternative method to operate probe in non-contact mode is SNDM readout that possesses from a fact that the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization can slightly change the storage medium’s capacitance due to the non-linearity in the permittivity tensor [79]. The variation on the capacitance would slightly change the resonance conditions that can be detected by monitoring the cantilever vibration if the cantilever is excited with a fixed AC voltage by means of a lock-in technique. Another method reported the direct piezoelectric effect to build up charge on the tip as a result of the tip-sample load force [78]. The resulting current is proportional to the load force, leading to a trade-off with endurance, as tip wear increases with the load force.|$|E

CRS cells consist of an antiserial setup of two bipolar resistive switching cells. The conventional <b>destructive</b> <b>readout</b> for CRS cells {{is based on a}} current measurement which makes a considerable call on the switching endurance. Here, we report a new approach for a nondestructive readout (NDRO) based on a capacity measurement. We suggest a concept of an alternative setup of a CRS cell in which both resistive switching cells have similar switching properties but are distinguishable by different capacities. The new approach has the potential of an energy saving and fast readout procedure without decreasing cycling performance and is not limited by the switching kinetics for integrated passive memory arrays...|$|E
40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{composed}} of three sections. In the first section, {{the current status of}} non-destructive readout ferroelectric memories is reviewed. Novel A 2 B 2 O 7 type ferroelectric materials are discussed in the second section. Finally, the preparation and properties of Sr 2 (Ta 1 -xNbx) 2 O 7 solid-solutions are investigated as a function of composition in the last section. 5. 1 LITERATURE REVIEW As discussed in Chapter 1, the ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) devices are divided into two categories, based on the readout technique: <b>destructive</b> <b>readout</b> (DRO) and non-destructive read-out (NDRO). In the DRO FRAM device, reading operation is carried out destructively i. e. reversing the original polarization state, and reading the switching current. Therefore, reset procedures are required to restore the switched polarization state to the original position. On the other hand, the NDRO FRAM devices read the stored data by sensing the modulation of the surface conductivity of the silicon rather than switching the polarization state. This reading method provides a privilege of non-destructive readout and eliminates the reset procedure. The NDR...|$|E

40|$|This is a Ph. D. thesis {{dissertation}} {{in which}} {{a new type of}} image sensor is investigated as possible successor to the charge coupled device (CCD) for scientific applications. As a result of the work described in this dissertation, the active pixel charge injection device (AP-CID) has been developed. This device retains most of the positive features of both the charge injection device (CJD) imager (random readout, non <b>destructive</b> <b>readout,</b> antiblooming, increased UV sensitivity, radiation tolerance, low power consumption, low manufacturing price) and the CCD imager (low noise, high dynamic range). The device lacks most of the drawbacks of the aforementioned devices. A functional array architecture was created. Based on this architecture several devices were fabricated. One of the arrays was fully measured, characterized and suggestions for improvement were formulated. Most of the characterizationalysis work described in this dissertation was centered on the following issues: temporal noise, linearity and FPN. The measured noise performance of the new device is excellent and comparable to the noise performance of the scientific CCD. The newly developed sensor is necessary for scientific imaging applications in space based operation. However due to its qualities, this device could be used in a much wider range of applications including commercial digital cameras, spectroscopy, biological, nuclear and other scientific applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} we {{demonstrate}} theoretically and ex-perimentally {{the capability to}} reduce the readout noise of an optical and X-ray photon detector based on the semiconductor DEPFET device below a level of only 0. 3 e − ENC (equivalent noise charge). The readout method used is called ”Repetitive Non <b>Destructive</b> <b>Readout</b> ” (RNDR) and was realised by placing two single DEPFET-devices {{next to each other}} and by coupling their charge storing region by an additional gate. By transferring the stored charge from one DEPFET to the other and vice versa the same charge can be measured non-destructively and arbitrarily often. Taking the average value of a large number n of these measurements, the noise is reduced by 1 / n. The main advantage of such a detector is to greatly reduce the influence of the 1 /f noise to the readout noise. The theoretically and experimentally achievable resolution for different operating parameters (leakage current, readout noise, number and duration of readouts) was investigated by Monte-Carlo simulations and verified on a real RNDR minimatrix (pixelarray). Single optical photon detection with high quantum efficiency and, even more fascinating, the possibility to distinguish between different numbers of photons e. g. 100 from 101 is presented in measurements.

40|$|Electrically {{variable}} or programmable capacitors {{based on}} the unique properties of thin perovskite films are undergoing development. These capacitors show promise of overcoming two important deficiencies of prior electrically programmable capacitors: Unlike {{in the case of}} varactors, {{it is not necessary to}} supply power continuously to make these capacitors retain their capacitance values. Hence, these capacitors may prove useful as components of nonvolatile analog and digital electronic memories. Unlike in the case of ferroelectric capacitors, it is possible to measure the capacitance values of these capacitors without changing the values. In other words, whereas readout of ferroelectric capacitors is <b>destructive,</b> <b>readout</b> of these capacitors can be nondestructive. A capacitor of this type is a simple two terminal device. It includes a thin film of a suitable perovskite as the dielectric layer, sandwiched between two metal or metal oxide electrodes (for example, see Figure 1). The utility of this device as a variable capacitor is based on a phenomenon, known as electrical-pulse-induced capacitance (EPIC), that is observed in thin perovskite films and especially in those thin perovskite films that exhibit the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) effect. In EPIC, the application of one or more electrical pulses that exceed a threshold magnitude (typically somewhat less than 1 V) gives rise to a nonvolatile change in capacitance. The change in capacitance depends on the magnitude duration, polarity, and number of pulses. It is not necessary to apply a magnetic field or to cool the device below (or heat it above) room temperature to obtain EPIC. Examples of suitable CMR perovskites include Pr(1 -x) Ca(x) MnO 3, La(1 -x) S-r(x) MnO 3,and Nb(1 -x) Ca(x) MnO 3. Figure 2 is a block diagram showing an EPIC capacitor connected to a circuit that can vary the capacitance, measure the capacitance, and/or measure the resistance of the capacitor...|$|E
40|$|The present rate of {{technological}} advance continues to place significant demands on data storage devices. The sheer amount of digital data being generated each year along with consumer expectations, fuels these demands. At present, most digital data is stored magnetically, {{in the form}} of hard disk drives or on magnetic tape. The increase in areal density (AD) of magnetic hard disk drives over the past 50 years has been of the order of 100 million times, and current devices are storing data at ADs of the order of hundreds of gigabits per square inch. However, it has been known for some time that the progress in this form of data storage is approaching fundamental limits. The main limitation relates to the lower size limit that an individual bit can have for stable storage. Various techniques for overcoming these fundamental limits are currently the focus of considerable research effort. Most attempt to improve current data storage methods, or modify these slightly for higher density storage. Alternatively, three dimensional optical data storage is a promising field for the information storage needs of the future, offering very high density, high speed memory. There are two ways in which data may be recorded in a three dimensional optical medium; either bit-by-bit (similar in principle to an optical disc medium such as CD or DVD) or by using pages of bit data. Bit-by-bit techniques for three dimensional storage offer high density but are inherently slow due to the serial nature of data access. Page-based techniques, where a two-dimensional page of data bits is written in one write operation, can offer significantly higher data rates, due to their parallel nature. Holographic Data Storage (HDS) is one such page-oriented optical memory technique. This field of research has been active for several decades, but with few commercial products presently available. Another page-oriented optical memory technique involves recording pages of data as phase masks in a photorefractive medium. A photorefractive material is one by which the refractive index can be modified by light of the appropriate wavelength and intensity, and this property can be used to store information in these materials. In phase mask storage, two dimensional pages of data are recorded into a photorefractive crystal, as refractive index changes in the medium. A low-intensity readout beam propagating through the medium will have its intensity profile modified by these refractive index changes and a CCD camera can be used to monitor the readout beam, and thus read the stored data. The main aim of this research was to investigate data storage using phase masks in the photorefractive crystal, lithium niobate (LiNbO 3). Firstly the experimental methods for storing the two dimensional pages of data (a set of vertical stripes of varying lengths) in the medium are presented. The laser beam used for writing, whose intensity profile is modified by an amplitudemask which contains a pattern of the information to be stored, illuminates the lithium niobate crystal and the photorefractive effect causes the patterns to be stored as refractive index changes in the medium. These patterns are read out non-destructively using a low intensity probe beam and a CCD camera. A common complication of information storage in photorefractive crystals is the issue of <b>destructive</b> <b>readout.</b> This is a problem particularly for holographic data storage, where the readout beam should be at the same wavelength as the beam used for writing. Since the charge carriers in the medium are still sensitive to the read light field, the readout beam erases the stored information. A method to avoid this is by using thermal fixing. Here the photorefractive medium is heated to temperatures above 150 �C; this process forms an ionic grating in the medium. This ionic grating is insensitive to the readout beam and therefore the information is not erased during readout. A non-contact method for determining temperature change in a lithium niobate crystal is presented in this thesis. The temperature-dependent birefringent properties of the medium cause intensity oscillations to be observed for a beam propagating through the medium during a change in temperature. It is shown that each oscillation corresponds to a particular temperature change, and by counting the number of oscillations observed, the temperature change of the medium can be deduced. The presented technique for measuring temperature change could easily be applied to a situation where thermal fixing of data in a photorefractive medium is required. Furthermore, by using an expanded beam and monitoring the intensity oscillations over a wide region, it is shown that the temperature in various locations of the crystal can be monitored simultaneously. This technique could be used to deduce temperature gradients in the medium. It is shown that the three dimensional nature of the recording medium causes interesting degradation effects to occur when the patterns are written for a longer-than-optimal time. This degradation results in the splitting of the vertical stripes in the data pattern, and for long writing exposure times this process can result in the complete deterioration of the information in the medium. It is shown in that simply by using incoherent illumination, the original pattern can be recovered from the degraded state. The reason for the recovery is that the refractive index changes causing the degradation are of a smaller magnitude since they are induced by the write field components scattered from the written structures. During incoherent erasure, the lower magnitude refractive index changes are neutralised first, allowing the original pattern to be recovered. The degradation process is shown to be reversed during the recovery process, and a simple relationship is found relating the time at which particular features appear during degradation and recovery. A further outcome of this work is that the minimum stripe width of 30 ìm is required for accurate storage and recovery of the information in the medium, any size smaller than this results in incomplete recovery. The degradation and recovery process could be applied to an application in image scrambling or cryptography for optical information storage. A two dimensional numerical model based on the finite-difference beam propagation method (FD-BPM) is presented and used to gain insight into the pattern storage process. The model shows that the degradation of the patterns is due to the complicated path taken by the write beam as it propagates through the crystal, and in particular the scattering of this beam from the induced refractive index structures in the medium. The model indicates that the highest quality pattern storage would be achieved with a thin 0. 5 mm medium; however this type of medium would also remove the degradation property of the patterns and the subsequent recovery process. To overcome the simplistic treatment of the refractive index change in the FD-BPM model, a fully three dimensional photorefractive model developed by Devaux is presented. This model shows significant insight into the pattern storage, particularly for the degradation and recovery process, and confirms the theory that the recovery of the degraded patterns is possible since the refractive index changes responsible for the degradation are of a smaller magnitude. Finally, detailed analysis of the pattern formation and degradation dynamics for periodic patterns of various periodicities is presented. It is shown that stripe widths in the write beam of greater than 150 ìm result in the formation of different types of refractive index changes, compared with the stripes of smaller widths. As a result, it is shown that the pattern storage method discussed in this thesis has an upper feature size limit of 150 ìm, for accurate and reliable pattern storage...|$|E
