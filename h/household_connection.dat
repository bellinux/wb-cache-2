40|$|Standpipes that {{dispense}} {{water from}} utilities {{are the most}} common alternatives to piped water connections for poor customers in the cities of Sub-Saharan Africa. Fifty-five percent of the unconnected urban population relies on standpipes as their first water source. Other informal water providers include household resellers and a variety of water tankers and vendors, which are the first water source of 1 percent and 3 percent of the urban population, respectively. In the cities studied, the percentage of unconnected households ranges from 12 percent to 86 percent of the population. The percentage of unconnected people covered by standpipes is substantially higher for countries with higher rates of <b>household</b> <b>connection,</b> while the percentage of unconnected people covered by water tankers or water vendors is higher for countries with lower rates of <b>household</b> <b>connection.</b> Water prices in the informal market are much higher than for households with private connections or yard taps. Although standpipes are heavily subsidized by utilities, the prices charged by standpipe operators are closely related to the informal water reseller price. Standpipe management models also affect the informal price of water. For example, the shift from utilities management to delegated management models without complementary regulation or consumer information has often led to declines in service levels and increased prices. Standpipes are not the only or even the most efficient solution in peri-urban areas. Programs that promote private household connections and arrangements that improve pricing and services in the household resale market should also be considered by policy makers.

Two of the important findings from the regression analyses results were PDC-BOD correlated with PPP-GNI per capita with 3 rd-order regression, and PDC-TP correlated with WSEI 1 positively with 10 % significance, besides smaller adjusted regression coefficients. t-values of partial regression coefficients between PDC-TP and WSEI 2 increased in the most analyses cases compared to those between PDC-TP and WSEI 1, which showed improvement of the indices. Empirical estimations were also conducted based on the regression analyses results and distributions of PDCs and PPP-GNI per capita on the graphs. Six components generated by the principle component analysis (PCA) contributed 99 % of the parameters. The first component represented access to sanitation, second one represented <b>household</b> <b>connection</b> of safe drinking water, third one represented areal equipment of water supply in urban area, fourth one represented domestic water usage amount, fifth one represented areal equipment of water supply, and sixth one represented income per capita and sanitation. Although some statistically significances of the multiple linear regression analysis were observed, the relationships between PDCs and the water supply parameters were considered as complicated in regards to areal equipment and <b>household</b> <b>connection,</b> and in whole country and in urban area.

Therefore, related topics of sewer system, such as cost estimation/analysis, optimal designs and environmental impacts, should deserve more intention and discussion. This study plans to accomplish the following works in a 3 year-horizon schedule: (1) developing cost functions suitable for sewer system in Taiwan; (2) monitoring the traffic flow, air pollutants and noise data of the roads under sewer system construction, and calibrate the street canyon model 「OSPM」 and traffic noise simulation model 「Odeon」 to evaluate the environmental impacts during the sewer system construction period; (3) employ heuristic optimization techniques such as ant algorithm and immune algorithm to develop sewer system optimization model and search the optimal designs; (4) integrate geographic information system to aid the spatial analysis for the optimization and/or simulation models aforementioned. Several real construction cases of sewer systems will be selected as case studies to verify the practicality and accuracy of this research. 截至民國九十四年為止，台灣地區公共污水下水道普及率僅 14. 01 %，因此在未來 20 年內，污水下水道將持續成為政府的主要公共建設之一，也將對於國內社會、經濟與環境產生相當顯著的影響。因此污水下水道系統的相關議題，如：成本評估、最佳設計方案、環境影響等，都應投入更多的討論與關注。因此本研究擬以三年的期程，與相關工務主管機關合作，分階段建立本土化的污水下水道系統，包括污水處理廠與管線施工的成本函數；並利用台中市正進行中的污水下水道工程進行施工路段於施工前後之交通流量、空氣污染物與噪音的監測，以瞭解其環境衝擊；同時利用上述監測數據進行街谷擴散模式OSPM以及交通噪音模樣模式Odeon的本土化參數率定。此外本研究將首度應用螞蟻演算法(ant algorithm) 以及免疫演算法(immune algorithm) 等啟髮式優選技術求解污水下水道系統的最佳化問題，同時將結合地理資訊系統，協助提供優選模式更準確的空間資料，以及協助OSPM與Odeon模式進行環境衝擊影響的空間分析，以提供後續規劃單位於設計污水下水道系統時的輔助工具...|$|E

Inputs that are modeled include electricity demand, costs, and geographic characteristics. The spatial nature of the model permits accurate representation of the existing electricity network and population distribution, which form the basis for future expansion decisions. The methodology and model assumptions are illustrated using country-specific data from Kenya. Results show that under most geographic conditions, extension of the national grid is less costly than off-grid options. Based on realistic penetration rates for Kenya, we estimate an average connection cost of $ 1900 per household, with lower-cost connection opportunities around major cities and in denser rural regions. In areas with an adequate pre-existing medium-voltage backbone, we estimate that over 30 % of households could be connected for less than $ 1000 per connection through infilling.

Data modelling gets around the privacy problem and allows for Monte Carlo simulations. First, residential electricity demand is described. The demographic properties describing the electricity demand in Belgium are determined with the use of machine learning techniques. Residential electricity consumers are grouped based on timing of and amount of electricity demand with clustering techniques. Measurement data from a project are scaled up by employing the groups found to get an impression of electricity demand of wet appliances. Then, residential electricity demand is modelled. The combination of electricity consumer groups together with Markov models allow for an electricity demand model. Wet appliance load cycles are detected and parametrised according to the previously defined consumer groups.

40|$|We {{study the}} demand for {{household}} water connections in urban Morocco, {{and the effect of}} such connections on household welfare. In the northern city of Tangiers, among homeowners without a private connection to the city’s water grid, a random subset was offered a simplified procedure to purchase a <b>household</b> <b>connection</b> on credit (at a zero percent interest rate). Take-up was high, at 69 %. Because all households in our sample had access to the water grid through free public taps (often located fairly close to their homes), household connections did not lead to any improvement in the quality of the water households consumed; and despite significant increase in the quantity of water consumed, we find no change in the incidence of waterborne illnesses. Nevertheless, we find that households are willing to pay a substantial amount of money to have a private tap at home. Being connected generates important time gains, which are used for leisure and social activities, rather than productive activities. Because water is often a source of tension between households, household connections improve social integration and reduce conflict. Overall, within 6 months, self-reported well-being improved substantially among households in the treatment group, despite the financial cost of the connection. Our results suggest that facilitating access to credit for households to finance lump sum quality-of-life investments can significantly increase welfare, even if those investments do not result in income or health gains. ...|$|E
