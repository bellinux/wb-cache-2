He liked its graphics but wrote that its music [...] "isn’t too hot". Buchanan enjoyed its multiplayer component and wrote that [...] "the slowdown when all four join in is minima—nice programming {{on the part of}} Looking Glass". Although he complained that the game's vehicle damage is not [...] "segmented throughout your car", he concluded by calling the game [...] "pure, unadulterated fun [...] has enough tracks and hidden vehicles to keep you playing for a very long time". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote, [...] "Graphically, Destruction Derby 64 surpasses the old PlayStation games by quite a bit - not that that is a particularly <b>hard</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do". He found that its framerate was adequate even in split-screen mode, and concluded that it was [...] "a better game than its PlayStation counterparts". He finished, [...] "Give it a rent next time you're rounding up the posse for a day of gaming." ...|$|E

2500|$|That {{garden was}} the place where my {{appearance}} as a cyclist at the Vélodrome d’Hiver was thought up. Gleizes and Villon claimed that I wouldn’t be able to cycle 100 kilometres without putting a foot on the ground. I bet them that I could {{for the price of}} a lunch. It’s actually a pretty <b>hard</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do to keep going over 100 kilometres on country roads. Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I began my laps in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another. The spectators, Fernand Léger was among them, cheered me on with increasing enthusiasm until quite unexpectedly the sound of a gong brought me to a halt. I had won my meal by my honourable average speed. (Metzinger) ...|$|E
