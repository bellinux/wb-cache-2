5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going on, and the owners <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an instant success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E

5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him.|$|E

25|$|In September 2014, it was {{reported}} that Pynchon may have a cameo in the film, which Anderson would not confirm, citing Pynchon's choice {{to stay out of the}} public spotlight. Brolin went as far as to confirm the cameo and claimed that Pynchon was on set but that nobody <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> him as he stayed in the corner.|$|E
25|$|Robson {{played his}} final {{game as a}} player on 1 January 1997, in a Premier League game against Arsenal at Highbury 10 days before his 40th birthday.

25|$|Eventually, the Doctor {{began to}} enjoy his travels through time and space, taking people {{along for the}} ride and was always {{reluctant}} and sad to see them go, even when he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for their own good.

25|$|Muhammad's 700 men met the 3000 of the Quraish in the Battle of Uhud {{and were}} defeated. The Quraish, however, {{did not succeed}} in killing Muhammad, nor did they occupy the town of Medina, {{possibly}} because they <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> guarded by Ibn Ubayy. Rodinson suggests that the Meccans did not want to reforge the very unity of the population, which had been jeopardised by Muhammad's defeat.|$|E
25|$|It's {{definitely}} the hardest game of cricket I've ever played. The World Cup was difficult, {{if not more}} difficult, but you <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{all going to be}} over in a day. This just took turn after turn after turn over the four days' duration, plus your rained out day — it was a real tough game of cricket to play for every body.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan was {{operated}} on at 11.30am on Thursday 10 October.

Macmillan was almost ready to leave hospital within ten days of the diagnosis and could easily have carried on, {{in the opinion of}} his doctor Sir John Richardson. His illness gave him a way out.|$|E

Milloy {{published}} evidence {{indicating that}} colonialists had intentionally concealed {{information on the}} spread of disease in his book A National Crime: The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986 (1999). According to Milloy, the Government of Canada {{was aware of the}} origins of many diseases but maintained a secretive policy. Medical professionals had knowledge of this policy, and further, <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> causing a higher death rate among indigenous people, yet the policy continued.|$|E
25|$|When {{the morning}} star rose ringed with red, the priest <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the signal for the sacrifice. He {{directed}} {{the men to}} carry {{out the rest of the}} ritual, including the construction of a scaffold outside the village. It was made of sacred woods and leathers from different animals, each of which had important symbolism. It was erected over a pit with elements corresponding to the four cardinal directions. All the elements of the ritual related to symbolic meaning and belief, and were necessary for the renewal of life. The preparations took four days.|$|E
25|$|Lulu is {{diagnosed}} with aplastic anemia and needs {{a bone marrow}} transplant, but none of her family members are a match. Laura's son by Stavros Cassidine, Nikolas, donates his bone marrow {{at a hospital in}} Switzerland. Nikolas arrives in Port Charles with his uncle Stefan (Stephen Nichols) where they decide to stay, creating tension in the Spencer family, especially when Stefan begins to romance Bobbie. Stefan had been Laura's only friend during her captivity. The two had developed romantic feelings for each other and were lovers. When he married Bobbie, Laura <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to make her jealous.|$|E

25|$|Milwaukee's {{founding}} fathers {{had a vision}} for the city: they <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new immigrants who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin {{during the middle of the}} 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked wheat-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. Railroads were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.|$|E
25|$|In February 1958, Russell, at Miles Davis's urging, drove Evans {{over to the}} Colony Club in Brooklyn, to {{play with}} Davis' sextet. By that time, the band {{consisted}} of John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones. Evans <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an audition, and that he might replace the recently fired Red Garland. By {{the end of the}} night, Davis told Evans that he would be playing their next engagement in Philadelphia. While the band used to play a mixture of jazz standards and bebop originals, by that time Davis had begun his venture in modal jazz, having just released his album Milestones.|$|E
25|$|A two part text, On the Binding of Contracts, {{deals with}} when {{contracts}} are binding {{and when they}} are not. The first section deals with general rules regarding when contracts are binding, including an analogy to the fact that Adam's trade of an apple for access to the Garden of Eden was valid even though it was an uneven contract because Adam <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> such. The second half deals with cases in which a contract may be overturned. The tract is also interesting because it is a collection of material from varying dates and places and as such much more uneven in content than other tracts.|$|E
