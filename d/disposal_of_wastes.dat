25|$|Marine debris, {{also known}} as marine litter, is human-created waste that has {{deliberately}} or accidentally been released in a lake, sea, ocean or waterway. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate {{at the center of}} gyres and on coastlines, frequently washing aground, when it is known as beach litter or tidewrack. Deliberate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> at sea is called ocean dumping. Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.|$|E
25|$|Polluted {{groundwater}} is less visible, {{but more}} difficult to clean up, than pollution in rivers and lakes. Groundwater pollution most often results from improper <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> on land. Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, excessive fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process wastewater from mines, industrial fracking, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and septic systems.|$|E

Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process wastewater from mines, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and septic systems. Polluted groundwater is mapped by sampling soils and groundwater near suspected or known sources of pollution, {{to determine the extent}} of the pollution, and to aid in the design of groundwater remediation systems. Preventing groundwater pollution near potential sources such as landfills requires lining the bottom of a landfill with watertight materials, collecting any leachate with drains, and keeping rainwater off any potential contaminants, along with regular monitoring of nearby groundwater to verify that contaminants have not leaked into the groundwater.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the study is the basic study of the system which enables to {{estimate}} a quality and quantity <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in the booth display composition of an Exhibition. In the study, I have investigated the following in order to demonstrate conditions for promoting appropriate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in an Exhibition. 1) The interview for grasping the actual conditions <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in an Exhibition and exhibition hall, 2) The investigation of the sense of the people concerned in an Exhibition to present their basic attitude and specific method for <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> 3) The investigation into the actual conditions of an Exhibition in Asian Nations to demonstrate the relation between <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and institution or social condition because the view and method <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> differ from each country. As a result, I could obtain the following; 1) A related contractor are actually concerned in <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> consider more seriously than the organizer and exhibitor, 2) more people realize that <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> is the serious problem in the exhibiting world, 3) drawing out the flow <b>of</b> discharge from <b>waste</b> in an Exhibition to grasp roughly the whole waste, 4) the necessity of estimating the quantity <b>of</b> discharge from <b>waste</b> based on the investigation into the actual conditions, 5) the difference between Asian Nations and Japan in <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> Key words: exhibition, booth display, waste assessment 1...|$|R

50|$|Chemical {{engineering}} is {{the processing of}} raw materials into chemical products. It involves preparation of raw materials to produce reactants, the chemical reaction of these reactants under controlled conditions, the separation of products, the recycle of byproducts, and the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes.</b> Each step involves certain basic building blocks called “unit operations,” such as extraction, filtration, and distillation. These unit operations are found in all chemical processes. Biomolecular {{engineering is}} a subset of Chemical Engineering that applies these same principles to the processing of chemical substances made by living organisms.|$|E

A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump; it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, such as the problems of insects and the contamination of ground water.|$|E

Early studies concentrated on determining the toxic effects of various contaminants and surveying their levels in coastal waters and inshore fisheries. By 1970, the general aim of the work had become the establishing of the effects on commercial fish and shellfish resources of <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes,</b> mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, and engineering and development work.
