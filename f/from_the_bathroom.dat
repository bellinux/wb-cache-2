She falls in love with him but circumstances, and their egos, prevent them both from expressing their feelings. One day, Balu pretends to suffer from chest pain, which scares Geetha, causing her to finally admit that she loves him. Later, when Geetha and Ramaiah go to Balu to enquire about his health, Balu, exiting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> fails to see that Geetha is there. He tells Ramaiah about the prank he played on her, and that he was only pretending to have chest pain. Angry that she has been deceived by Balu, she begins to {{question}} whether or not his professed love for her is real. Hurt, she brings her friends, who are on a holiday trip to Shimla, to the residence and tries to drive Balu out of the house.

Ashokan), a relative and an air force pilot.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1988, {{fans would}} throw toilet paper after a CMU men's {{basketball}} player {{made the first}} basket. It was estimated that 3,000 rolls were used each game, causing a shortage.

50|$|At its peak, the MMBT's {{permanent}} collection contained approximately 3,000 rolls of toilet paper. The toilet paper's origins ranged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> of other museums, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim, to American tourist destinations like Wall Drug and Graceland.

As Romans entered, he was ambushed by Mixon, who shot him through the wall and door of a bedroom he was hiding in, mortally wounding him. Gonzales was then shot and wounded in the shoulder, although he continued to lead the team inside the bedroom.

The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party. She went upstairs to bed at about 3 a.m. Miranda undressed, placed her platform shoes in a corner, lit a cigarette, placed it in an ashtray and went into her bathroom to remove her makeup. She apparently came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> with a small, round mirror in her hand; in the small hall which led to her bedroom, she collapsed with a fatal heart attack. Miranda was 46 years old. Her body was found at about 10:30a.m. lying in the hallway.

5000|$|Its nickname, the [...] "Jim Crow Car", {{relates to}} the Jim Crow laws of pre-1965 United States, which allowed for {{separate}} facilities for blacks under the policy of separate but equal. A law passed on May 24, 1892, called the Separate Coach Law, specifically declared that railroad passenger cars must be segregated.

500|$|In Psycho, Hitchcock subverts {{the romantic}} {{elements}} that are seen in most of his work. The film is instead ironic as it presents [...] "clarity and fulfillment" [...] of romance. The past {{is central to the}} film; the main characters [...] "struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories" [...] and ultimately fail. Lesley Brill writes, [...] "The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness." [...] The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film. Marion is like Persephone of Greek mythology, who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only [...] "reflected in mirrors, as images of images—twice removed from reality". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> drain to Marion's lifeless eye, [...] "Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's La Dolce Vita, it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption." ...|$|E
500|$|When Elaine finally arrives, she {{explains}} that Kramer promised her a lift if she would wait in his car for two minutes.

On their way out, they notice it is snowing. Jerry knows snow would ruin his suede jacket and asks Alton if they can take a cab, but Alton replies that it is only a few blocks away. George suggests that Jerry could turn the jacket inside out, but because of the candy stripe lining, Alton notices and tells him to turn it back, saying he looks [...] "like a damn fool" [...] and that he's [...] "not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that." [...] George then reminds Jerry that the restaurant is only a few blocks away; Jerry, reluctantly, puts his jacket back to normal.|$|E
500|$|Cash opened both {{shows with}} a {{rendition}} of [...] "Folsom Prison Blues", followed by many songs about prison, including [...] "The Wall", [...] "Green, Green Grass of Home", and the gallows humor song [...] "25 Minutes to Go".

All components can be segregated for recycling. There are no walls or closed rooms (apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms)</b> and only few pieces of furniture. The transparency is supposed to create the impression that one lives outdoors exposed to nature.

Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", said Andrew did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John says he can smell carbolic soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Jeremy says Ian is the person he was going to pick up from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian.

500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
500|$|Cannibal {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics upon its release. The album holds a score 73 out of 100 based on 11 critical reviews, {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic was positive in the review of Cannibal. Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that Animal had been [...] "squeezed dry of hits". Although critical of the re-release, Thomas' consensus of the album was positive, writing: [...] "aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal’s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal -- but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She’s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her [...] "herky-jerky rhymes still sound like they came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> wall of a reform-school kindergarten", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a [...] "sulfurous end-of-days whiff about it". Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of [...] "B+" [...] and called [...] "Sleazy" [...] and [...] "Blow" [...] the standout tracks on the album. Will Hermes from Rolling Stone noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was Lady Gaga writing, [...] "This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle" [...] praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the [...] "snap queen of clubland." [...] Chad Grischow from IGN met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of {{the production of the}} album and overuse of Auto-Tune writing that there was [...] "so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads [...] "The Harold Song" [...] and [...] "C U Next Tuesday" [...] in the album's review. Grischow ended his review writing, [...] "Cannibal proves to be too mired in mindless lyrics and excessive vocal effects to have any lasting appeal." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{questioned}} on the theory, HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer {{stated that}} the conversation is a [...] "legitimate" [...] hint. Also, Butchie DeConcini (the presumed successor of Phil Leotardo) was last seen saddled with reparations following the mob war. He had expressed ideas about killing Tony before ("Kaisha"), and Tony was, in the end, the very last DiMeo man left standing out of the three original Lupertazzi targets, who, Phil believed, if killed, would totally cripple the Jersey family. Hence, Tony {{would have been a}} tempting target of a hit. The final scene showing a man who glances at Tony (credited as [...] "Man in Members Only Jacket") and who later goes to the bathroom, has been interpreted as a nod to the famous scene in The Godfather in which Michael Corleone retrieves a gun <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> before shooting his enemies to death (Tony's favorite scene from the film, as revealed in the episode [...] "Johnny Cakes"). Speculation has also linked the jacket of the man to the title of the opening episode of the season, [...] "Members Only", in which Tony is shot, and also as a symbolic reference to the mysterious man's membership of the Mafia. Actor Matt Servitto said that in the script, the scene continued with the man in the Members Only jacket emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> and starting to walk towards Tony's table. Servitto later clarified this statement, saying that he did not mean to imply that there was a completely different scripted ending, only that the [...] "genius" [...] editing was not what he had expected.|$|E
2500|$|Laude, a trans woman, met Pemberton, a United States Marine from New Bedford, Massachusetts, at the Ambyanz disco bar in Olongapo on {{the evening}} of October 11, 2014.

Staff found Laude's naked body, partially covered from the waist down, with her neck blackened with strangulation marks and her head in a toilet bowl. Condoms recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> were subjected to DNA testing to determine if the semen it contained matched that of Pemberton. American forensic experts Jessica LeCroy and Derk Dorrien, latent print examiners from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory, revealed that one of the three condoms and a condom wrapper recovered from the motel room had the fingerprints of Pemberton. The DNA within the condoms also did not match Laude's DNA. The cause of death was reported as [...] "asphyxiation by drowning".|$|E

When Miguel learns that Ángela is the daughter of a prominent fascist soldier, he describes his run-ins with fascists and failed attempts to seduce Ángela's eldest sister.
