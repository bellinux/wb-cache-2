5|$|After Prapiroon dissipated, the {{regional}} <b>Disease</b> <b>Prevention</b> and Control Center of Guangxi Autonomous Region sent out eight teams of health workers to help avoid epidemics in affected areas. Despite the {{damage in the}} wake of the typhoon, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs did not activate any emergency response plans. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought for $4,825,791 (2006USD) in funds to assist 240,000 people who were affected over a 12-month span. Reconstruction in the areas devastated by Prapiroon began shortly after the typhoon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacists {{involved}} in CPAs may participate in clinical {{services that are}} outside of the traditional scope of practice for pharmacists. Notably, pharmacists {{do not need to}} participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing <b>disease</b> <b>prevention</b> services (e.g. immunizations), engaging in public health screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, via administering the PHQ-2), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a certified diabetes educator), and counseling patients on information regarding their medications.|$|E

Massachusetts has the most doctors per 100,000 residents, the second-lowest infant mortality rate, and the lowest percentage of uninsured residents (for both {{children as well as}} the total population). According to Businessweek, commonwealth residents have an average life expectancy of 78.4 years, the fifth-longest in the country. 37.2% of the population is overweight and 21.7% is obese, and Massachusetts ranks sixth-highest in the percentage of residents who are considered neither obese nor overweight (41.1%). Massachusetts also ranks above average in the prevalence of binge drinking, which is the 20th-highest in the country.|$|E
5|$|On December18, 1998, the United Nations {{launched}} a large-scale rehabilitation effort in Cuba. Roughly $14million {{was spent on}} housing and infrastructure reconstruction and repair; {{this portion of the}} project consisted of reconstruction of homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, irrigation and the water system. Another $1.1million was used to inform and protect residents against post-storm diseases. The largest part of the effort involved jump-starting agriculture and fisheries. Roughly $50.4million was provided to reconstruct fishing vessels, purchase new tools and gear. By mid-February 1999, the Governments of Italy, Germany, Canada and the European Union provided $1million, $714,000, $50,000, and $510,200 in funds respectively. The Government of Israel also supplied agricultural tools. The Government of Norway provided $29,100 in water-borne <b>disease</b> <b>prevention</b> funds. Through various agencies, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided Cuba with roughly $86million in disaster funding.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest <b>disease</b> <b>prevention</b> study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E

The present analysis emphasizes the role of food in <b>diseases</b> <b>prevention,</b> and allowed identifying aspects of continuity with older notions on diet, which were not erased by the new knowledge on nutrition introduced by chemistry and experimental physiology...|$|R
