40|$|Two phase {{liquid-liquid}} flow {{is described}} as the concurrent flow of two immiscible liquids, encountered widely in the petroleum industry during the production and transportation of oil and water. Good estimations of rheological and pipeline <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> of these fluids are very important for proper processing and flow assurance assessment. However, despite of their importance, liquid-liquid <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> have not been investigated {{to the same extent}} as gas-liquid flows for crude oils. Experimental investigations on liquid-liquid flow in a pipeline are mainly based on binary synthetic oils and water. Models reported in the literature are generally based on the synthetic oil experiments supported by additional field tests. The prediction models are based on the following input bulk liquid properties for each phase: density, viscosity, and interfacial tension. However, crude oil systems contain interfacially active substances (resins and asphaltenes) that influence the formation and stability of droplets. Consequently, liquid-liquid <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> of crude oil systems are generally different from synthetic oil systems even if both systems have similar density, viscosity, and interfacial tension values. The skilled chemist {{needs to be able to}} model the behaviour of crude oil wherever the need arises. In particular, it would be valuable to be able to model crude oil behaviour in a pipeline where it will be mixed with water. Whilst crude oil itself could be used, this obviously involves transportation of the crude oil to wherever it is needed. Also, crude oil is a noxious substance and is ideally avoided as there are issues with toxicity, volatility, storage, and so on. There is also the issue of laboratory safety. Consequently, it would be a great deal easier if the research petrochemical chemist had at his disposal a composition that mimicked the behaviour of crude oil which could be used for modelling crude oil behaviour and transport properties. This work was developed within the aims of the project “Multiphase Flow Assurance Centre (FACE) ” and has been two folded with an attempt to investigate interfacial, rheological and pipeline flow properties of North Sea crude oils and their emulsions and prepare synthetic oils for mimicking the bulk, interfacial, and <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> of acidic crude oils and their emulsions. The influence of dispersed phase volume fraction, temperature, shear rate, and flow rate on rheological and pipeline <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> of North Sea acidic crude oil emulsions were investigated in Paper 1. Paper 2 investigates the influence of the pH on the pressure drop, pressure gradient, viscosity, droplet size, and droplet size distribution of water-in-North Sea acidic crude oil emulsions in pipelines. Paper 3 aims to investigate the effect of aqueous phase pH on the dynamic interfacial tension behaviours of acidic crude oils. The paper 3 also aims to the find suitable synthetic oils and interfacial active molecules for mimicking the initial, equilibrium, and dynamic interfacial behaviours of acidic crude oils at various pHs. In paper 4 (patent application) aims for the preparation and characterization of synthetic reference oils for the North Sea acidic crude oil emulsions. The motivation for this work was to prepare synthetic reference oils mimicking the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as pressure gradient, pressure drop, viscosity, Reynolds Number, friction factor, inversion point, and in-situ droplet size of water-in-North Sea acidic crude oils emulsions in pipelines. The motivation for the paper 5 was to systematically investigate the rheological and pipeline <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> of water-in-North Sea heavy crude oil emulsions at different aqueous volume fractions, temperatures, shear rates, and flow rates.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out to {{describe}} the flow of liquids in packed beds but the non-wetting flow of liquid has received relatively little attention. Non-wetting flow {{is an important factor in}} modelling the flow of liquid iron and slag in the blast furnace lower zone where the liquid iron does not wet the coke. This paper reports results of visualisation of the flow of non-wetting liquids through a 2 -D array of regularly packed cylinders. A video technique is used to visualise the liquid flow patterns through the packed bed. Two major flow patterns are identified: rivulet and droplet. The flow regimes depend on liquid fraction, liquid flow rate and height of packed bed. The maximum percolation velocity at the bottom of the packed bed are also measured using high speed video analysis. Water, mercury and glycerol are selected to examine the effect of physical properties on the liquid <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> and maximum percolation velocity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the local {{transfer}} coefficients between fluid and wall surface and the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> in back of turbulence promotors in a rectangular channel and then to discuss the mechanism for the improvement of the transfer coefficients. The transfer coefficients, the shear stress and the turbulent intensity have been obtained by using the electrochemical method of the redox system under the diffusion control and the <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> have been observed by using the aluminum tracer method. The results of the transfer coefficients and the shear stresses with turbulence promotors were compared with those without promotors, as Sh/ Sh_ 0 τ/τ_ 0. They were graphically correlated with the diameter, the pitch of the promotor and flow Reynolds number. The turbulence intens ities near the wall surface were also correlated with those parameters. These results agreed reasonably with the observation of aluminum tracer method. It was found that the improvement of transfer coeffic ients in back of the turbulence promotors depends on the turbulent intensity near the wall surface. 伝熱係数の増進に関する研究は，高温高熱流束下の熱除去，コンパクト熱交換器の設計，工業用水の不足対策などの省エネルギー，省資源において重要視すべき課題である。伝熱性能向上の一方法として簡単に応用できるものに乱流促進体がある。乱流促進体には，伝熱面近傍の境界層を直接撹乱させるもの，主流そのものを撹乱させるもの，および流体に施回を与え流れの分速度を大きくするとともに，遠心力効果あるいは二次流れ効果を利用したものなどがある。平滑管に対し粗面管は，熱伝達を促進することがすでに知られている。反面圧力損失も増加する。しかし，この圧力損失増加は，移動に要するポンプ動力，伝熱面積の減少等のエネルギー有効利用の立場から，必ずしも熱的性能をそこなうものでないと考えられる。本研究では，乱流促進体として円柱を用い，これを伝熱面に流れと直角に設置し，促進体後方における伝熱面において各種流体力学的物理量と局所移動係数を，フェリーフェロの酸化還元系電極反応を用いて，物質移動係数を求めアナロジーにより伝熱係数を求める方法を選んだ。上記諸量の分布より，実験的に移動係数の増進機構が解明されるが，流動状態の把握，促進体後流で生じる渦流の挙動などを明らかにするため，アルミ粉トレーサ法による可視化実験を行ない詳細な検討を加えた...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{prediction of}} flow in a dimpled channel is reported. The flow regimes considered cover {{a wide range}} of Reynolds numbers, which range from 380 to 99000 and which are equivalent to a range of inlet velocities from very low (0. 072 m/s) to very high (60 m/s). In this study, calculations were made using the standard k-e model with standard wall function. The drag coefficient, skin friction drag, pressure drag, and pressure distribution around a dimple were investigated. As the velocity increased, the drag coefficient decreased until the velocity exceeded 45 m/s, after which it increased. Furthermore, the pressure drag and skin friction drag depend on the velocity. Particles with a density of 2440 kg/m 3 and a diameter of 100 microns were tracked through the domain to estimate the frequency, velocity, and angle of impact of the particles and to estimate the resulting erosion rate. It was found that the maximum erosion rate occurred between 40 and 65 degrees from {{the leading edge of the}} dimple. Furthermore, a computational study of the flow fields of three dimples in an in-line arrangement is presented.

The base liquid film thickness distributions, determined by either wavy or full annular flow regime, are compared with available experimental data.

Results from liquid distributions and two-phase <b>flow</b> <b>behaviours</b> have indicated the presence of strong gas/liquid interferences. This can largely contribute towards the thickening of the liquid film coverage along the top pipe wall surface for a fully developed annular flow, compared to those occurred in the wavy annular flow regime. This is due to possible earlier droplets broken down thus the liquid wavy front can travel from the low part of the pipe to the upper wall surface.

50|$|Also {{known as}} the Ostwald-de Waele power law this {{mathematical}} relationship is useful because of its simplicity, but only approximately describes the behaviour of a real non-Newtonian fluid.

Therefore, the power law is only a good description of fluid behaviour across the range of shear rates to which the coefficients were fitted.
