5|$|As <b>knowledge</b> <b>has</b> increased, {{paleontology}} {{has developed}} specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion years ago. As <b>knowledge</b> <b>has</b> increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} kingship in Europe {{ultimately}} originates in systems of tribal kingship in prehistoric Europe. The Minoan (c. 3200 – c. 1400 BCE) and Mycenaean civilisation (c. 1600 – c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in protohistoric Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the Linear B script in 1952, much <b>knowledge</b> <b>has</b> been acquired about {{society in the}} Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned as leaders of palace economies. The role of kings changed in the following Greek Dark Ages (c. 1100 – c. 750 BCE) to big gentleman farmers with military power.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, {{only a few}} {{benthic species}} of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and catsharks, had survived in {{aquarium}} conditions {{for a year or}} more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More <b>knowledge</b> <b>has</b> led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation. For a long time, the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long, but in September 2004, the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.|$|E
5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal. Against this idea {{it has been argued that}} he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's <b>knowledge)</b> <b>has</b> been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much <b>knowledge</b> <b>has</b> been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E

25|$|Biological {{psychiatry}} is {{a branch}} of psychiatry where the focus is chiefly on researching and understanding the biological basis of major mental disorders such as unipolar and bipolar affective (mood) disorders, schizophrenia and organic mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself.
