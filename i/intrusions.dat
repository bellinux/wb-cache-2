It is therefore imperative {{to detect the}} network <b>intrusion</b> to ensure the normal operation of the internet. There are many studies in the <b>intrusion</b> detection and <b>intrusion</b> patter recognition. The artificial neural network (ANN) {{has proven to be}} powerful for the <b>intrusion</b> detection.

40|$|Abstract- An <b>intrusion</b> {{response}} {{system is}} charged with minimizing any losses caused by <b>intrusion.</b> It remains ineffective if {{the response to the}} <b>intrusion</b> does not bring the timely and adequate corrections required by the victim system. This paper proposes a new <b>intrusion</b> response system based on contextual fuzzy cognitive map. In this <b>intrusion</b> response system framework, a new ontology is defined based upon conceptual graphs in order to describe relationships between different <b>intrusion</b> concepts and recognize suspect connection as an <b>intrusion</b> which belongs to known <b>intrusion</b> class (DOS, PROBING, U 2 R or R 2 U). Fuzzy cognitive maps are used to assess the negative impact of an <b>intrusion</b> on the victim system. Specifying appropriate remedies for all damages which are caused by <b>intrusion</b> is considered as main task of <b>intrusion</b> response system. There are two kinds of remedies: direct or indirect remedies, the former is accomplished by acting directly on the victim system but the later is considered as remotely acting on damaged system. The proposed <b>intrusion</b> response system is multilayer system. The first layer {{is charged with}} the identification of the <b>intrusion</b> suspect <b>intrusion</b> using conceptual graphs to build a new ontology.

5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older rocks are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma <b>intrusions</b> of diabase rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and pegmatite <b>intrusions</b> also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss.
