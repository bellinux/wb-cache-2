After the first interim analysis, the short-short regimen was stopped. RESULTS: A total of 1437 women were enrolled. At the first interim analysis, the rates of HIV transmission were 4. 1 percent for the long-long regimen and 10. 5 percent for the short-short regimen (P= 0. 004). For the entire study period, the transmission rates were 6. 5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4. 1 to 8. 9 percent) for the long-long regimen, 4. 7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2. 4 to 7. 0 percent) for the long-short regimen, and 8. 6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5. 6 to 11. 6 percent) for the short-long regimen.

METHODS: Study based on {{a convenience sample of}} women unaware of their HIV serostatus when they were admitted to delivery in public maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre, Brazil, between March 2000 and April 2002. Women were counseled and tested using the Determine HIV 1 / 2 Rapid Test. HIV infection was confirmed using the Brazilian algorithm for HIV infection diagnosis. <b>In</b> <b>utero</b> <b>transmission</b> of HIV was determined using HIV-DNA-PCR. There were performed descriptive analyses of sociodemographic data, number of previous pregnancies and abortions, number of prenatal care visits, timing of HIV testing, HIV rapid test result, neonatal and mother-to-child transmission interventions, by city studied. RESULTS: HIV prevalence in women was 6. 5 % (N= 1, 439) in Porto Alegre and 1. 3 % (N= 3. 778) in Rio de Janeiro. In Porto Alegre most of women were tested during labor (88. 7 %), while in Rio de Janeiro most were tested in the postpartum (67. 5 %). One hundred and forty-four infants were born to 143 HIV-infected women. All newborns but one in each city received at least prophylaxis with oral zidovudine. It was possible to completely avoid newborn exposure to breast milk in 96. 8 % and 51. 1 % of the cases in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{the first}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy, HIV- 1 mother-to-child transmission is relatively rare despite the permissivity of placental cells to cell-to-cell HIV- 1 infection. The placenta interacts directly with maternal uterine cells (decidual cells) but the physiological role of the decidua in the control of HIV- 1 transmission and whether decidua could {{be a source of}} infected cells is unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To answer to this question, decidual mononuclear cells were exposed to HIV- 1 in vitro. Decidual cells were shown to be more susceptible to infection by an R 5 HIV- 1, as compared to an X 4 HIV- 1. Infected cells were identified by flow cytometry analysis. The results showed that CD 14 (+) cells were the main targets of HIV- 1 infection in the decidua. These infected CD 14 (+) cells expressed DC-SIGN, CD 11 b, CD 11 c, the Fc gamma receptor CD 16, CD 32 and CD 64, classical MHC class-I and class-II and maturation and activation molecules CD 83, CD 80 and CD 86. The permissivity of decidual tissue was also evaluated by histoculture. Decidual tissue was not infected by X 4 HIV- 1 but was permissive to R 5 HIV- 1.

GBV-C RNA was extracted from serum and amplified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-seven (36 %) of these 75 HIV-infected women tested positive for GBV-C RNA. To study transmission dynamics, we chose a random subsample of 20 of these women and their infants. In this cohort, there was evidence of postnatal transmission of GBV-C; however, {{it was not possible to}} demonstrate evidence of <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> or intrapartum <b>transmission.</b> <b>In</b> this pilot observational study, transmission of HIV from mother-to-infant occurs independently of the GBV-C infection status of the mother. The immunological indices measured tend to suggest an association with protection and or delayed progression of HIV disease in GBV-C–infected mothers. In the province of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, the HIV pandemic and the consequent development of AIDS poses an enormous threat to the socioeconomic and political landscape of this province [1].

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vertical transmission is important to enhance the accuracy of monitoring protocols for endemically infected breeding herds. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the prevalence of PRRSV within infected litters, to quantify viremia, and to identify specific attributes of infected individuals. Eight gilts were intramuscularly inoculated with 101 TCID 50 of a mildly virulent PRRSV strain (MN- 30100) at 90 d of gestation. All inoculated gilts transmitted the virus in utero. The proportion of PRRSV PCR-positive piglets and the level of viremia in the piglets were higher at 4 d of age than at birth or at weaning. No specific attributes were associated with PRRSV infection in the piglets. This is the first report, that we are aware of, documenting the efficient <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>transmission</b> of an extremely low dose of a mildly virulent strain of PRRSV. The results support the sampling of piglets late during lactation as a tool to monitor PRRSV shedding from sow-herds...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} obesity during pregnancy raises concerns over the intergenerational transmission of obesity and its potential to exacerbate the current obesity epidemic. The fetal origins hypothesis posits that the intrauterine environment might have lasting effects on children's outcomes. A large literature establishes that mother's pre-pregnancy obesity is correlated with obesity in her children. However, previous research is largely based on comparing individuals across families and hence cannot control for unobservable factors associated with both maternal and child obesity. We use both within-family comparisons and an instrumental variable approach on a sample of 4435 children to identify the effect of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity on obesity in preschool-aged children. Consistent with extant research, OLS models that rely on across-family comparisons indicate a significant correlation between maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and preschool obesity. However, maternal fixed effects render those associations insignificant. Instrumenting for mother's BMI with her sisters' BMI values confirms the null result indicating that the <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>transmission</b> of obesity is likely not driving the increase in childhood obesity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) {{is caused}} by the protozoon Leishmania infantum. Transmission of this parasite to hosts occurs mainly through the bite of infected sand flies. However, alternative infection routes have been hypothesized, especially in areas where the biological vector is absent. The exact time of infection and whether <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>transmission</b> occurs have still not been fully elucidated. This report demonstrates molecular evidence of vertical transmission of L. infantum from a pregnant dog to the embryo. Samples (e. g. vulva, vagina, cervix, uterine body, uterine horn and ovaries) from a female naturally infected by L. infantum and from her embryo were molecularly analyzed by means of qPCR and cPCR followed by DNA sequencing. The gestational age was estimated to be 23 ± 1 day. Through qPCR, the presence of L. infantum DNA was detected in all the samples analyzed (n= 7), including the embryo, conversely through cPCR, only four samples (vagina, cervix, uterine body and embryo) were positive. This study demonstrated that transmission of L. infantum from a pregnant dog to the embryo might occur {{in the early days of}} pregnancy. In conclusion, this is the first report showing L. infantum infecting a canine embryo...|$|E
40|$|The major ways {{in which}} man acquires {{toxoplasmosis}} are through handling and consumption of raw meat and contact with feces (in litterpans and soil) from cats infected with Toxoplasma gondii. To prevent toxoplasmosis, certain steps should be taken. Meat should be heated throughout to 150 F (66 C) before consumption, and hands should be washed {{with soap and water}} after handling meat to remove any toxoplasma organisms contaminating the skin. Infection of indoor cats can be prevented by feeding them dry, canned, or boiled food and by restraining them from hunting. To the extent that diet cannot be controlled, an indoor eat's litterpan should be cleaned daily, feces should be flushed down the toilet, and the pan should be disinfected with boiling water. A person should wear disposable gloves while performing these tasks. Since soil contaminated by oocysts from T. gondii in feline feces is difficult to disinfect, contaminated sand in chil-dren's sandboxes should be disposed of, and gloves should be worn while one is working with soil that may contain feces from cats. Pregnant women should avoid cats whose source of food is unknown and should not empty litter pans, as toxo-plasmosis can be transmitted to infants <b>in</b> <b>utero.</b> The <b>transmission</b> of toxoplasmosis first became of interest with the discovery of neonatal infection. In the newborn baby, the disease often gives rise to disorders of the central nervous system and the eyes [1, 2]. Subsequently, the transmission of toxoplasmosis from raw or undercooked meat was suspected [3, 4], confirmed experimentally [5], and illustrated by an epidemic attributed to ham-burger meat [6]. It became apparent during the last few years that a stage of Toxoplasma gondii was shed in the feces of cats [7 - 9]. After an oocyst was discovered in feline feces and it was shown that Toxoplasma can be transmitted like other coccidia [10, 11], the focus of interest in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis shifted almost en-tirely to the role of cats since {{there is no evidence that}} other animals shed toxoplasma oocysts [10...|$|R

40|$|Outcomes of Zika virus (ZIKV) {{infection}} in pregnant women vary from {{the birth of}} asymptomatic offspring to abnormal development and severe brain lesions in fetuses and infants. There are concerns that offspring affected <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> and born without apparent symptoms may develop mental illnesses. Therefore, animal models are important to test interventions against <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> infection and health sequelae in symptomatic and likely more widespread asymptomatic offspring. To partially reproduce <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> infection <b>in</b> humans, we directly inoculated selected porcine conceptuses with ZIKV.
