5|$|Halkett was {{an amateur}} inventor, and during {{his spare time}} whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving {{the problem of how}} to design a boat that would be small and light enough to {{transport}} easily on foot through wilderness, but robust <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> people in safety across wide bodies of water. His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} high desert region are the Northern Paiute people. These Native Americans were once semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who relied on nuts, roots, seeds, berries, and eggs, and animals such as deer, pronghorn, geese, quail, rabbits, and bear, following their food to high and low elevations depending {{on the time of}} year. They make sandals, traps, and fishing nets, and weave baskets. Made out of sagebrush, willow, tule plant, Indian hemp, and sumac fibers, the baskets are tight <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> water. Archaeological evidence from near Fort Rock has shown that people wove baskets in the area at least 9,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 the {{formerly}} independent Hammersmith and City Railway was {{absorbed by the}} Metropolitan Railway and the Great Western Railway, and was operated from then on by Metropolitan Railway trains. The plan for a terminus in Fulham was abandoned, and the line instead turned west at Hammersmith to run over London and South Western Railway tracks to Richmond. Although Wandsworth Town railway station, near {{the southern end of}} the bridge, had provided direct connections to central London since 1846, the lack of rail connections opening on the north bank meant the area on the Fulham side remained undeveloped, and bridge usage was low. Tolmé's design was not sturdy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> heavy vehicles, and drainage problems on the approach road to the north discouraged vehicles from using Wandsworth Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Rapid forces, {{whether for}} an {{offensive}} or defensive purpose, {{were needed to}} deny vital locations to the enemy. Long before the Germans did, the French had contemplated using airborne troops to achieve speedy attacks. As early as 1936 the French had commissioned the design of light airborne tanks, but these plans had been abandoned in 1940, as they possessed no cargo planes large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> them. A naval division and an infantry division were earmarked to depart for Zealand to block the Western Scheldt against a German crossing. These would send forward forces over the Scheldt estuary into the Isles, supplied by overseas shipping.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the Dutch ships {{was the end of}} the final attempt by a {{continental}} nation to land troops in Ireland during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that followed them. Furie and Waakzaamheid were both purchased for the Royal Navy, Furie returned to her pre-war name of Wilhelmina and Waakzaamheid under the same name. The corvette was regraded and the number of guns aboard were reduced to 20 as her frame was not deemed strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> 24. Richard King remained in Sirius until 1802, and subsequently commanded the ship of the line HMS Achille, participating at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the breed are not fully documented, but some {{evidence}} points to the ancestors of the Jutland {{being used by the}} Vikings during the early 9th century. Images from the time show Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain riding horses similar in appearance to the modern Jutland. Some of those horses may have been left behind, contributing to the base stock from which the Suffolk Punch was eventually developed. Horses from Jutland were exported to England, Germany and France during the Middle Ages, and were popular mounts for knights, especially for use in jousting. The first mention of the Jutland type is from the 12th century, when they are documented as war horses with many useful attributes. The Jutland horse appears in the Danish ballad Svend Felding's Kamp med Risen, in which mythic hero Svend Fælling goes on a pilgrimage to Rome and on his journey encounters a giant. Other horses prove too shy or too weak to enable him to confront the giant, therefore Svend obtains a Jutland horse from a passing miller, who claims that it is strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> fifteen skippund. Mounted on the Jutland, Svend succeeds in killing the giant.|$|E
