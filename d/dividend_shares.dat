40|$|Ever since Modigliani and Miller {{made their}} {{irrelevance}} proposition, a key theme in corporate finance {{has been to}} explain {{the conditions under which}} capital structure does affect firm value. Split-capital closed-end funds successfully exploit such conditions, being worth on average 11 % more than conventional closed-end funds. Cross-section and time-series analyses reveal that the extra value comes mainly from two sources. The first (worth 4. 7 %) arises simply from limiting the life of the company, which automatically reduces the agency problem and makes any discount converge towards zero. The second (worth 5. 6 %) comes from being fifty-percent levered, which is shown to be predominantly a clientele effect rather than a tax effect. Using an option-pricing approach, it is found that two thirds of the extra value becomes lodged in the market prices of the ordinary (capital) shares, rather than in the prices of debt or <b>dividend</b> <b>shares.</b> The main conclusion is that small investors {{are willing to pay for}} leverage, in order to increase dividend yields.

A solution for TU-games assigns a set of payoff distributions (possibly empty or consisting of a unique element) to every TU-game. Harsanyi solutions are solutions {{that are based on}} distributing dividends.

Concepts such as moral hazard and asymmetric information are associated with behavioral finance and decision-making processes of companies. Behavioral economics sees the individual as irrational man who does not try to maximize his/her benefit, but mainly to minimize the risk in decision making. Against the background of the analyzed issue is made specific comparisons of dividend investment strategies with neutral/market strategies. Methods: Primary and secondary research was used in this article. Secondary research was based on a search of scientific articles and literature on the theory of <b>dividend,</b> <b>shares</b> and behavioral economics. Data from two previously conducted studies were used. Primary research was conducted on two stock indexes (dividend strategy vs. neutral/market strategy) using selected statistical methods, and then the connection was sought between dividend policy and the return that these strategies bring. Scientific aim: The aim {{of this paper}} was to make a critical analysis of investment dividend strategy compared with a neutral/market strategies using statistical methods. Findings: It can be concluded that long-term investing in dividend stocks gives the investor a slightly higher valuation, at about the same risk than investing in stocks covering the whole market.

40|$|Numerous {{empirical}} studies {{have attempted to}} measure the effect of changes in dividend policy on corporate equity values. One {{of the most popular}} study methodologies has been an examination of share price changes around ex-dividend days. Comparing the movement in a stock's price with its nominal dividend payment leads to estimates of the stock market's relative valuation of dividends and capital gains. Ex-day price studies are often interpreted as showing that investors recognize their tax liabilities and therefore discount their dividend income. These studies predict that firms which reduce their payout ratio shouldrise in value, and buttress the view that an increase in dividend taxes would reduce the value of the stock market. This study disputes these conclusions by presenting a "counterexample" which suggests that ex-dividend day studies provide limited insight into the effects of dividend taxes, or dividend policy, on corporate valuation. I analyze a firm with two different classes of common stock: one class pays taxable cash dividends, while the other pays untaxed stock dividends. On exâ€”dividend days,the taxable-dividend shares experience a price decline equal to about seventy five percent of their dividend payment, while the untaxed stock distribution shares fall by the full value of their dividends. However, the prices of the two classes of equity do not reflect this apparent market preference for non-taxable distributions. The average price of taxable-dividend shares is approximately equal to that of the untaxed <b>dividend</b> <b>shares,</b> indicating that the market considers the two shares as equivalent. These findings are important for several reasons. First, they cast doubt on earlier conclusions, based on ex-dividend day studies, about how a change individend taxes or payout policy would affect the market value of equity capital. Second, the results may provide new insights which help to explain why firms pay dividends. They deny the view that investors hold dividend paying stocks only because they are necessary for diversification, and may suggest that there is some attribute of cash dividends which investors genuinely value. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{synthesis}} of the literature on the changing perspectives of corporate distribution policy. Design/methodology/approach – This paper synthesizes and interprets the theoretical, empirical and survey-based research on corporate payout policy. Findings – Dividends once constituted a prominent part of an investor's total return, but this role has declined over time. Although many companies still pay cash <b>dividends,</b> <b>share</b> repurchases have risen dramatically and are now a significant component of payout. Research limitations/implications – New theories and perspectives on corporate distribution are likely to be introduced; while this paper represents an up-to-date view on the topic, it is not possible to anticipate new research developments that may affect some of the perspectives expressed herein. Practical implications – No single explanation fully accounts for the changes in distribution policy, most notably, the declining incidence of dividend-paying firms and the increasing level of repurchase activity. Factors that explain the popularity of share repurchases in the USA include the improved regulatory environment, economic conditions, and the flexibility of repurchases relative to dividends. Developing a comprehensive model that explains the choice between <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchase remains a challenge facing researchers.

40|$|Firms pay out cash {{using both}} <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchases. In many aspects these two means are similar, but one {{important}} {{difference is that}} dividends are generally taxed more heavily than share repurchases. Nevertheless firms persist in paying out large amounts in dividends. This paper provides an explanation for this dividend puzzle by developing a class of signaling models violating the "single-crossing" property in which information {{about the quality of}} the firm is asymmetric between the management and the shareholders. In these models a high-quality firm can always signal its quality by using share repurchases only. However, in certain cases share repurchases become costlier on the margin for a high-quality firm than for a low-quality imitator. In such cases, the high-quality firm signals most cost efficiently by means of a combination of share repurchases and taxable cash dividends financed by the issuance of new <b>shares.</b> Taxable cash <b>dividends</b> financed by the issuance of new shares then can be considered a positive kind of money burning whose role is to signal a firm’s high quality. The implications of the models are consistent with several important empirical facts about <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchases. Thus, this paper’s main contribution is to examine a range of new signaling models that provides a role for taxable cash <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchases and to derive their empirical implications.

The analysis is similar in spirit to the analysis carried out by Kasa (1992).
