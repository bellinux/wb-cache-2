25|$|These new fashions made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} life of the servant. From the 1760s Palladianism was slowly superseded by Neoclassicism. A defining feature of the Neoclassical house was the absence of the first floor piano nobile. This was in part due to the picturesque values then coming into vogue. During this—the era of Humphrey Repton's idyllic landscapes—it became desirable to step from any of the main rooms directly into the landscape. It was also desirable for all four sides of a house to <b>enjoy</b> <b>this</b> luxury.|$|E
25|$|Iliescu and his {{supporters}} split from the Front and created the Democratic National Salvation Front (NSDF), which later evolved into the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), then the Social Democratic Party (PSD) (see Social Democratic Party of Romania). Progressively, the Front lost its character as a national government or generic coalition, and became vulnerable to criticism for using its appeal as the first institution involved in power sharing, while engaging itself in political battles with forces that could not <b>enjoy</b> <b>this</b> status, nor the credibility.|$|E
25|$|The first regular {{newspaper}} in Tamil was Swadesamitran in 1882, started by G.Subramaniya Iyer, editor and sponsor of The Hindu and {{founding member of}} the Indian National Congress. He created a whole new Tamil political vocabulary. He) was conscious that those with a knowledge of English are a small number and those with a knowledge of Indian languages the vast majority. He felt that unless our people were told about the objectives of British rule and its merits and defects in the Indian languages, our political knowledge would never develop. When Subramania Aiyer quit The Hindu 1898, he made the Swadesamitran his full-time business. In 1899, the first Tamil daily. It was to <b>enjoy</b> <b>this</b> status for 17 years.|$|E

25|$|Assaliaq (assaliq; lit. «fried thing»; also, pancake; other fried food; fry bread) {{is fresh}} fried fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except the {{entrails}} are used to prepare this dish, although often the heads are removed as well. The fish is filleted, dipped in seasoned flour, or just seasoned with salt, and fried in oil. If households enjoy picking and sucking backbones or only a few fish are available, the backbone will be fried along with the filleted pieces. Heads are sometimes fried for the same reasons. Boiled rice is the favorite side dish with this meal. Middle aged and younger people <b>enjoy</b> <b>this</b> meal for the flavor. The verb assali- (to fry; to make pancakes or griddlecakes) is derived from Russian жа́рить (zhárit’) ‘to roast, fry, broil, grill’.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May, {{the emperor}} {{appointed}} d'Aspré Proprietor (Inhaber) of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 18. Unfortunately, the general was not destined to <b>enjoy</b> <b>this</b> honor for very long. D'Aspré's division maintained the same {{organization for the}} Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, except that the Mayblümel battalion was renamed Locher. Also, two 6-pounder and one 3-pounder brigade batteries were attached, with a total strength of 24 cannons. On {{the night of the}} 4th, Napoleon launched a massive amphibious assault from Lobau Island to the north bank of the Danube, forcing back the Austrian VI Armeekorps and Advance Guard. At 6:00 PM that afternoon, Napoleon sent Nicolas Oudinot's II Corps, Eugène de Beauharnais' Army of Italy, and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's IX Saxon Corps to break Archduke Charles' line near Wagram. After initially being driven back, the Austrian I and II Armeekorps counterattacked and routed the Franco-Allied forces.|$|E
25|$|Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (the RaMCHaL) {{posited that}} God's purpose in {{creation}} {{was to give}} a gift from God's good to another being. Since God is perfect, {{it would have been}} insufficient for God to give merely a partial good. Rather, God would have to give the ultimate good that God's creation – humankind – could receive. As God is the true good, that ultimate good is found in God. Allowing God's creatures to become more attached to God would thus allow them to experience this ultimate receivable good. Thus, the purpose of creation was to bring into existence a creature who could derive pleasure from God's own good. God further recognized that for humanity to most <b>enjoy</b> <b>this</b> good, humanity would have to feel that humanity had earned it. God therefore arranged that humanity be able to perceive right and wrong, and have access to both. God thus gave humanity the means to earn the attachment to God that God sought to give.|$|E

25|$|I find it {{amazing that}} he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, {{it seems to be}} in line with a more modern {{understanding}} of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would <b>enjoy</b> <b>this</b> book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.|$|E
