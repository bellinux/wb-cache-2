40|$|More than 25 {{bathymetry}} profiles {{have been}} used to examine the flexure of the Pacific lithosphere seaward of the Izu-Bonin and Mariana trenches. Selected bathymetry profiles have been corrected for the effects of sediment loading and compared to simple elastic and elastic-plastic models for lithospheric flexure seaward of these trenches. Profiles of the northern Mariana trench, where the seaward wall is relatively gentle, can be explained by a simple elastic model without an applied <b>horizontal</b> <b>load.</b> Profiles of the Izu-Bonin and southern Mariana trenches, where the seaward wall is relatively steep, can be explained by an elastic-plastic model with an applied load of 4. 0 - 6. 0 kbar, depending on the uniform yield stress assumed. If it is assumed the yield stress varies with depth the <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> required is significantly reduced (≲ 2. 5 kbar). The magnitude of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> cannot be determined with certainty, however, since it is not known how the yield stress may vary with depth.

30|$|Under <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> column {{may be in}} {{different}} working states. If the external <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> is zero, column will not move, which is named as “full compression without slip”. Under cyclic <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> such as earthquake and wind, if the external force {{is less than the}} friction force at column foot, there is no relative displacement between column and stone base. Column foot transfer seismic energy all from the bottom of structure to upper structure. Column will rotate under the effect of <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> which is named as “column rocking without slip”. If the external force is larger than the friction force at column foot, slip will appear to the column foot. Column will rotate under the effect of <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> which is named as “column rocking with slip”. At this working state, the shear force at column foot is equal to the friction force according to the horizontal force equilibrium equation. And, the load transferred from the bottom of column foot to upper structure is same with friction force, which plays an obvious seismic isolation effects. After seismic load, column may be in a new state with irreclaimable slip, which is named as “full compression with slip”. During column rocking, if the restoring moment is less than the external moment, column will overturn, which is named as “column overturning”. Therefore, with the combined effects of vertical and horizontal loads, column may be in five possible working states: (a) full compression without slip; (b) full compression with slip; (c) column rocking without slip; (d) column rocking with slip and (e) column overturning. The force systems of column in working states (a) and (b) are clear. While the force systems of column in working states (c) and (d) under seismic load are not clear, which should be studied further.|$|E
