40|$|The {{causes of}} early embryo {{abortion}} in the reciprocal crosses between Phaseolus vulgaris L. and <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus</b> Greenm. were studied. Methacrylate resin sections, 2 micron meter thick, of 2 to 6 day-old hybrid seeds {{were used to}} examine the stage of embryo development and the state of seed tissues. These observations permitted the determination of the main causes of abortion and the developmental stages at which interspecific embryos should be rescued. Early nutritional barriers in <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus</b> (Q) x <b>Phaseolus</b> vulgaris crosses are related to a deficient endosperm development while in reciprocal crosses, endothelium proliferation and, in some extent, hypertrophy of the vascular elements might be the main causes of early embryo abortion. The importance of the abnormalities observed during embryo development depended to a great extent on the compatibility between the genotypes crossed. Results also suggest that the appropriate time for embryo rescue when <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus</b> is a female partner is at the early globular stage...|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic {{relationships}} among 74 accessions belonging to six species of Phaseolus are investigated using variation in chloroplast DNA assessed {{according to a}} PCR-RFLP protocol. Three fragments of chloroplast DNA are amplified using universal primers, and then digested with 10 restriction enzymes. Thirty-six haplotypes are identified {{on the basis of}} the polymorphism in fragment number and size. Three main phylogenetic groups, strongly supported through bootstrap analysis, are identified: (1) accessions from Phaseolus lunatus and Phaseolus xolocotzii; (2) accessions from Phaseolus glabellus; (3) accessions from <b>Phaseolus</b> vulgaris, <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus</b> and <b>Phaseolus</b> coccineus. Within the third group, accessions of Phaseolus coccineus are scattered along the phylogenetic tree, which provides some evidence that coccineus accessions are paraphyletic with respect to Phaseolus vulgaris and <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus.</b> An analysis of molecular variance applied on four species show that they are significantly differentiated with 79 % of molecular variance among species and 21 % within species. The results agree with previous investigations on chloroplast DNA variation in the genus Phaseolus, and suggest that PCRRFLP methods, which are technically less labour-intensive than previous methods, are of great value for phylogenetic investigations at the generic level.

40|$|A {{review of}} embryos rescue in food legumes {{in general and}} in the genus Phaseolus in particular. Genetic {{improvement}} of Phaseolus vulgaris L. by interspecific hybridization with Phaseolus coccineus L. and <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus</b> Greenm., used as female parents, often gives rise to embryo abortion at globular developmental stage. In vitro culture of embryos at cotyledonary and torpedo shaped stages, leads to hybrid plants, but with very low percentages of success. Several investigations of in vitro culture in selfed genotypes of Phaseolus and from embryos at globular or young heart shaped stages have allowed to regenerate some young plantlets. However, problems of rooting and stopping of growth restrict the number of developing plantlets. Analysis of the results achieved from interspecific embryo rescue in others food legumes of the genus Lupinus, Cajanus, Cicer, Lens and Trifolium, helped to identify some solutions to resolve incompatibility problems in Phaseolus...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{interspecific}} breeding between Phaseolus vulgaris L. (PV) {{and the two}} donor species Phaseolus coccineus L. (PC) or <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus</b> Greenm. (PP) requires the utilization of the donor species as female parents. Although incompatibility barriers are post-zygotic, success in such F 1 crosses is very limited due to early hybrid embryo abortion. Rescue techniques for globular or early heart-shaped embryos have been improved but hybrid plant regeneration remains very difficult. In this study we describe the use of protoplast fusion techniques within the genus Phaseolus, {{as an alternative to}} succeed crosses between PP or PC and PV. Large numbers of heterokaryons have been produced using different genotypes and procedures for fusion, based either on electro-fusion (750 or 1500 V. cm- 1), or on the use of a chemical micro-method with polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) as the fusing agent. Both divisions of heterokaryons and the formation of heterokaryon-derived microcalli were observed...|$|R
40|$|Total seed protein {{variability}} {{in a sample}} of 163 entries of year-bean (<b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus),</b> including wild, feral and cultivated forms of the whole range of distribution in Latin America was studied using 1 -dimensional SDS/PAGE and 2 -dimensional IEF-SDS/PAGE. Ten different patterns were observed in this crop. Eight of these are found in the Mesoamerican materials, the other two of those in the northern Andes. The highest diversity is found in the wild ancestral forms present in central Guatemala with six patterns. The b pattern predominant in all Mesoamerican cultivated materials is also present at low frequency in Colombia. The k pattern, predominant in the northern Andes, is present in Costa Rica. These results together with information on indigenous names for the crop suggest that there is a single gene pool domesticated from a wild ancestor still present in Guatemala, and distributed afterwards to the northern Andes, but with a clinal genetic drift from Mesoamerica to the Andean region.

40|$|Use of induced {{mutations}} in embryogenesis study in bean Phaseolus vulgaris L. and two model plants, Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. and Zea mays L [...] Breeding of common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., through interspecific hybridizations with the species Phaseolus coccineus L. and <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus</b> Greenm. as female parents {{leads to the}} abortion of immature embryos. Identification of genes required for embryo development could partly explain the abortion of hybrid embryos; induced mutations could thus be an alternative to identify key genes involved in Phaseolus embryogenesis. This paper is a review which shows {{a few examples of}} the use of induced {{mutations in}} the identification of essential genes for embryogenesis in two model plants, Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyhn. for dicots and Zea mays L. for monocots. In these two species, embryo development mutants have been isolated using insertional mutagenesis and chemical mutagenesis with Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS). Arabidopsis embryo mutants are affected in apical-basal axis polarity, radial pattern and in post-embryonic stages. Some Arabidopsis embryo mutants are defected in auxin signalisation. In maize, defective kernel (dek) mutants are affected in the embryo and the endosperm, while in embryo specific (emb) mutants, only the embryo is affected. In common bean, plants deficient in seed development were isolated using EMS mutagenesis. Embryos inside the seeds fail to growth at different stages of development and show abnormalities mainly in the suspensor and the cotyledons...|$|R
40|$|Development of an {{in vitro}} culture {{technique}} for immature Phaseolus embryos. In the interspecific crosses <b>Phaseolus</b> <b>polyanthus</b> (or P. coccineus) (i?) x P. vulgaris, the hybrid embryos abort very early. Therefore, it is essentiel {{to develop an}} in vitro culture technique that allows the rescue of beau embryos at globular or early heart-shaped stages. After several trials conceming the salts composition, the sugar rate and the amino acid concentration of différent in vitro culture media, a technique has been developed for heart-shaped Phaseolus embryos. This technique consists of two stages. In a first step, embryos are cultivated under darkness until their germination on a medium containing the salts of Gamborg et al. (1968), 400 mg. 1 ` (5 mM - 1 -') NHNO,, 1 mg. 1 -' thiamine HCI, 5 mg. l` nicotinic acid, 0. 5 mg - l` pyridoxine, 1, 000 mg. l` -glutamine, 1, 000 mg. l` casein hydrolysate, 100 mg. l` myo-inositol, 0. 028 mg. P N 6 -benzyladenine, 30 g. l` sucrase, and 8 g - 1 -' DIFCO agar. After germination, the embryos are cultivated under light on a second medium that does not contain any NHNO, complément and is poorer in amino acids (100 mg  1 -' L-glutamine). Developed with six deys old heart-shaped embryos of the P. vulgaris Bico de Ouro (NI 637) variety, this technique has proved its efficiency with other P. vulgaris and P. polyanthus génotypes. It allows an average régénération rate of 30 % from {{the total number of}} cultivated embryos...|$|R
