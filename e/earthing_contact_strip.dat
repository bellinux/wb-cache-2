The correct choice of <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> material influences the wear rate of contact wire and also <b>contact</b> <b>strip.</b> Reduction on wear for <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> but especially for contact wire involves reduction on maintenance costs.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{a railway}} system, trains get {{electricity}} through a structure mainly composed by contact wires and pantographs. The electricity runs through contact wire, a fixed wire suspended above railway tracks. Trains {{make contact with}} the wire and get the electricity that runs along the contact wire by means of a pantograph. In a railway system, a pantograph is a device fixed {{on the top of a}} train that reaches upwards towards the contact wire suspended above the train and creates the necessary contact between train and wire carrying electricity. The end part of the pantograph that touches the contact wire is known as <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> line. But if the surface of a <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> line is not smooth, contact between pantograph and suspended contact wire you get vibrations, generally a frequency of thousands of Hz with constant time damping of few hundred seconds. These vibrations give rise to acoustic signals that can be picked up by microphones mounted along the track. The acoustic signal is filtered to a range of thousands of hertz using a specific data signal process. At this point a special device is used to analyse the signal and determine the roughness of the <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> line that caused the vibrations. Different experiments have been carried out to understand the specific parameters of the acoustic signal, the results tell us how rough a <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> line actually is. The application of this method, to detect any defects in the pantograph, like undesired <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> line roughness, is original.

40|$|The {{method by}} which current is {{collected}} from overhead contact lines over the tracks via pantographs is widely used to supply power to EMUs and electric locomotives. Pantographs were first installed to trains in operation in Japan in 1914. Then, in 1922, the former Japanese National Railways completed the installation of pantographs to all electric locomotives and EMUs. Thus, pantographs have been playing the main role in current collection for rolling stock in Japan for nearly a century. The most important function required of pantographs is to collect the required current efficiently to vehicles when needed. To do that, pantographs need to have conductivity and capacity appropriate to their usage. These functions also should be maintained even in high speed running. Factors that determine the current collectivity of pantographs are largely classified into two factors: dynamic performance of the pantograph and wear resistance between the <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> and the <b>contact</b> wire. Pantographs absolutely must follow the vertical deviation of the contact wire even in high speed running without fail. <b>Contact</b> <b>strips</b> are installed {{to the top of}} a pantograph that contacts the contact wire, (Fig. 1). If a pantograph cannot follow the contact wire and <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> lose <b>contact</b> to the wire while large current is flowing, arcs are generated or current collection worsens. Such a situation is called contact loss. Arcs caused by contact loss increase wear of <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> and <b>contact</b> wire; and in worse case scenarios, they break both. If contact wire or <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> wear easily or cause wear on each other, that results in shorter lifespan and increase in maintenance expenses. Based on these factors, the Technical Center is carrying out R&D projects with an aim of extending lifespan of both of contact wires and <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> by decreasing wear of those. Here I wil...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} to {{estimate}} the electron diffusion length in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) is presented. DSCs were fabricated on conducting glass substrates that were patterned by laser ablation of the fluorine-doped tin oxide coating to form parallel <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> separated by uncontacted strips of the same width. The relative collection efficiency was measured {{as a function of}} the gap between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips,</b> which determines the lateral distance traveled by electrons to reach the contacts. To avoid complications arising from nonlinear recombination kinetics, current measurements were performed using small amplitude perturbations of the electron density close to open circuit and the maximum power point to minimize electron density gradients in the film. One and two-dimensional solutions of the continuity equation for electron transport and back reaction predict that the relative collection efficiency should fall as spacing between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> exceeds the electron diffusion length and electrons are lost by back electron transfer during transit to the contacts. Measurements of the relative collection efficiency were fitted to the predicted dependence of the collection efficiency on the spacing between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> to obtain the value of the electron diffusion length. The diffusion length is found to increase with voltage both at open circuit and at the maximum power point...|$|R
