25|$|Fallingwater {{stands as}} one of Wright's {{greatest}} masterpieces both for its dynamism and for its integration with its striking natural surroundings. Fallingwater {{has been described as}} an architectural tour <b>de</b> <b>force</b> of Wright's organic philosophy. Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony between man and nature. Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house,I think Wright learned {{the most important aspect of}} architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. When I visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, I found that same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that appealed to me.|$|E

Another highlight is the 1351 Reichenau Crozier. The Burghley Nef, a salt-cellar, French, dated 1527–28, uses a nautilus shell to form the hull of a vessel, which rests on {{the tail of a}} parcelgilt mermaid, who rests on a hexagonal gilt plinth on six claw-and-ball feet.
