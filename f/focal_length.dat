5|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} with the problems of wide-angle lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8mm <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> but is fairly insignificant as the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> is raised above 12mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8mm and 0.7% at 12mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16mm. SLAR Gear reports that the point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.|$|E
5|$|One model had its lens {{fixed to}} a bag bellows. A scissor {{mechanism}} held the bellows in its expanded state until {{the photo was}} taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards.

5000|$|The lens has {{significant}} distortion at 18mm and 35mm, but less so at other <b>focal</b> <b>lengths.</b> Similarly, lateral chromatic aberration is particularly noticeable at these <b>focal</b> <b>lengths,</b> and increases as the lens is stopped down. While center sharpness is high at all <b>focal</b> <b>lengths,</b> {{there is strong}} fall-off towards the edges and corners, particularly at 18mm. Neither edge nor center performance improve much at other <b>focal</b> <b>lengths.</b> Coma is well-corrected, but [...] "when it comes to flares, the Sony E 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 OSS fails spectacularly", according to reviewer Symon Starczewski of LensTip.com. Optical stabilisation gives a benefit of two stops.|$|R
50|$|Longitudinal {{chromatic}} aberration is a pronounced effect of optical telescope objectives, because the <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> are so long. Microscopes, whose <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> are generally shorter, do not tend {{to suffer from}} this effect.|$|R
50|$|Standards for the {{dispensing}} {{of prescription}} eyeglass lenses discourage {{the use of}} curvatures that deviate from definite <b>focal</b> <b>lengths.</b> Multiple <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> are accepted {{in the form of}} bifocals, trifocals, vari-focals, and cylindrical components for astigmatism.|$|R
5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took Pale Blue Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E
5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine {{the capabilities of the}} cameras.|$|E

The practical upper limit on <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> for eyepieces with 1.25" [...] barrels is about 32 mm. With longer <b>focal</b> <b>lengths,</b> the edges of the barrel itself intrude into the view limiting its size.

5|$|Between 1877 and 1931, Albert A. Michelson made {{multiple}} {{measurements of}} the speed of light. His 1877–79 measurements were performed under the auspices of Simon Newcomb, who was also working on measuring the speed of light. Michelson's setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault's original arrangement. As seen in Figure5, Michelson placed the rotating mirror R near the principal focus of lens L (i.e. the focal point given incident parallel rays of light). If the rotating mirror R were exactly at the principal focus, the moving image of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M (equal in diameter to lens L) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens, this being true regardless of the RM distance. Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000feet. To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance, Michelson used an extremely long <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lens (150feet) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15feet closer to L than the principal focus. This allowed an RS distance of between 28.5 to 33.3feet. He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air-turbine-powered mirror R, and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115mm. His 1879 figure for the speed of light, 299944±51km/s, was within about 0.05% of the modern value. His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements {{such as the use of}} polygonal prism-shaped rotating mirrors (enabling a brighter image) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts-per-million accuracy. His figure of 299,796±4km/s was only about 4km/s higher than the current accepted value. Michelson's final 1931 attempt to measure the speed of light in vacuum was interrupted by his death. Although his experiment was completed posthumously by F.G.Pease and F.Pearson, various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy, including an earthquake which disturbed the baseline measurement.|$|E

50|$|Ultra {{wide-angle}} lenses that do {{not produce}} a rectilinear image (i.e., exhibit barrel distortion) are called fisheye lenses.

25|$|Several other factors, such {{as subject}} matter, movement, camera-to-subject distance, lens <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> {{selected}} lens f-number, format size, and {{circle of confusion}} criteria also influence when a given defocus becomes noticeable.

25|$|The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes {{were also}} {{developed}} {{with a single}} objective and eyepiece lens. In contrast to the microscope, the objective lens of the telescope was designed with a large <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> to avoid optical aberrations. The objective focuses {{an image of a}} distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an eyepiece of a much smaller <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather collection of light which is determined by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of the objective divided by the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of the eyepiece, smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification.|$|E
