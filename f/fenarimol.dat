50|$|Necrotic ring spot can {{be managed}} through {{chemical}} and cultural controls. Cultural control includes the use of ammonium sulfate or other acidifying fertilizers to suppress the pathogen by lowering the pH of the soil to between 6.0 and 6.2. The more acidic soil discourages the activity of O. korrae (9) When reducing pH to these levels, additional manganese applications should be undertaken to compensate for lower pH. As of now, {{there are only two}} resistant cultivars of bluegrass, which are ‘Riviera’, and ‘Patriot’ (9). One component of their resistance could be that they are tolerant to low temperature, because the grass is more susceptible to the pathogen under colder temperatures(8). In addition, reducing watering inputs and growing turf on well drained soils can lessen disease symptoms. Many different fungicides are used to control the pathogen, <b>Fenarimol,</b> Propiconazole, Myclobutanil, and Azoxystrobin (8). Historically, <b>Fenarimol</b> and Myclobutanil were predominantly used (14). In a study where diluted pesticides were sprayed throughout infested test plots, <b>Fenarimol</b> was found to be the most effective with a 94.6% reduction of the disease. Myclobutanil also decreased the amount of disease, but only by 37.7% (8). Myclobutanil is generally recognized as a very weakly acting demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and <b>fenarimol</b> is no longer registered for turf so a number of other DMI fungicides have been employed successfully, including Propiconazole, Tebuconazole, Metconazole and others. Pyraclostrobin and Fluoxastrobin have also been used to control the pathogen.|$|E

Important alterations (viz. delayed maturation in females, indications of arrested spermatogenesis in males) were detected in carps from Flix, a heavily industrialized area. Low ovarian P- 450 aromatase and reduced glucuronidation of testosterone and estradiol in males were observed in Zaragoza and Canal Imperial de Aragón—an agricultural area—which suggest decreased estrogen synthesis, and possibly, reduced sex hormone excretion in those organisms.

40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{identification and}} mechanistic analysis of reproductive toxicants constitutes {{one of the}} major hurdles in the toxicological assessment of chemicals originating from the large number of chemicals to be tested and the difficulty in examining germ cells at various stages of their development. We previously described the development of an assay in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the detection of chemicals bearing aneugenic activity and {{that could be used for}} the detection of germline toxicity. We present here new evidence for the reproductive toxicity of three pesticides identified in our germline toxicity assay: Maneb, Diazinon and <b>Fenarimol.</b> We show that all three pesticides cause an acute germline nuclear loss in exposed nematodes in a dose-dependent fashion. The loss of germline nuclei coincides with the meiotic stage of pachytene during Prophase I and is dependent on the germline apoptotic machinery suggesting activation of a meiotic checkpoint. Further investigation revealed a profound dysregulation of the meiotic program revealed by (1) an alteration of the kinetics of double strand repair, (2) the disruption of the process of chromosome morphogenesis at the end of Prophase I and (3) the reorganization of the meiotic differentiation gradient inherent to the C. elegans germline following exposure to Maneb and Diazinon.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of lipid disruptive effects in invertebrates {{is limited by}} our poor knowledge of the lipid metabolic pathways. A recent study showed that tributyltin activated the ecdysteroid, juvenile hormone and retinoic X receptor signaling pathways, and disrupted the dynamics of neutral lipids in the crustacean Daphnia magna impairing the transfer of triacylglycerols to eggs and hence promoting their accumulation in post-spawning females. Tributyltin disruptive effects correlated with lower fitness for offspring and adults. The present study aims to addresses effects of existing compounds on storage lipids in post-spawning females and their health effects. D. magna individuals were exposed 12 chemicals that included vertebrate obesogens (tributyltin, triphenyltin, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate), other contaminants known to affect arthropods (pyriproxyfen, <b>fenarimol,</b> methoprene, emamectin benzoate and fluoxetine), {{as well as the}} natural hormones methyl farnesoate and 20 -hydroxyecdysone. Reproductive effects were also assessed. Quantitative changes in storage lipids accumulated in lipid droplets were studied using Nile red staining, which showed a close relationship with whole organism levels of triacylglycerols. Ten compounds altered storage lipids in a concentration related manner enhancing (tributyltin, bisphenol A, methyl farnesoate, pyriproxyfen and 20 -hydroxyecdysone) or decreasing (nonylphenol, <b>fenarimol,</b> emamectin benzoate, methoprene and fluoxetine) their levels in post-spawning females.

40|$|Accumulation {{of storage}} lipids in the {{crustacean}} Daphnia magna {{can be altered}} {{by a number of}} exogenous and endogenous compounds, like 20 -hydroxyecdysone (natural ligand of the ecdysone receptor, EcR), methyl farnesoate, pyrirproxyfen (agonists of the methyl farnesoate receptor, MfR), and tributyltin (agonist of the retinoid X acid receptor, RXR). This effect, analogous to the obesogenic disruption in mammals, alters Daphnia’s growth and reproductive investment. Here we propose that storage lipid accumulation in droplets is regulated in Daphnia by the interaction between the nuclear receptor heterodimer EcR:RXR and MfR. The model was tested by determining changes in storage lipid accumulation and on gene transcription in animals exposed to different effectors of RXR, EcR, and MfR signaling pathways, either individually or in combination. RXR, EcR, and MfR agonists increased storage lipid accumulation, whereas <b>fenarimol</b> and testosterone (reported inhibitors of ecdysteroid synthesis and an EcR antagonist, respectively) decreased it. Joint effects of mixtures with <b>fenarimol,</b> testosterone, and ecdysone were antagonistic, mixtures of juvenoids showed additive effects following a concentration addition model, and combinations of tributyltin with juvenoids resulted in greater than additive effects. Co-exposures of ecdysone with juvenoids resulted in deregulation of ecdysone- and farnesoid-regulated genes, accordingly with the observed changes in lipid accumulation These results indicate the requirement of ecdysone binding to the EcR:RXR:MfR complex to regulate lipid storage and that an excess of ecdysone disrupts the whole process, probably by triggering negative feedback mechanisms.

40|$|Fish {{spawning}} {{is often}} used as an integrated measure of reproductive toxicity, and an indicator of aquatic ecosystem health {{in the context of}} forecasting potential population-level effects considered important for ecological risk assessment. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} flexible, widely-applicable, biologically-based models that can predict changes in fecundity in response to chemical exposures, based on readily measured biochemical endpoints, such as plasma vitellogenin (VTG) concentrations, as input parameters. Herein we describe a MATLAB® version of an oocyte growth dynamics model for fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) with a graphical user interface based upon a previously published model developed with MCSim software and evaluated with data from fathead minnows exposed to an androgenic chemical, 17 β-trenbolone. We extended the evaluation of our new model to include six chemicals that inhibit enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis: fadrozole, ketoconazole, propiconazole, prochloraz, <b>fenarimol,</b> and trilostane. In addition, for unexposed fathead minnows from group spawning design studies, and those exposed to the six chemicals, we evaluated whether the model is capable of predicting the average number of eggs per spawn and the average number of spawns per female, which was not evaluated previously. The new model is significantly improved in terms of ease of use, platform independence, and utility for providing output in a format that can be used as input into a population dynamics model. Model-predicted minimum and maximum cumulative fecundity over time encompassed the observed data for fadrozole and most propiconazole, prochloraz, <b>fenarimol</b> and trilostane treatments, but did not consistently replicate results from ketoconazole treatments. For average fecundity (eggs•female(- 1) •day(- 1)), eggs per spawn, and the number of spawns per female, the range of model-predicted values generally encompassed the experimentally observed values. Overall, we found that the model predicts reproduction metrics robustly and its predictions capture the variability in the experimentally observed data...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on {{pesticide}} residues in artichokes treated with Pirimicarb, Chlorpyriphos-methyl, Penconazole and <b>Fenarimol,</b> representing the mostly used pesticides in the protection of this crop. The treatment was performed after covering with plastic films about 50 % globes at different ripening stages. The residues detected 24 hours after treatment were lower than 0. 05 mg/kg for the covered globes, whereas ranged from 0. 32 to 2. 70 mg/kg for the uncovered ones. The residues found in the covered samples were {{probably due to the}} migration of the active ingredients from the leaves to the globes. As far as the uncovered globes are concerned, residues were barely lower than the legal limits {{at the end of the}} pre-harvest interval. Covering of the globes does not compromise the product safety and allows the harvest from the first day after the treatment...|$|E
