40|$|Three {{magnetic}} powder cores and one ferrite core, {{which are}} commonly used in inductor and transformer design for switch mode power supplies, were selected for investigation at cryogenic temperatures. The powder cores are Molypermalloy Core (MPC), High Flux Core (HFC), and Kool Mu Core (KMC). The performance of four inductors utilizing these cores has been evaluated {{as a function of}} temperature from 20 C to - 180 C. All cores were wound with the same wire type and gauge to obtain equal values of inductance at room temperature. Each inductor was evaluated in terms of its inductance, quality (Q) factor, resistance, and dynamic <b>hysteresis</b> characteristics (<b>B-H</b> <b>loop)</b> as a function of temperature and frequency. Both sinusoidal and square wave excitations were used in these investigations. Measured data obtained on the inductance showed that both the MPC and the HFC cores maintain a constant inductance value, whereas with the KMC and ferrite core hold a steady value in inductance with frequency but decrease as temperature is decreased. All cores exhibited dependency, with varying degrees, in their quality factor and resistance on test frequency and temperature. Except for the ferrite, all cores exhibited good stability in the investigated properties with temperature as well as frequency.

40|$|The {{tensile force}} of {{pre-stressed}} concrete (PSC) girders {{is the most}} important factor for managing the stability of PSC bridges. The tensile force is induced using pre-stressing (PS) tendons of a PSC girder. Because the PS tendons are located inside of the PSC girder, the tensile force cannot be measured after construction using conventional NDT (non-destructive testing) methods. To monitor the induced tensile force of a PSC girder, an embedded EM (elasto-magnetic) sensor was proposed in this study. The PS tendons are made of carbon steel, a ferromagnetic material. The magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic specimen are changed according to the induced magnetic field, temperature, and induced stress. Thus, the tensile force of PS tendons can be estimated by measuring their magnetic properties. The EM sensor can measure the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials {{in the form of a}} B (magnetic density) -H (magnetic force) loop. To measure the <b>B-H</b> <b>loop</b> of a PS tendon in a PSC girder, the EM sensor should be embedded into the PSC girder. The proposed embedded EM sensor can be embedded into a PSC girder as a sheath joint by designing screw threads to connect with the sheath. To confirm the proposed embedded EM sensors, the experimental study was performed using a down-scaled PSC girder model. Two specimens were constructed with embedded EM sensors, and three sensors were installed in each specimen. The embedded EM sensor could measure the <b>B-H</b> <b>loop</b> of PS tendons even if it was located inside concrete, and the area of the <b>B-H</b> <b>loop</b> was proportionally decreased according to the increase in tensile force.

40|$|There are {{increasing}} calls to employ conventional magnetic testers, {{such as the}} Epstein frame and single sheet tester, for the accurate measurements of magnetic properties of soft magnetic materials under fully controlled nonsinusoidal flux density waveforms. This paper presents a computerized automated adaptive digital feedback system built for that purpose. We present several examples of {{the ability of the}} system to control an arbitrary shape of the flux density waveforms over the frequency range of the data acquisition system (0. 5 Hz to 2 kHz) and for peak flux density up to 90 % of saturation. The control algorithm is capable of magnetizing magnetic material under controlled sinusoidal, triangular, trapezoidal, and pulsewidth-modulated magnetizing conditions as well as other arbitrary waveforms that do not contain dc components. We provide a full description of the adaptive digital feedback technique together with measurements showing the <b>B-H</b> <b>loops</b> for several magnetic materials under various controlled excitation conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{alternation}} {{of dynamic}} magnetic characteristics with operating temperature and magnetizing frequency in annealed Fe 73. 5 Cu 1 Nb 3 Si 15. 5 B 7 nanocrystalline alloy core was systematically studied by AC <b>B-H</b> <b>loop</b> tracer and complex permeability approach. It is {{found that the}} operating temperature below 160 degrees C has little influence on core loss when the induction (B) is less than 1. 1 T. As B becomes higher, core loss measured at higher temperature becomes larger. The B and remanence (Br) at 80 A/m under power frequency both decline slightly as the temperature goes up. Furthermore, the real part of permeability (mu') increases {{at first and then}} decrease with the rise of temperature. The peaks of the imaginary part of permeability (mu '') shift to higher frequency side with decreasing mu' over operating temperature. In addition, the variations of permeability dispersion with the elevated in the operating temperature of the annealed nanocrystalline core are explained by fitting to Havriliak-Negami (H-N) model, revealing that temperature impact on the magnetic relaxation time.
