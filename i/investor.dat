Foreign <b>investors</b> trade at worse prices than resident <b>investors</b> for large trades, for smaller stocks, and more so for sales than for purchases. Foreign <b>investors</b> sell to domestic <b>investors</b> before a stock has a large positive abnormal return and buy from domestic <b>investors</b> before a stock has a large negative abnormal return. Using intraday data, the large trades of domestic individual <b>investors</b> have more information than the large trades of foreign <b>investors</b> or of domestic institutional <b>investors.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an <b>investor</b> with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an <b>investor</b> holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an <b>investor</b> is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines investorsâ€™ {{performance and}} trading {{behavior on the}} Norwegian stock market, using a unique and extensive data set of monthly holdings of all the <b>investors.</b> The first paper studies how Norwegian individual <b>investors,</b> financial institutional <b>investors</b> and foreign <b>investors</b> affect stock return volatility and finds surprising and interesting results: domestic individual <b>investors</b> and financial institutional <b>investors</b> dampen stock return volatility, and foreign <b>investors</b> exacerbate stock return volatility. While the result that individual <b>investors</b> reduce stock return volatility {{is similar to the}} implication of the findings in Sias (1996) and Malkiel and Xu (2003), it is inconsistent with the traditional assumption that individual <b>investors</b> are noise traders who make stocks more volatile. It is also striking that domestic financial institutional <b>investors</b> and foreign <b>investors</b> have opposite impact on stock return volatility, although we usually assume that institutional <b>investors,</b> regardless of geographical locations, have similar impact on the stock market. The explanations are that foreign <b>investors</b> are momentum traders, trade the most and have the shortest investment horizon; individual <b>investors</b> are contrarian traders, trade the least and have the longest investment horizon; and financial <b>investors</b> fall somewhere in-between. The second paper examines whether some individual <b>investors</b> can successfully time the stock market, {{in the sense that they}} invest more in the stock market conditional on the forecast that the stock market will perform well in the subsequent period and reduce their equity portfolio holding when the stock market underperforms the bond market. The results show that some individual <b>investors</b> can successfully time the market at 1 to 6 month horizons with the strongest results at the quarterly horizon. We show that individual <b>investors</b> with positive and significant timing ability have higher performance than that of <b>investors</b> with no or negative timing ability, which indicates that our results that some individual <b>investors</b> can time the stock market are not spurious. The third paper examines whether some individual <b>investors</b> can outperform the market and can do so persistently, using unique data on month-end stock market portfolios of all individual <b>investors</b> over an eleven-year period. By using different measures of portfolio performance and various analysis methodologies, this paper finds that a sizable of individual <b>investors</b> exhibit economically and statistically significant performance persistence. The performance persistence exists not only for <b>investors</b> with poor prior performance but also for <b>investors</b> with top performance...|$|R
40|$|This current {{experimental}} research {{is done to}} answer whether the male or female <b>investors</b> {{tend to be more}} overconfident in the capital market. There are thirty volunteers participate in this research. According to research design, all participants are classified into two groups based on their score of overconfidence, namely less informed <b>investors,</b> and more informed <b>investors</b> and each group will be analyzed based on the gender perspective. It employs three different types of treatments consisting of the state of no available market information, the guidance of prediction, and the signal of good news. The result demonstrates that male and female <b>investors</b> in the group of less informed <b>investors</b> perform the same level of overconfidence when there is no available market information. Meanwhile, in the group of more informed <b>investors,</b> male <b>investors</b> tend to be more overconfident than do female ones.
