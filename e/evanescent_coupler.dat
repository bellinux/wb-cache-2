40|$|Micro-ring {{resonators}} in silicon photonic circuits {{have been}} widely studied and implemented in systems for biosensing [1], telecommunications [2] and generation of photon pairs for quantum optics experiments [3]. The resonator Q-factor, defined by the roundtrip loss and coupling coefficient, is typically a static property of the device realised in the design stage. In this work a method by which to exert active control over both the resonator Q-factor and resonant wavelengths is presented, allowing modulation of resonance enhanced processes such as Four Wave Mixing (FWM) in devices with much smaller footprint than Mach-Zehnder based designs. Low loss waveguide technology and optimised fabrication processes have allowed resonators with loaded Q-factors in the 105 range with ring diameters {{of only a few}} tens of microns [4, 5]. However, the critical coupling condition in high Q resonators exhibits a high sensitivity to group index, losses and coupling coefficient variations. The tight optical confinement to the silicon waveguide core also leads to a strong dependence of these parameters on the fabricated waveguide geometry. Fabrication variations of only a few percent in waveguide dimensions can detune the resonator from its designed condition. A relatively simple method by which microring resonant wavelengths and Q-factors can be tuned is presented in this work. Two resistive heater elements are applied over the uppercladding of the silicon resonator. One heater is situated colinearly to the ring and can exert control, through the thermo-optic effect, on the optical path length of the resonator and hence its resonant wavelengths. The second heater was designed as an asymmetrically placed strip, co-propagating with the <b>evanescent</b> <b>coupler</b> section. The thermal gradient induced across the two waveguides of the evanescent field coupler produces a detuning of their effective refractive index difference, tuning the power coupled into the ring, and th- refore its Q-factor. An optical micrograph of the device is shown in Fig 1. (a). Using these two controls, resonators were realised that showed tuning of their coupling coefficient between 0. 7 and 0. 1, leading to a Q-factor tuning between 2 x 103 and 2 x 104 as shown in Fig. 1 (b). By tuning an optimised coupled ring to its critical coupling point, a resonant Q-factor of 7. 3 x 104 was achieved. FWM experiments, Fig. 1 (c), were carried out and a conversion efficiency of - 20 dB was measured with an input power on-chip of only 0. 2 mW...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the prospects for}} micron-scale acoustic wave components and circuits on chip in solid planar structures {{that do not require}} suspension. We leverage evanescent guiding of acoustic waves by high slowness contrast materials readily available in silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes. High slowness contrast provides strong confinement of GHz frequency acoustic fields in micron-scale structures. We address the fundamental implications of intrinsic material and radiation losses on operating frequency, bandwidth, device size and as a result practicality of multi-element microphononic circuits based on solid embedded waveguides. We show that a family of acoustic components based on evanescently guided acoustic waves, including waveguide bends, <b>evanescent</b> <b>couplers,</b> Y-splitters, and acoustic-wave microring resonators, can be realized in compact, micron-scale structures, and provide basic scaling and performance arguments for these components based on material properties and simulations. We further find that wave propagation losses are expected to permit high quality factor (Q), narrowband resonators and propagation lengths allowing delay lines and the coupling or cascading of multiple components to form functional circuits, of potential utility in guided acoustic signal processing on chip. We also address and simulate bends and radiation loss, providing insight into routing and resonators.

In this work we present the development of a high precision hybrid optical chip interferometer metrology device. The complete metrology sensor system is structured into two parts; optical chip and optical probe. The hybrid optical chip interferometer is based on a silica-on-silicon etched integrated-optic motherboard containing waveguide structures and <b>evanescent</b> <b>couplers.</b> Upon the motherboard, electro-optic components such as photodiodes and a semiconductor gain block are mounted and bonded to provide the required functionality. The key structure in the device is a tunable laser module based upon an external-cavity diode laser (ECDL). Within the cavity is a multi-layer thin film filter which is rotated to select the longitudinal mode at which the laser operates. An optical probe, which uses a blazed diffracting grating and collimating objective lens, focuses light of different wavelengths laterally over the measurand. Incident laser light is then tuned in wavelength time to effectively sweep an â€˜optical stylusâ€™ over the surface. Wavelength scanning and rapid phase shifting can then retrieve the path length change and thus the surface height. We give an overview of the overall design of the final hybrid photonic chip interferometer, constituent components, device integration and packaging as well as experimental test results from the current version now under evaluation.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 113 - 123. Chalcogenides, {{which are}} glasses consist of S, Se and Te elements, are promising materials for photonics as silicon for modern electronics, {{due to their}} extraordinary material properties such as high nonlinearity and wide mid-IR transparency. However, the biggest barrier before their full extend technological exploitation is the difficulty in utilization of these unique material properties within photonic devices with various forms of desired geometries including nanowires, microspheres, and microdisks as necessitated by unique optical functionalities for specific applications, {{some of which are}} optical microresonators, modulators, and photodetection devices. In this study, the author explore new routes for the fabrication of on-chip photonic elements with chalcogenides and consider a low cost high-yield production method with a compatible and extendable integration phase. The study illustrates production of chalcogenide optical cavities embedded in a polymer fiber, on-chip integration of the cavities having spherical, spheroidal, and ellipsoidal boundaries, and results of their optical characterizations. Besides the fabrication of active photonic devices with electro-optical capabilities, tapered chalcogenide fibers are also considered as <b>evanescent</b> <b>couplers</b> for the resonators of high index materials.

40|$|Advances in {{manufacturing}} {{and with the}} demand of achieving faster throughput {{at a lower cost}} in any industrial setting have put forward the need for embedded metrology. Embedded metrology is the provision of metrology on the manufacturing platform, enabling measurement without the removal of the workpiece. Providing closer integration of metrology upon the manufacturing platform will improve material processing and reliability of manufacture for high added value products in ultra-high-precision engineering. Currently, almost all available metrology instrumentation is either too bulky, slow, destructive in terms of damaging the surfaces with a contacting stylus or is carried out off-line. One technology that holds promise for improving the current state-of-the-art in the online measurement of surfaces is hybrid photonic integration. This technique provides for the integration of individual optoelectronic components onto silicon daughter boards which are then incorporated on a silica motherboard containing waveguides to produce a complete photonic circuit. This thesis presents first of its kind a novel chip interferometer sensor based on hybrid integration technology for online surface and dimensional metrology applications. The complete metrology sensor system is structured into two parts; hybrid photonic chip and optical probe. The hybrid photonic chip interferometer is based on a silica-on-silicon etched integrated-optic motherboard containing waveguide structures and <b>evanescent</b> <b>couplers.</b> Upon the motherboard, electro-optic components such as photodiodes and a semiconductor gain block are mounted and bonded to provide the required functionality. Optical probe is a separate entity attached to the integrated optic module which serves as optical stylus for surface scanning in two measurement modes a) A single-point for measuring distance and thus form/surface topography through movement of the device or workpiece, b) Profiling (lateral scanning where assessment of 2 D surface parameters may be determined in a single shot.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} novel resonant propulsion of dielectric microspheres is {{studied with}} the goal of sorting spheres with identical resonances, which are critical for developing microspherical photonics. First, <b>evanescent</b> field <b>couplers</b> were developed by fixing tapered microfibers in mechanically robust platforms. The tapers were obtained by chemical etching techniques. Using these platforms, WGMs modal numbers, coupling regimes and quality factors were determined for various spheres and compared with theory. Second, the spectroscopic properties of photonic molecules formed by spheres with better than 0. 05 % uniformity of WGM resonances were studied. It was shown that various spatial configurations of coupled-cavities present relatively stable mode splitting patterns in the fiber transmission spectra which can be used as spectral signatures to distinguish such photonic molecules. The third part is the study of giant resonant propulsion forces exerted on microspheres. This effect was observed in suspensions of polystyrene spheres with sufficiently large diameters. By integrating optical tweezers for individual sphere manipulation, the wavelength detuning between a tunable laser and WGMs in each of the spheres was precisely controlled. Resonant enhancement of optical forces was directly demonstrated in experiments. The spectral shape, position and magnitude of the observed propulsion force peaks were explained by efficient transfer of light momentum to microspheres under resonant conditions. The peak magnitude of the resonant force is shown to approach total absorption limit imposed by the conservation of momentum. The transverse movement of the spheres during the propulsion process was studied and the existence of a stable radial trap was demonstrated. Giant resonant propulsion forces can be used for large-scale sorting of microspheres with ultrahigh uniform resonant properties.

40|$|The use {{of optical}} {{interconnects}} is a promising {{solution to the}} increasing demand for high speed mass data transmission used in integrated circuits as well as device to device data transfer applications. For the purpose, low cost polymer waveguides are a popular choice for routing signal between devices due to their compatibility with printed circuit boards. In optical interconnect, coupling from an external light source to such waveguides is a critical step, thus a variety of couplers have been investigated such as grating based <b>couplers</b> [1, 2], <b>evanescent</b> <b>couplers</b> [3], and embedded mirrors [4 â€“ 6]. These couplers are inherently micro-optical components which require fast and scalable fabrication for mass production with optical quality surfaces/structures. Low NA laser direct writing {{has been used for}} fast fabrication of structures such as gratings and Fresnel lenses using a linear laser direct writing scheme, though the length scale of such structures are an order of magnitude larger than the spot size of the focused laser of the tool. Nonlinear writing techniques such as with 2 -photon absorption offer increased write resolution which makes it possible to fabricate sub-wavelength structures as well as having a flexibility in feature shape. However it does not allow a high speed fabrication and in general are not scalable due to limitations of speed and area induced by the toolâ€™s high NA optics. To overcome such limitations primarily imposed by NA, we propose a new micro-optic fabrication process which extends the capabilities of 1 D, low NA, and thus fast and scalable, laser direct writing to fabricate a structure having a length scale close to the tool's spot size, for example, a mirror based and 45 degree optical coupler with optical surface quality. The newly developed process allows a high speed fabrication with a write speed of 2600 mmÂ²/min by incorporating a mask based lithography method providing a blank structure which is critical to creating a 45 degree slope to form the coupler surface. In this method, instead of using an entire exposure in a pixelated manner, only a portion of the Gaussian profile is used, allowing a reduced surface roughness and better control of the surface shape than previously possible with this low NA beam. The surface figure of the mirror is well controlled below 0. 04 waves in root-mean-square (RMS) at 1. 55 Î¼m wavelength, with mirror angle of 45 Â± 1 degrees. The coupling efficiency is evaluated using a set of polymer waveguides fabricated on the same substrate as the complete proof of concept device. Device insertion loss was measured using a custom built optical test station and a detailed loss analysis was completed to characterize the optical coupling efficiency of the mirror. Surface roughness and angle were also experimentally confirmed. This process opens up a pathway towards large volume fabrication of free-form and high aspect ratio optical components which have not yet pursued, along with well-defined optical structures on a single substrate. In this dissertation, in Chapter 1, we provide an overview of optical surface fabrication in conjunction with current state of the art on fabrication of free form surfaces in macro and microscopic length scale. The need for optical interconnects is introduced and fabrication methods of micro-optical couplers are reviewed in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, the complete fabrication process of a mirror based coupler is presented including a custom alignment procedure. In Chapter 4, we provide the integration procedure of the optical couplers with waveguides. In Chapter 5, the alignment of two-lithographic methods is discussed. In Chapter 6, we provide the fabrication procedure used for the waveguides. In Chapter 7, the experimental evaluation and testing of the optical coupler is described. We present a custom test station used for angle verification and optical coupler efficiency measurement. In Chapter 8, a detailed loss analysis of the device is presented including suggestions for future reductions in loss. Conclusions and future work considerations are addressed in Chapter 9...|$|R

SWG operates as an artificial metamaterial with an equivalent refractive index which depends on the geometry of the structure and the polarization of the propagating wave. SWG waveguides have been advantageously used in silicon photonics, resulting in significant performance improvements for many practical devices, including highly efficient fiber-chip couplers, waveguide crossings, broadband multimode interference (MMI) <b>couplers,</b> <b>evanescent</b> field sensors and polarization beam splitters, to name a few. Here we present a theoretical and experimental study of the influence of disorder effects in SWG waveguides. We demonstrate via electromagnetic simulations and experimental measurements that even a comparatively small jitter (~ 5 nm) in the position and size of the SWG segments may cause a dramatic reduction in the transmittance for wide (multimode) SWG waveguides, while for narrow (single mode) waveguides this effect is negligible. Our study shows that the impact of the jitter on SWG waveguide performance {{is directly related to the}} modal confinement. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
