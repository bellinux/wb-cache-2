5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

According to Bakshi, it took quite a long time to assemble the right staff. Those who entered with a smirk, [...] "wanting to be very dirty and draw filthy pictures", did not stay very long, and neither did those with a low tolerance for vulgarity. One cartoonist refused to draw a black crow shooting a pig policeman. Two female animators quit; one because she could not bring herself to tell her children what she <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> the other because she refused to draw exposed breasts.|$|E

About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that I {{ever thought about}} my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man.

He hired cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo, among key personnel.

Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of 8½, Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he [...] "felt overwhelmed by shame… I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. And lo and behold, at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight {{to the heart of the}} film. I would narrate everything that had been happening to me. I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make".|$|E
