25|$|This meeting also {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} a world tournament to be played every <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> <b>now</b> called the World Netball Championships. The inaugural tournament was played in Eastbourne, England in 1963, and tournaments have since been played quadrennially. Since their inception, Australia has dominated the World Championships, winning 10 of the 13 tournaments played. The most recent tournament was the newly renamed Netball World Cup in August, 2015 played in Sydney, with Australia emerging as winners. The next tournament is scheduled for 2019 in Liverpool.|$|E
500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>now.</b> We were talking about {{actually}} picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody's so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody's up for it." [...] On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden, ending the possibility of a reunion.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "True Love Waits" [...] for their third album, OK Computer (1997), but discarded it. They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E

2500|$|... "For Conan Doyle, who {{had spent}} his {{childhood}} bouncing from one flat to another in Edinburgh, Undershaw brought a welcome stability. His own children, after the upheavals of the previous <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> <b>now</b> had a beautiful home and four acres of wooded land to explore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Konishiki {{retained}} his ōzeki ranking for 39 tournaments {{over more}} than six years, but he eventually lost it in November 1993 after two consecutive losing records. However, he continued {{to compete in the}} top division as a maegashira [...] for another <b>four</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Now</b> weighing over , he was very susceptible to belt throws and slap downs by lighter and more agile opponents. Ironically, even though he enjoyed less success, he became progressively more popular with Japanese fans due to his continuous fighting spirit, distinctive bulk and amiable personality. In November 1997, he faced demotion to the second jūryō division and announced his retirement after 15 years in sumo. He had spent 81 consecutive tournaments in the top division and won 649 bouts there.|$|E

6000|$|Heyst saw the girl's eyes turn towards Mr. Jones's {{secretary}} and rest blankly on his face. Ricardo, however, looked vaguely into space, and, with faint flickers {{of a smile}} about his lips, made conversation indefatigably against the silence of his entertainers. He boasted largely of his long association with Mr. Jones--over <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>now,</b> he said. Then, glancing rapidly at Heyst: ...|$|E

"You're {{supposed}} to have come courting my daughter, Mr. Somebody Else," [...] said the other, re-leasing himself and thrusting his face into Mr. Carter's, [...] "and, after getting her promise to marry you, nipping off to London to arrange for the wedding.

6000|$|... "It is true. They can {{scarcely}} tolerate you. They {{do not show}} it to you, but they almost hate you. It is I who have had to bear all this. It was not always so, though. They liked you at first as... as I liked you. But that was four years ago. The time passed by--a year, two years; and then they began to turn against you. They {{are not to be}} blamed. You spoke no word. They felt that you were destroying my life. It is <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> <b>now,</b> and you have never once mentioned marriage to them. What were they to think? What they have thought, that you were destroying my life." ...|$|E

[...] "At the present moment, even, I {{do not see}} {{that it will be}} of much advantage to me; but it may be that some day I shall see it in a different light. It has come upon me almost as suddenly as it has upon you. I thought that after I had finished with the Bastow affair I should set to work to find out this treasure, and that it would probably take me out to India, occupy me there for some time, and that afterwards I might travel through other places, and be away from England three or <b>four</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Now</b> the matter is altogether altered, and I shall be some time before I form any fresh plans. In fact, these must depend upon circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|He sat at {{his desk}} dejectedly. Outside the Gothic windows the earth was warm and marvellously calm. Everything was as it had always been. And yet, and yet...It was nearly <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> since he had preached that sermon on Matthew xxiv. 7: [...] "For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places." [...] It was nearly four years. He had had the sermon printed; it was so terribly, so vitally {{important}} that all the world should know {{what he had to}} say. A copy of the little pamphlet lay on his desk--eight small grey pages, printed by a fount of type that had grown blunt, like an old dog's teeth, by the endless champing and champing of the press. He opened it and began to read it yet once again.|$|E
6000|$|... "It may {{not seem}} so to you, count," [...] Fergus said quietly; [...] "but it has seemed so to me. I {{understand}} what you are so generously saying but, even with such encouragement, I can scarce dare to ask what seems to me so presumptuous a question. For <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> <b>now,</b> this house has been as a home to me; and it was but natural that, as your daughter grew up, I should have grown to love her. I have told myself, hundreds of times, that it would be, indeed, a base return for your kindness, were I to try to steal her heart; and never have I said a single word to her that I would not have said, aloud, had you and her mother been present. During the month that I have been here, now, I have struggled hard with myself; thrown with her, as I have been, for hours every day. But I have {{made up my mind}} that no word should ever pass my lips; and if it has done so, now, it is because you have drawn it from me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speech by the IOC President Lord Killanin, in English.

6000|$|Friedrich, say all {{judges of}} soldiership and human {{character}} {{who have studied}} Friedrich sufficiently, [...] "is greater than ever," [...] in these <b>four</b> <b>Years</b> <b>now</b> coming. [Berenhorst, in Kriegskunst; Retzow; &c.] And this, I have found {{more and more to}} be a true thing; verifiable and demonstrable in time and place,--though, unluckily for us, hardly in this time or this place at all! A thing which cannot, by any method, be made manifest to the general reader; who delights in shining summary feats, and is impatient of tedious preliminaries and investigations,--especially of MAPS, which are the indispensablest requisite of all. A thing, in short, that belongs peculiarly to soldier-students; who can undergo the dull preliminaries, most dull but most inexorably needed; and can follow out, with watchful intelligence, and with a patience not to be wearied, the multifarious topographies, details of movements and manoeuvrings, year after year, on such a Theatre of War. What is to be done with it here! If we could, by significant strokes, indicate, under features true so far as they went, the great wide fire-flood that was raging round the world; if we could, carefully omitting very many things, omit of the things intelligible and decipherable that concern Friedrich himself, nothing that had meaning: IF indeed--! But it is idle preluding. Forward again, brave reader, under such conditions as there are! ...|$|E
