40|$|In a {{parallel}} double-blind trial with fifty paediatric patients, the anti-inflammatory, anti-exudative and antipyretic effects ofFentiazac suspension {{were compared with}} Benzidamine drops {{in the treatment of}} painful inflammatory conditions. Both drugs proved to be effective in relieving the signs and symptoms considered, though <b>Fentiazac</b> was shown to be more rapid and active. Body temperature was lowered by both drugs. Patients treated with <b>Fentiazac</b> suspension had a normal temperature after 3 days of treatment whereas in the Benzidamine-treated group the same result was reached only after 4 days (p < 0 Â· 01). There was no subjective or objective evidenceoflocal and/or systemic intolerance to either test drug...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandins of the E type {{specifically}} inhibited {{the production}} of interleukin 2 (IL- 2) by normal human lymphocytes, whereas PG synthetase inhibitors such as indomethacin and <b>fentiazac</b> raised IL- 2 production above normal levels. Removal of adherent cells from mononuclear cell populations also resulted in enhanced IL- 2 production. The resultant nonadherent cell population lost sensitivity to the enhancement effect of PG synthetase inhibitors, suggesting that a PGE-producing adherent cell {{plays a major role}} in the regulation of IL- 2...|$|E
