500|$|In {{a series}} of couplets, Goldfrapp sings [...] "I {{borrowed}} bones, I borrowed skin / To save me from the hell I'm in / Your fantasy / And <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of you / I see the dark, I hear their hooves", which registers a theme of transformation, according to Chris White from musicOMH. Towards the song's end, she repeats [...] "they're coming for you" [...] in a [...] "reedy and distorted" [...] voice. The track's sound was compared to the works of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails by David Chiu of Consequence of Sound. Furthermore, Chris Gerard, a writer for PopMatters, compared the production's sound to being intoxicated.|$|E

Mostly, each cult consists of one person, but sometimes there's two--a talker and an audience--or even three. For instance, {{you may be}} a militant and a vegetarian, but if some one is a militant and has a good figure, why then--oof!... That's what I mean by `Interesting People.' I loathe them! So, of course, being one of them, I go from one bunch to another, and, upon my honor, <b>every</b> single <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that the new bunch is interesting!" ...|$|R

60|$|It was shameful. But {{there was}} no help for it. The {{skinning}} was begun {{and had to be}} finished. The tears flowed with every rake, and so did the fervent execrations.

50|$|I {{have been}} {{thinking}} about Blaze off and on for a while and <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> would <b>think</b> about it... you know I did the early books as Richard Bachman books {{and this is going to}} be a Bachman because it came from the same time. It was written right before Carrie and finally I thought to myself... the reason I’ve never done it was because, in my memory at least, it was a tearjerker of a book, you know it was kind of sentimental and just kind of... every now and then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of what Oscar Wilde said about The Little Match Girl. He said that it’s impossible to read about the little match girl without weeping tears of laughter and... you know something that is so sad it’s actually funny.|$|R
5000|$|... "We usually {{try to do}} {{something}} fresh <b>every</b> <b>time.</b> This one, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is deliberately a little more raw and more aggressive than Sacrament was. Sacrament was a really, really dynamic record on every level, and the songs were all over the place - it was also heavily produced. This one's really raw and real-sounding, from every angle, and we're celebrating imperfections on this record. We're choosing what takes stay on the record based more on their character and personality than how completely mechanically precise they are. It's more about vibe and attitude in the takes than it is about, 'Wow, that was perfect.' It's the perfect ones that get thrown away, because they're just too sterile." ...|$|R

60|$|Now, then, at this point, {{something}} occurred which convinces me, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it--and {{it struck}} me so at the time--that for a moment, at least, her hopes wandered to the King, and put into her mind the same notion about her deliverance which Noel and I had settled upon--a rescue by her old soldiers.

5000|$|A confrère {{who was a}} {{great friend}} of Nicola wrote during the days {{immediately}} after his death: [...] "Now down here with us remains only a cut stem, his stem. The flower is up there, engrossed in the Heart of God. For this reason <b>every</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> or speak of beloved Nicola I feel I have to look up there as in a dream, bowing. My Hero! I had seen vaguely, I had only dreamed the ideal of holiness, without reaching it, because to touch something you've got {{to be close to}} it, and to have an admiration with no obscurity, you've got to be similar to the hero who inspires it. I've touched my hero and then...he seems to vanish. But, like the little Theresa with Celina, I believe that he will always walk at the side of every person who is able to discover him. I loved him, he died in my arms, {{and he looked at me}} with his last gaze, waving his hand to me to say [...] "goodbye." [...] I love him, by now he's my great, little Saint together with his, and my little Theresa." [...] (13) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{was on a}} {{military}} basis, but, so far as I could see, the [...] one and only reason for it all was rubber. It was the theme of every [...] conversation, and {{it was evident that}} the only way to please one's [...] superiors was to increase the output somehow. I saw a few men come in, [...] and the frightened look even now on their faces tells only too [...] eloquently of the awful time they have passed through. As I saw it [...] brought in, each man had a little basket, containing, say, four or [...] five pounds of rubber. This was emptied into a larger basket and [...] weighed, and being found sufficient, each man was given a cupful of [...] coarse salt, and to some of the head-men a fathom of calico.... I [...] heard from the white men and some of the soldiers some most gruesome [...] stories. The former white man (I feel ashamed of my colour <b>every</b> <b>time</b> [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of him) would stand at the door of the store to receive the [...] rubber from the poor trembling wretches, who after, in some cases, [...] weeks of privation in the forest, had ventured in with what they had [...] been able to collect. A man bringing rather under the proper amount, [...] the white man flies into a rage, and seizing a rifle from one of the [...] guards, shoots him dead on the spot. Very rarely did rubber come in [...] but one or more were shot in that way at the door of the store--'to [...] make the survivors bring more next time.' Men who had tried to run [...] from the country and had been caught, were brought to the station and [...] made to stand one behind the other, and an Albini bullet sent through [...] them. 'A pity to waste cartridges on such wretches.' Only the roads to [...] and fro from the various posts are kept open, and large tracts of [...] country are abandoned to the wild beasts. The white man himself told [...] me that you could walk on for five days in one direction, and not see [...] a single village or a single human being. And this where formerly [...] there was a big tribe!...|$|R
40|$|The {{morning of}} my graduation, my two-year old {{daughter}} asked me, “You graduate {{to become a}} doctor? ” “Yep, ” I replied. She paused to think. Then she said, “I become a doctor, too, someday. ” I {{have no doubt that}} she will. And she’ll probably do it in half the time it took me. If she does decide to get her Ph. D., I hope that she has the same circle of support I had to help her reach her goal. I want to acknowledge and thank those who inspired, supported, and nourished me along the way so that I could reach this pivotal milestone. First, I want to thank the members of my two dissertation writing groups: Harrod Suarez and Sonjia Hyon, who dedicated their time and energy to make our writing group productive and active despite our long distance from each other; and Alex Mendoza and Kandace Creel Falcon from the Kitchen Table Collective, a writing group for women of color. They read draft after draft of my chapters and were there <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> needed to <b>think</b> through an idea or test out an argument. The extremely insightful and critical feedback I received from these four colleagues undoubtedly made my dissertation stronger. During my tenure at the University of Minnesota, I couldn’t have asked for more dedicated and nurturing faculty members. I especially want to thank Jigna Desai, Erika Lee, and Josephine Lee for being excellent role models in showing me how to negotiate the demands of family life with the rigors of academic pursuit. These three scholar/teacher/mothers have demonstrated to me that motherhood can actually make one a better teacher and scholar. I am so grateful to have had such wonderful examples in my i...|$|R
