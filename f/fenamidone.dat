50|$|An {{array of}} studies have tested the {{curative}} and protective effects of various chemical compounds against P. ramorum in plants valued as ornamentals or Christmas trees. Many {{studies have focused on}} the four main ornamental hosts of P. ramorum (Rhododendron, Camellia, Viburnum, and Pieris). Several effective compounds have been found; some of the most effective include mefenoxam, metalaxyl, dimethomorph, and <b>fenamidone.</b> Many of these studies have converged upon the following conclusions: chemical compounds are, in general, more effective as preventives than in curatives; when used preventively, chemical compounds must be reapplied at various intervals; and chemical compounds can mask the symptoms of P. ramorum infection in the host plant, potentially interfering with inspections for quarantine efforts. In general, these compounds suppress but do not eradicate the pathogen, and some researchers are concerned that with repeated use the pathogen may become resistant to them. These studies and conclusions are summarized by Kliejunas.|$|E

Aliquots of pesticide standard solutions {{were added to the}} grapes before crushing, to reach a concentration equal or half the maximum residue limit (MRL). Vinifications were performed, with maceration (R), or without maceration (W). During the wine-making process, samples were taken at the beginning (one hour after grapes crushing), at the middle {{and at the end of}} the spontaneous fermentation process. At half the MRL concentration, deltamethrin affected Pichia sp. population with a decrease of almost 50 %, while <b>fenamidone</b> decreased Candida sp., Candida stellata at 83, and 36 %, respectively. Metschnikowia pulcherrima population decreased in all samples when compared to the control. Experiments at MRL levels showed a strong reduction for all non-Saccharomyces yeast species, when grapes had been treated with pyraclostrobin, <b>fenamidone,</b> and deltamethrine, except for Candida sp. which was found to have been affected only by <b>fenamidone</b> residues. Growth zone inhibition test showed only an in vitro activity of pyraclostrobin over Kloeckera spp., C. stellata, and M. pulcherrima. Microvinification experiments produced wines with no differences concerning S. cerevisiae population as well as production of ethanol and residual sugars. Experiments showed that at the end of the fermentation process pesticides were adsorbed by the lees and grape skins, and no pesticides residue was detectable in wine...|$|E

40|$|The fate {{of three}} {{fungicide}} residues (<b>fenamidone,</b> pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin) from vine to wine was studied {{to evaluate the}} decay ratio {{and the influence of}} the technological process. The aim of this work was to identify pesticides that can degrade rapidly or be eliminated together with byproduct (lees and cake) of the winemaking process to obtain wine free of residues. The disappearance rate on grapes was calculated as pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the half-life (t 1 / 2) was in the range from 5. 4 (1. 9 to 12. 2 (1. 2 days. The mechanism of dissipation of the three quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides was studied using different model systems. It was observed that the main mechanism responsible for disappearance was photodegradation. For active ingredients (ai) the half-lives of <b>fenamidone,</b> pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin were 10. 2 (0. 8, 20. 1 (0. 1, and 8. 6 (1. 0 h, respectively, whereas for formulation higher half-lives were observed when epicuticular waxes were present (from 13. 8 (0. 2 to 26. 6 (0. 1 h). After winemaking, <b>fenamidone,</b> pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin residues were not detected in the wine, but they were present in the cake and lees. This was due to the adsorption of pesticide residues to the solid parts, which are always eliminated {{at the end of the}} alcoholic fermentation.

Concentrations of the test chemical were 30 mg/L, 38 mg/L and 50 mg/L under laboratory conditions. We used PAS-reaction for detection of glycogen storage and Sudan III staining for detection of lipid droplets in common carp hepatocytes. Hence, we found that the amount of glycogen and the fat storage in the liver increased proportionally with the increased fungicide concentrations. We also found conglomerates of accumulated glycogen in certain hepatocytes at all used concentrations. Overall, the results demonstrated enhanced glyconeogenesis and fat accumulation in the common carp liver, exposed to the test chemical. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the histological alterations in common carp gills caused by a fosetyl-Al and <b>fenamidone</b> based fungicide tested in laboratory conditions at 30, 38 and 50 mg/L concentration. In general, all the tested concentrations activated compensatory-adaptive mechanisms, which caused pathological changes in the fish gills. Results showed different histological alterations in the gill structure, which included lamellar lifting, edema, proliferation of the glandular cells and epithelium, covering the gill filament, fusion and degenerative alterations. Blood circulatory system showed vasodilatation of the secondary lamellae and aneurysms. Overall, there was enhancement of the gill histological changes, which was dose-dependent, i. e., proportional to the increasing fungicide concentrations. Thus, based on the results, {{it was concluded that}} the histological alterations in common carp gills could be applied as possible biomarkers in risk assessment and monitoring programs for pesticide contamination of aquatic ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Environmental factors, {{including}} pesticides, {{have been}} linked to autism and neurodegeneration risk using retrospective epidemiological studies. Here we sought to prospectively identify chemicals that share transcriptomic signatures with neurological disorders, by exposing mouse cortical neuron-enriched cultures to hundreds of chemicals commonly found in the environment and on food. We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson's disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone and <b>fenamidone,</b> produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease). These chemicals stimulate free radical production and disrupt microtubules in neurons, effects that can be reduced by pretreating with a microtubule stabilizer, an antioxidant, or with sulforaphane.

40|$|Phytophthora blight of peppers (Capsicum annuum) {{is caused}} by the oomycete {{pathogen}} Phytophthora capsici. In Arizona, the root and crown rot phase of the disease initially can appear on plants early in the growing season in areas of the field where soil remains saturated with water after an irrigation or rainfall event. Disease severity can increase dramatically due to summer rains during July and August in the southeastern Arizona production area. Fungicides are an important component of a Phytophthora disease management system, when used in combination with other management practices such as crop rotation, raised beds, and water management. The efficacy of the systemic fungicide mefenoxam (Ridomil Gold) for control of Phytophthora blight on pepper has been documented; however, in many pepper production regions, populations of the pathogen insensitive to this fungicide have developed. Other chemistries, including dimethomorph (Acrobat) as well as some new fungicides in development, have activity on some species of Phytophthora and associated diseases on crops other than pepper. The objective of the following study was to evaluate these additional chemistries for efficacy in suppressing development of root and crown rot on pepper plants grown in soil naturally infested with Phytophthora capsici in a greenhouse environment. The mean duration of survival for Aristotle bell pepper plants in untreated soil infested with P. capsici was 29 days. On the other hand, a significant increase in pepper plant survival was achieved when soil was treated with Reason (<b>fenamidone)</b> + Previcur Flex (propamocarb), SA- 110201, Ranman (cyazofamid), Omega (fluazinam), Ridomil Gold (mefenoxam), V- 10161 (fluopicolide), Forum (dimethomorph), NOA- 446510 (mandipropamid), IR- 6141 (kiralaxyl), and Maestro (captan). The data from this study suggest that several fungicides currently not registered for use on peppers may be effective components of a management program for Phytophthora crown and root rot. The data is promising; however, additional studies in field soil naturally infested with P. capsici are needed to confirm these preliminary findings as well as to determine the optimal application rate and timing for each new chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pesticides {{are used}} to control pests and {{diseases}} in modern agriculture but unfortunately their residues {{can be found on}} agricultural crops, and in the human’s dietary. Although the best way to decrease the risk associated with the presence of pesticides on agro-food is following organic farming techniques, most farmers may not avoid the use of chemicals in pest management strategies. A good approach to the problem should therefore guarantee good agricultural yields and low pesticide residues allowing the use of environmental safety pesticides on crops, so joining consumer’s safeness with farmer’s necessity. Results: The behaviour of various pesticides used in IPM strategies on grapes and tomatoes were studied. All the analytical methods showed good recoveries, and good separation of the molecules. Repeatability and intermediate precision showed good results, and LODs and LOQs were far below the MRLs set by EU for these pesticides in tomatoes and grapes. The analysis of pesticide residues on tomatoes showed that cv. with little berries accounted for higher residue levels than cv. with big berries. They also showed an high persistence of azoxystrobin, cyproconazole, cyprodinil, penconazole, tolclofos-methyl, mepanipyrim, pyrimethanil, famoxadone <b>fenamidone,</b> fenhexamid, iprodione, and a rapid degradation of triadimenol, cymoxanil, iprovalicarb, fenarimol, and fludioxonil. On grapes, the behaviour in field and the transfer to wine during winemaking of iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, was studied. The residue levels found in grapes were far below the MRLs set for grapes in EU, accounting at harvest time 0. 81, 0. 43, and 4. 23 mg/kg for iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, respectively. The residue levels in the samples treated with boscalid may have residual problems (due to an accumulation effect) if repeated field treatments will be performed. Winemaking experiments showed a complete transfer of all pesticide from grapes to the must, while in wine the residues were low or negligible due to the adsorbing effect of lees and pomace. The clarification experiments showed a good removal of pesticide residues from the wine media, for all pesticides. The data obtained in two years survey of pesticide residues on wines following IPM strategies, showed residues less than maximum residue limits (MRLs). The most pesticides present a residue absent, some (benalaxyl, metalaxyl, iprovalicarb, penconazole, cymoxanil and thiophanate-metyl) showed a residual below the minimum limit of detection (LOD). No residues were found above the LOQ (0, 01 mg/kg). Conclusions: The obtained data showed the possibility to get tomatoes and wine at "zero residue" or, at least, with residues below the limit of quantification (LOQ). The data collected on tomato have also shown the difference in initial deposition of pesticide joined {{to the size of the}} berries in order to obtain products with lower pesticide residues, paying more attention to chemical treatments for the defense of cultivars with small berries. ...|$|E
