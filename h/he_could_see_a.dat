25|$|Lawrence {{walked along}} Well Hall Road to the {{junction}} of Dickson Road to see if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> bus coming {{and then went back}} towards the bus stop. Brooks was still on Well Hall Road, part way between Dickson Road and the roundabout with Rochester Way and Westhorne Avenue.|$|E
25|$|At 3.15 p.m. an {{amphibian}} aircraft, piloted by {{a senior}} {{officer of the}} RAAF based on the Rathmines, took off on a reconnaissance flight to seaward. Soon after taking off the pilot saw smoke several miles out to sea he altered course and made for the spot immediately. He found {{a great deal of}} wreckage was floating on the surface with the amphibian sighting the wreck site within ten minutes of the explosion an. The pilot landed the plane but found the water much rougher than he had expected. Because of the seas and the extent of the wreckage, he was unable to taxi close to one large piece of the flotsam, to which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> group of men clinging desperately. He taxied the machine some distance to the lea of a small island, where sheltered water enabled him to take off.|$|E
500|$|Better telescopes {{developed}} {{early in}} the 19th century allowed permanent Martian albedo features to be mapped in detail. The first crude map of Mars was published in 1840, followed by more refined maps from 1877 onward. When astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the spectroscopic signature {{of water in the}} Martian atmosphere, the idea of life on Mars became [...] among the public. Percival Lowell believed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> network of artificial canals on Mars. These linear features later proved to be an optical illusion, and the atmosphere was found to be too thin to support an Earth-like environment.|$|E
50|$|For his UFC debut, Saint Preux faced fellow promotional {{newcomer}} Gian Villante on April 27, 2013, at UFC 159. The fight {{ended in}} unusual fashion as Saint Preux accidentally poked Villante {{in the right}} eye with his thumb and referee Kevin Mulhall immediately called {{an end to the}} fight after asking Villante if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>As</b> a result of the injury, the fight went to the judges' scorecards and Saint Preux won a majority technical decision.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bennett heaved {{himself out}} of the deck-chair. Beyond the French windows <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> indistinct form in a gray suit, and remembered that this was the morning on which Sir Mallaby Marlowe's clerk--who was taking those Schultz and Bowen papers for him to America--had written that he would call. To-day was Friday; no doubt the man was sailing from Southampton to-morrow.|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} {{difficulty}} that Leo breathed, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>see</b> <b>a</b> dozen feet before him.|$|R
500|$|Another early {{point of}} {{contention}} (although not explicitly related {{to the nature of}} the memorial) concerned the possibility of incorporating a [...] "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier" [...] into the memorial—an approach that was championed by the St. Kilda RSL, who revealed plans to bury a soldier from either Gallipoli or France on ANZAC Day, 25 April 1922. This proposal received considerable debate, and was countered by the argument that the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey represented all of the dead of the British Empire. Monash was on the side of those against such a burial, as while <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> place for an Unknown Soldier in a national memorial, he did not feel that it would be suitable at the Victorian Shrine. The Stone of Remembrance was later placed in the position where an Unknown Soldier might have been laid. An Australian Unknown Soldier was eventually interred at the Australian War Memorial by Prime Minister Paul Keating on 11 November 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Bosov {{incorrectly}} {{identified the}} plane as a United States Air Force reconnaissance RC-135. When reporting back to Tsarkov, Bosov said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> maple leaf on the plane's tail, implying that {{it belonged to}} North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). After a few moments, he corrected himself, stating {{that he could see}} Chinese characters and the [...] "maple leaf" [...] was actually a red stork with wings spread.|$|E
2500|$|John Berman for ABC News {{reported}} in 2006 that [...] "Grown Iraqi men get misty-eyed by {{the mere mention}} of his name. 'I love Lionel Richie,' they say. They can sing an entire Lionel Richie song." [...] Berman wrote that Richie said he was told that Iraqi civilians were playing [...] "All Night Long" [...] the night U.S. tanks invaded Baghdad. Richie was against the war, but says <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> day when he would come and perform in Baghdad.|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{his mother}} {{came home from}} a morning visit to Thomasin. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>a</b> disturbance in the lines of her face that something had happened.|$|R
50|$|Khatir {{said the}} killings were not intentional. <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{group of people}} coming towards him in the dark, refusing his orders to stop.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I froze him {{stiff and}} I fogged him blind. And kicked him {{home with his}} road to find By what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>a</b> three-day {{snow-storm}} [...] (All round the Sands!) ...|$|R
2500|$|At 19:02:44, the {{clearance}} delivery officer at Shanwick transmitted its oceanic route clearance. The aircraft did not acknowledge this message. The Clipper Maid of the Seas [...] "squawk" [...] then flickered off. Air Traffic Control {{tried to make}} contact with the flight, with no response. At this time a loud sound was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) at 19:02:50. Five radar echoes fanning out appeared, instead of one. Comparison of the cockpit voice recorder to the radar returns showed that, eight seconds after the explosion, the wreckage had a [...] spread. A British Airways pilot, flying the London–Glasgow shuttle near Carlisle, called Scottish authorities to report that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> huge fire on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Van Gogh {{worked on}} a group of {{paintings}} [...] "The Wheat Field" [...] that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital. [...] From the studio room <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> field of wheat, enclosed by a wall. [...] Beyond that were the mountains from Arles. [...] During his stay at the asylum he made about twelve paintings of the view of the enclosed wheat field and distant mountains. [...] In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, [...] "Through the iron-barred window I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory." [...] The stone wall, like a picture frame, helped to display the changing colors of the wheat field.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money I will pay you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish my picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E
60|$|Still {{there was}} no answer, and now Tom {{did not know what}} to do. Under the trees it was so dark that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>see</b> <b>a</b> yard in front of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] he demanded, in {{a muffled}} tone, for {{inside of the}} bag it was all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to breathe. The {{covering}} was so heavy <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> thing.|$|R
60|$|The snow-covered ice was smooth, but {{the bends}} {{of the river}} {{increased}} the distance wofully; there was a keen wind, and the dark pines stretched on without a break as far as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> entered each fresh loop of the stream he looked eagerly for an opening or sign of life, but there were only rows of ragged spires, cutting sharply against the sky. He felt inexpressibly lonely and badly afraid; the desolation was growing appalling, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not keep on his feet much longer. He had food enough for two scanty meals, and then, if no help came, he must starve.|$|R
60|$|Reaching the headland, Sam gazed around anxiously. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> long {{distance}} {{to the north and}} the west, but not a sail was in sight.|$|E
60|$|And as Ralph {{covered his}} nose and mouth with his handkerchief, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> black vapor, almost like smoke, arising {{from the mouth of}} the well.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin's eyes {{followed}} the man's forefinger. Far away {{across the ocean}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> dim green light almost upon the horizon. It was the German man-of-war.|$|E
60|$|It was not, he said, <b>a</b> bad house. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>a</b> {{good deal}} {{could be made}} of it. The fellow was clever in his way, though what {{it was going to}} cost Soames before it was done with he didn't know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on! I'm in the ma'sh. Lend a {{hand and}} get me out!" [...] bawled Sam, anxiously waiting for his {{deliverer}} to appear, for <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>a</b> hat bobbing along behind the hazel-bushes that fringed the lane.|$|R
60|$|The {{defenders}} {{were all}} lying down, {{each of them}} having chosen <b>a</b> position where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through <b>a</b> crevice between the rocks. Lisle was lying next to the sergeant. Presently the latter gave an exclamation, fired his rifle, and shifted his position behind the rock.|$|R
60|$|It was Shep who {{uttered the}} words. The long spell of {{darkness}} {{had at last}} gone, and looking up overhead <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> bit of sunshine striking {{the edge of the}} hollow.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> man {{brushing}} a shoe, {{and went}} up with [...] "Please, sir--" [...] But he was met by, [...] "Get off you young vagabond, we want none of your sort here." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the rocket}} burst Mr. Hardy had gazed eagerly over the country, and fancied that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> dark mass at a {{distance}} of half a mile. This he guessed to be the Indians' horses.|$|E
60|$|She said no more. Her eyes {{watched him}} {{steadily}} {{for a moment}} and then closed. Venters pulled off his boots and then felt for the little steps in the rock. The shade of the cliff above obscured the point he wanted to gain, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> dimly <b>a</b> few feet before him. What he had attempted with care he now went at with surpassing lightness. Buoyant, rapid, sure, he attained the corner of wall and slipped around it. Here <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> hand before his face, so he groped along, found a little flat space, and there removed the saddle-bags. The lasso he took back with him to the corner and looped the noose over the spur of rock.|$|R
60|$|Stuyvesant looked. All that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> however, was <b>a</b> gaping {{wound in}} Phonny's boot, {{just over the}} ankle, and {{something}} bloody beneath.|$|R
6000|$|From his shadowed corner <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} {{light had}} sprung into Grant's eyes, although his reply {{was in his}} ordinary easy banter. [...] "I shall be only too glad to act as Miss Clementina's vaquero, and lasso her runaways, or keep stragglers in the road." ...|$|R
60|$|As night drew on, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> faint {{light up}} the shore, which told him where the Indian camp lay. All around him was silent and deserted, only the {{occasional}} cry of a bird breaking the stillness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop, O'Riley," [...] cried Fred, [...] "you're too soon, man. I {{have to come}} {{on first}} as an Esquimaux woman, and when Grim says to the woman he wishes <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> bear, then you are to come." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{the hunter}} tied his boat {{to a tree}} and once more climbed out. He climbed up the bank and studied the land. Across a wide meadow <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> brushy old pasture and back of that some thick woods. He grinned.|$|E
60|$|He {{sprang up}} and ran along at his utmost speed on the trampled path, but when he emerged from it <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>a</b> dark party, {{containing}} a horseman or two, so far on {{the way that it}} was hopeless to overtake them.|$|R
60|$|There was no reply, {{but in a}} {{twinkling}} {{his hands}} were caught and bound tightly behind him, and a bag was thrust {{over his head and}} fastened around his throat. The bag was so thick that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> thing before him.|$|R
5000|$|Shree Jankidas Maharaj {{occupied}} the Gadi for 53 {{years and he}} was very practical. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through <b>a</b> man as soon as he came near him.
