5|$|Nauendorf {{continued}} his raids, the soldiers foraged {{for food and}} dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> one another by Königgrätz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, {{she was willing to}} send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, {{despite the fact that she}} disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick to keep an eye on each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.|$|E
25|$|Cao Cao led an army to Tong Pass {{to attack}} Ma Chao and the coalition, {{resulting}} in the Battle of Tong Pass. After both sides clashed in a few engagements, Cao Cao had talks with Ma Chao and Han Sui. Ma Chao thought highly of himself and secretly harboured the intention of dashing forth and capturing Cao Cao when they met. However, he did not dare to make his move when Xu Chu, one of Cao Cao's close aides, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him. Cao Cao later followed Jia Xu's strategy to sow discord between Ma Chao and Han Sui and make them become suspicious of each other. Taking advantage of the hostility between Ma Chao and Han Sui, Cao Cao launched {{an attack on the}} northwestern warlords and defeated them.|$|E
500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E

500|$|The adult defendants, {{facing the}} death penalty, portrayed {{themselves}} at trial as unwilling {{participants in the}} conspiracy. [...] The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilović (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilović stated to the court: [...] "Princip <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> me and very forcefully said 'If you want to know, it is for that reason {{and we are going}} to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'" [...] Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež." [...] Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time. When pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: [...] "I was more afraid of terror than the law." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrett did not {{contribute}} material to the band after A Saucerful of Secrets was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, only one, [...] "Jugband Blues", {{made it to the}} band's second album; one, [...] "Apples and Oranges", became a less-than-successful single; and two others, [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man", were never officially released until 2016 in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set, as they were deemed too dark and unsettling. Feeling guilty for ousting their friend, the members of Pink Floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Rick Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, Wright had the awful job of telling Barrett that he was going out to buy cigarettes while he went off to play a gig. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down between his fingers (an incident later referenced in Pink Floyd's The Wall). Emerging from catatonia and unaware that {{a long period of time}} had elapsed, Barrett would ask, [...] "Have you got the cigarettes?". Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, in the reception area, waiting to be invited in. He also showed up to a few gigs and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Gilmour. Barrett played slide guitar on [...] "Remember a Day" [...] (which had been first attempted during the Piper sessions), and also played on [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". On 6 April 1968, the group officially announced Barrett was no longer a member, the same day the band's contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated as the record label. Considering Barrett to be the musical brains of the band, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett.|$|E

Miller tried to disrupt Bird's concentration when he was shooting free throws late in a game.

2500|$|It was {{reported}} that Coleman was fighting extradition to New Jersey. A warrant was issued by New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, and Manhattan prosecutors decided to drop a 1997 charge against him for allegedly having a small knife. Coleman later appeared in State Superior Court where he had to face Moore's mother and her sister. He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> them as he was led {{out of the courtroom}} in shackles. The Superior Court Judge, Sheila Venable, imposed a $2 million cash bail against him. [...] Coleman was extradited to New Jersey to face trial in October 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The Austrian {{government}} {{feared that}} Piedmont wanted {{to drop out}} of the alliance and even change sides. Therefore, Beaulieu received secret instructions not to fully trust his ally. Consequently, he neglected to fully inform the Sardinians of his plans. Colli deployed his army between Dego and Cuneo, with his main weight to the west guarding the Col de Tende. He posted two battalions at Dego and part of Giovanni Marchese di Provera's Austrian brigade at Millesimo. Meanwhile, François Christophe de Kellermann's French Army of the Alps and the Prince of Corrigan's Sardinian army, each about 20,000 strong, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> each other in the mountains west of Cuneo and Turin.|$|E

When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Campbell {{stepped from}} cover with his pistol drawn, saw Hale {{collapsed}} dead, and yelled to Stoudenmire {{that this was}} not his fight. [...] However, Constable Krempkau, mistakenly believing that Campbell had shot him, then fired his pistol twice at Campbell before losing consciousness from loss of blood. [...] Krempkau's first bullet struck Campbell's gun and broke his right wrist, while the second hit him in the foot. [...] Campbell screamed in pain and scooped up his gun from the ground with his left hand. [...] Stoudenmire whirled from Hale and instantly fired at Campbell who dropped his gun again, grabbed his stomach and collapsed onto the ground. [...] Stoudenmire walked slowly toward Campbell and coldly <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] In agony, Campbell yelled, [...] "You big son of a bitch! You murdered me!" [...] Stoudenmire said nothing. [...] Both Campbell and Krempkau died within minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{dramatic}} and unexpected entrance drew stares from {{the residents of}} the courtroom. Victoria Price, brought out for Bates to identify, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> her. Attorney General Knight warned Price to [...] "keep your temper." [...] Bates proceeded to testify, and explained that no rape had occurred. She said none of the defendants had touched her or even spoken to her. When asked if she had been raped on March 25, 1931, Bates said, [...] "No sir." [...] When asked why she had initially said she had been raped, Bates replied, [...] "I told it just like Victoria did because she said we might have to stay in jail if we did not frame up a story after crossing a state line with men." [...] Bates explained that Price had said [...] "she didn't care if all the Negroes in Alabama were put in jail." [...] This recantation seemed to be a severe blow to the prosecution.|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao later {{agreed to}} meet Ma Chao and Han Sui for talks, and he brought along only Xu Chu. Ma Chao had {{confidence}} in himself and he secretly planned to use the opportunity to charge forward and capture Cao Cao, but he had heard of Xu Chu's might before and he suspected that the man beside Cao Cao was Xu Chu. Ma Chao asked Cao Cao, [...] "Where's your Tiger Marquis?" [...] Cao Cao pointed at Xu Chu, who <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Ma Chao. Ma Chao was afraid and did not dare to make his move. Both sides then returned to their respective camps. Several days later, a battle was fought, and Cao Cao scored a major victory. Xu Chu killed several enemies and was promoted to Military Guard General of the Household (武衞中郎將) for his achievement. This {{was the first time}} the term [...] "Military Guard" [...] (武衞) was used. Cao Cao's soldiers knew that Xu Chu possessed the might of a tiger, but he was also simple minded, so they nicknamed him [...] "Tiger Fool" [...] (虎癡).|$|E

2500|$|In 208, {{following}} Liu Biao's death, Cao Cao {{started a}} campaign aimed at wiping out opposing forces in southern China. When his armies arrived in Jing Province, Liu Biao's younger son and successor, Liu Cong, surrendered to Cao Cao. Liu Bei evacuated Xinye County and headed south with his followers towards Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei), which {{was controlled by}} Liu Biao's elder son, Liu Qi. Cao Cao sent 5,000 riders to pursue Liu Bei, and they {{caught up with him}} at Changban (長阪), Dangyang (當陽). Liu Bei abandoned his family and fled, with only Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and a small number of soldiers accompanying him. Zhang Fei led 20 horsemen to cover Liu Bei's retreat. After having a bridge destroyed, he stood guard at one end (facing the enemy), brandished his spear, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> the enemy, and shouted, [...] "I'm Zhang Yide. You can come forth and fight me to the death!" [...] Cao Cao's soldiers were all afraid and did not dare to approach him. Liu Bei and his followers were hence able to retreat safely.|$|E
2500|$|Apparently, Cao Hong had {{previously}} offended Cao Zhen, another relative of Cao Cao who {{also served as}} a general in Wei. In 224, when Cao Zhen returned from a campaign, Cao Pi ordered Wu Zhi to host a banquet in his residence in Cao Zhen's honour. During the banquet, Wu Zhi instructed actors to put up a skit to make fun of Cao Zhen and Zhu Shuo (朱鑠), who were fat and thin respectively. Cao Zhen was enraged and he shouted at Wu Zhi, [...] "Are you and your men seeking a fight with me and my men?" [...] Cao Hong and Wang Zhong egged Wu Zhi on by saying, [...] "If you want to make the General (Cao Zhen) admit that he is fat, you have to show that you're thin." [...] Cao Zhen drew his sword, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> them and said, [...] "I'll kill whoever dares to mock me." [...] When Cao Hong got into trouble later, Cao Zhen told Cao Pi, [...] "If Cao Hong is to be executed, he'll definitely say something nasty about me." [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "I'll deal with him myself. Why do you need to worry?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the song, Vedder said in {{an online}} chat that it was written {{around the time of}} the Gulf War and added that [...] "it's an anti-patriotic song, actually." [...] On August 7, 2008, at a solo {{performance}} in Newark, New Jersey, at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Vedder took a question from the audience requesting that he explain the meaning of [...] "Yellow Ledbetter". At first, Vedder joked, saying, [...] "Wait...you mean there's lyrics?" [...] He went on to talk about how the song took as its subject a friend of his from Seattle whose brother served in the first Gulf War. His friend received a [...] "yellow letter" [...] in the mail informing him that his brother had died in the war. Vedder and his friend then went for a walk. On this walk, the friend, whom Vedder described as [...] "alternative looking," [...] happened by a house with an American flag flying and people on the porch. He stopped and gestured to the flag, as if to salute it, but the people on the porch <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him disapprovingly due to his appearance.|$|E

2500|$|But {{the ladies}} of Winchester had brought some of this harsh {{treatment}} on themselves. From the very first Union occupation, they had treated Federal soldiers despicably. Going to church one Sunday, one woman accidentally dropped her Bible or prayer brook. A passing soldier immediately {{picked it up and}} offered it to her. She <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him hatefully and refused it. When the Union army was retreating through town during the First Battle of Winchester, the civilians, but most particularly the women, uttered the vilest language, hurling at them anything that came to hand. Then they began shooting from their windows or yards. Any of a number of soldiers were killed by women firing at them. One cavalryman, wounded in the foot, sat on a doorstep. The woman of the house opened the door and asked him if he could walk. [...] "No," [...] he told her. Could she see his pistol she asked. Innocently, he gave it to her. She put it to his head and told him to get off her doorstep. As he tried to limp away, she shot him in the back. That night, several young soldiers took a vow to punish the women of Winchester for murdering their comrades when they returned. This is the context within which Milroy was operating.|$|E
2500|$|It was Hammond's misfortune {{to live in}} {{the same}} age as Don Bradman, the {{greatest}} batsmen of them all. Bradman made 974 runs (139.14) in 1930 and thereafter when Hammond made a century Bradman would make a double century, if Hammond struck 200, Bradman would make 300. When England amassed 903/7 at the Oval in 1938 Hammond waited until he had medical assurance that Bradman was unfit to bat before declaring and England won by an innings and 579 runs. Bradman never forgot this – or Bodyline – and when Hammond arrived to play a sporting tour to re-establish cricket after the war he was angered by the Australian captain's determination to win. In the First Test Bradman was caught by Jack Ikin off Bill Voce when 28, but refused to walk; [...] "Hammond <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Bradman and said tensely, [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series." [...] Bradman went on to make a match-winning 187 and did the same in the Second Test when Ikin caught him off Alec Bedser at 22, Bradman refused to budge and made 234. Hammond thought this was gamesmanship and refused to talk to Bradman {{for the rest of the}} tour except to call the toss. Nevertheless, Hammond refused to be drawn into a public war, he did not make official complaints or even reveal to the press his concerns about umpiries, poor wickets, heavy rollers and aggressive fast bowling. [...] "He displayed tact and diplomacy in the interests of cricket, and wherever they went his colleagues were welcomed and liked." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 224, Cao Pi ordered Wu Zhi to host {{a banquet}} in his {{residence}} to celebrate Cao Zhen's return from a campaign.

During the banquet, Wu Zhi instructed actors {{to put up a}} skit to make fun of Cao Zhen and Zhu Shuo (朱鑠), who were fat and thin respectively. Cao Zhen turned furious and he shouted at Wu Zhi, [...] "Are you and your men seeking a fight with me and my men?" [...] Cao Hong and Wang Zhong egged Wu Zhi on by saying, [...] "If you want to make the General (Cao Zhen) admit that he is fat, you have to show that you're thin." [...] Cao Zhen drew his sword, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> them and said, [...] "I'll kill whoever dares to mock me."

My throat won't tremble when I swallow you and my teeth won't chatter when I chew on you. How dare you behave so rudely!" [...] Zhu Shuo stood up and tried to reduce tensions by telling Wu Zhi, [...] "His Majesty ordered you to host entertainment for everyone. Do you have to do this?" [...] Wu Zhi then shouted at Zhu Shuo, [...] "Zhu Shuo, how dare you leave your seat!" [...] Everyone then returned to their seats. Zhu Shuo felt outraged but did not say anything, and returned to his seat and used his sword to hit the ground.|$|E
