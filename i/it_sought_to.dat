5|$|By 1973, the {{government}} regarded Black Consciousness as a threat. <b>It</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> disrupt Biko's activities, and in March 1973 placed a banning order on him. This {{prevented him from}} leaving the King William's Town magisterial district, prohibited him from speaking either in public or {{to more than one}} person at a time, barred his membership of political organisations, and forbade the media from quoting him. As a result, he returned to Ginsberg, living initially in his mother's house and later in his own residence.|$|E

He {{was a part}} of the 1928 Constitutional Assembly, helping draft a constitution for the Syrian Republic. Al-Atassi appointed him Vice President of the National Bloc in 1930. Al-Bakri successfully ran for parliament as a representative of Damascus on the National Bloc's ticket in 1932, after winning a run-off vote by a large margin.|$|E
5|$|In late 1978, Guccione {{shut down}} the {{unprofitable}} magazine. Wintour decided {{to take some time}} off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer Michel Esteban, for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York. She returned to work in 1980, succeeding Elsa Klensch as fashion editor for a new women's magazine named Savvy. <b>It</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> appeal to career-conscious professional women, who spent their own money, the readers Wintour would later target at Vogue.|$|E

5|$|After the Gadsden Purchase, {{southern}} Arizona's social elite, {{including the}} Estevan Ochoa, Mariano Samaniego, and Leopoldo Carillo families, remained primarily Mexican American until {{the coming of}} the railroad in the 1880s. When the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company opened silver mines in southern Arizona, <b>it</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> employ educated, middle-class Americans who shared a work ethic and leadership abilities to operate the mines. A biographical analysis of some 200 of its employees, classed as capitalists, managers, laborers, and general service personnel, reveals that the resulting work force included Europeans, Americans, Mexicans, and Indians. This mixture failed to stabilize the remote area, which lacked formal social, political, and economic organization in the years from the Gadsden Purchase to the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Hawker Siddeley aggressively marketed the Harrier for export. At {{one point}} the company was holding talks with Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, India and Japan. Of these only India became a customer, {{purchasing}} the Sea Harrier. At one point China {{came very close to}} becoming an operator of the first generation Harrier. Following an overture by the UK in the early 1970s, when relations with the West were warming, China became interested in the aircraft as <b>it</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> modernise its armed forces; British Prime Minister James Callaghan noted significant hostility from the USSR over the sales bid. The deal was later cancelled by the UK as part of a diplomatic backlash after China invaded Vietnam in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} {{important}} issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established {{as part of the}} Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. <b>It</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E

5|$|On October 29, {{responding}} to growing concerns that Enron might have insufficient cash on hand, news spread that Enron was seeking a further $1–2 billion in financing from banks. The next day, as feared, Moody's lowered Enron's credit rating from Baa1 to Baa2, two levels above junk status. Standard & Poor's affirmed Enron's rating of BBB+, {{the equivalent of}} Moody's Baa1. Moody's also warned that it would downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, the consequence of which would likely prevent the company from finding the further financing <b>it</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> keep solvent.|$|E
5|$|The Wallachian Revolution of 1848 was a Romanian {{liberal and}} {{nationalist}} uprising in the Principality of Wallachia. Part of the Revolutions of 1848, and closely {{connected with the}} unsuccessful revolt in the Principality of Moldavia, <b>it</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> overturn the administration imposed by Imperial Russian authorities under the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, through many of its leaders, demanded the abolition of boyar privilege. Led {{by a group of}} young intellectuals and officers in the Wallachian Militia, the movement succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government and a Regency, and in passing a series of major progressive reforms, first announced in the Proclamation of Islaz.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the campaign was {{the defeat of the}} approximately 40,000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as Viet Cong) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where Vietnamese communist forces could establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, <b>it</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after <b>it</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Provisional Government {{had planned}} for a Constituent Assembly {{to be elected}} in November 1917; against Lenin's objections, Sovnarkom agreed for the vote to take place as scheduled. In the {{constitutional}} election, the Bolsheviks gained approximately {{a quarter of the}} vote, being defeated by the agrarian-focused Socialist Revolutionary Party. Lenin argued that the election was not a fair reflection of the people's will, that the electorate had not had time to learn the Bolsheviks' political programme, and that the candidacy lists had been drawn up before the Left Socialist Revolutionaries split from the Socialist Revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the newly elected Russian Constituent Assembly convened in Petrograd in January 1918. Sovnarkom argued that it was counter-revolutionary because <b>it</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> remove power from the soviets, but the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks denied this. The Bolsheviks presented the Assembly with a motion that would strip it of most of its legal powers; when the Assembly rejected the motion, Sovnarkom declared this as evidence of its counter-revolutionary nature and forcibly disbanded it.|$|E
