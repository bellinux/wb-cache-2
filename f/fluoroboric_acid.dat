30|$|The {{research}} group in recent years led by Shafiq et al. presented multiple experimentations using various acid combinations (Shafiq et al. 2013 b, 2014; Shafiq and Shuker 2013; Shafiq et al. 2015; Shafiq and Ben Mahmud 2016). The acid combinations tested by the authors included a mixture of orthophosphoric (H 3 PO 4) <b>acid</b> and HF; <b>fluoroboric</b> (HBF 4) <b>acid</b> and HCOOH; and HCOOH and HF. The methodology applied was core saturation method, whereby the sandstone core plugs are saturated with the mentioned acid combinations. Multiple analyses were carried out to discuss the change in porosity, permeability, mineralogy and strength {{before and after the}} experiment. According to their findings, the best acid combination is 3 % HF: 9 % H 3 PO 4. However, all these acid combinations are suitable to be applied as the main acid during sandstone acid stimulation. With 135.32 % increase in permeability, this acid combination is even more superior to the standard mud acid (3 % HF: 12 % HCl), showing lower increase in permeability, which is 101.76 %. Therefore, it was proven that varying the acid combination would result in different outcomes, either in major or minor disparity. However, {{it should be noted that}} most of the experimentations were conducted only at ambient or room temperature conditions, which could not represent the real-field environment. Hence, this left a research gap that can be bridged in the future studies.|$|R

This {{is not to be}} confused with electroless plating of the traces as the solution, commercially sold as Liquid Tin, does not contain the chemicals required to reduce tin (II) tetrafluoroborate to metallic tin. Rather, this chemical relies on the low pH created by the <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> to increase the reduction potential of tin vs copper to the point to where tin preferentially plates on the copper traces.|$|E

50|$|Hexafluorosilicic acid is {{generally}} assumed {{to consist of}} oxonium ions charge balanced by hexafluorosilicate dianions as well as water. The situation {{is similar to that}} for chloroplatinic acid, <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid,</b> and hexafluorophosphoric acid. Hexafluorosilicate is an octahedral anion; the Si-F bond distances are 1.71 Å. Hexafluorosilicic acid is only available commercially as solution.|$|E
5000|$|The heavier trihalides do not undergo {{analogous}} reactions, possibly due to {{the lower}} stability of the tetrahedral ions BX4− (X = Cl, Br). Because of the high acidity of <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid,</b> the fluoroborate ion {{can be used to}} isolate particularly electrophilic cations, such as diazonium ions, that are otherwise difficult to isolate as solids.|$|E
50|$|The acidity of <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> is {{complicated}} by the fact that the name refers to several different species H(OEt2)+BF, H3O+BF, and HF.BF3 - each with a different acidity. The aqueous pKa is quoted as −0.44. Titration of NBuBF in acetonitrile solution indicates that HBF4, i.e., HF.BF3, has a pKa of 1.6 in that solvent. Its acidity is thus comparable to that of fluorosulfonic acid.|$|E
50|$|It {{is mainly}} {{produced}} as {{a precursor to}} other fluoroborate salts. It is a strong acid. <b>Fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> is corrosive and attacks the skin. It is available commercially as a solution in water and other solvents such as diethyl ether. It is a strong acid with a weakly coordinating, non-oxidizing conjugate base. It is structurally similar to perchloric acid, but lacks the hazards associated with oxidants.|$|E
5000|$|Perchloric acid, a superacid, {{is one of}} {{the strongest}} Brønsted-Lowry acids. Its pKa is −10, -15.2 (±2.0). [...] It {{provides}} strong acidity with minimal interference because perchlorate is weakly nucleophilic (explaining the high acidity of HClO4). Other acids of noncoordinating anions, such as <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> and hexafluorophosphoric acid are susceptible to hydrolysis, whereas perchloric acid is not. Despite hazards associated with the explosiveness of its salts, the acid is often preferred in certain syntheses. [...] For similar reasons, it is a useful eluent in ion-exchange chromatography.|$|E
5000|$|Aluminium and its alloys are {{difficult}} to solder due {{to the formation of}} the passivation layer of aluminium oxide. The flux {{has to be able to}} disrupt this layer and facilitate wetting by solder. Salts or organic complexes of some metals can be used; the salt has to be able to penetrate the cracks in the oxide layer. The metal ions, more noble than aluminium, then undergo a redox reaction, dissolve the surface layer of aluminium and form a deposit there. This intermediate layer of another metal then can be wetted with a solder. One example of such flux is a composition of triethanolamine, <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid,</b> and cadmium fluoroborate. More than 1% magnesium in the alloy however impairs the flux action, as the magnesium oxide layer is more refractory. Another possibility is an inorganic flux composed of zinc chloride or tin(II) chloride, ammonium chloride, and a fluoride (e.g. sodium fluoride). Presence of silicon in the alloy impairs the flux effectivity, as silicon does not undergo the exchange reaction aluminium does.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To study osseointegration of {{implants}} with surface modifications {{by the use}} of <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> and/or H 2 O 2 {{installed in}} conventional sites or sites with circumferential marginal defects. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four implants with different surfaces were used. One basic surface (ZirTi(®)) was sandblasted with zirconium microspheres and acid etched additionally with hydrofluoric acid. A second surface was treated with <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> instead of hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the other two surfaces was additionally treated with H 2 O 2. The edentulous mandibles of 6 foxhound dogs were used to randomly install 8. 5 -mm-long implants with the different surfaces and to study the histological healing after 1 and 3 months. To study osteoconductivity, additional four recipient sites were prepared with the coronal region being widened so that a 4 mm deep and 0. 85 mm wide marginal defect resulted after the placement of the four implants with different surfaces. No filler material or membranes were used, and a fully submerged healing was allowed for 3 months. RESULTS At the conventional sites, new bone formation ranged between 68. 5 % and 74. 9 % after 1 month. After 3 months, bone-to-implant contact ranged from 72. 6 % at the ZirTi(®) surface to 84. 1 % at the fluoroboric acid-treated implants, the difference being statistically significant. At the sites with marginal defects, bone formation ranged from 0. 77 mm at the surface treated with <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> and H 2 O 2, to 1. 93 mm at the surface treated with <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> alone.

30|$|Figure  9 {{demonstrates}} the {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) results of pore filling clay before and after treatment with conventional mud acid and <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively. It {{was clear from the}} figure in the lower left that clays were dissolved, while the lower right shows partially fused kaolinite platelets. This had prevented the issue of fines migration (Ayorinde et al. 1992).|$|E
30|$|To sum up {{the whole}} {{literature}} review, there are numerous acids that had been developed in the past years, aiming to continuously improve the permeability enhancement result, while preventing precipitation. In this study, a detailed evaluation of all these acids are presented as shown in Table  11. Generally, four groups of acids are identified, which include the mud acid (HF), <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (HBF 4), chelating agents, retarded and organic acids.|$|E
30|$|However, mud acid {{also caused}} some negativity to the wells such as rapid {{reaction}} rate with the formation at high temperature condition. This {{had resulted in}} shallow penetration distance and corrosion. In worst case scenario, this also contributed to production loss (Leong and Ben Mahmud 2018). Therefore, many other chelating agents and alternative acids had been developed such as the <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> and organic acid (Shafiq and Ben Mahmud 2017). In this study, the technical performance of HBF 4 had been studied intensively.|$|E
30|$|Against this background, it is {{critical}} to develop new acid combination, which can mitigate the issues caused by conventional mud acid at elevated temperatures. At the same time, the new acid combination has a role in formation porosity and permeability enhancement, ensuring positive economic returns. There {{have been a number of}} acids that had been developed and used in the sandstone well stimulation. These acids include the most popular mud acid, chelating agents, retarded acids, organic acids as well as <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (HBF 4).|$|E
30|$|<b>Fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (HBF 4) has {{a unique}} slow {{hydrolysis}} reaction to produce hydrofluoric acid (HF). Its hydrolysis process is, however, a function of temperature and concentration (Ryss 1956). Wamser (1948, 1951) carried out investigation on the hydrolysis of HBF 4 at room temperature condition to produce HF. Based on the result, the equilibrium constant of HBF 4 is determined to be 2.3 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 [1] at room temperature. Thomas and Crowe (1978, 1981) applied HBF 4 to stimulate the sandstone reservoirs. HBF 4 had demonstrated its efficiency in enhancing the penetration of live acid as well as stabilizing the clays.|$|E
30|$|A 3 D {{mathematical}} model {{to simulate the}} performance of <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid,</b> HBF 4, at various range of temperatures had been developed. The numerical simulation process had also been accomplished using the COMSOL® Multiphysics commercial software of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A finite element method (FEM) was adopted and implemented to perform the numerical solving of the core-scale cylindrical model. Finally, a number of 3 D visualization of the simulation results as well as interpretation were presented. Based on the modelling results, {{there are a few}} conclusions that were drawn to attention as highlighted in the following points.|$|E
30|$|In the past, many {{researchers}} had proven various advantages that were offered by <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (HBF 4) and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) {{when compared to}} the mud acid. HBF 4 can produce HF through slow hydrolysis process. On the other hand, H 3 PO 4 functions like a buffer acid, which enables a deeper penetration of acid into the sandstone matrix before being spent. Similarly, both these acids result in higher permeability increase, lower strength reduction of the core plugs and relatively lower corrosiveness. Despite this, there are few studies indicating the precise temperature range, in which HBF 4 can be suitably applied, resulting in successful sandstone acid treatment.|$|E
30|$|From {{a larger}} perspective, {{it is clear}} that there are many {{different}} acids that can be technically used in sandstone stimulation besides the mud acid, which is a conventional option and has already been widely applied. These acids that had been used and tested included chelating agents, retarded and organic acid combinations as well as <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid.</b> Among all the acids tested by previous researchers, HBF 4 could be further experimented based upon the research conducted by Shafiq and Ben Mahmud (2016) at the higher temperatures of 60, 80 and 100  °C. Then, the results could be compared with mud acid under the same temperature conditions.|$|E
40|$|Methylation of {{alcohols}} by the Williamson synthesis requires strongly {{basic conditions}} {{and there is}} no satisfactory general methylation procedure effective under neutral or mildly acidic conditions. In principle, diazomethane with an acidic catalyst should methylate alcohols, but the usual protonic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, is unsatisfactory because it is itself methylated with diazomethane. <b>Fluoroboric</b> <b>acid,</b> however, promised to serve as a useful catalyst since it would be consumed in reaction with diazoinethane only by some process involving rupture of a B-F bond. This expectation was indeed realized and a novel method has been developed for methylation of alcohols in high yields under mild conditions...|$|E

Concentrations of 5 - 100 mM Sn(II) in 1 M <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> have been explored and electron micrographs of the deposited crystals used to characterise the different shapes and sizes of the crystals obtained. Low concentrations and low overpotentials result in faceted cuboid-shaped crystals while higher concentrations and deposition potentials yield highly complex and fractal-like structures with high surface energies. These crystals can be used as model systems for studying mesoscopic superconductivity, or as a template for core-shell structures if plated with a second metal...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, methanesulphonic acid has largely {{replaced}} <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> as the electrode of choice for the electrodeposition of tin and tin-lead solder on electronic devices. Certain other electrochemical processes involving lead, most notably the electrorefining of lead by the Bett's process are currently carried out in fluorosilicic acid based electrolytes but those based on methanesulphonic acid (MSA) are being actively investigated as environmentally superior alternatives to the currently used systems. Also, a number of commercial strip steel tin-plating operations have recently converted to methanesulphonic acid based tin-plating electrolytes. There are also developing markets for methanesulphonic acid in silver, nickel, copper, cadmium and zinc electroplating.

30|$|So, <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (HBF 4) {{is being}} {{proposed}} in the scope of future work. Numerous advantages were observed in HBF 4 {{when compared to the}} mud acid. It causes greater increase in the permeability, less reduction in the mechanical strength of core plugs and has also significantly lower corrosiveness. HBF 4 is more beneficial than conventional mud acid due to its retardation effect. However, there is no innovative discovery of the limitation of this retardation effect. Although HBF 4 has a slow hydrolysis process to form HF, its retardation effect is a function of temperature. This means that as the temperature increases, the retardation effect of HBF 4 will be reduced until it reaches an optimum point of temperature. Hence, the persistence of HBF 4 at high temperatures deserves detailed investigation in future to provide a more precise and reliable recommendation of acid choice between HF and HBF 4.|$|E
30|$|Zhou et al. (2016) also {{performed}} core flooding experiments using 12 % HBF 4 combined with 12 % HCl at 25 and 65  °C. The results {{were compared to}} conventional 3 % HF and 12 % HCl. The {{results indicated that the}} permeability enhancement reflected by the <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> combination is 40 % higher than the conventional mud acid. Also, permeability enhancement is greater at 65  °C than 25  °C. The work done by Zhou et al. (2016) only compared two temperatures, which are 25 and 65  °C. There is no optimization work being conducted and, therefore, the optimum temperature range for the recommended use of HBF 4 remains undetermined. In addition, the core sample used is a heterogeneous sandstone, with 9 % being clay and calcite. An evaluation of the homogeneous clean sandstone is also recommended in the future. A summary of classification on the reviewed experimental works using HBF 4 is interpreted in Table  8.|$|E
30|$|The low-, medium- and high-formation {{temperature}} conditions {{are represented by}} 25, 65, and 105  °C, respectively. After 5, 15, 25, and 35  min of the <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> injection, {{the results of the}} 3 D numerical visualization are obtained. However, only the results after 25 and 35  min were shown here in this paper. The porosity and permeability distribution of the core at 25, 65, and 105  °C due to acid dissolution and precipitation reactions are shown in Figs.  4 and 5, respectively. This simulation is based on homogeneous sandstone condition, therefore, the moving of injected acid at {{the front end of the}} core plug is observed to be uniform throughout the length of the core plug. There is no preferential flow path being created along the core sample as the porosity and permeability distribution being decreased in a gradual and uniform pattern from the entering side until the exiting end of the core geometry.|$|E
40|$|The {{precursor}} of open chain Reissert analogues was prepared by reaction of mandelonitrile with aniline to form 2 -anilino- 2 -phenylacetonitrile. A range of open chain Reissert compounds {{was made by}} reacting the acetonitrile with p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, p-methylbenzoyl chloride, and p-methoxybenzoyl chloride. Each of the Reissert compounds was treated with <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> to form the munchnone iminium salt. Each was reacted with ethyl propiolate and ethyl phenylpropiolate to yeild highly substituted pyrroles. ^ The ratio of the regioisomeric products {{of each of the}} reactions was established by HPLC. Identification of the regioisomers was accomplished by alternate syntheses, and by 300 MHz (2 ̆ 71) H-NMR analyses. ^ Based on the regiochemical data gathered, 1, 3 dipolar cycloaddition reactions of munchnone iminium salts with substituted acetylenes are highly regioselective. Regioisomeric product ratios indicate that merostabilization has a greater effect on the regiochemistry of the reaction than Linnett stabilization, which in turn is stronger than benzylic stabilization for the reactions of munchnone iminium salts with substituted acetylenes. ...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{stationary}} source emissions for heavy metals generally requires {{the use of}} quartz filters to collect samples because of the high temperature and high moisture sampling environment. The documentary standard method sample preparation technique in Europe, EN 14385, uses digestion in hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid (HF/HNO 3) followed by complexing with boric acid (H 3 BO 3) prior to analysis. However, the use of this method presents a number of problems, including significant instrumental drift during analysis caused by the matrix components, often leading to instrument breakdown and downtime for repairs, as well as posing significant health and safety risks. The aim of this work was to develop an alternative sample preparation technique for emissions samples on quartz filters. The alternative techniques considered were: (i) acid digestion in a <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (HBF 4) and HNO 3 mixture and (ii) acid extraction in an aqua regia (AR) mixture (HCl and HNO 3). Assessment of the effectiveness of these options included determination of interferences and signal drift, as well as validating the different methods by measurement of matrix certified reference materials (CRMs), and comparing the results obtained from real test samples and sample blanks to determine limits of detection. The results showed that the HBF 4 /HNO 3 mixture provides the most viable alternative to the documentary standard preparation technique...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{study the}} {{sequential}} healing at bicortically installed implants with surface modifications {{by the use}} of <b>fluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> and/or H 2 O 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-eight albino New Zealand rabbits were used. Two recipient sites were prepared in the tibiae bilaterally, one in the metaphysis and the second in the diaphysis regions. Four implants with different surface characteristics were randomly installed with bicortical stabilization: (i) sandblasted and acid-etched; (ii) same surface as i, but with a substitution of the hydrofluoric acid with fluoroboric acid; (iii) same surface as i, additionally treated with H 2 O 2; and (iv) same surface modified as ii, additionally treated with H 2 O 2. The animals were killed after 5, 8, 15, and 30 days. Ground sections were prepared for histological analyses. RESULTS No statistically significant differences in osseointegration were found among various surfaces at any of the healing periods. A higher degree of osseointegration was observed at the implants placed in the metaphysis compared to those placed in the diaphysis, especially during early healing. A higher degree of osseointegration was found at sites with proximity to compact (cortical) bone when compared to the middle portion of the implants, especially in the diaphysis region. CONCLUSIONS Surfaces modified with different acids or H 2 O 2 resulted in similar osseointegration compared to a standard sandblasted and acid-etched surface. The portion of the bicortically installed implants in close contact with the cortical compartment presented a higher percentage of osseointegration compared with the region in contact with the bone marrow compartment...|$|E
