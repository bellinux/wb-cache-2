40|$|Diagnosis of sleep-disordered {{breathing}} {{is based on}} the presence of an abnormal breathing pattern during sleep. In this study, an algorithm was developed for the offline breath-to-breath analysis of the nocturnal respiratory recordings. For that purpose, respiratory signals (nasal airway pressure, thoracic and abdominal movements) were divided into half waves using period amplitude analysis. Individual breaths were characterized by the parameters of the <b>half</b> waves (<b>duration,</b> <b>amplitude,</b> and slope). These values can be used to discriminate between normal and abnormal breaths. This algorithm was applied to six polysomnographic recordings to distinguish abnormal breathing events (apneas and hypopneas). The algorithm was robust for the identification of breaths (sensitivity = 96. 8 %, positive prediction value (PPV) = 99. 5 %). The detection of apneas and hypopneas was compared to the manual scoring of two experienced sleep technicians: sensitivity was, respectively, 89. 2 and 88. 9 %, PPV was 54. 1 and 59. 3 %. The classification of apneas into central, obstructive, or mixed was in concordance with the observers in 68 % of the apneas. Although the algorithm tended to detect more hypopneas than the clinical standard, this study shows that the extraction of breath-to-breath parameters is useful for detection of abnormal respiratory events and provides a basis for further characterization of these events...|$|R

METHODS: Eighteen schizophrenia outpatients and fourteen normal controls participated in the VGS task. Multiple indicators, including <b>amplitude,</b> <b>duration,</b> velocity, latency, accuracy rate, acceleration, and deceleration were analyzed. Asymmetric acceleration index (AAI) was introduced to describe {{the difference between}} peak acceleration and peak deceleration. The correlation coefficient (RAD) of AAI and duration was computed to examine the difference between schizophrenia patients and normal controls. RESULTS: No significant difference between patients and normal controls was found on <b>amplitude,</b> <b>duration,</b> latency, and accuracy rate. However, RAD values of schizophrenia patients were {{significantly lower than the}} control group.

2500|$|Currents {{produced}} by the opening of voltage-gated channels {{in the course of}} an action potential are typically [...] significantly larger than the initial stimulating current.

This all-or-nothing property of the action potential sets it apart from graded potentials such as receptor potentials, electrotonic potentials, and synaptic potentials, which scale with the magnitude of the stimulus.

40|$|We {{present the}} time-frequency {{analysis}} results {{based on the}} Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) {{for the evolution of}} a 4 -Hz low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (LFQPO) around the black hole X-ray binary XTE J 1550 - 564. The origin of LFQPOs is still debated. To understand the cause of the peak broadening, we utilized a recently developed time-frequency analysis, HHT, for tracking the evolution of the 4 -Hz LFQPO from XTE J 1550 564. By adaptively decomposing the ~ 4 -Hz oscillatory component from the light curve and acquiring its instantaneous frequency, the Hilbert spectrum illustrates that the LFQPO is composed of a series of intermittent oscillations appearing occasionally between 3 Hz and 5 Hz. We further characterized this intermittency by computing the confidence limits of the instantaneous amplitudes of the intermittent oscillations, and constructed both the distributions of the QPO's high and low <b>amplitude</b> <b>durations,</b> which are the time intervals with and without significant ~ 4 -Hz oscillations, respectively. The mean high <b>amplitude</b> <b>duration</b> is 1. 45 s and 90 % of the oscillation segments have lifetimes below 3. 1 s. The mean low <b>amplitude</b> <b>duration</b> is 0. 42 s and 90 % of these segments are shorter than 0. 73 s. In addition, these intermittent oscillations exhibit a correlation between the oscillation's rms amplitude and mean count rate. This correlation could be analogous to the linear rms-flux relation found in the 4 -Hz LFQPO through Fourier analysis. We conclude that the LFQPO peak in the power spectrum is broadened owing to intermittent oscillations with varying frequencies, which could be explained by using the Lense-Thirring precession model.

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{experimental}} {{study showed that}} thyropharyngeal, cricopharyngeal and cervical esophageal muscles of rabbits with iron deficiency anemia had morphological changes similar to those observed in muscular dystrophy, causing myastenic changes in muscles involved in swallowing. Our hypothesis is that patients with iron deficiency anemia may have a decrease in esophageal contractions with successive swallows. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied the esophageal motility of 12 women with iron deficiency anemia aged 31 to 50 years (median 36 years) with serum iron from 11 to 40 mug/dL (median 21 mug/dL), and 13 asymptomatic women aged 26 to 49 years (median 35 years) with serum iron over 60 mug/dL. We used the manometric method with continuous perfusion. The esophageal contractions were measured at 3, 9 and 15 cm from the upper margin of a sleeve that straddled the lower esophageal sphincter. Each subject performed 10 swallows of a 2 mL bolus of water alternated with 10 swallows of a 7 mL bolus, with an interval of 30 seconds between swallows. We measured the <b>amplitude,</b> <b>duration,</b> velocity and area under the curve of contractions. RESULTS: There {{was no difference between}} the swallows of a 2 mL or 7 mL bolus. The <b>amplitude,</b> <b>duration</b> and area under the curve were lower in patients with iron deficiency than in asymptomatic volunteers, mainly in the proximal and middle esophageal body. There was no difference in velocity. Sequential swallows did not change contraction <b>amplitude,</b> <b>duration,</b> velocity or area under curve in patients and volunteers. CONCLUSION: Although the power of esophageal contractions was decreased in patients with iron deficiency anemia, sequential swallows did not cause further impairment...|$|R

Median nerve conduction studies, <b>amplitude</b> and <b>duration</b> of MUAP, and the MUNE of the abductor pollicis brevis were measured. The cross sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve at the pisiform and distal radioulnar joint level was determined by high resolution ultrasonography. Clinical symptom of CTS was assessed using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ). Results The MUNE, the <b>amplitude</b> and the <b>duration</b> of MUAP of the CTS group were significantly different from those found in the control group. The area under the ROC curve was 0. 944 for MUNE, 0. 923 for MUAP amplitude and 0. 953 for MUAP duration. MUNE had a negative correlation with electrophysiologic stage of CTS, <b>amplitude</b> and <b>duration</b> of MUAP, CSA at pisiform level, and the score of BCTQ. The <b>amplitude</b> and <b>duration</b> of MUAP had a positive correlation with the score of BCTQ. The electrophysiologic stage was correlated with amplitude but not with the duration of MUAP.

40|$|Abstract The aims of {{this study}} were to explore all {{characteristics}} of high-amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs) {{that would allow them to}} be distinguished from nonHAPC colonic pressure waves, and to develop computer algorithms for automated HAPC detection. Colonic manometry recordings obtained from 24 healthy volunteers were used. Automated analysis was performed to detect propagated pressure waves and to determine their <b>amplitude,</b> <b>duration</b> and area under the curve (AUC). For each of these variables distribution plots were made. Automated HAPC counts were compared to visual counts by experienced investigators. Distribution plots of 141093 colonic pressure waves lacked a bimodal pattern, as was also the case for propagated contractions (n = 8758). With increasing high-amplitude thresholds for HAPC detection, a gradual decrease in the automatically detected HAPC number was observed. These findings precluded determination of a threshold. Taking visually detected HAPCs as reference, amplitude thresholds of 100 mmHg in two channels, and 80 mmHg in one channel yielded the highest sensitivity (92 %). In conclusion, objective criteria to distinguish HAPCs from other propagated pressure waves on the basis of their <b>amplitude,</b> <b>duration</b> or AUC do not exist. Automated detection of HAPCs using empirically derived criteria leads to an acceptable degree of correlation with visually detected HAPC...|$|R
