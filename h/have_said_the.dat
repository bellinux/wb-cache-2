5|$|On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta {{told the}} Senate and House {{intelligence}} committees that the CIA withheld {{information about a}} secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program {{was an attempt to}} carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{speculative}} hypotheses. One hypothesis is that the cross symbols and the swastika share a common origin in simply symbolizing the sun. Another hypothesis is that the four arms of the cross represent four aspects of nature - the sun, wind, water, soil. Some <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> four arms of cross are four seasons, where the division for 90-degree sections correspond to the solstices and equinoxes.|$|E

25|$|Internationally, where gun {{controls}} are generally stricter {{than in the}} United States, some commentators <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> impact may be more strongly felt, as alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable. Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a 3D printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws. Europol stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons, but noted that as the technology improved the risks of an effect would increase.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2013 police across China {{announced}} the arrests {{of hundreds of}} people accused of spreading false rumors online. Chinese authorities <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> crackdown is directed at abuses such as fraud, fakery, and slander. But the accusations against many of the arrested microbloggers have a political edge {{with many of the}} rumors called outrageously false by the government dealing with the sins of officials: corruption, venality, and sexual escapades. The suspicion is that the crackdown is intended to break up online networks of like-minded people whose ideas could challenge the Communist Party. Some of China's most popular microbloggers have been arrested. In September 2013 China’s highest court and prosecution office issued guidelines that define and outline penalties for publishing online rumors and slander. The rules give some protection to citizens who accuse officials of corruption, but they say that a slanderous message forwarded more than 500 times or read more than 5,000 times could result in up to three years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Gen. Anaya {{stated in}} his written battle report that 35 San Patricios were killed, 85 taken {{prisoner}} (including a wounded John Riley, Captain O'Leary and Anaya); about 85 escaped with retreating Mexican forces. Some 60% of the San Patricios {{were killed or}} captured in the engagement. The survivors were reformed before the Battle of Mexico City some two weeks later and were stationed at Querétaro where the Mexican government had decamped, with some 50 members serving as a body-guard for the commander-in-chief. The battalion were {{caught up in the}} infighting and politicking of Mexico at the time, and were under the patronage of a faction that favored suing for ending of the conflict peacefully. New units were later made up of the free survivors of the battle of Churubusco and a roughly equal number of fresh deserters from the U.S. Army. Following the war, the Mexican Government insisted in a clause of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that the remaining San Patricio prisoners held by the Americans were to be left in Mexico, and Major General William Orlando Butler issued General Orders 116 on June 1, 1848 stating that; “The prisoners confined at the Citadel, known as the San Patricio prisoners, will be immediately discharged"—Rogue’s March was played upon their release. The Saint Patrick's battalion continued to function as two infantry companies under the command of John Riley, with one unit tasked with sentry duty in Mexico City and the other was stationed in the suburbs of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The San Patricios were officially mustered out of Mexican military service in 1848; some members were alleged to have been involved in an abortive military coup, while historians <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> group was disbanded because of Mexican budget cuts.|$|E

500|$|Judas Priest {{formed in}} 1969 in {{industrial}} West Bromwich, Birmingham. [...] Co-founder Al Atkins chose the band's name, wanting one similar to Black Sabbath's. [...] The bands were contemporaries and were both from Birmingham, though Judas Priest {{failed to find}} a significant audience until Black Sabbath began to fade from the spotlight. [...] The band's guitarists Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> heavy riffing {{and complexity of the}} song arrangements were inspired by the factories of Birmingham.|$|E
500|$|The band <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> lyrics {{refer to}} the events of both Bloody Sunday in 1972 and Bloody Sunday in 1920, but are not {{specifically}} about either event. The song takes the standpoint of someone horrified by the cycle of violence in the province. Bono rewrote the Edge's initial lyrics, attempting to contrast the two events with Easter Sunday, but he has said that the band were too inexperienced at the time to fully realise that goal, noting that [...] "it was a song whose eloquence lay in its harmonic power rather than its verbal strength." ...|$|E

Craig and Bentley denied that Bentley <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> words while the police officers testified that he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> them. Further, Bentley's counsel argued {{that even if he}} <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> words, it could not be proven that Bentley had intended the words to mean the informal meaning of [...] "shoot him, Chris" [...] instead of the literal meaning of [...] "give him the gun, Chris".|$|R
500|$|Some leading {{figures from}} the {{critical}} countries, such as Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> QE2 is understandable given the challenges facing the United States. Wang Jun, the Chinese Vice Finance Minister suggested QE2 could [...] "help {{the revival of the}} global economy tremendously". President Barack Obama has defended QE2, saying it would help the U.S. economy to grow, which would be [...] "good for the world as a whole". Japan also launched a second round of quantitative easing though to a lesser extent than the United States; Britain and the Eurozone did not launch an additional QE in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "alternative" [...] {{had been}} used as a {{catchall}} term for rock bands outside the mainstream, Spin Alternative Record Guide covers approximately 500 artists from a variety of genres considered relevant to alternative music's development. These include 1970s punk rock, 1980s college rock, 1990s indie rock, noise music, reggae, electronic, new wave, heavy metal, krautrock, synthpop, disco, alternative country, hip hop, grunge, worldbeat, and avant-garde jazz. Most artists associated with classic rock are not covered, while some mainstream pop artists are given entries, including Madonna and ABBA. Other non-rock artists reviewed in the book include jazz composer Sun Ra, country singer-songwriter Lyle Lovett, and Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Weisbard and Marks <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> book was meant to be [...] "suggestive", rather than [...] "comprehensive", of alternative music.|$|E
500|$|A view often held {{by those}} who reject the {{evidence}} for global warming is {{that much of the}} temperature increase seen in land based thermometers could be due to an increase in urbanization and the siting of measurement stations in urban areas. For example, Ross McKitrick and Patrick J. Michaels conducted a statistical study of surface-temperature data regressed against socioeconomic indicators, and concluded that about half of the observed warming trend (for 1979–2002) could be accounted for by the residual UHI effects in the corrected temperature data set they studied—which had already been processed to remove the (modeled) UHI contribution. Critics of this paper, including Gavin A. Schmidt, <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> results can be explained away as an artifact of spatial autocorrelation. McKittrick and Nicolas Nierenberg stated further that [...] "the evidence for contamination of climatic data is robust across numerous data sets." ...|$|E
