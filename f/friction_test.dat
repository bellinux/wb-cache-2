50|$|To {{assess a}} floor's slip resistance, a reliable, {{thoroughly}} researched (in interlaboratory studies) floor <b>friction</b> <b>test</b> method must be used, {{and then a}} minimum safety criterion (0.43, 0.60, 36, etc.) is needed {{to apply to the}} results. If the floor is likely to be lubricated with water or grease in use, it needs to be anti-slip under these expected conditions. Floor slip resistance testing can be carried out dry, wet with water, or lubricated with oils and other contaminants. Dry slip resistance is not an indicator of wet slip resistance — in fact the two often vary inversely — so reliable wet slip resistance testing is often needed as well as reliable dry testing.|$|E
5000|$|Friction testing. There {{are several}} {{techniques}} through which explosives may be tested {{to determine their}} sensitivity to friction. One {{of the most popular}} is the ABL <b>friction</b> <b>test,</b> which uses a line of explosives on a prepared metal plate, placed in front of a specially prepared metal wheel that is forced down upon the plate with a hydraulic press. The metal plate is then struck with a pendulum to move it, squeezing the explosives between plate and wheel as the plate moves. Initiation is determined, and analyzed by the Bruceton analysis or Neyer d-optimal test, as above. BAM friction testing is similar, except that the sample is placed on a ceramic plate which is then moved side-to-side as a ceramic peg exerts force on the sample.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} factors effect {{pavement}} surface friction characteristics.

Since 2006, Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has adopted the International Civil Aviation Organisations (ICAO) requirements for runway <b>friction</b> <b>testing</b> and minimum intervention levels. Should an incident occur and the runway's condition be questioned, <b>friction</b> <b>testing</b> results may be an important safeguard for the airport owner. There are a number of options for any airport to provide a runway surface with adequate friction characteristics. CASA, through MOS 139, notes the use of grooved or un-grooved asphalt surfaces, open graded friction courses and sprayed seals as valid options. ICAO has identified six reliable <b>friction</b> <b>testing</b> devices and has published equivalent friction results for each device, based on significant research and investigation undertaken primarily by NASA.

40|$|Abstract. Lubricant {{potentiality}} of used cooking {{palm oil}} was examined through four-ball <b>friction</b> <b>test</b> with modified palm oils {{of two different}} types. One category of tested oils was the heat-treated type which is expected as degraded palm oil by heating during cooking. The degraded degree was controlled by the length of heating period, then the acid number, AN, was varied between 0 and 3. 5 [mgKOH/g]. For these oils, temperature dependence during <b>friction</b> <b>test</b> was examined on friction and wear between 40 - 100 ˚C. Degraded palm oil of higher acid number showed wear much more, and the wear for AN= 3. 5 showed almost double of non-heat treated oil, but half of mineral oil, VG 32, up to 85 ˚C. Friction coefficient did not show strong dependence of the acid number, and the value was 20 %-lower than VG 32 between 40 - 100 ˚C. The other was the free-fatty acid added type which is expected as degraded palm oil by hydrolysis during cooking where boiled water reacts with palm oil. Four model oils were prepared, {{and each of them}} contained one of major palm oil components, such as palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid, at 10 mass % to refined palm oil. For these oils, <b>friction</b> <b>test</b> was performed at 40 and 100 ˚C to examine the effect of temperature.

Dry <b>friction</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted and compared with the bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution lubricated Ni and the cell culture media lubricated Ni.
