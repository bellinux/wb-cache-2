40|$|Pregnant rats were {{implanted}} with subcutaneous minipumps to deliver either naloxone or saline. The time-course of subsequent parturition was different {{between the two}} groups: the <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> <b>births</b> was significantly shorter for the naloxone=req- treated rats. This supports {{the hypothesis that the}} opioid innervation of the neurohypophysis, which is known to influence oxytocin release profoundly, has a physiological role in parturition. To test the further hypothesis that this role is particularly important in a stressful environment, pregnant rats, again implanted with minipumps, were regularly transferred, at 15 -min intervals beginning with the birth of the first pup, between their normal cage and the unfamiliar environment of a glass observation chamber. No difference was noted between the time-courses of parturition for the naloxone- and saline-treated groups, although the time-courses were markedly altered from those observed in rats not subjected to an unfamiliar environment. We conclude that opioid modulation of oxytocin release {{may play a role in}} 'spacing ' the delivery of successive births during normal parturition. J. Endocr. (1985) 106, 219 =n- 2...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>{{interval}}</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> <b>births</b> (birth interval) {{may affect}} breast cancer risk, whereas interval from last birth to cancer onset may modify its behaviour. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 29 488 Finnish grand multiparous (GM) women, including 628 women with breast cancer. Conditional logistic regression for case–control design nested within the cohort {{was used to}} estimate proportional hazards (referred as relative risks, RR). Age at first birth and parity were co-variables. RESULTS: Short interval (o 1 year) between first and second birth increased the risk of advanced ductal breast cancer at ages o 50 years (RR 5. 29; 95 % CI 2. 00 – 14. 0) as compared to interval 3 þ years. The risk of advanced ductal cancer was also large (RR 4. 00; 95 % CI 1. 19 – 13. 4) shortly (o 3 years) after last birth {{as compared with the}} period 15 þ years. CONCLUSIONS: Short birth interval-associated excess breast cancer risk may be related to stimulatory effects of female steroid hormones produced during two closely connected pregnancies, or defective breast maturation owing to failures in breastfeeding...|$|E

50|$|Following {{the seminal}} {{research}} done by Dr. Wedekind, several studies found corroborating evidence for biological compatibility. Garver-Apgar et al. presented evidence for HLA-dissimilar alleles playing {{a factor in}} the healthiness of romantic relationships. They discovered that as the proportion of HLA-similar alleles increased between couples, females reported being less sexually responsive to their partners, less satisfaction from being aroused by their partners, and having additional sexual partners (while with their current partner). Additionally, Ober et al. conducted an independent study on a population of American Hutterites by comparing the HLA alleles of married couples. They discovered that married couples were less likely to share HLA alleles than expected from random chance; thus their results were consistent with tendencies for same-HLA alleled partners to avoid mating. Further evidence of the importance of genetic compatibility {{can be found in the}} finding that couples sharing a higher proportion of HLA alleles tend to have recurring spontaneous abortions, reduced body mass in babies, and longer <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> <b>births.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycles of}} 23 captive olive baboons were studied over two successive parturitions. Interbirth intervals of 450 days were reduced by 60 % {{in comparison to}} wild baboons, and consisted of 145 days of postpartum amenorrhea, 3. 5 cycles, and a gestation of 185 days. Dominance rank {{was found to be}} one significant factor affecting female fertility. Low-ranking females had longer total <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> <b>births</b> and, in particular, they experienced a longer delay to conception once they had resumed sexual cycles. Mothers of infants who were heavy for age resumed cycling more quickly and had fewer cycles before a subsequent conception. Mothers best able to sustain rapid early infant growth were those of high dominance rank and of high body mass; these females had more rapid reproductive rates. As female energy intake was unrelated to dominance, we suggest that social stresses are important suppressors of the hormonal and lactational competence of subordinate females...|$|R
40|$|Studying the {{dynamics}} of timing and spacing of births is important for several reasons including an understanding of completed family size as well as maternal and child mortality differentials. Using the 1998 DHS data, this paper examines whether there are intrinsic socio-cultural factors that affect the duration of birth intervals in Ghana. The results suggest that while most socio-cultural differences are mediated through socio-economic and demographic factors, there is the persistence of ethnic-specific norms and practices that affect the timing of births. At all durations, Ewes and Mole- Dagbanis were consistently found to have longer <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> <b>births</b> than Akans. This has been explained through to ethnic differences in unobservable norms and observable practices such as lineage patterns, duration of the period of post-partum sexual abstinence and amenorrhoea. Besides the socio-economic and socio-cultural factors, other consistently significant covariates were age at first birth, birth cohorts and the survival status of the index. Age at first marriage was found to associate only with {{the timing of the}} first two children...|$|R
40|$|Continual {{surveillance}} {{aiming to}} detect an increased frequency of some rare event {{is of interest}} in several different situations in quality control, medicine, economics and other fields. Examples are continual surveillance of defect articles in a production process or surveillance of a business cycle. Surveillance of rare health events in general and especially surveillance of congenital malformations has been a field of unabating interest during the last decades. Since the Thalidomide episode in the early 60 's, several registries of congenital malformations are in operation all over the world. The basic idea {{is that if a}} 'catastrophe' occurs an alarm should be signalled as soon as possible after the occurrence. A method developed for this situation is the Sets method that focuses on the <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> events under surveillance, e. g. <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> <b>births</b> of malformed babies. If a previously defined number of such intervals are 'short' an alarm is triggered. The traditional evaluation measure used when discussing the Sets method is the ARL (Average Run Length). Here, evaluation measures such as the probability of a false alarm, the probability of a successful detection and the predictive value of an alarm are derived and discussed for the Sets method. The information provided by these measures is important for the implementation and use of a system of surveillance in practice...|$|R
40|$|Studying the {{dynamics}} of spacing of births is important for several reasons including an understanding of completed family size. For instance, making longer <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> <b>births</b> used to allow less competition between existing children for breastfeeding, food, nutrition, the mother’s time, and other resources. In this paper the length of <b>birth</b> <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> children that is called inter-birth interval in rural community of Ethiopia was considered. The data for the study was obtained from Ethiopian Demography and Health survey (EDHS) data conducted in 2010 / 11. The data contains 9647 rural women aged from 15 - 49 years. The approach {{of the study was}} fitting probability density functions to identify better distribution that provide adequate fit for all birth interval data; and among those distributions lognormal distribution seem best fit. Identifying variables that affect birth intervals was done by parametric survival analysis technique called “accelerated failure time ” model. The result shows that the duration time <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> <b>births</b> is different for different regions, religion groups and education level. The median length of birth intervals in rural community of Ethiopia is 28 months and more than 75 % of births occur within 3 years...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the determinants of optimal {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) adherence and time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> clinic visits, and the association between these two processes. This was done by reviewing routinely collected patient information in the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA). Records of 688 patients enrolled in the CAPRISA AIDS treatment (CAT) programme between 2004 and 2006 were analysed. Patients were considered adherent if they had taken at least 95 % of their prescribed drugs. The adherence has been measured using the pill counts data. A multivariate generalised mixed random effects approach was used to jointly analyse optimal HAART adherence and time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> visits. The results showed that on the overall, the association between optimal HAART adherence and time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> visits was negative. The results further showed that the interaction between time and treatment site had a significant joint effect on optimal HAART adherence and time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> visits. The interaction revealed that as the number of follow-up visits increased, the <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> visits also increased {{while at the same time}} high levels of optimal adherence were maintained in the rural treatment site. Moreover, after accounting for the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> visits, the results showed that optimal HAART adherence was significantly associated with having a cell phone, living with a partner as well as interactions that include time and gender, time and treatment site, age and gender and age and education. The findings provide evidence of a negative association between optimal HAART adherence and the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> clinic visits on the overall, which therefore indicates that longer time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> clinic visits is undesirable if optimal HAART adherence is to be maintained. This notwithstanding, rural patients were able to maintain HAART adherence for longer time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>successive</b> clinic visits. Furthermore, the findings indicated that optimal HAART adherence was low for some sub-populations, such as the urban and male populations, thus vigorous ongoing adherence counseling is required.

40|$|Abstract—Nodes within {{existing}} P 2 P networks typically exchange periodic keep-alive {{messages in}} order to maintain network connections between neighbours.

Several studies have shown that older peers are more likely to remain in the network longer than their short-lived counterparts.
