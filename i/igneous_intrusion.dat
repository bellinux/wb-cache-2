In geology, when an <b>igneous</b> <b>intrusion</b> cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, {{it can be}} determined that the <b>igneous</b> <b>intrusion</b> is younger than the sedimentary rock.

25|$|Geologists Carpenter and Russell studied Devils Tower in {{the late}} 19th century {{and came to the}} {{conclusion}} that it was formed by an <b>igneous</b> <b>intrusion.</b> Modern geologists agree that it was formed by the intrusion of igneous material, but not on exactly how that process took place. Several believe the molten rock comprising the Tower might not have surfaced; others are convinced the tower is all that remains of what once was a large explosive volcano.|$|E
25|$|Folds form under varied {{conditions}} of stress, hydrostatic pressure, pore pressure, and temperature gradient, {{as evidenced by}} their presence in soft sediments, {{the full spectrum of}} metamorphic rocks, and even as primary flow structures in some igneous rocks. A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a fold belt, a common feature of orogenic zones. Folds are commonly formed by shortening of existing layers, but may also be formed as a result of displacement on a non-planar fault (fault bend fold), at the tip of a propagating fault (fault propagation fold), by differential compaction or due to the effects of a high-level <b>igneous</b> <b>intrusion</b> e.g. above a laccolith.|$|E
25|$|Exposed {{within the}} {{interior}} of the Richat Structure are a variety of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites. The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and hydrothermally altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars. According to field mapping and aeromagnetic data, the gabbroic rocks form two concentric ring dikes. The inner ring dike is about 20m in width and lies about 3km from the center of Richat Structure. The outer ring dike is about 50m in width and lies about 7 to 8km from the center of this structure. Thirty-two carbonatite dikes and sills have been mapped within the Richat Structure. The dikes are generally about 300m long and typically 1 to 4m wide. They consist of massive carbonatites that are mostly devoid of vesicles. The carbonatite rocks have been dated as having cooled between 94 and 104million years ago. A kimberlitic plug and several sills have been found within {{the northern part of the}} Richat Structure. The kimberlite plug has been dated to around 99million years old. These intrusive igneous rocks are interpreted as indicating the presence of a large alkaline <b>igneous</b> <b>intrusion</b> that currently underlies the Richat Structure and created it by uplifting the overlying rock.|$|E

50|$|<b>Igneous</b> <b>intrusions</b> {{are found}} in the far {{southern}} areas of the State. Ages ago North America began to split roughly {{along the lines of the}} Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Igneous rock flowed up into fissures, as a new ocean began to form. Had this continued, Illinois might have resembled the Arabian Peninsula, a broken terrain between two continents. This split, however, failed: the continent reclosed, leaving only a few <b>igneous</b> <b>intrusions,</b> and some oil fields, as evidence that it happened.|$|R
2500|$|Stone Mountain is a pluton, {{a type of}} <b>igneous</b> <b>intrusion.</b> Primarily {{composed}} of quartz monzonite, the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during {{the formation of the}} Blue Ridge Mountains around 300–350 million years ago (during the Carboniferous period), part of the Appalachian Mountains. It formed {{as a result of the}} upwelling of magma from within the Earth's crust. [...] This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.|$|E
2500|$|The São João platform, {{along the}} {{northern}} flank of the Sintra Mountains, has altitudes between [...] and , while {{the southern part of}} the mountains, the Cascais platform, is lower: sloping from [...] to the sea, terminating along the coast, around [...] above sea level. The spectacular relief results from the east-west orientation of the massif's axis, its terminus at the coast, and the nature of igneous rocks, which are resistant to erosion. The Eruptive Massif of Sintra (MES) is a dome structure, formed by layers of sedimentary rocks (limestones and sandstones) from the Upper Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods. A metamorphosed <b>igneous</b> <b>intrusion</b> resulted in a narrow halo of metamorphic rocks, but also strongly deformed these sedimentary layers causing a vertical exposure. While in the south there are enclosed sedimentary layers, to the north (around Praia Grande) the massif is steep. The sedimentary formations, until the beginning of the Upper Cretaceous, are deformed by the intrusion which limits the MES to the end the Cretaceous. Radiometric aging of different rocks from the massif has indicated an age between 80 and 75 million years (confirming the installation of the massive Upper Cretaceous).|$|E
