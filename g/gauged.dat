5|$|In 1875, Goldfaden {{headed for}} Munich, {{intending}} to study medicine. This {{did not work}} out, and he headed for Lvov/Lemberg in Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, Isrulik or Der Alter Yisrulik (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be <b>gauged</b> from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E
5|$|Morphological {{studies have}} been {{inconclusive}} about the evolutionary relationships of the tasselled wobbegong, but overall have <b>gauged</b> it {{to be among the}} more derived wobbegong (Orectolobidae) species. A 2009 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found otherwise, that this species was in fact basal to all other wobbegongs except the northern wobbegong (O. wardi). This result supports the synonymization of Eucrossorhinus with Orectolobus. Molecular clock estimation placed the speciation of the tasselled wobbegong at 11–6 Ma, coinciding with a period of significant geological rearrangement and the formation of coral reef habitats in the region.|$|E

The Rhodesian Bush War suddenly re-erupted after two years of relative inactivity on 21 December 1972 when ZANLA attacked Altena Farm near Centenary in the country's north-east. The security forces mounted a strong counter-campaign and by the end of 1974 had reduced the number of guerrillas active within the country to under 300. In the period October–November 1974, the Rhodesians killed more nationalist fighters than in the previous two years combined.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the Anglican {{authorities}} officially disapproved of the singing of hymns in churches, other than metrical psalms, although there was considerable informal hymn-singing in parishes. Heber, according to the poet John Betjeman, was a professed admirer of the hymns of John Newton and William Cowper, {{and was one of the}} first High Church Anglicans to write his own. In all he wrote 57, mainly between 1811 and 1821. Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection, in which he proposed to include some by other writers. In October 1820 he sought help from the Bishop of London, William Howley, in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns, although he proposed to withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be <b>gauged.</b> Heber began preparing the publication, but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823. The collection was eventually published in 1827, after Heber's death, as Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year.|$|E
5|$|It {{was one of}} Warren's ships, the frigate HMS Arethusa, {{which first}} {{discovered}} the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on Arethusa miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships {{of the line and}} ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French. Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have <b>gauged</b> its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having only taken enough aboard for 15 days at sea in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier. On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet {{in the face of the}} supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.|$|E

40|$|Abstract] A supersymmetric {{model with}} U(1) <b>gauge</b> {{symmetry}} {{will be discussed}} in this paper. The model has strict U(1) <b>gauge</b> symmetry and supersymmetry simultaneously. Besides, there is a massive U(1) <b>gauge</b> field contained in the model. According to the conventional notion, if a system has strict <b>gauge</b> symmetry, the mass of <b>gauge</b> field in the lagrangian must be zero [1]. With the development of the <b>gauge</b> theory, this notion has already been changed. In the <b>gauge</b> theory developed by Wu [2], under the precondition that the system has strict <b>gauge</b> symmetry, the theory contains massive <b>gauge</b> bosons. In fact, this result holds not only in the usual quantum field theory, but also in the supersymmetric quantum field theory. In other words, we could construct a supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> field model with massive <b>gauge</b> bosons. Supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> field models have been extensively discussed in the literature [3 - 5]. Similar to the conventional <b>gauge</b> model, in all these supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> models, the masses of <b>gauge</b> fields is zero. In this paper, we will construct a <b>gauge</b> field model which has strict U(1) <b>gauge</b> symmetry, supersymmetry and one massive <b>gauge</b> field...|$|R
