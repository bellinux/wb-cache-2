5|$|Following {{the trial}} and conviction, Scrushy, Siegelman, and the {{prosecutors}} all indicated they would appeal. Scrushy and Seigelman vowed to appeal their convictions and sentences, while the prosecution announced its desire to appeal a judge's decision to remove charges of perjury from Scrushy's indictment. The prosecutors quickly <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> appeal, and United States Attorney Alice Martin indicated they had reconsidered.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an airdrop. The planes mistakenly <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E

5|$|At first, the Japanese bombers {{appeared}} {{to be trying to}} approach and attack Enterprise but turned toward Chicago after six Enterprise CAP fighters began to engage them. Four other CAP fighters chased the 751AG aircraft as they entered the anti-aircraft fire from Chicagos escorting destroyers. Two of the bombers were shot down before they could release their ordnance. Six more were shot down moments later, but not before they <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had been shot down and four were attempting to make a run for home. The remainder <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E

5|$|The French were {{initially}} opposed to Albani's election, but they quickly <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> opposition to him. He was elected unanimously on 23 November 1700. He was unsure {{whether he should}} accept the papacy {{due to the fact}} that he had nephews who he suspected would be angry if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept the papacy by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The T48 {{originated}} from an Anglo-American requirement for a self-propelled 6-pounder anti-tank gun. The requirement {{was met by}} emplacing a 57mm gun M1 – the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6-pounder – {{in the rear of}} an M3 Half-track. The first production batch was ordered in April 1942. The Americans <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer, the M10. Afterwards, it was intended solely to be supplied overseas {{under the terms of the}} Lend-Lease Program; the T48 was never officially type-classified.|$|E
5|$|Under heavy {{anti-aircraft}} fire, they <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> bombs. Although their crews reported hitting 4 ships, none of {{the bombs}} actually hit anything and no significant damage was inflicted. Early the following morning, the Japanese oil tanker Akebono Maru sustained the first hit when a torpedo from an attacking PBY struck her around 01:00. This was the only successful air-launched torpedo attack by the U.S. during the entire battle.|$|E

5|$|From 15:00, III./Kampfgeschwader 55 (KG 55) {{took off}} from Villacoublay led by Major Schlemell. It headed towards Southampton before {{diverting}} to bomb Royal Navy targets at Portland. British radar reported them as six intruders. There were actually more than 20 He 111s without fighter escort. They were intercepted by six Spitfires from No. 152 Squadron from RAF Warmwell. The bombers <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> ordnance but only five fell among naval installations causing minor damage. The RAF fighters claimed one destroyed and another damaged. KG 55 9 Staffel lost one He 111P-2 (one survivor) and 8 Staffel suffered one bomber damaged {{and one of the}} crew killed.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005, {{three men}} {{carrying}} guns {{broke into his}} home, removing any valuables. They {{asked if he was}} gay, and when he refused to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with murder in the furtherance of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them to life in prison with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar had {{previously}} signed a non-compete clause {{in order to}} be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010. However, he decided to challenge this ruling in court. WWE responded with a counterclaim after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling show in 2004. In July 2005, the two sides <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, their official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company. The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21, but did not get solved.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{the area}} to the east of the Jordan River garrisoned by the Ottoman Fourth Army, two Bristol Fighters {{reporting}} early in the day all Ottoman camps {{in the area}}, were quiet. After attacking a mass of cavalry at Ain es Sir they returned to base by flying over the Wadi Fara road. Here they <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> remaining bombs on a column of 50 motor lorries, moving eastwards along the road towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River. A direct hit on one of the lorries blocked the road and in the late afternoon another two Bristol Fighters continued this attack.|$|E
5|$|The carrier {{also contributed}} 3 Zeros {{to the total}} of 11 {{assigned}} to the initial CAP over the four carriers. By 07:05, the carrier had 6 fighters with the CAP which helped to defend the Kido Butai from the first US attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. At this time, Nagumo's carriers were attacked by 6 US Navy Grumman TBF Avengers from Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) and 4 USAAC Martin B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after Hiryū while the Marauders attacked Akagi. The 30 CAP Zeros {{in the air at}} this time, including the 6 from Hiryū, immediately attacked the American airplanes, shooting down 5 of the Avengers and 2 of the B-26s. The Avengers shot down 1 of Hiryūs Zeros. The surviving aircraft <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> torpedoes, but all missed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} of these {{occurred}} in Jayuya in {{what became known}} as El Grito de Jayuya (Jayuya Uprising). Nationalist leader Blanca Canales led the armed nationalists into the town and attacked the police station. A small battle with the police occurred; one officer was killed and three others were wounded before the rest <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> weapons and surrendered. The nationalists cut the telephone lines and burned the post office. Canales led the group into the town square where the illegal light blue version of the Puerto Rican Flag was raised (it was against the law to carry a Puerto Rican Flag from 1898 to 1952.) In the town square, Canales gave a speech and declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The town was held by the nationalists for three days.|$|E

5|$|The strikebreakers were escorted out of {{the city}} by the National Guard on November 8. They left by train to return to Chicago. The same day, the {{employees}} returned to work and normal operations resumed. There was a brief disturbance when pro-union employees refused to work on cars with non-union employees. Ralston immediately interceded in the dispute, and threatened to use the National Guard to run the streetcars until the Indiana Public Service Commission could resolve the dispute. The employees <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> objections and returned to work. The National Guard remained in the city until November 9 without incident. They demobilized on November 10.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{decision}} of the inquiry went against NESCo and those in support of the station, and the company <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> plans. NESCo received an ex gratia payment of £6,650 from the Ministry of Town and Country Planning for the expenditure incurred to that point. The site itself was inherited by the nationalised British Electricity Authority in 1948 and they eventually sold it. On 9 October 1945, Minister of Town and Country Planning Lewis Silkin made clear in the House of Commons that NESCo had begun extending their existing power stations by installing additional generating plant at sites other than Kepier, sufficing the demand for electricity, and meaning no station was needed at Kepier.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Nagumo's {{carriers}} {{were attacked}} by six US Navy Grumman TBF Avengers from Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) and four United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after Hiryū while the Marauders attacked Akagi. The 30 CAP Zeroes {{in the air at}} this time, including the 11 from Akagi, immediately attacked the American aircraft, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s. One of Akagis Zeroes, however, was shot down by defensive fire from the B-26s. Several of the Marauders <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> torpedoes, but all either missed or failed to detonate. One B-26, piloted by Lieutenant James Muri, strafed Akagi after dropping its torpedo, killing two men. Another, either attempting a suicide ramming, or out of control due to battle damage or an incapacitated pilot, narrowly missed crashing into Akagis bridge, where Nagumo was standing, before it cartwheeled into the sea.|$|E
