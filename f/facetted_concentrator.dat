40|$|The {{design of}} a solar dish {{concentrator}} is proposed based on triangular membrane facets for space power applications. The <b>facet</b> <b>concentrator</b> approximates a parabolic surface supported by a deployable perimeter truss structure, which originates from a large aperture space antenna. For optimizing the number of facets rows and focal-diameter ratio of the concentrator, Monte Carlo ray-tracing method is utilized to determine optical performance of the concentrator, and the system root-mean-square (RMS) deviation is considered in this design procedure. A 600 -facet concentrator with focal-diameter ratio of 1. 1 will achieve 83. 63 % of radiative collection efficiency over a 15 [*]cm radius disk located in the focal plane, with a mean solar concentration ratio exceeding 300.

We present a procedure {{to design a}} square <b>facet</b> <b>concentrator</b> for laboratory-scale research on medium-temperature thermal processes.

The Monte Carlo ray tracing method is used for analysis of the optical performance of the concentrator and to identify the set of geometric concentrator parameters that allow for flux characteristics suitable for medium and high-temperature applications.

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are provided for aligning the facets of a solar concentrator. A first laser directs a first laser beam onto a selected <b>facet</b> of the <b>concentrator</b> such that a target board positioned {{adjacent to the}} first laser at approximately one focal length behind {{the focal point of}} the concentrator is illuminated by the beam after reflection thereof off of the selected facet. A second laser, located adjacent to the vertex of the optical axis of the concentrator, is used to direct a second laser beam onto the target board at a target point thereon. By adjusting the selected facet to cause the first beam to illuminate the target point on the target board produced by the second beam, the selected facet can be brought into alignment with the target point.

40|$|Concentrated {{solar thermal}} energy can be {{utilized}} {{in a variety of}} high temperature applications for both terrestrial and space environments. In each application, knowledge of the collector and absorber's heat exchange interaction is required. To understand this coupled mechanism, various concentrator types and geometries, as well as, their relationship to the physical absorber mechanics were investigated. To conduct experimental tests various parts of a 5, 000 watt, thermal concentrator, facility were made and evaluated. This was in anticipation at a larger NASA facility proposed for construction. Although much of the work centered on solar thermal propulsion for an upper stage (less than one pound thrust range), the information generated and the facility's capabilities are applicable to material processing, power generation and similar uses. The numerical calculations used to design the laboratory mirror and the procedure for evaluating other solar collectors are presented here. The mirror design is based on a hexagonal faceted system, which uses a spherical approximation to the parabolic surface. The work began with a few two dimensional estimates and continued with a full, three dimensional, numerical algorithm written in FORTRAN code. This was compared to a full geometry, ray trace program, BEAM 4, which optimizes the curvatures, based on purely optical considerations. Founded on numerical results, the characteristics of a <b>faceted</b> <b>concentrator</b> were construed. The numerical methodologies themselves were evaluated and categorized. As a result, the three-dimensional FORTRAN code was the method chosen to construct the mirrors, due to its overall accuracy and superior results to the ray trace program. This information is being used to fabricate and subsequently, laser map the actual mirror surfaces. Evaluation of concentrator mirrors, thermal applications and scaling the results of the 10 foot diameter mirror to a much larger concentrator, were studied. Evaluations, recommendations and pit falls regarding the structure, materials and facility design are presented...|$|R

40|$|The Space Station will {{represent}} {{the first time}} that a solar dynamic power system will be used to generate electrical power in space. In a system such as this, sunlight is collected and focused by a solar concentrator onto the receiver of a heat engine which converts the energy into electricity. The concentrator must be capable of collecting and focusing as much of the incident sunlight as possible, and it must also withstand the atomic oxygen bombardment which occurs in low Earth orbit (LEO). This has led to the development of a system of thin film coatings applied to the <b>concentrator</b> <b>facet</b> surface in a chamber designed especially for this purpose.

To meet {{the goals of}} an optical test method {{that can be done}} in {{a relatively short period of}} time, requires little space, uses ``off the shelf`` test equipment, and provides a quantitative measure adequate to address quality control requirements, necessitates conversion of the system to use color.

40|$|An {{analysis}} was performed to predict the thermal distortion of the solar dynamic concentrator for Space Station Freedom in low earth orbit and to evaluate the effects of that thermal distortion on concentrator on-orbit performance. The analysis required substructural finite element modeling of critical concentrator structural subsystems, structural finite element modeling of the concentrator, mapping of thermal loading onto the structural finite element model, {{and the creation of}} specialized postprocessors to assist in interpreting results. Concentrator temperature distributions and thermally induced displacements and slope errors and the resulting receiver flux distribution profiles are discussed. Results determined for a typical orbit indicate that <b>concentrator</b> <b>facet</b> rotations are less than 0. 2 mrad and that the change in facet radius due to thermal flattening is less than 5 percent. The predicted power loss due to thermal distortion effects is less than 0. 3 percent. As a consequence the thermal distortions of the solar dynamic concentrator in low earth orbit will have a negligible effect on the flux distribution profiles within the receiver...|$|R
40|$|Off-axis {{radiation}} is radiation from any direction not {{parallel to the}} axis of the solar concentrator. It will be reflected to regions other than {{the focus of the}} parabolic concentrator and possibly concentrated there. Four types of off-axis radiation are discussed. These are: (1) small off-axis angles during walk-off; (2) large off-axis angles; (3) an extended off-axis source such as Earth albedo; and (4) miscellaneous off-axis sources including radio frequency sources and local point sources. A previous analytical study used a computer code named PIXEL to predict concentration of off-axis radiation and a previous experimental study used an 11 -m diameter multifaceted dish concentrator to validate the PIXEL analysis. The PIXEL code was limited in that it represented concentration by an ideal parabolic reflector of light from a point source. Another code named OFFSET has been developed to represent the solar concentrator being developed for Space Station Freedom. It is a detailed, ray tracing model which represents 50 ray originating points on the Sun and reflections from 10 points on each of the 456 <b>concentrator</b> <b>facets.</b> Results of this code are generally similar to the PIXEL results although there are small differences due to the more detailed representations of the Sun and concentrator that were used in the OFFSET code...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in non-fossil fuel based electricity generation {{has caused a}} prominent boost for the renewable energy sector, especially the field of Photovoltaics (PV) {{with one of the}} main reasons being the decrease in cost of PV electricity generation. However, over the last few years a saturation in the efficiency of solar cells have been reached leading into a renewed search for other means to further reduce the cost of electricity generation from photovoltaic sources. One of the technologies that has attracted a lot of attention is low concentration photovoltaics (LCPV). LCPV investigates an alternative strategy to replace costly semiconductor material with relatively cheap optical materials by developing a Low Concentration Photovoltaic (LCPV) module. A LCPV module is divided into three subsystems, namely, the optical, electrical and thermal subsystem. This study focussed on the design, construction and characterisation of an optical subsystem accompanied by a thorough investigation into the design of an electrical subsystem. A <b>facetted</b> parabolic <b>concentrator</b> using a vertical receiver was modelled and a first prototype was constructed having a geometric concentration factor of 6. 00 X. Upon electrical characterisation of this first vertical receiver LCPV prototype a concentration of only 4. 53 X (receiver 1) and 4. 71 X (receiver 2) was obtained. The first vertical receiver LCPV prototype did not reach the expected concentration factor due to optical losses and misalignment of optical elements. The illumination profile obtained from the reflector element was investigated and an undesirable non-uniform illumination profile was discovered. A second vertical receiver LCPV prototype was constructed in an attempt to improve on the first prototype, this second vertical receiver prototype had a geometrical concentration factor of 5. 80 X. The results indicated a much improved illumination profile, yet still containing a number of non-uniformities. The second vertical receiver LCPV module yielded an operational concentration factor of 5. 34 X. From the preliminary results obtained it was discovered that under concentrated illumination there was a limitation on the maximum power that could be obtained from the receiver. Upon further investigation it was discovered that this limitation was due to the higher current levels under concentrated illumination accompanied by a high series resistance of the receiver. This lead to the construction of new PV receivers, where this limitation could be minimised. 3 cell, 4 cell, 6 cell and 8 cell string configurations were constructed and used for the electrical characterisation of the prototypes. Due to non-uniformity of the illumination profile obtained from the second LCPV prototype a third vertical receiver LCPV prototype was constructed. This vertical receiver design illustrated more uniformity in the obtained illumination distribution and had a geometrical concentration factor of 4. 61 X, although under operation only 4. 26 X could be obtained. It is important to note that the geometric concentration factor does not account for reflective losses of the reflective material. One of the main reasons for the difficulty in obtaining a uniform illumination profile with the vertical receiver design is that the facetted reflector element is far away from the PV receiver. This enhances the effect of the slightest misalignment of any of the optical elements. This large distance also increases the effect of lensing from each facet. These factors lead to the consideration of a second design, which would counteract these factors. A horizontal receiver LCPV module design implementing a facetted parabolic reflector was considered to counteract these effects. From a mathematical model a horizontal receiver LCPV prototype was constructed having a geometrical concentration factor 5. 3 X. The optical characterisation of the illumination profile showed a much improved illumination profile, which was much more uniform than the previous illumination profiles obtained from the other LCPV prototypes. The uniformity of the illumination profile could be seen in results obtained from the electrical characterisation where the concentrator reached operational concentration factor of 5. 01 X. The reliability of the third vertical receiver LCPV prototype and the horizontal receiver LCPV prototype as well as the receivers were investigated by placing each receiver under stressed operational conditions for 60 sun hours. I-V characteristics were obtained after every five sun hours to investigate any signs of degradation. After 60 sun hours none of the receiver displayed any signs of degradation or reduction in electrical performanc...|$|R
