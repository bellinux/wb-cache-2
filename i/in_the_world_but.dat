The cold Labrador Current and the warm Gulf Stream meet on the Grand Banks, making the area not only one of the richest fishing grounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> also one of the foggiest areas. The Grand Banks are an area of significant petroleum production with Hibernia, White Rose and Terra Nova oil fields all located there.|$|E
5|$|Hamburg {{had once}} been Germany's main seaport, the fourth largest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> in 1943 {{virtually}} the entire city {{had been reduced to}} rubble by World War II bombing raids. By 1960, when they arrived, the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity. In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, Hamburg was a wealthy city.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{fishing is}} an {{important}} industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly {{from a series of}} events {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access to rich North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common Fisheries Policy put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet.|$|E

5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E

Ahmed Awad, who was the 2011 African and All-Africa Games champion, {{as well as the}} runner-up at the 2009 Mediterranean Games and a bronze medalist at the 2012 African Championships, earned a spot in the 66 kg event by being the highest ranked African in the division. He defeated Humaid Al-Derei of the United Arab Emirates before losing against Tarlan Karimov of Azerbaijan in the round of 16. Hussein Hafiz, who was the 2011 Pan Arab and 2012 African Champion, as well as the 2011 African runner-up and a bronze medalist at the 2009 and 2010 editions and the 2011 All-Africa Games, {{qualified for}} London by being ranked 18th in the world in the 73 kg class. He won his opening match against Osman Murillo Segura of Costa Rica before being defeated by France's Ugo Legrand, an eventual bronze medalist. Hesham Mesbah, who was Egypt's only medalist at the 2008 Summer Olympics, returned to the 90 kg division by being ranked 13th <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> was eliminated his first match, against Timur Bolat of Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Victoria against Queensland at the Gabba in 1940â€“41. In the first innings, he made 25 before being caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon from the bowling of Jack Ellis as the visitors took first innings {{points in a}} drawn match. In the next match, he made an impression. After making 35 in the first innings, he scored 70 in an hour's batting in the second innings at the SCG against New South Wales. In both innings, he was dismissed by leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, the leading bowler <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> Victoria managed to prevail by 24 runs. The teams met again three weeks later, and this time, New South Wales turned the table, winning by 235 runs. Harvey made 14 in the first innings, bowled by O'Reilly for the second innings in a row. In the second innings he made 38 before being removed by another leg spinner, Cec Pepper. Harvey ended the season with 182 runs at 36.40.|$|E

Coming into the 2012 Olympics he was ranked fourth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> lost in the opening round against Ihar Makarau of Belarus. The final judoka, Ramadan Darwish, had won every African championship in the 100kg class since 2009, was the 2009 Mediterranean champion and 2011 All-Africa Games runner-up, and had earned a bronze medal at the 2009 World Judo Championships. He qualified for the 100 kg event at the Olympic Games by being ranked ninth worldwide, but was defeated in his first match by France's Thierry Fabre.|$|E

5|$|The Budapest Gambit {{has never}} been widely used as Black by the top-ten chessplayers. Richard RÃ©ti used it five times in the period 1919â€“26 when {{he was among the}} ten best players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> he scored only 1Â½ points. Savielly Tartakower used it four times in 1928 when he was the eighth-best player in the world, {{including}} thrice in one tournament (Bad Kissingen 1928) but he scored only Â½ point against world-class opposition: Bogoljubov then ranked number four in the world, Capablanca ranked number two, and Rubinstein ranked number seven. Rudolf Spielmann used it thrice in 1922â€“23 when he was about number 9â€“12 in the world, with a win against Euwe but defeats against Yates and SÃ¤misch. Nigel Short played the gambit twice in the years 1992â€“93 when he was number7â€“11, scoring only Â½ points against Karpov (then ranked number two) and Ivanchuk (then ranked number three). Recently, Mamedyarov used it twice in 2004 (scoring 1Â½ with a win against Van Wely) when he was not already among the top-players, and six times in 2008 when he was about number 6â€“14; he scored five points with wins against former world champion Kramnik (then ranked number three), and grandmasters Tkachiev and Eljanov, but all six games took place in rapid or blitz events.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E
