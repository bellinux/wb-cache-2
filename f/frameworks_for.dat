5|$|He {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Marxist <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> analysing society, for instance in developing the belief that British colonialism had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed. However, he disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T. Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E
5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E

25|$|Behavioural change {{theories}} are not universally accepted. Criticisms include the theories' emphases on individual behaviour {{and a general}} disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour.

25|$|The {{scholarship}} of Jorge Ferrer introduces a more pluralistic and participatory perspective on spiritual and ontological dimensions. In his revision of transpersonal theory Ferrer questions three major presuppositions, or <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> interpretation, {{that have been}} dominant in transpersonal studies. These are the frameworks of Experientalism (the transpersonal understood as an individual inner experience); Inner empiricism (the study of transpersonal phenomena according {{to the standards of}} empiricist science); and perennialism (the legacy of the perennial philosophy in transpersonal studies). Although representing important frames of reference for the initial study of transpersonal phenomena, Ferrer believes that these assumptions have become limiting and problematic {{for the development of the}} field.|$|E

25|$|The Am Yisrael Foundation's {{activities}} were launched in 2007 by Jay M. Shultz, a Fair Lawn, New Jersey-born entrepreneur. Shultz moved to Israel from New York City in 2006, {{and settled in}} Tel Aviv. Concerned about mounting assimilation among young Jews, {{he was convinced that}} Aliyah offered part of the solution. Yet he found Tel Aviv lacking in social and cultural <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> young English-speaking adults who took this step. To address this lacuna and further his idea of modern-day Zionist pioneering in Israel, he launched a series of social entrepreneurial initiatives focusing on the Tel Aviv area. The Am Yisrael Foundation as the umbrella organization under which these programs operate was formally established in 2013 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.|$|E
25|$|He rose to {{prominence}} with his studies of Islamic decoration at the Alhambra, {{and the associated}} publication of his drawings, which pioneered new standards in chromolithography. Jones was a pivotal figure {{in the formation of}} the South Kensington Museum (later to become the V) through his close association with Henry Cole, the museum's first director, and another key figure in 19th century design reform. Jones was also responsible for the interior decoration and layout of exhibits for the Great Exhibition building of 1851, and for its later incarnation at Sydenham. Jones advised on the foundation collections for the South Kensington museum, and formulated decorative arts principles which became teaching <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> the Government School of Design, then at Marlborough House. These design propositions also formed the basis for his seminal publication, The Grammar of Ornament, the global and historical design sourcebook for which Jones is perhaps best known today.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, {{mathematical}} logic has both contributed to, {{and has been}} motivated by, the study of foundations of mathematics. This study {{began in the late}} 19th century with the development of axiomatic <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> geometry, arithmetic, and analysis. In the early 20th century it was shaped by David Hilbert's program to prove the consistency of foundational theories. Results of Kurt G√∂del, Gerhard Gentzen, and others provided partial resolution to the program, and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency. Work in set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of sets, although there are some theorems that cannot be proven in common axiom systems for set theory. Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics often focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in particular formal systems (as in reverse mathematics) rather than trying to find theories in which all of mathematics can be developed.|$|E
