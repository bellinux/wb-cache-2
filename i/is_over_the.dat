5|$|Modern Macedonian language, a south Slavic language, is {{unrelated}} to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes. The first <b>is</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> name (alternative ways of referring to this language {{can be found in}} the terminology by group section and in the article Macedonian language naming dispute). The second dispute <b>is</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a {{horseshoe}} to the Devil's foot when he {{was asked}} to re-shoe the Devil's cloven hoof. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe <b>is</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.|$|E
5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process <b>is</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> male dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} girl talking about what she wants in her next boyfriend while on some bleachers. After her {{monologue}} <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> video cuts between shots of Eric Church and scenes of the girl and a boy during various high points and low points in their relationship. Church is seen throughout the video either playing with his band in a garage, {{in the middle of}} the street on a piano, or walking through the streets with an American flag around his shoulders while singing. The video ends without showing whether the girl and boy ended up together.|$|E
5|$|When {{breeding}} <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> {{black-necked grebe}} usually partakes in a moult migration to saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes {{with large numbers}} of invertebrate prey, so that it can fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult {{until the end of the}} moult migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling to places such as Mono Lake.|$|E
5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all of the cards the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E

5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball Saver, which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game <b>is</b> <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball Saver or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act <b>is</b> <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E

5|$|The {{number and}} names of hells, {{as well as}} the type of sinners sent to a {{particular}} hell, varies from text to text; however, many scriptures describe 28 hells. After death, messengers of Yama called Yamadutas bring all beings to the court of Yama, where he weighs the virtues and the vices of the being and passes a judgement, sending the virtuous to Svarga (heaven) and the sinners to one of the hells. The stay in Svarga or Naraka is generally described as temporary. After the quantum of punishment <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> souls are reborn as lower or higher beings as per their merits. In a few texts, hell is described as a bottomless pit of darkness where souls are trapped for eternity and deprived of rebirth.|$|E
5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E
5|$|Abi and Babe {{discover}} that Ben's half sister Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) {{has been using}} Phil's credit card, so they force her to return everything she has bought. Babe asks Abi for a favour, but Abi realises that Babe has already assumed that she would say yes, so calls Babe a user. As revenge, Babe sends Ben a letter, telling him of the fake pregnancy. Louise finds the letter and blackmails Abi, telling her to move away with Ben. Abi tries to persuade Ben into moving but he refuses, saying {{he needs to be}} there for alcoholic Phil, and Abi tells Louise that Ben will always believe his girlfriend over his sister. Abi tells Babe that she is worried that Ben will find out, so Babe suggests that Abi tells Ben the truth. However, Abi allows Louise to continue using Phil's credit card. Later, Abi catches Ben and Louise arguing and assumes it <b>is</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> letter, and she inadvertently reveals she was never pregnant, but Ben was referring to Phil's credit card. In The Vic, Ben gets drunk and kisses Abi in the toilets and starts to undress her, but then drags her into the pub in her underwear and reveals via the karaoke microphone that she made up her pregnancy. Abi is humiliated and is taken to Dot Branning's (June Brown) house by her uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), however, an enraged Phil takes her away in his car, but is stopped by Jay, who insists that enough people have been hurt. When Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) confesses to killing Lucy, Max is released, but refuses to see Abi or Lauren.|$|E

5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask <b>is</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E
