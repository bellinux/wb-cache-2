5|$|Like {{many other}} young physicists, Rabi was closely {{following}} momentous events in Europe. He was astounded by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced {{him of the}} validity of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, he set out to extend the Schrödinger <b>equation</b> to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that none of them could solve the resulting <b>equation,</b> a second-order partial differential <b>equation.</b> Rabi found the answer in a book by the 19th-century mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The <b>equation</b> had the form of a hypergeometric <b>equation</b> to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to Physical Review, which published it in 1927.|$|E
