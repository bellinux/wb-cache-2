40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDanny H. RogersCenter pivot {{irrigation}} systems {{are used in}} crop production across the state of Kansas. The American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) standard on uniformity testing of a center pivot system calls for collectors {{to be used to}} measure the water depth emitted by the irrigation system. The standard was designed without specially considering the low pressure sprinklers now commonly used on center pivot systems; the recommended collectors may not accurately measure the applied depth from these sprinklers. The collector size effect on measured water depth and measured depth variability was studied for spinning <b>plate,</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>plate,</b> and wobbling plate sprinkler systems. Five different collector sizes (C 2 (5. 5 cm), C 4 (10. 0 cm), C 6 (14. 8 cm), C 8 (20. 0 cm), and C 10 (27. 4 cm)) were studied using four 5 x 5 Latin squares. Each collector’s water depth was measured and statistically analyzed. Two analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the collector size effect were reported. Past experimental results were compared to this experiment’s results. The ANOVA for the measured water depth reported no collector size effect for the spinning plate and wobbling plate systems. The ANOVA of the variability of measured depths showed significant differences between collector sizes for the spinning plate system but not for the wobbling plate system. Previous studies of spinning plate and wobbling plate systems reported acceptable variability for all collector sizes. Although some collector sizes measured significantly different mean depths, the numerical difference in mean depths was small. Any studied collector size could be used to measure the water depth of wobbling plate systems, but the C 4 collector is ideal. C 4 and C 6 collectors are ideal for measuring spinning plate systems. Significant differences between measured depths were reported for the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> system. The C 10 measured significantly lower water depths than all other collectors, and the C 4 collector measured lower depths than the C 2 and C 8 collectors. The variability of mean depths was similar and high for all collector sizes. Previous experiments also indicated that different collector sizes measured different depths and had high variability of depth measurements for the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> sprinkler systems. The distinct stream pattern provides a challenge for accurately measuring the water depth with these collector sizes; other methods of measuring uniformity should be considered for <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> sprinklers...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} fluid mediated effective {{interactions in}} a confined film geometry, between two rigid, no-slip plates, {{where one of}} the plates is mobile and subjected to a random external forcing with zero average. The fluid is assumed to be compressible and viscous, and the external surface forcing to be of small amplitude, thus enabling a linear hydrodynamic analysis. While the transverse and longitudinal hydrodynamic stresses (forces per unit area) acting on either of the plates vanish on average, they exhibit significant fluctuations that can be quantified through their equal-time, two-point correlators. For transverse (shear) stresses, the same-plate correlators on both the fixed and the mobile plates, and also the cross-plate correlator, exhibit decaying power-law behaviors as functions of the inter-plate separation with universal exponents: At small separations, the exponents are given by - 1 in all cases, while at large separations the exponents are found to be larger, differing in magnitude, viz., - 2 (for the same-plate correlator on the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate),</b> - 4 (for the excess same-plate correlator on the mobile plate) and - 3 (for the cross-plate correlator). For longitudinal (compressional) stresses, we find much weaker power-law decays with exponents - 3 / 2 (for the excess same-plate correlator on the mobile plate) and - 1 (for the cross-plate correlator) in the large inter-plate separation regime. The same-plate stress correlator on the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> increases and saturates on increase of the inter-plate separation, reflecting the non-decaying nature of the longitudinal forces acting on the <b>fixed</b> <b>plate.</b> The qualitative differences between the transverse and longitudinal stress correlators stem from the distinct nature of the shear and compression modes as, for instance, the latter exhibit acoustic propagation and, hence, relatively large fluctuations across the fluid film.

40|$|Holographic optical {{elements}} (HOE) {{can be used}} {{to reflect}} the direct (beam) sunlight incident on a window whilst allowing the diffuse light to pass through. This is achieved with a semi-transparent hologram, which enables solar control of a building without reducing the benefit of a window or facade to the occupants. Domestic conservatories represent an interesting potential market for such a product. Conservatories and sunrooms by their very nature have large expanses of glass and so are prone to periods of unacceptably high solar gain during the summer months. Currently, blinds or other opaque shading devices are used to reduce the solar gain but this is at the expense of daylighting. This paper describes the potential application of solar control HOE applied as either a <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> or tracked solution. The performance of such systems for the UK climate is predicted using transient thermal analysis simulation of commonly used UK conservatories. The benefit of selective HOE glazing of specific elevations within a conservatory is considered to achieve 'peak clipping' of daytime temperatures to an acceptable level. The simulations predict that reductions of up to 17 degrees are possible with fully tracked HOE applied to all the elevations of a typical conservatory design. Selective use of <b>fixed</b> <b>plate</b> HOE glazing, can achieve a temperature reduction of 6. 1 degrees when only 62 % of the glazing within a conservatory is replaced...|$|R
