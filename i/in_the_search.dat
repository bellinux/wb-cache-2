The ship's bow was not designed to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually fix wood planks to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane.

Too slow to follow Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock's cruisers, she missed the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, where Cradock was defeated.
