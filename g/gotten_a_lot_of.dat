[...] "Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus" [...] was among the episodes featured in a 2006 list by the Winnipeg Free Press of the ten most memorable South Park episodes. The Toronto Sun listed the episode {{as one of the most}} memorable television moments of 1998, and the single most memorable moment from the month of April. The prank played by the airing of this episode was revisited a number of times in subsequent episodes. The episode [...] "Cartoon Wars Part II" [...] revisits it by appearing to begin with a similar spoof, though the episode then cuts to the actual plot.

2500|$|After {{the teasing}} of the Nick–Jess {{relationship}} in the first season, critics named Jake Johnson the breakout star of season 2 as the characters' romance unfolded. Saying that [...] "Not since Ross and Rachel's tango on Friends has watching a comedy romance been so satisfying", The Hollywood Reporter said the producers [...] "did the impossible by engaging their leads in a love story, which only strengthened the artistry of the single-cam comedy". The New York Times said season 2 [...] "erupted in fantastic and bizarre fits and starts" [...] because of the characters' unmatched personalities, and lauded the writers for not playing up the will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. By emphasing how the characters got together, the show [...] "made for hilarious setups [...] to high-level Abbott and Costello slapstick. They have a modern love. [...] Together, they are fully functional. They make each other human." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan was unconcerned about getting Jess and Nick together, as because of immaturity [...] "they're bound to keep on {{making a lot of}} amusing and painful mistakes, sometimes with each other. Those choices can be both hilarious and sad, and New Girl has <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> mileage out of both those areas." [...] The continued Nick–Jess relationship was criticized in season 3 for dropping the characters' personalities, lack of tension, and for neglecting the show's female friendship between Jess and Cece. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt that {{during the first half of}} season 3 that [...] "bringing them together caused that [...] spark [...] to diminish", while Hitfix Alan Sepinwall and The A.V. Club David Sims found that the show's perceived decline in quality had less to do with the Nick–Jess relationship but with the handling of Schmidt's cheating arc and the re-introduction of Coach.|$|E

Both of those books have <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> play in the 'mainstream' press; they've been written up in The New York Times for instance... It's that kind of more adult material that will help us break out of the sort of superhero-bound, direct-sales specialty market.
