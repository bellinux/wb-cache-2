40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Drug</b> <b>delivery</b> systems, {{particularly}} nanomaterial-based <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> systems, {{possess a}} tremendous amount of potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of <b>drugs.</b> Controlled <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>targeted</b> to a specific disease is designed to significantly improve the pharmaceutical effects of drugs and reduce their side effects. Unfortunately, only a few <b>targeted</b> <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> systems can achieve high targeting efficiency after intravenous injection, even with the development of numerous surface markers and targeting modalities. Thus, alternative drug and nanomedicine targeting approaches are desired. Circulating cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, and stem cells, present innate disease sensing and homing properties. Hence, using living cells as <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> carriers has gained increasing interest in recent years. This review highlights the recent advances in the design of cell-mediated <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> systems and <b>targeting</b> mechanisms.

40|$|Development of {{improved}} drug and gene delivery systems {{directly into the}} lungs is highly desirable given the important burden of respiratory diseases. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of liposomes composed of photopolymerized lipids (1, 2 -bis-(tricosa- 10, 12 -diynoyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine) associated with amino acids as vectors for gene delivery into the lungs of healthy animals. Lipopolymer vesicles, in particular, are more stable than other types of liposomes. In this study, lipopolymers were associated with L-arginine, L-tryptophan, or L-cysteine. We hypothesized that the addition of these amino acids would enhance the efficacy of gene delivery to the lungs by the lipopolymers. L-Arginine showed the highest association efficiency due to its positive charge and better surface interactions. None of the formulations caused inflammation or altered lung mechanics, suggesting that these lipopolymers can be safely administered as aerosols. All formulations were able to induce eGFP mRNA expression in lung tissue, but the addition of amino acids reduced delivery efficacy {{when compared with the}} simple lipopolymer particle.

Doxorubicin (DOX) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASOND) -loaded polymer nanoparticles were prepared in water by a gelation process. Particle characterization, drug loading, and drug release were evaluated. To verify drug delivery efficiency in vitro experiments on a breast cancer cell line (T 47 D) were performed. EGFR gene and protein expression was analyzed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. A loading percentage of 63 % ± 5 % for ASOND and 70 % ± 5 % for DOX was achieved. Drug release data after 15 hours showed that ASOND and DOX were completely released from chitosan-based particles while a lower and more sustained release of only 22 % ± 8 % was measured for thiolated particles. In a cytosol simulated release medium/reducing environment, such as found intracellularly, polymer-based nanoparticles dissociated, liberating approximately 50 % of both active substances within 7 hours. ASOND-loaded polymer nanoparticles had higher stability and high mucoadhesive properties.

Subsequent synthetic steps were i) functionalization of [Pt(IV) Cl(OH) 2 (terpy) ]+ in the axial position with succinic anhydride to obtain [Pt(IV) Cl(OH) (succinato) (terpy) ]+, and ii) reaction of the latter with nonporous silica nanoparticles (SNPs) with an external shell containing primary amino groups to obtain a nanovector able to transport the Pt(IV) antitumor prodrug in form of conjugate Pt-SNP.

The quest for enhanced magnetic nanomaterials of different shapes, magnetic properties, or surface coatings continues for applications in <b>drug</b> <b>delivery,</b> <b>targeting</b> therapies, biosensing, and magnetic separation. In this context, the use of simple in vivo models, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, to biologically evaluate nanoparticles is currently in increasing demand as it offers low-cost and information-rich experiments. In this work, we evaluated how surface modification (citrate- and protein-coated) of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (C-SPIONs and BSA-SPIONs, respectively) induces changes in their toxicological profile and biodistribution using the animal model C. elegans and combining techniques from materials science and biochemistry. The acute toxicity and nanoparticle distribution were assessed in two populations of worms (adults and larvae) treated with both types of SPIONs. After 24 h treatment, nanoparticles were localized in the alimentary system of C. elegans; acute toxicity was stronger in adults and larvae exposed to C-SPIONs rather than BSA-SPIONs. Adult uptake was similar for both SPION types, whereas uptake in larvae was dependent on the surface coating, being higher for BSA-SPIONs. Nanoparticle size was evaluated upon excretion, and a slight size decrease was found. Interestingly, all results indicate the protective effects of the BSA to prevent degradation of the nanoparticles and decrease acute toxicity to the worms, especially at high concentrations. We argue that this relevant information on the chemistry and toxicity of SPIONs in vivo could not be gathered using more classical in vitro approaches such as cell culture assays, thus endorsing the potential of C. elegans to assess nanomaterials at early stages of their synthetic formulations. C. elegans N 2 and E. coli OP 50 were provided by the CGC, which is funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P 40 OD 010440).

As {{a starting point for}} innovation, we designed a hybrid NP system combining the benefits of liposomes and polymeric NPs. These particles have a polymeric surface which displays targeting ligands while avoiding macrophage uptake. A liposome-like layer provides in vivo biocompatibility and a hydrophobic core allows for high-capacity small molecule <b>drug</b> <b>delivery.</b> <b>Targeting</b> ligands that bind injured vasculature were discovered and optimized by screening an M 13 bacteriophage library (109 independent clones) against collagen IV, the major component of the basement membrane. Relative binding affinities using ELISA identified the lead targeting candidate, which bound with 900 -fold greater relative affinity to collagen IV when compared with the unselected library. The selected peptide sequence was synthesized and tested for its ability to actively target the hybrid NP system. Paclitaxel, an anti-proliferative drug, was chosen as the delivered pharmaceutical. Drug release was modified through a slow-eluting paclitaxel conjugate using controlled ester hydrolysis (drug release - 10 - 12 days in vitro). To test these targeted NPs, injured vasculature was approximated using an aortic smooth muscle culture embedded on a collagen IV matrix. In this setting, the hybrid NPs showed clear evidence of increased potency using the selected ligands. In experimental animal models of surgery-induced vascular injury, targeted NPs showed a four-fold improved retention at angioplastied aortas over intact aortas ex vivo. Targeted NPs were tested as intraarterially delivered therapy to angioplastied carotid arteries in vivo and showed a two-fold better localization at injury sites versus scrambled-peptide and non-targeted NPs. Targeted NPs were also tested using a systemic, intravenous infusion administered postprocedure on Day I and 6 and resulted in lower neointima-to-media (N/M) scores at two weeks compared to FDA-approved Taxol@ and injury-only groups (N/Msham= - 249 + 0. 046, vs. N/MTaxol= 0. 837 ± 0. 087, N/MNP= 0. 749 ± 0. 136 and N/MPep-NP= 0. 662 ± 0. 169, all P < 0. 01 vs. injury-only, mean ± SEM, n= 5). These findings indicate that complex, multilayered NPs can functionally target and treat injured vasculature, a clinical problem of primary importance. by Juliana Maria Chan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux {{membrane}} transporter, {{is widely}} {{distributed throughout the}} body and is responsible for limiting cellular uptake {{and the distribution of}} xenobiotics and toxic substances. Hundreds of structurally diverse therapeutic agents are substrates to it and it impedes the absorption, permeability, and retention of the drugs, extruding them out of the cells. It is overexpressed in cancer cells and accountable for obstructing cell internalization of chemotherapeutic agents and for developing transporter mediated resistance by cancer cells during anti-tumor treatments. As it jeopardizes the success of <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> and cancer <b>targeting,</b> strategies are being developed to overcome P-gp mediated drug transport. This concise review represents a brief discussion on P-gp mediated drug transport and how it hinders the success of various therapies. Its main focus is on various strategies used to tackle this curb in the field of <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> and <b>targeting...</b>|$|R

40|$|A novel {{design of}} a multi-drug {{delivery}} network and diagnosis using a molecular network is proposed. By using a pair of tweezers to generate the intense optical vortices within the PANDA ring resonator, the required molecules (drug volumes) can be trapped and moved dynamically within the molecular bus networks, in which the required <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>targets</b> can be achieved within the network. The advantage of the proposed system is that the diagnostic method can be used within a tiny system (thin film device or circuit), which is available as an embedded device for diagnostic use in patients. In practice, the large molecular networks such as ring, star, and bus networks can be integrated to form a large <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> system. The channel spacing of the trapped volumes (molecules) within the bus molecular networks can be provided by using the appropriate free spectrum range, which is analyzed and discussed {{in the terms of}} crosstalk effects. In this work, crosstalk effects of about 0. 1 % are noted, which can be neglected and does not affect the network stability...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{nanotechnology}} is {{the latest}} trend in cancer therapy. It helps the pharmacist to formulate the product with maximum therapeutic value and minimum or negligible range side effects. Cancer is the disease in which the abnormal cells are quite similar to the normal cell with just minute functional or genetic change. Thus, {{it is very hard}} to target the abnormal cells by the conventional method of the <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> system. Nanotechnology is probably the only method that can be used for site-specific action without causing the side effects by killing the normal cells. This review article describes the possible way to exploit the nanotechnology to targeted drug therapy in cancer. The various methods used are: systemic <b>delivery</b> systems, passive <b>targeting,</b> active <b>targeting,</b> intracellular <b>delivery,</b> subcellular localization, and nanoparticle drugs. Different cancer detection techniques like carbon nanotubes, nanorods, and biosensors are also available.
