5|$|<b>Interferometric</b> {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate <b>interferometric</b> fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|Altair rotates rapidly, with a {{velocity}} at {{the equator}} of approximately 286km/s. This {{is a significant}} fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other <b>interferometric</b> studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an <b>interferometric</b> radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|Since then, many {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} measuring such dragging coefficients, often {{in combination with the}} Sagnac effect. For instance, in experiments using ring lasers together with rotating disks, or in neutron <b>interferometric</b> experiments. Also a transverse dragging effect was observed, i.e. when the medium is moving at right angles to the direction of the incident light.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in December 2000, the star's diameter was measured with the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) at mid-infrared wavelengths producing a limb-darkened estimate of 55.2±0.5milliarcseconds (mas)—a figure entirely consistent with Michelson's findings eighty years earlier. At the time of its publication, the estimated parallax from the Hipparcos mission was 7.63 ± 1.64mas, yielding an estimated radius for Betelgeuse of 3.6AU. However, an infrared <b>interferometric</b> {{study published}} in 2009 announced that the star had shrunk by 15% since 1993 at an increasing rate without a significant diminution in magnitude. Subsequent observations suggest that the apparent contraction may be due to shell activity in the star's extended atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Observations of binary pulsars provide strong {{indirect}} {{evidence for the}} existence of gravitational waves (see Orbital decay, above). Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the <b>interferometric</b> detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the long {{secondary}} periods is unknown, but they certainly aren't due to radial pulsations. <b>Interferometric</b> observations of Betelgeuse have shown hotspots that {{are thought to be}} created by massive convection cells, a significant fraction of the diameter of the star and each emitting 5–10% of the total light of the star. One theory to explain long secondary periods is that they are caused by the evolution of such cells combined with the rotation of the star. Other theories include close binary interactions, chromospheric magnetic activity influencing mass loss, or non-radial pulsations such as g-modes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the star's diameter, questions have arisen about the complex dynamics of Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. The mass that makes up galaxies is recycled as stars are formed and destroyed, and red supergiants are major contributors, yet {{the process by which}} mass is lost remain a mystery. With advances in <b>interferometric</b> methodologies, astronomers may be close to resolving this conundrum. In July 2009, images released by the European Southern Observatory, taken by the ground-based Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), showed a vast plume of gas extending 30AU from the star into the surrounding atmosphere. This mass ejection was equal to the distance between the Sun and Neptune and is one of multiple events occurring in Betelgeuse's surrounding atmosphere. Astronomers have identified at least six shells surrounding Betelgeuse. Solving the mystery of mass loss in the late stages of a star's evolution may reveal those factors that precipitate the explosive deaths of these stellar giants.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, <b>interferometric</b> signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E

25|$|This way, besides {{providing}} the <b>interferometric</b> gain, the asymmetric interferometer utilized in nano-FTIR also completely eliminates the multiplicative background, which otherwise {{could be a}} source of various artifacts and is often overlooked in other s-SNOM based spectroscopies.|$|E
25|$|Deformation sensing: Satellite-borne spatial radar {{data can}} be used to detect {{long-term}} geometric changes in the volcanic edifice, such as uplift and depression. In this method, <b>interferometric</b> synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), digital elevation models generated from radar imagery are subtracted from each other to yield a differential image, displaying rates of topographic change.|$|E
25|$|By {{the modern}} definition, the term binary star is {{generally}} restricted to pairs of stars which revolve around a common center of mass. Binary stars {{which can be}} resolved with a telescope or <b>interferometric</b> methods are known as visual binaries. For most of the known visual binary stars one whole revolution has not been observed yet, they are observed to have travelled along a curved path or a partial arc.|$|E
25|$|Denebola is a {{relatively}} young star with an age estimated at less than 400million years. <b>Interferometric</b> observations give a radius that is about 173% that of the Sun. However, {{the high rate of}} rotation results in an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge. It has 75% more mass than the Sun, which results in a much higher overall luminosity and a shorter life span on the main sequence.|$|E
25|$|Some amateur {{telescope}} makers use {{a similar}} test called a Ronchi test that replaces the knife edge with a grating comprising several fine parallel wires or an etching on a glass plate. Other tests used include the Gaviola or Caustic test which can measure mirrors of fast f/ratio more accurately, and home-brew <b>Interferometric</b> testing made possible {{in recent years}} by affordable lasers, digital cameras (such as webcams), and computers.|$|E
25|$|Warning {{systems can}} detect {{avalanches}} which develop slowly, such as ice avalanches caused by icefalls from glaciers. <b>Interferometric</b> Radars, high-resolution Cameras, or motion sensors can monitor instable areas {{over a long}} term, lasting from days to years.

Such systems (e.g. the monitoring of the Weissmies glacier in Switzerland) can recognize events several days in advance.|$|E
25|$|The {{telescope}} is operated {{in a global}} network with other large radio telescopes {{around the world in}} order to create an <b>interferometric</b> array.

25|$|The {{predictions}} of Ritz's version of emission theory {{were consistent with}} almost all terrestrial <b>interferometric</b> tests save those involving the propagation of light in moving media, and Ritz did not consider the difficulties presented by tests such as the Fizeau experiment to be insurmountable. Tolman, however, noted that a Michelson–Morley experiment using an extraterrestrial light source could provide a decisive test of the Ritz hypothesis. In 1924, Rudolf Tomaschek performed a modified Michelson–Morley experiment using starlight, while Dayton Miller used sunlight. Both experiments were inconsistent with the Ritz hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Starting from white-light {{interferometry}} for in vivo ocular eye measurements imaging {{of biological}} tissue, {{especially of the}} human eye, was investigated by multiple groups worldwide. A first two-dimensional in vivo depiction of a human eye fundus along a horizontal meridian based on white light <b>interferometric</b> depth scans {{was presented at the}} ICO-15 SAT conference in 1990. Further developed in 1990 by Naohiro Tanno, then a professor at Yamagata University, and in particular since 1991 by Huang et al., in Prof. James Fujimoto laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, optical coherence tomography (OCT) with micrometer resolution and cross-sectional imaging capabilities has become a prominent biomedical tissue-imaging technique; it is particularly suited to ophthalmic applications and other tissue imaging requiring micrometer resolution and millimeter penetration depth. First in vivo OCT images – displaying retinal structures – were published in 1993 and first endoscopic images in 1997.|$|E
25|$|In 1868, Fizeau {{noted that}} the purpose of the {{arrangement}} of mirrors or glass lenses in a conventional telescope was simply to provide an approximation to a Fourier transform of the optical wave field entering the telescope. As this mathematical transformation was well understood and could be performed mathematically on paper, he noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array— a technique which later became known as astronomical interferometry. It was not until 1891 that Albert A. Michelson successfully used this technique for the measurement of astronomical angular diameters: the diameters of Jupiter's satellites (Michelson 1891). Thirty years later, a direct <b>interferometric</b> measurement of a stellar diameter was finally realized by Michelson & Francis G. Pease (1921) which was applied by their 20ft (6.1 m) interferometer mounted on the 100 inch Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interferometric</b> {{detectors}} {{are limited}} at high frequencies by shot noise, which occurs because the lasers produce photons randomly; one analogy is to rainfall—the rate of rainfall, like the laser intensity, is measurable, but the raindrops, like photons, fall at random times, causing fluctuations around the average value. This leads to noise at {{the output of}} the detector, much like radio static. In addition, for sufficiently high laser power, the random momentum transferred to the test masses by the laser photons shakes the mirrors, masking signals of low frequencies. Thermal noise (e.g., Brownian motion) is another limit to sensitivity. In addition to these 'stationary' (constant) noise sources, all ground-based detectors are also limited at low frequencies by seismic noise and other forms of environmental vibration, and other 'non-stationary' noise sources; creaks in mechanical structures, lightning or other large electrical disturbances, etc. may also create noise masking an event or may even imitate an event. All these {{must be taken into account}} and excluded by analysis before detection may be considered a true gravitational wave event.|$|E
500|$|Interferometers and <b>interferometric</b> {{techniques}} may {{be categorized}} {{by a variety}} of criteria: ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Interferometric</b> {{measurements}} of stellar positions {{over the course}} of the mission would have permitted SIM to precisely measure the distances between stars throughout the Milky Way.

500|$|The angular {{diameter}} of Altair was measured interferometrically by R. Hanbury Brown {{and his co-workers}} at Narrabri Observatory in the 1960s. [...] They found a {{diameter of}} 3milliarcseconds. Although Hanbury Brown et al. realized that Altair would be rotationally flattened, they had insufficient data to experimentally observe its oblateness. [...] Altair was later observed to be flattened by infrared <b>interferometric</b> measurements made by the Palomar Testbed Interferometer in 1999 and 2000. This work was published by G. T. van Belle, David R. Ciardi and their co-authors in 2001.|$|E

Experiments were conducted in Antarctica to determine how [...] snow could affect its readings, and to provide data for calibrating the satellite. In January 2007 the European Space Agency issued a request for proposals for further calibration and validation experiments. Further CryoVEx experiments were conducted on Svalbard in 2007, followed by a final expedition to Greenland and the Devon Ice Cap in 2008.

[...] This was the first <b>interferometric</b> measurement of any object outside the Solar System. [...] A high-precision orbit was published in 1994 based on observations by the Mark III Stellar Interferometer, again at Mount Wilson Observatory. [...] Capella also became the first astronomical object to be imaged by a separate element optical interferometer when it was imaged by the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope in September 1995.|$|E
500|$|Simplified {{geophysical}} {{models of}} Mauna Loa's magma chamber have been constructed, using <b>interferometric</b> {{synthetic aperture radar}} measures of ground deformation due to the slow buildup of lava under the volcano's surface. These models predict a [...] wide magma chamber located {{at a depth of}} about , [...] below sea level, near the southeastern margin of Mokuʻāweoweo. This shallow magma chamber is significantly higher-placed than Mauna Loa's rift zones, suggesting magma intrusion into the deeper and occasional dike injections into the shallower parts of the rift zone drive rift activity; a similar mechanism has been proposed for neighboring Kīlauea. Earlier models based on Mauna Loa's two most recent eruptions made a similar prediction, placing the chamber at [...] deep in roughly the same geographic position.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the advent}} of laser technology, {{coherent}} radio sources were used for interferometry measurements {{of the speed of}} light. However <b>interferometric</b> determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry. This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (which later became NIST). They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with a [...] fractional uncertainty of [...]|$|E
500|$|Between 1954 and 1957, nine Avro Arrow models, scaled at one-eighth size {{or about}} [...] long, are {{believed}} to have been launched, using rockets, over Lake Ontario from Point Petre in Prince Edward County, Ontario as part of the process for testing the hull design. (Two others were launched in Virginia.) They travelled at supersonic speeds as onboard sensors sent data back to shore. After many attempts to find the models, a new search was started in late July 2017. The Raise the Arrow project was a joint venture by several companies, the Canadian Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian Military Institute. A Thunderfish autonomous submarine, equipped with an AquaPix <b>interferometric</b> synthetic aperture sonar, was being used to survey the relevant area of the lake bottom.

500|$|The modern {{monitoring}} system on Mauna Loa is constituted {{not only by}} its locally seismic network but also {{of a large number}} of GPS stations, tiltmeters, and strainmeters that have been anchored on the volcano to monitor ground deformation due to swelling in Mauna Loa's subterranean magma chamber, which presents a more complete picture of the events proceeding eruptive activity. The GPS network is the most durable and wide-ranging of the three systems, while the tiltmeters provide the most sensitive predictive data, but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation; nonetheless a survey line across the caldera measured a [...] increase in its width over the year preceding the 1975 eruption, and a similar increase in 1984 eruption.

500|$|Michelson and Morley (1887) {{and other}} early experimentalists using <b>interferometric</b> {{techniques}} {{in an attempt}} to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental temperature control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even though the interferometer might be set up in a basement. Since the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, it would be easy for an observer to [...] "get lost" [...] when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length. This was an early example of the use of white light to resolve the [...] "2pi ambiguity".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular <b>interferometric</b> measurement techniques include Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI), and Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI), also known as scanning white light interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO term Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI), CSI exploits coherence to extend the range of capabilities for interference microscopy. These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other feature of the overall fringe pattern. [...] In its simplest form, CSI provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution SWLI or Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), use coherence effects in combination with interference phase to enhance precision.|$|E
500|$|Astronomical optical {{interferometry}} {{has had to}} overcome a number of technical issues not shared by radio telescope interferometry. The short wavelengths of light necessitate extreme precision and stability of construction. For example, spatial resolution of 1 milliarcsecond requires 0.5µm stability in a 100m baseline. Optical <b>interferometric</b> measurements require high sensitivity, low noise detectors that did not become available until the late 1990s. Astronomical [...] "seeing", the turbulence that causes stars to twinkle, introduces rapid, random phase changes in the incoming light, requiring kilohertz data collection rates to be faster than the rate of turbulence. Despite these technical difficulties, roughly a dozen astronomical optical interferometers are now in operation offering resolutions down to the fractional milliarcsecond range. , a binary star system approximately 960 light-years (290 parsecs) away in the constellation Lyra, as observed by the CHARA array with the MIRC instrument. The brighter component is the primary star, or the mass donor. The fainter component is the thick disk surrounding the secondary star, or the mass gainer. The two components are separated by 1milli-arcsecond. Tidal distortions of the mass donor and the mass gainer are both clearly visible.|$|E
