50|$|Brazing {{has many}} {{advantages}} over other metal-joining techniques, such as welding. Since brazing does not melt the base metal of the joint, it allows much tighter control over tolerances and produces a clean joint {{without the need}} for secondary finishing. Additionally, dissimilar metals and non-metals (i.e. metalized ceramics) can be brazed. In general, brazing also produces less thermal distortion than welding due to the uniform heating of a brazed piece. Complex and multi-part assemblies can be brazed cost-effectively. Welded joints must sometimes be <b>ground</b> <b>flush,</b> a costly secondary operation that brazing does not require because it produces a clean joint. Another advantage is that the brazing can be coated or clad for protective purposes. Finally, brazing is easily adapted to mass production and it is easy to automate because the individual process parameters are less sensitive to variation.|$|E

Then the mine is placed into a shallow hole in the <b>ground</b> (<b>flush</b> with the surface) and the pressure plate is carefully rotated from its safety position to the armed position using the special arming spanner supplied in each crate of mines. Finally, the U-shaped metal safety clip is removed from the pressure plate by pulling on the attached cord. At this point, the mine is fully armed. When deployed by the USA, M14s are often laid together with other mines in their inventory i.e. the M16, M15 or M19. In a [...] "mixed minefield" [...] the anti-tank mines protect anti-personnel mines and vice versa.

30|$|The {{forest at}} the McCloud site was a {{relatively}} young mixed conifer stand dominated by white fir (Abies concolor [Gord. & Glend.] Lindl. ex Hildebr.), which grew after the largest conifers were logged (Appendix 1). Shrubs found nearby included bitter cherry, greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula Greene), and snowbrush (Ceanothus velutinus Douglas ex Hook.). We established four 5.5 m × 5.5 m burn units {{in close proximity to}} each other in gaps between trees. Shortly before the burns, we sampled the shrub seed bank at eight points just outside the perimeter of each unit, using the same procedures outlined previously except without subsampling. We installed duff pins, which consisted of sections of rebar pounded into the <b>ground</b> <b>flush</b> with the upper surface of the litter, at nine points within each unit {{in order to determine the}} percentage of the forest floor removed by the burns. To estimate amount of heating at different forest floor and mineral soil depths, we inserted four 20.2 cm long tiles that were painted with vertical strips of heat-sensitive Tempilaq® paints (temperatures (degrees Celsius) of 52, 59, 66, 79, 93, 149, 260, 427, and 482; Tempil Company, Plainfield, New Jersey, USA) into a cut through the litter, duff, and soil near the corner of each unit. The top of the tile was flush with the top of the litter. We estimated the moisture of the forest floor and upper 10 cm of soil by collecting samples at two to four locations outside of each plot at the time of the burn. The forest floor was separated into the upper forest floor (litter plus fermentation horizons) and lower forest floor (humus) samples. We placed all samples in airtight plastic containers, weighed them wet, and weighed them again after oven drying at approximately 100 °C until the weights no longer changed.|$|E
40|$|A {{round robin}} was {{organized}} to measure FN (ferrite) {{levels in the}} weld metal of five stainless steel weldments, including: types AISI 308 H (with controlled ferrite), 2205 (22 % Cr duplex), 309 Mo, 16 - 8 - 2 (316 H- a lean composition with controlled ferrite), and 316 NF (with negligible ferrite). Each weldment was sliced into several pieces, and various locations on the surfaces of these pieces were specified for measurements. In addition, some locations on the weld caps and weld roots were given different finishes (as-welded, lightly polished, <b>ground</b> <b>flush,</b> and filed flush) to assess {{the effect of these}} surface finishes on the measurements. The specimens were circulated to 17 different laboratories in 9 different countries around the world. A Summary Report (distributed to two Commissions within the International Institute of Welding in 2001, as IIW Documents II- 1440 - 01 and IXH- 512 - 01) presented the data and some preliminary analysis of the data. That report recommended a more comprehensive statistical analysis, which {{is the subject of this}} report. First, a two-way analysis of variance showed that the laboratory and area (location within the specimen) were both statistically significant variables and so both were considered in further analyses. Next, Tukey analyses showed the large number of statistically distinct subsets into which both the laboratory and area data could be divided. Box-and-whiskers plots for these weldments show the distribution of the data, both by laboratory and by area. The data for each location in the weldments were combined to show the variation (as standard deviations) in the values of FN, to estimate the variation that might be expected among laboratories. Finally, the surface finish was found to be significant, but the effect varied from weld to weld...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{theoretical and}} experimental analyses of weld guided {{surface acoustic waves}} (SAW) through the guided wave propagation (GWP) analyses. The GWP analyses {{have been carried out}} by utilizing piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) for in situ structural inspection of a thick steel plate with butt weld as the weld bead is <b>ground</b> <b>flush.</b> Ultrasonic techniques are commonly used for validation of welded structures in many in-situ monitoring applications, e. g. in off-shore structures, in nuclear and pressure vessel industries and in a range of naval applications. PWAS is recently employed in such ultrasonic applications as a resonator as well as a transducer. Quasi-Rayleigh waves a. k. a. SAW can be generated in relatively thick isotropic elastic plate having the same phase velocity as Rayleigh waves whereas Rayleigh waves are a high frequency approximation of the first symmetric (S 0) and anti-symmetric (A 0) Lamb wave modes. As the frequency becomes very high the S 0 and the A 0 wave speeds coalesce, and both have the same value. This value is exactly the Rayleigh wave speed and becomes constant along the frequency i. e. Rayleigh waves are non-dispersive guided surface acoustic waves. The study is followed with weld-GWP tests through the pitch-catch method along the butt weld line. The tuning curves of quasi-Rayleigh wave are determined to show the tuning and trapping effect of the weld bead that has higher thickness than the adjacent plates on producing a dominant quasi-Rayleigh wave mode. The significant usage of the weld tuned and guided quasi-Rayleigh wave mode is essentially discussed for the applications in the in-situ inspection of relatively thick structures with butt weld such as naval offshore structures. The paper ends with summary, conclusions and suggestions for future work...|$|E

By the additions of the videttes and parties that had been out, and which now had all joined, the whole number of the horse was increased to nearly two hundred. There was also a small body of men, whose ordinary duties were those of guides, but who, in cases of emergency, were embodied and did duty as foot soldiers; these were dismounted, and proceeded, by the order of Dunwoodie, to level the few fences which might interfere with the intended movements of the cavalry. The neglect of husbandry, which had been occasioned by the war, left this task comparatively easy. Those long lines of heavy and durable walls, which now sweep through every part of the country, forty years ago were unknown. The slight and tottering fences of stone were then used more to clear the land for the purposes of cultivation than as permanent barriers, and required the constant attention of the husbandman, to preserve them against the fury of the tempests and the frosts of winter. Some few of them had been built with more care immediately around the dwelling of Mr. Wharton; but those which had intersected the vale below were now generally a pile of ruins, over which the horses of the Virginians would bound with the fleetness of the wind. Occasionally a short line yet preserved its erect appearance; but as none of those crossed the ground on which Dunwoodie intended to act, there remained only the slighter fences of rails to be thrown down. Their duty was hastily but effectually performed; and the guides withdrew to the post assigned to them for the approaching fight.|$|R
40|$|If {{you have}} lived in coastal Australia, the {{geography}} of Toowoomba {{is a bit of}} an enigma when you first arrive. There is no visible water. All of Australia's major cities are located on bodies of water which first drew the European colonisers together. They grew around strong and swift coastal rivers or deep and scenic harbours and bays; even Canberra; although inland, has its artificial Lake Burleigh Griffin at its centre. Yet Toowoomba spreads itself across the escarpment, a town of over 90, 000 people without any apparent body of water to unite its people in common need. Toowoomba is the first sign that the inland hydrology of Australia operates quite differently to its coastal streams. Toowoomba's fresh water lies underground. When Europeans first arrived they found a number of small creeks and large wetlands which were fed and recharged by underground freshwater aquifers. The Europeans soon disturbed and resented 'the Swamps' and they were drained and covered over in the nineteenth century. Toowoomba sits on Gowrie Creek, one small sub-catchment of the Condamine River, but one which behaves in a very similar pattern to the entire river system. Despite its reputation, the Condamine often disappoints coastal visitors. For much of its length it appears as a small creek dwarfed by its vast plains. Other than where it rises in the eastern escarpment, it seeps as much as it flows, through aquifers and wetlands, through myriad small creeks and brooks and soaks, until it reaches its main channel. Much of its power thus lies hidden to a superficial eye until a sudden downpour reinvigorates it; then the river reclaims its floodplain irrespective of human wishes and plans. Its full power is briefly apparent before it soaks back into the <b>ground</b> or is <b>flushed</b> downstream many hundreds of kilometres to the Balonne and the Darling River systems. In the last two decades the impacts on the river have increased dramatically and the availability of water {{has been one of the}} most contentious issues facing the local economy. Pressures on local water users have been compounded by national concern about the Murray-Darling Basin. Despite its remoteness from the Murray's river mouth in South Australia, the Condamine is one of this national river system's most important northern headwaters. Although the debate over the Condamine's waters has been a very public one, it has been expressed in the language of economic demands and modern resource management terms. Those unfamiliar with WAMPs, or E. coli and turbidity readings have few reference points to appreciate the changes that the river is currently facing. It was for this reason that Sarah Moles, co-ordinator of the Toowoomba and Region Environment Council, first proposed that we talk to older people who had lived along the river all their life. We needed to find out what these changes really meant in terms of people's actual interaction with and appreciation of the river. In the midst of conflicting scientific and user evidence, she urged us to listen to what older residents knew about the river and its processes...|$|R
