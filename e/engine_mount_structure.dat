[...] German investigators, however, determined that one fracture formed in the wing and <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> <b>structure</b> due to defective construction and welding techniques {{in conjunction with the}} engine vibrations, while a second fracture resulted from the force of the turbulence in the storm.|$|E

40|$|Improved engine {{vibration}} isolation was proposed {{to be the}} most weight and cost efficient retrofit structure-borne noise control measure for single engine general aviation aircraft. A study was carried out the objectives: (1) to develop an engine isolator design specification for reduced interior noise transmission, (2) select/design candidate isolators to meet a 15 dB noise reduction design goal, and (3) carry out a proof of concept evaluation test. Analytical model of the engine, vibration isolators and <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> <b>structure</b> were coupled to an empirical model of the fuselage for noise transmission evaluation. The model was used to develop engine isolator dynamic properties design specification for reduced noise transmission. Candidate isolators ere chosen from available product literature and retrofit to a test aircraft. A laboratory based test procedure was then developed to simulate engine induced noise transmission in the aircraft for a proof of concept evaluation test. Three candidate isolator configurations were evaluated for reduced structure-borne noise transmission relative to the original equipment isolators...|$|E

Some sample diagrams, which introduced ideal adjustment angles for a specific aircraft, is proposed.

In this article the finite element approach utilizes the concept of viscoelastic damping, which is carried out by direct integration.

5000|$|For the He 177, Günter {{decided to}} employ {{two of the}} complex Daimler-Benz DB 606 [...] "power system" [...] setups for propulsion. He had already {{employed}} these engines on the record-breaking Heinkel He 119 reconnaissance aircraft prototypes. They consisted {{of a pair of}} DB 601 liquid-cooled 12-cylinder inverted-vee inline <b>engines</b> <b>mounted</b> side by side in a nacelle - for the He 119, centrally within the fuselage, just behind its heavily glazed cockpit enclosure - driving one propeller. The two engines were inclined inwards by 30° when mounted onto either side of their common, vertical-plane space-frame primary <b>engine</b> <b>mount,</b> so that the inner cylinder banks were disposed almost vertically. A common gear-housing connected the front ends of the two crankcases, with the two crankshaft pinions driving a single airscrew shaft gear. The outer sides of each of the component engines' crankcases were connected to the nacelle firewall through forged mountings similar to what would be used for either a single DB 601 or DB 605 engine-powered aircraft installation. When combined with the central space-frame mount designed especially for the [...] "power system" [...] format, this resulted in a Daimler-Benz [...] "coupled" [...] twin-crankcase [...] "power system" [...] having a trio of <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> <b>structures</b> within its nacelle accommodation. The starboard DB 601 component engine had to be fitted with a mirror-image version of its mechanically driven centrifugal supercharger, drawing air from the starboard side of the engine. Two of the DB 606s, each of which initially developed 2,600 PS (2,564 hp, 1,912 kW) for take-off and weighing some 1,515 kg (3,340 lb) apiece, were to power the He 177. The DB 606 — and its eventual replacement, the Daimler-Benz DB 605-based [...] "DB 610" [...] — were to be the only two production German aviation powerplants designed to surpass 1,500 kW of power, something that the Germans had considerable challenges in developing during the war into production-ready, combat-reliable aviation engines.|$|R
50|$|Three {{civilian}} Electras {{were lost}} in fatal accidents between February 1959 and March 1960. Following the third crash the FAA restricted the maximum speed of Electras until the cause could be determined. After an extensive investigation, two of the crashes (in September 1959 and March 1960) {{were found to be}} caused by insufficiently strong <b>engine</b> <b>mounts,</b> unable to damp a whirling motion that could affect the outboard engines. When the oscillation was transmitted to the wings, a severe vertical vibration escalated until the wings were torn from the aircraft. The company implemented an expensive modification program, labelled the Lockheed Electra Achievement Program or LEAP, in which the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> and wing <b>structures</b> supporting the <b>mounts</b> were strengthened, and some wing skins replaced with thicker material. All the surviving Electras of the 145 built at that time were modified at Lockheed's expense at the factory, the modifications taking 20 days for each aircraft. The changes were incorporated in subsequent aircraft as they were built.|$|R
40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>mounting</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} components in a vehicle to isolate noise and vibration generated by the engine from the driver and passenger. There are three main types of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> such as passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting,</b> semi-active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> and active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The price of the mounting in the market range from the cheapest which is passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> to the most expensive type of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> vary with the price of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> with the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the low quality isolation of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the highest quality isolation of NVH. In order to reduce the vibrations, noise and harshness (NVH) level for vehicles, understanding about the vibration characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in detail is crucial. The objective of this project is to analyze the vibration cause by the engine of a Perodua Kenari on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system at different engine revolutions per minute (rpm).

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> influence {{the performance of}} the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The frequency-dependent properties represented the more accurate properties of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> as opposed to the frequency-independent properties model. Impact technique in the past has been used to measure the dynamic driving point stiffness in the axial position which omitted the shear properties. In this research, the impact technique is extended to measure the global {{dynamic properties}} including the dynamic shear stiffness of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> [...] When the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> is oriented in certain angles, the combination effect of dynamic compression stiffness and dynamic shear stiffness altered the global dynamic properties of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> A transformation technique is developed to include both of the dynamic stiffnesses and used them to determine the global dynamic properties of <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> Three different types of <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> are used to validate the application of the developed technique. Finally, optimization was carried out to demonstrate the effect of the global dynamic properties based on the frequency-dependent properties of <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> The optimum locations and orientation angles of each individual mount are identified to minimize the mean force transmissibility of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The reduction of the force transmissibility showed that optimization based on the frequency-independent properties underestimated the peak transmissibility...|$|R

At present conventional elastomeric mounts are widely used in <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> systems for commercial vehicles. However, these mounts cannot fulfill the conflicting characteristic requirements for the best isolation concerning both road and engine induced vibrations. Therefore, to improve the noise and vibration isolation of commercial vehicles it is necessary to go beyond traditional passive isolators and use semi-active or active vibration control systems due to their capabilities of addressing the conflicting requirements in different road and engine conditions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to first develop mathematical and computational models of elastomeric <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> for heavy trucks and investigate the nonlinear behavior of dynamic stiffness and damping of the mounts, and finally use the developed models to design and analyze an adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system.
