500|$|The {{report was}} {{controversial}} {{even at the}} time of its publication. John Pike, space policy director for the Federation of American Scientists, commented that [...] "the Kraft report <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> disaster. They are basically saying dismantle the safety and quality assurance mechanisms set in place after the Challenger accident." [...] NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel also took issue with the report, saying in May 1995 that [...] "the assumption that the Space Shuttle systems are now 'mature' smacks of a complacency which may lead to serious mishaps." [...] Nonetheless, NASA accepted the recommendations of the report, and in November 1995, responsibility for shuttle operations was turned over to the United Space Alliance.|$|E

The [...] "secrets", divulged {{at the end of}} each chapter, provide examples of such recipes. One is for a capon in a bottle; the trick was to skin the bird, place the skin inside a bottle, fill it with a mixture of milk and eggs, and put the bottle into boiling water. As the mixture expanded in heat, it produced an illusion of a whole capon fit inside a bottle. Another [...] "secret" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> an uncut pike with its head fried, its tail baked and its middle boiled; it was made by spit-roasting the fish while basting its head with oil or butter and sprinkling it with flour, and pouring salted vinegar on cloth wrapped around the middle part. The last recipe is for a broth boiled with a string of pearls and a golden coin, which was supposed to cure the sick and those [...] "despairing about their health".|$|E

2500|$|On December 7, UN {{officials}} {{claimed that}} the $7.1 billion budget (USD) for peacekeeping troops was insufficient even before planned reinforcements of MONUC could be fulfilled; even the troop and equipment requirements may not be met, as Western countries declined support, citing the conflict not as [...] "strategically vital" [...] as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. International Crisis Group vice-president Fabienne Hara stated that, [...] "Contributions of U.N. members states will probably not grow at the very least, if not diminish... may not be funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources." [...] An anonymous UN official {{claimed that the}} Security Council could [...] "drop the ball, {{move on to another}} issue and we're the ones at fault. We've seen before that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> failure." [...] Reuters reported that a senior Western Security Council diplomat claimed that, while criticism was not invalid, other countries with reserves of troops should aid failing peacekeeping missions. The official stated that [...] "We're not the only ones who can do this. Where are the Russians, the Ukrainians? Where are the developing countries who want to have seats on the Security Council? Where is Brazil? It doesn't always have to be us." [...] The lack of peacekeeping resources was cited as counterproductive by political analyst Max Bergmann of the National Security Network. [...] "UN forces ... do fail, but this is often the result of either too few troops or too little money. Our reliance on the United Nations to address trouble spots and to prevent them from worsening has only increased. Shorting the U.N. on peacekeeping funding is therefore akin to shooting ourselves in the foot." [...] European Union nations declined to intervene.|$|E

60|$|Let us start fair by frankly {{admitting that}} the genius, like the poet, is born and not made. If {{you wish to}} apply the recipe for {{producing}} him, it is unfortunately necessary to set out by selecting beforehand his grandfathers and grandmothers, to {{the third and fourth}} generation of those that precede him. Nevertheless, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> the production of genius, and every actual concrete genius who ever yet adorned or disgraced this oblate spheroid of ours has been produced, I believe, in strict accordance with its unwritten rules and unknown regulations. In other words, geniuses don't crop up irregularly anywhere, 'quite promiscuous like'; they have their fixed laws and their adequate causes: they are the result and effect of certain fairly demonstrable concatenations of circumstance: they are, in short, a natural product, not a lusus naturæ. You get them only under sundry relatively definite and settled conditions; and though it isn't (unfortunately) quite true that the conditions will always infallibly bring forth the genius, it is quite true that the genius can never be brought forth at all without the conditions. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? No more can you get a poet from a family of stockbrokers who have intermarried with the daughters of an eminent alderman, or make a philosopher out of a country grocer's eldest son whose amiable mother had no soul above the half-pounds of tea and sugar.|$|E
