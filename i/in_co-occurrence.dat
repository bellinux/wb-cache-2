This latter process is sometimes referred to as generalization or rule learning. Research has shown that if input is encoded in terms of perceptually salient dimensions rather than specific details and if patterns in the input indicate that a number of objects are named interchangeably in the same context, a language learner will be much more likely to generalize that name to every instance with the relevant features. This tendency is heavily dependent on the consistency of context clues and the degree to which word contexts overlap in the input. These differences are furthermore linked to the well-known patterns of under and overgeneralization in infant word learning. Research has also shown that the frequency <b>in</b> <b>co-occurrence</b> of referents is tracked as well, which helps create associations and dispel ambiguities in object-referent models.|$|E
50|$|A {{process called}} {{methanogenesis}} can also occur around whale falls. Archaea that produce methane can be abundant in anoxic sediment, but is typically not found <b>in</b> <b>co-occurrence</b> with the sulfur reducing bacteria found at whale falls. Whale falls do however support both sulfur reducing bacteria and methane producing archaea, {{leading to the}} conclusion that the area is not electron donor limited, and/or there is minimal or no competition for suitable substrate. Concentration gradients of both sulfide and methane can be found around whale falls, with the highest concentration coming within one meter of the carcass, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding sediment concentrations. Methanogenesis appears to only occur in sediments as opposed to sulfur reduction, which occurs both in sediments and on the bones of the carcass. The addition of sulfur reduction in both sediments and high lipid whale bones is a key factor for why whale falls are able to sustain deep-sea communities for extended periods of time.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{hypothesis}} of co-occurrence graphs {{assumes that the}} semantics of a word can be represented {{by means of a}} co-occurrence graph, whose vertices are co-occurrences and edges are co-occurrence relations. These approaches are related to word clustering methods, where co-occurrences between words can be obtained on the basis of grammatical [...] or collocational relations. HyperLex is the successful approaches of a graph algorithm, based on the identification of hubs <b>in</b> <b>co-occurrence</b> graphs, which have to cope with the need to tune a large number of parameters. To deal with this issue several graph-based algorithms have been proposed, which are based on simple graph patterns, namely Curvature Clustering, Squares, Triangles and Diamonds (SquaT++), and Balanced Maximum Spanning Tree Clustering (B-MST). The patterns aim at identifying meanings using the local structural properties of the co-occurrence graph. A randomized algorithm which partitions the graph vertices by iteratively transferring the mainstream message (i.e. word sense) to neighboring vertices is Chinese Whispers. By applying co-occurrence graphs approaches have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in standard evaluation tasks.|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile, the MST {{algorithm}} chooses edges which {{minimize the}} weighted value of path.

40|$|How trophic {{resources}} are managed {{is a key}} factor in our understanding of the success of invasive species. In amphibians that usually occupy ephemeral ponds, the capacity to acquire resources and food selection are especially important because as a pond dries, the larval density increases and food {{resources are}} limited. Abundant and high-quality food can increase the final size and reduce the duration of development of amphibians. The aim of this work was to assess the trophic traits of tadpoles of the invasive (originally North African) anuran Discoglossus pictus compared to those of native European Epidalea calamita tadpoles under laboratory conditions. Food of two different levels of quality was supplied, and the feeding activity and food preference of the two species were analysed alone and <b>in</b> <b>co-occurrence.</b> D. pictus was capable of modifying its behaviour and food preferences; while E. calamita displayed much milder differences between treatments. Both alone and <b>in</b> <b>co-occurrence</b> with the native species, the invasive tadpoles obtained higher feeding activity values and showed a stronger preference for high-quality food. Additionally, when high densities of the two species shared food resources, the feeding activity results indicated potential displacement of the native tadpoles to low-quality resources. D. pictus thus presents trophic traits that are favourable for invasion and could limit the fitness of E. calamita when resources are limited or there is a risk of pond desiccation...|$|E

40|$|The genomic {{information}} of microbes {{is a major}} determinant of their phenotypic properties, yet it is largely unknown to what extent ecological associations between different species can be explained by their genome composition. To bridge this gap, this study introduces two new genome-wide pairwise measures of microbe-microbe interaction. The first (genome content similarity index) quantifies similarity in genome composition between two microbes, while the second (microbe-microbe functional association index) summarizes the topology of a protein functional association network built for a given pair of microbes and quantifies the fraction of network edges crossing organismal boundaries. These new indices are then used to predict co-occurrence between reference genomes from two 16 S-based ecological datasets, accounting for phylogenetic relatedness of the taxa. Phylogenetic relatedness was found to be a strong predictor of ecological associations between microbes which explains about 10 % of variance <b>in</b> <b>co-occurrence</b> data, but genome composition was found to be a strong predictor as well, it explains up to 4 % the variance <b>in</b> <b>co-occurrence</b> when all genomic-based indices are used in combination, even after accounting for evolutionary relationships between the species. On their own, the metrics proposed here explain a larger proportion of variance than previously reported more complex methods that rely on metabolic network comparisons. In summary, results {{of this study indicate that}} microbial genomes do indeed contain detectable signal of organismal ecology, and the methods described in the paper can be used to improve mechanistic understanding of microbe-microbe interactions...|$|E

40|$|Co-occurrence {{networks}} {{produced from}} microbial survey sequencing data are frequently {{used to identify}} interactions between community members. While this approach has potential to reveal ecological processes, it has been insufficiently validated due to the technical limitations inherent in studying complex microbial ecosystems. Here, we simulate multi-species microbial communities with known interaction patterns using generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics, construct co-occurrence networks, and evaluate how well networks reveal the underlying interactions, and how experimental and ecological parameters can affect network inference and interpretation. We find that co-occurrence networks can recapitulate interaction networks under certain conditions, but that they lose interpretability when the effects of habitat filtering become significant. We demonstrate that networks suffer from local hot spots of spurious correlation {{in the neighborhood of}} hub species that engage in many interactions.

In this paper, we study co-occurrence data using a general energy-based probabilistic model, and we analyze three different categories of energy-based model, namely, the L_ 1, L_ 2 and L_k models, which are able to capture different levels of dependency <b>in</b> the <b>co-occurrence</b> data. We also discuss how several typical existing models are related to these three types of energy models, including the Fully Visible Boltzmann Machine (FVBM) (L_ 2), Matrix Factorization (L_ 2), Log-BiLinear (LBL) models (L_ 2), and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model (L_k). Then, we propose a Deep Embedding Model (DEM) (an L_k model) from the energy model in a principled manner. Furthermore, motivated by the observation that the partition function in the energy model is intractable {{and the fact that}} the major objective of modeling the co-occurrence data is to predict using the conditional probability, we apply the maximum pseudo-likelihood method to learn DEM. In consequence, the developed model and its learning method naturally avoid the above difficulties and can be easily used to compute the conditional probability in prediction. Interestingly, our method is equivalent to learning a special structured deep neural network using back-propagation and a special sampling strategy, which makes it scalable on large-scale datasets. Finally, in the experiments, we show that the DEM can achieve comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on datasets across several application domains...|$|R
