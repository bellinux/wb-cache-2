5|$|Hurst was {{equipped}} with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions. These weapons were slow to reload, so {{to ensure that the}} castle would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of hitting enemy ships passing at speed, two long batteries of weapons were built onto either side of the old castle, a west wing with 37 gun positions and an east wing with 24 positions. These were built on top of the two gun batteries constructed there a few years before and also required the castle's moat to be filled in. As work progressed, the decision was taken to reinforce the batteries with additional iron shields.|$|E
5|$|During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having {{held the}} Ashes since 1934 but critics {{considered}} England to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> {{of winning the}} series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was uncertain and he was troubled by fibrositis which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia's first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed {{early in the second}} innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain {{for the remainder of the}} series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{maintained}} {{his interest in}} politics, and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Since the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover, was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed the stock market crash, the nominee would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith's successor as New York's governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner, and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker sought the nomination. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention {{in the hope that}} it would turn to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker {{in the event of a}} stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.|$|E
25|$|These {{average values}} {{do not take}} into account the special status of the king as a royal piece. They have also been {{normalized}} so that the pawn is worth 1 point to avoid fractions.

25|$|Competition was intense, {{with the}} National Action Party (PAN) eager {{to hold on}} to the {{presidency}} for a second period, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) equally keen to regain the office it lost in the 2000 election for the first time in 71 years (then in coalition with the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico), and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) (then in coalition with Convergence and the Labor Party) believing itself to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to win after disappointments in the two previous elections.|$|E

Additionally, pieces gain in value if they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of promotion (particularly for the water buffalo, which promotes to the most powerful piece in the game), and the jumping generals and fire demon tend to lose some power as the board empties (because they then cannot make full use of their jumping and burning abilities).|$|E
25|$|Because {{the common}} skate is {{long-lived}} and slow to mature, {{it is difficult}} for it to repopulate quickly. Coupled with overfishing, this means that the common skate's population has drastically decreased and it is likely it will disappear entirely unless more is done to preserve it. It is strictly protected within the EU, making it illegal for commercial fishers to actively fish for it or keep it if accidentally landed. Like other elasmobranchs, it is believed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of surviving if released after being caught.|$|E

Captain Roberts was killed by grapeshot, which struck him in the throat while {{he stood on the}} deck. Before his body could be captured by Ogle, Roberts's wish to be buried at sea was fulfilled by his crew, who weighed his body down and threw it overboard after wrapping it in his ship's sail.

25|$|However, on {{the fourth}} day, 426 runs were hit and enough wickets fell to get a result. Blackwell smacked 88 not out in 85 balls as Somerset added 184 in the first fifty overs of the day before declaring, which set Derbyshire 268 to win in 50 overs - a good one-day total. Derbyshire {{attempted}} the chase, Jon Moss slashing 106 and adding runs with Luke Sutton, and at 247 for 4, Derbyshire looked to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> at winning it. However, two run-outs and two wickets each for Blackwell and Caddick saw Derbyshire lose their last six men for 15 runs, and Somerset snatched a five-run win.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} protect unregistered well-known {{marks in}} accordance with their international obligations under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement). Consequently, not only big companies but also SMEs may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of establishing enough goodwill with customers so that their marks may be recognized as well-known marks and acquire protection without registration. It is, nevertheless, advisable to seek registration, taking into account that many countries provide for an extended protection of registered well-known marks against dilution (Art. 16.3 TRIPS), i.e., the reputation of the mark being weakened by the unauthorized use of that mark by others.|$|E

25|$|The long through ball: This is a long, {{and usually}} high, pass from a teams' own half, {{over the heads}} of the other team's defence. It is {{intended}} for the attacking players to chase and it is important that they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} case, {{according}} to FCC, evolving females with increasingly heavy childcare burdens {{would have done}} best by resisting attempts at harem-holding by locally dominant males. No human female needs a partner who will get her pregnant only to disappear, abandoning her in favour of his next sexual partner. To any local group of females, the more such philandering can be successfully resisted—and the greater the proportion of previously excluded males who can {{be included in the}} breeding system and persuaded to invest effort—the better. By evolving concealed ovulation and continuous receptivity, females force males into longer periods of consortship if they are to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of achieving impregnation (figures c,d). Reproductive synchrony —whether seasonal, lunar or a combination of the two—is a key strategy for reproductive levelling, reducing paternity skew and involving more males in investment in offspring. Greater reproductive synchrony owing to seasonality during glacial cycles may have differentiated Neanderthal reproductive strategies from those of Homo sapiens ancestors.|$|E
25|$|However, the arguable {{climax of}} the season {{occurred}} during the season's final doubleheader at the Highlanders’ home stadium, Hilltop Park. In order to win the pennant, New York needed to take both games from Boston. With Jack Chesbro, the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, New York seemed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of winning the first game. However, {{in the top of}} the ninth inning with the score tied 2–2 with a man on third {{in the top of the}} ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro allowing Boston's Lou Criger to score the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history. Unfortunately the NL champion New York Giants had previously declined to play any postseason series, fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led to the two leagues immediately turning the World Series into a permanent championship, starting in 1905.|$|E

500|$|The {{pilot was}} {{considered}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of being picked up, but ultimately the CW passed on the show. Discussing the excitement surrounding the project, Lou Diamond Phillips said, [...] "The funny thing about the Aquaman project is that there's so much buzz about it already. Which is amazing, I mean you don't usually get that with a pilot, because they're sort of sight unseen." [...] There were reports of two WB pilots in contention for the new CW network, one being Aquaman, which was a frontrunner. On May 18, 2006, when The CW announced its fall lineup Aquaman {{was not on the}} list. Dawn Ostroff, The CW's president of entertainment, stated that it was still a midseason contender.|$|E
500|$|The other likely {{scenario}} {{was that a}} small group of riders would break away over the final climbs, most probably on the Poggio, and be able to hold off the chase from the group behind. Fabian Cancellara (...) , who won the race in 2008 and had finished on the podium for the last four years, was considered the most likely rider to win the race in this scenario. Peter Sagan was also believed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of victory, since he was thought to have the ability and form to win the race from a breakaway as well as a bunch sprint. Other riders who could win the race from a breakaway included Greg Van Avermaet (...) and Sep Vanmarcke (...) [...] Although Cavendish was not in perfect form, his [...] had other riders capable of victory: Zdeněk Štybar and Michał Kwiatkowski, the 2014 world champion, had the potential to attempt an attack in the final part of the race.|$|E

However, Webber, Price and Pack missed almost the entire year (65, 75 and 51games respectively) because of injuries. [...] In February, the New York Knicks made two trades that put them in position to bid on Howard in the 1996 free agent market.
