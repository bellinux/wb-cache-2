40|$|Nosema ceranae and Nosema apis are two fungal {{pathogens}} {{belonging to}} the phylum Microsporidia and infecting the European honeybee, Apis mellifera. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} N. ceranae is more virulent than N. apis both at the individual insect level and at the colony level. Severe colony losses could be attributed to N. ceranae infections, and an unusual form of nosemosis is caused by this pathogen. In the present study, data from a 5 -year cohort study of the prevalence of Nosema spp. in Germany, involving about 220 honeybee colonies and a total of 1, 997 samples collected from these colonies each spring and autumn and analyzed via species-specific PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), are described. Statistical analysis of the data revealed no relation between colony mortality and detectable levels of infection with N. ceranae or N. apis. In addition, N. apis is still more prevalent than N. ceranae in the cohort of the <b>German</b> <b>bee</b> population that was analyzed. A possible explanation for these findings could be the marked decrease in spore germination that was observed after even a short exposure to low temperatures (+ 4 °C) for N. ceranae only. Reduced or inhibited N. ceranae spore germination at low temperatures should hamper the infectivity and spread of this pathogen in climatic regions characterized by a rather cold winter season...|$|E
50|$|The European dark bee (Apis mellifera mellifera) is a {{subspecies}} {{of honey}} bee whose original European range stretched from western Russia through Northern Europe and probably {{down to the}} Iberian Peninsula. It was domesticated in Europe and hives were brought to North America in the colonial era. They are large for honey bees though they have unusually short tongues. They are sometimes called the <b>German</b> black <b>bee</b> or <b>German</b> dark <b>bee.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceMorphometry {{is a very}} powerful, {{though often}} {{laborious}} and time-consuming, tool for the identification of bee species and subspecies. In an attempt to develop a simplified methodology for such work, we marked five easily identified landmarks of digitalized images of the right forewing radial cell in 50 workers of each of three different racial groups of Apis mellifera. Software was developed to calculate angles between the landmarks, cell area, continuous curvature, and arc lengths (total of 11 characters). Based on multivariate analysis, significant differences were detected between commercial USA Italian <b>bees,</b> <b>German</b> Carniolan <b>bees</b> and Africanized honey bees (a polyhybrid that is predominantly Apis mellifera scutellata). A single wing cell carried enough information to discriminate nearly 99 % of the individuals. Most of the classifications gave P > 0. 99, and only three Africanized bees were misclassified. We concluded that the features measured in a single wing cell are sufficient to discriminate these racial groups...|$|R

The family was {{relatively}} well off, belonging to the middle-class citizenry of Leisnig. Apianus was educated at the Latin school in Rochlitz. From 1516 to 1519 he studied at the University of Leipzig; during this time, he Latinized his name to Apianus (lat. apis means [...] "bee"; [...] "Biene" [...] is the <b>German</b> word for <b>bee).</b>|$|R

Greek oida ‘I know’ < ‘it is known to me’, édomai ‘I will eat’ < ‘it is eatable to me’. On the basis of Oettinger’s epoch-making book (1979), I proposed that the Hittite hi-flexion originated from a merger of the perfect, where *-i was added to 3 rd sg. *-e in order to supply a new present, with the thematic flexion of causatives and iteratives, where the final *-e of 3 rd sg. *-eie was dropped before the loss of intervocalic *-i- (1983 : 315) ...|$|R
40|$|Sebald Beham from Nuremberg {{designed}} his Spinning Bee woodcut around 1524 (Figure 1) as {{a medium-sized}} work of approximately 1 ft by 1. 5 ft, printed on two {{sheets of paper}} glued side by side. A large number of individuals are included and most are women, significantly so because spinning bees served as meeting places for rural girls and women where they would spin and amuse themselves during {{the fall and winter}} evenings. Beham’s print is the first surviving example of a spinning bee in visual art {{and one of the first}} substantive examples of the theme in any form. The print thus began a tradition in the visual arts and followed one in literature that continued through the eighteenth century with German poems and prints, including an engraved copy of Beham’s Spinning Bee with text. In Beham’s print only two of the women spin: the woman whose distaff stands out prominently at center, and an older woman at lower left, who is probably married, judging from her matron’s bonnet. Each of these women holds yarn she has spun from the raw wool or flax on a long distaff. The older woman also holds a spindle, a long bobbin-like weight that helps turn the distaff in its base. The remaining women and men eat and drink, dance, and are engaged in a variety of sexual antics in which the men embrace or lie on the women (at upper right), look under their skirts (at lower right), and reach aggressively under their clothing (lower left). Sebald Beham seems to offer the viewer a tantalizingly exaggerated picture of the kind of Early Modern <b>German</b> spinning <b>bee</b> Hans Medick broadly describes as a “youth-sexual culture” showing “rural customs of courtship. ” My purpose in this essay is to examine the sexualized view of women Beham presents in this print. Most of the women are depicted as sexually involved and, I argue, therefore misbehaving, while only two women attend to their distaffs and are thereby shown to be virtuous. I intend to discuss these contradictory attitudes about women, as virtuous and sexual, by placing them within the broader context of attitudes in Nuremberg. The results show that Beham’s microscopic view of one group of Nuremberg women telescopes into more general attitudes toward women during Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe...|$|R
