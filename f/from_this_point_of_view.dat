5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E

25|$|Symmetric polynomials arise {{naturally}} {{in the study}} of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> the elementary symmetric polynomials are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A theorem states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every symmetric polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial.|$|E

Déjeuner sur l'herbe depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. Odilon Redon, for example, did not like it.

25|$|When media {{coverage}} and allegations of Constanzo's affinity towards Satanism died down, several Afro-Caribbean scholars stated that Constanzo's actions were fueled by his personal conviction and psychopathic involvement with Palo Mayombe. They argued that Constanzo used Palo Mayombe {{for his own}} financial, illicit, and psychological needs by convincing his cult members to help further his drug trafficking operations. Through human sacrifice, Constanzo promised his members that they were protected from the law. Other Afro-Caribbean scholars, on the other hand, alleged that Constanzo murdered Kilroy because he truly believed it was a requirement in his distorted view of Palo Mayombe. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Constanzo's actions and what happened in Matamoros could happened anywhere.|$|E
25|$|But the use {{of stable}} models in answer set {{programming}} {{provides a different perspective}} on such programs. In that programming paradigm, a given search problem is represented by a logic program so that the stable models of the program correspond to solutions. Then programs with many stable models correspond to problems with many solutions, and programs without stable models correspond to unsolvable problems. For instance, the eight queens puzzle has 92 solutions; to solve it using answer set programming, we encode it by a logic program with 92 stable models. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> logic programs with exactly one stable model are rather special in answer set programming, like polynomials with exactly one root in algebra.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{amount of}} medieval {{literature}} is anonymous. This {{is not only}} {{due to the lack}} of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the author's role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an auctor instead. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.|$|E

25|$|Going back to Nalebuff (1987), the Monty Hall {{problem is}} also much {{studied in the}} {{literature}} on game theory and decision theory, and also some popular solutions correspond to this point of view.

And the chance aspects of how the car is hidden and how an unchosen door is opened are unknown. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> one has to remember that the player has two opportunities to make choices: first of all, which door to choose initially; and secondly, whether or not to switch. Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.|$|E
25|$|In this context, {{on the eve}} of {{independence}} there did not really exist a political movement strictly based on the demand for the rights of women. Existing institutions sustained political parties, and although these rights were the subject of speeches, they were not then among political priorities. The Union of women and the Union of girls belonging to the Communist party agitated especially in the social and labour domains. As for the Muslim union and the cells destourian women created in 1951-1952, they did not begin to call for the right to vote and eligibility for office until 1955. These two rights became official on March 14, 1957 and Tunisian women voted {{for the first time in}} municipal elections in May 1959 and later in the presidential and legislative elections of November 1959. But the right to education remained the only one unanimously sought by feminine organizations. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> the Code was not promulgated under any feminist pressure, that, when it existed, was usually directed to other ideals.|$|E
25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E
