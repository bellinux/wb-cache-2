Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune {{to be a strong}} abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E

500|$|By late February 1942, the Soviet winter counter-offensive, {{had pushed}} German forces from Moscow {{on a broad}} front and then ended in mutual exhaustion. Stalin was {{convinced}} that the Germans were finished and would collapse by the spring or summer 1942, as he said in his speech of 7 November 1941. Stalin decided to exploit this perceived weakness on the Eastern Front by launching a new offensive in the spring. Stalin's decision faced objections from his advisors, including the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, General Boris Shaposhnikov, and generals Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Georgy Zhukov, who argued for a more defensive strategy. Vasilevsky wrote [...] "Yes, we were hoping for , but the reality was more harsh than that". According to Zhukov, Stalin believed that the Germans were able to carry out operations simultaneously along two strategic axes, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the opening of spring offensives along the entire front would destabilize the German Army, before it had a chance to initiate what could be a mortal offensive blow on Moscow.

Most of the King's Council were also present. Cranmer, who was at Lambeth Palace, was reported to have broken down in tears after telling Alexander Ales: [...] "She who has been the Queen of England on earth will today become a Queen in heaven." [...] When the charges were first brought against Anne, Cranmer had expressed his astonishment to Henry and his belief that [...] "she should not be culpable." [...] Still, Cranmer felt vulnerable because of his closeness to the queen, and so on the night before the execution, he declared Henry's marriage to Anne to have been void, like Catherine's before her. He made no serious attempt to save Anne's life, although some sources record that he had prepared her for death by hearing her last private confession of sins, in which she had stated her innocence before God. On the day of her death, a Scottish friend found Cranmer weeping uncontrollably in his London gardens, saying that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Anne had now gone to Heaven.|$|E

[...] Despite modest sales estimates—the band's record company, DGC Records, forecast sales of 50,000 copies—Nevermind became a huge commercial success, popularizing the Seattle grunge movement and alternative rock in general. [...] Nevertheless, all three members of Nirvana—singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl—later expressed dissatisfaction {{with the sound of}} the album, citing its production as too polished. [...] Early in 1992, Cobain told Rolling Stone that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the band's next album would showcase [...] "both of the extremes" [...] of its sound, saying [...] "it'll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others. [...] It won't be as one-dimensional [...] ". [...] Cobain wanted to start work on the album in the summer of 1992, but the band was unable as Cobain and his bandmates lived in different cities, and as the singer and his wife, Courtney Love, were expecting the birth of their daughter, Frances Bean. [...] DGC had hoped to have a new album by the band ready for a late-1992 holiday season release; since work on it proceeded slowly, the label released the compilation album Incesticide in December 1992.|$|E
500|$|According to {{crew member}} Harmen Koops, on , Krause {{ordered him to}} bring on deck some assegais, or African spears, and some swords, for the Malagasy to clean. The assegais had been {{acquired}} on Madagascar along with the Malagasy, {{some of whom were}} experienced in the use of this weapon. Krause believed himself to be intellectually superior to the Malagasy, and is reported to have laughed when issuing his order, saying <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> others would doubt his wisdom; having set the task, he went below deck for a meal. When the Malagasy had cleaned the weapons and were ordered to return them, they attacked the ship's crew, killing all who were left on deck, including Krause, who had returned when the attack began. Also killed in this fight were two of the ship's mates, Bender and Albert, leaving only Daniel Carel Gulik surviving of that rank. Some of the surviving crew climbed into the rigging, and others, including Gulik, Koops, Jan de Leeuw, and Krause's assistant Olof Leij, withdrew to the Constapelskamer, or gunroom, which was below decks at the stern of the ship, near the rudder. Captain Muller, who stated that he had been [...] "gazing out over the sea" [...] {{at the time of the}} attack, was taken by surprise and stabbed three times by Massavana. Muller escaped to his cabin and soon climbed down from a window, via the rudder, to join the others in the gunroom. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had been thrown overboard with others from the rigging, managed to swim around the ship to a rope hanging from the gunroom window, and was pulled to safety by his shipmates. Although the crew who had climbed into the rigging threatened the Malagasy from the fore-mast with hand grenades, [...] "only those that reached the safety of the barricaded ... escaped a brutal death." [...] With Krause dead and Muller wounded, Olof Leij was left in charge of the remaining crew below deck.|$|E
