This research attempts to study the effects of <b>Echinaceae</b> purpurea hydroalcoholic extract on the blood parameters in little laboratory female mice (Balb/c species). Materials and Methods: In this research, 48 mature female mice were divided randomly into 6 groups. The control group did not receive any extract, the placebo group received 0. 5 cc normal saline every other day and 4 treatment groups received extract with (50, 100, 200, 300) mg/kg/ 2 day doses that was used interperitoneal injection. Then the blood samples were taken from the whole mice. The results were analyzed in the case that p< 0. 05,using SPSS software. Results: The study of blood parameters showed that the extract increased markedly in the total number of white blood cells in each of 4 treatment groups in comparison with control group. The number of neutrophiles decreased significantly in each of 4 treatment groups in comparison with control group, but the significant difference wasn’t noticed in monocytes. The number of red blood cells increased significantly in groups 1, 2 in comparison with the control group, but in groups 3 and 4 there was no significant difference. In this study, the extract had no statistical significant effect on the mean of hematocrit, hemoglobin and the index of red blood cells (MCV,MCH,MCHC).

The results from this research should contribute to large-scale production as a raw material for Iranian pharmaceutical industries. Comparison of means of the different characteristics was carried out using t-test at 5 % level. Results showed that purple coneflower is adaptable to the climatic conditions in the north of Tehran and can be produced on a large scale. The suitable time for transplanting the seedling in the field was from 5 August to 5 September. Maintaining the purple coneflower until its fourth vegetative period is economical.

Changes of EPR signals of the reference after interactions with nonir-radiated and UV-irradiated E. purpureae were detected. Interactions of the tested E. purpureae samples caused decrease of the EPR signal of DPPH as the result of its antioxidant properties. The decrease of the amplitude of EPR line of DPPH was lower for interactions with UV-irradiated E. purpureae. EPR examination confirmed anti-oxidant properties of E. purpureae. The weaker antioxidant properties of E. purpureae after UV irradiation were pointed out. E. purpureae should be storage in the dark.

40|$|Background: Purple coneflower (<b>Echinaceae</b> purpurea L.) is a {{perennial}} herbaceous with astringent properties, disinfectant, antimicrobial and anti intoxication activity. The main {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of shoot essential oil of purple coneflower against some microorganisms including gram positive, gram negative bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeasts. Material and Methods: In this experimental and laboratory investigation, plant samples were collected in full blooming stage. Shoot essential oil was extracted by hydro-distillation technique using Clevenger apparatus. The chemical constitutes of this oil was analyzed by GC and GC/MS method. Anti microbial properties of the essential oil were determined using micro broth dilution and well disk diffusion methods. At the end, data were analyzed by the SPSS version 15 software, using the T-test and Duncan s' test. Results: Twenty nine components were identified by GC and GC/MS in the essential oil of purple coneflower representing 96. 21 % of total oil. The major components were Germacrene D (53. 30 %), -Cymene (9. 78 %), β-Caryophyllene (7. 52 %), α-Humulene (5. 22 %), β-Bisabolene (4. 43 %) and α-Pinene (4. 23 %), respectively. This oil exhibited strong antifungal activity against filamentous fungi and yeast with average of inhibition zone (AIZ) 39. 63. Microorganisms differ in their resistance to purple coneflower oil. All of the bacteria including gram positive and gram negative bacteria are more resistant than fungi and gram negative bacteria are more resistant than gram positive bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium were more resistant than others. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that coneflower essential oil with significant antimicrobial effects and can be used instead of synthetic antibiotics that microbial resistance towards them is increasing...|$|R
