5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. <b>Helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell,</b> which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
25|$|Antibody class {{switching}} declines significantly once <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> function fails. The immune system loses {{its ability to}} improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate B cells that can produce antibody groups such as IgG and IgA. These effects are primarily due {{to the loss of}} any <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> that can interact with the B lymphocyte correctly. Another symptom of AIDS is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in Th2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper T cells). All of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by IgM antibodies.|$|E
50|$|Physiologically, BCL6 is {{a master}} {{transcription}} factor which leads the differentiation of naive <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in Follicular <b>Helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (TFH cells). Its action is negatively regulated by the gene PRDM1 encoding the transcription factor Blimp-1.|$|R
25|$|Proliferating <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{that develop}} into {{effector}} <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> differentiate into two major subtypes of cells known as Th1 and Th2 cells (also known as Type 1 and Type 2 <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively).|$|R
5000|$|The {{resolution}} of the I-J paradox involves a process of mutual selection (or [...] "co-selection") of suppressor <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> meaning that (a) those suppressor <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are selected that have V regions with complementarity to as many <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> as possible, and (b) <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are selected {{not only on the}} basis of their V regions having some affinity for MHC class II, but also on the basis of the V regions having some affinity for the selected suppressor <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> V regions. The <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and suppressor <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that are co-selected are then a mutually stabilizing construct, and for a given mouse genome, more than one such mutually stabilizing set can exist. This {{resolution of}} the I-J paradox leads to some testable predictions.|$|R
25|$|Clonal Ignorance theory, {{according}} to which autoreactive T cells that are not represented in the thymus will mature and migrate to the periphery, where they will not encounter the appropriate antigen because it is inaccessible tissues. Consequently, auto-reactive B cells, that escape deletion, cannot find the antigen or the specific <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} chronic {{inflammation}} ensues, and functional CD4+ T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually {{to a point}} where the CD4+ T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of antigens that could potentially be detected. The depletion of CD4 T cells and the development of chronic inflammation are signature processes in HIV pathogenesis that propel progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). CD4 T cell depleted to the cell count of less than 200cell/μL in blood during AIDS allows various pathogens to escape T cell recognition, thus allowing opportunistic infections that would normally elicit a <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response to bypass the immune system. While these complete bypass situations only occur when the <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response is absolutely necessary for infection clearance, most infections increase in severity and/or duration because the immune system's helper T cells provide less efficient immune response.|$|E
25|$|The above {{experimental}} expression {{data shows}} many possible findings for CCDC142. Overexpression of SNAI1, a zinc finger protein, is correlated to {{the reduction of}} CCDC142 expression in Homo sapiens. A Mus musculus knockout of MEKK 2/3, which help regulate <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, also showed lowered expression of CCDC142. Another Mus musculus experiment focusing on cardiomyopathy in mice showed lower levels of CCDC142 in mice with damaged myocardial cells.|$|E
500|$|Mature {{dendritic}} <b>cells</b> activate [...] <b>T</b> <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> and cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The activated <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{interact with}} macrophages and B cells to activate them in turn. In addition, dendritic cells {{can influence the}} type of immune response produced; when they travel to the lymphoid areas where <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are held they can activate <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> which then differentiate into cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> or <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{other types of}} <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that can {{influence}} the expression and activation of <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> such as natural regulatory <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> along with less common cytokine profiles such as the Th3 subset of <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Terms such as [...] "regulatory" [...] and [...] "suppression" [...] have become ambiguous after the discovery that <b>helper</b> CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are also capable of regulating (and suppressing) their own responses outside of dedicated regulatory <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{are capable}} of {{influencing}} a variety of immune <b>cells,</b> and the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response generated (including the extracellular signals such as cytokines) can be essential for a successful outcome from infection. In order to be effective, <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> must determine which cytokines will allow the immune system to be most useful or beneficial for the host. Understanding exactly how <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> respond to immune challenges is currently of major interest in immunology, because such knowledge may be very useful {{in the treatment of}} disease and in increasing the effectiveness of vaccination.|$|R
25|$|Considering {{the diverse}} and {{important}} role helper T cells {{play in the}} immune system, {{it is not surprising}} that these cells often influence the immune response against disease. They also appear to make occasional mistakes, or generate responses that would be politely considered non-beneficial. In the worst-case scenario, the <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response could lead to a disaster and the fatality of the host. Fortunately this is a very rare occurrence.|$|E
25|$|Asthma is {{characterized}} by eosinophil-induced inflammation motivated by a type 2 <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> (Th2). By targeting the transcription factor, GATA3, of the Th2 pathway, with DNAzyme {{it may be possible}} to negate the inflammation. The safety and efficacy of SB010, a novel 10-23 DNAzyme was evaluated, and found to have the ability to cleave and inactivate GATA3 messenger RNA in phase IIa clinical trials. Treatment with SB010 significantly offset both late and early asthmatic responses after allergen aggravation in male patients with allergic asthma.|$|E
500|$|Both B {{cells and}} T cells carry {{receptor}} molecules that recognize specific targets. T cells recognize a [...] "non-self" [...] target, {{such as a}} pathogen, only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a [...] "self" [...] receptor called a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. There are two major subtypes of T cells: the killer T cell and the <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell.</b> In addition there are regulatory T cells which [...] {{have a role in}} modulating immune response. Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell. A third, minor subtype are the γδ T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.|$|E

40|$|We have {{established}} lines and clones of <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> specific for the antigen fowl gamma globulin (FGG) and maintained these cells in continuous proliferation in vitro {{for up to}} 8 months. During this period the specific helper activity was assessed in vitro in T cell-dependent anti-hapten responses.

2500|$|On {{surfaces}} of helper T cells are CD4 receptors, {{as well as}} T cell receptors (TCRs).

2500|$|Type 1 {{hypersensitivity}} includes common immune {{disorders such as}} asthma, {{allergic rhinitis}} (hay fever), eczema, urticaria (hives) and anaphylaxis. These reactions all involve IgE antibodies, which require a Th2 response during <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> development. Preventive treatments, such as corticosteroids and montelukast, focus on suppressing mast cells or other allergic cells; T cells do not play a primary role during the actual inflammatory response.

2500|$|Like the T cell, B cells {{express a}} unique B cell {{receptor}} (BCR), in this case, a membrane-bound antibody molecule. All the BCR {{of any one}} clone of B cells recognizes and binds to only one particular antigen. A critical difference between B cells and T cells is how each cell [...] "sees" [...] an antigen. T cells recognize their cognate antigen in a processed form – as a peptide {{in the context of}} an MHC molecule, whereas B cells recognize antigens in their native form. Once a B cell encounters its cognate (or specific) antigen (and receives additional signals from a <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> (predominately Th2 type)), it further differentiates into an effector cell, known as a plasma cell.|$|E

40|$|A {{requirement}} for <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the production}} of IgG antibody by B cells has been {{known for a long time}} and has been extensively studied (1 - 3). More recently, evidence has accumulated that there may be two classes of <b>helper</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> for antibody production (4 - 6) and that <b>T</b> cell-T <b>cell</b> collaboration may be involved in the in vitro generation ofcytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) 1 against alloantigens (7 - 10).
