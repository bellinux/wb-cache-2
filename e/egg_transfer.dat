50|$|This species' {{method of}} {{breeding}} was misunderstood {{for quite some time}} due to difficulties in making in situ observations. At first, the urogenital positioning of the pirate perch was speculated to serve to promote <b>egg</b> <b>transfer</b> to the fish's gill (branchial) chamber for gill-brooding. However, the pirate perch was found to not brood bronchially; instead, they lay their eggs within underwater root masses which are then fertilized by the males. Nevertheless, a unique spawning behavior has been observed, which has been referred to as transbranchioral ("through the gill chamber"). When the eggs are laid, they are transferred directly from the urogenital to the gill chamber and then spat out through the mouth into the substrate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{expected}} {{proportion of}} males in androdioecious populations (those comprised {{of males and}} hermaphrodites) largely depends on the fertilization opportunities of males. If male mating opportunities are low due to restricted access to hermaphroditic eggs, then pop-ulations will be hermaphrodite-biased. Hermaphrodites have two mechanisms available to limit male mating success: (1) pre-mating barriers to outcrossing, in which hermaphrodites choose not to pair with males and (2) post-mating barriers to outcrossing, in which hermaphrodite sperm has greater access to eggs than male sperm. In this study, we measured male mating success in the androdioecious clam shrimp Eulimnadia texana when pre-mating barriers to outcrossing were removed. These branchiopod crustaceans are small (5 - 8 mm), filter feeders that live in ephemeral pools in the deserts of the southwestern United States. Using genetic markers, we measured male mating success in laboratory experiments in two populations of these shrimp. We correlated mating success with clasping time, clasping during <b>egg</b> <b>transfer,</b> and male thrusting during <b>egg</b> <b>transfer.</b> Males fertilized an average of 24 - 40 % of the her-maphrodites ’ eggs.

40|$|The {{importance}} of pre- and postovulatory ovarian steroid secretion on egg transport {{through the entire}} oviduct was studied in the rabbit. Estrous New Zealand rabbits were induced to ovulate with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), had eggs transferred to the oviducts, were bilaterally ovariectomized and had eggs transferred to the oviducts, or were induced to ovulate with hCG and were bilaterally ovariectomized shortly after ovulation. Groups of animals so treated were sacrificed at either 48 h or 72 h after ovulation or <b>egg</b> <b>transfer.</b> The oviductal recovery of eggs and the distance traveled by the eggs was determined. Eggs transferred to the oviducts of estrous rabbits were transported rapidly; only 15. 9 ± 9. 7 percent of the eggs could be recovered from the oviducts of estrous rabbits 48 h after transfer. In contrast, between 72 percent and 86 percent of the eggs were still located in the oviducts in the other groups sacrificed at a similar time. By 72 h after <b>egg</b> <b>transfer</b> or ovulation no eggs {{could be found in}} the oviducts of estrous rabbits, and only & 6 ± 4. 8 percent of the eggs were located in the oviducts of rabbits induced to ovulate with hCG. However, if estrous rabbits were bilaterally ovariectomized immediately before <b>egg</b> <b>transfer</b> or were ovariectomized shortly after hCG-induced ovulation approximately 40 percent of the eggs were still located in the oviducts at 72 h. The results demonstrate that egg transport through the entire oviduct is fastest in estrous rabbits, and that acute steroid withdrawal (ovariectomy) and normal preovulatory steroid changes act to impede egg transport rates. However, steroid withdrawal by itself is not sufficient to cause normal egg transport. It appears that preovulatory steroid surges are important for subsequent normal egg transport. When rabbits were ovariectomized shortly after ovulation egg transport was delayed. The data suggest that preovulatory steroid surges and/or steroid withdrawal induce an impeding effect on egg transport, and that postovulatory steroid secretion changes are essential to overcome this impeding effect and facilitate normal egg transport through the entire oviduct...|$|E

During the {{breeding}} seasons 1957 - 58 and 1958 - 59, {{a total of}} 280 fertilized eggs collected from Suffolk and Welsh Mountain ewes, mated to rams of their own breeds, was transferred at rates of either two or five eggs per animal to the Fallopian tubes or uterine horns of eighty Suffolk recipient ewes. Half of the recipients had been pre-treated with injections of 1500 i. u. PMS in order to induce superovula-tion. The survival and development of <b>transferred</b> <b>eggs,</b> however, {{was found to be}} unaffected either by superovulation or by the breed of <b>eggs</b> <b>transferred.</b> Overall prenatal mortality was divided into two periods (1) up to 17 or 18 days and referred to throughout as embryonic mortality or loss, and (2) 17 or 18 days to term, referred to as foetal mortality or loss. Two peaks of embryonic mortality were observed, one occurring before and the other after attachment of embryos to the endometrium. Embryonic death accounted for almost all the prenatal mortality and the majority of the loss occurred before attachment. Foetal mortality occurring later than the 17 th or 18 th day of pregnancy was negligible. The proportion of recipients becoming pregnant was the same in the groups which received two eggs and the group which received five eggs, but the ovum-survival rate following the <b>transfer</b> of five <b>eggs</b> was sig¬ nificantly lower than that following the <b>transfer</b> of two <b>eggs.</b> However, those ewes which received five eggs and subsequently became pregnant had significantly more lambs at term and normal embryos at autopsy than those which received only two eggs.

40|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>transfer</b> {{experiments}} have consistently {{failed to find}} differences among sheep breeds {{in their ability to}} support a given number of fertilised eggs. The literature on egg survival rate in pregnant, multiple ovulating ewes is also remarkably consistent across a wide range of breeds and environments in terms of the ratio of foetuses (or lambs) to corpora lutea. Two reports on egg survival in ewes of the same breed but genetically different ovulation rates have also failed to demonstrate differences in egg survival. It is concluded that there is no gentic variation among ewes in their ability to support a given number of fertilised eggs (within the range l- 6). It follows, therefore, that the genetic correlation between litter size and ovulation rate is unity. Consequently, selection for increased litter size is really using litter size as an index of ovulation rate. It is shown that the efficiency of this index is a function of average ovulation rate and declines as ovulation rate increases...|$|E
40|$|The sexual {{behavior}} of Drosophila melanogaster gynandromorphs was studied {{to analyze the}} relationship between different steps in the female reproductive pathway. It was assumed that, in some gynandromorphs, certain female functions are missing because the corresponding control sites (foci) are either composed of male tissue or did not develop. A given gynandromorph can show elements of {{both male and female}} reproductive pathways. None of the steps of the female reproductive pathway appeared to be dependent on any other, in contrast to male behavior where, for example, following of females is a prerequisite for attempted copulation. By correlating each of the behaviors with the genotype of the cuticle, we confirmed previous findings that the focus for the female sex appeal is located in the abdomen, but receptivity to copulation is controlled by a site in the head. Many of the gynandromorphs did not lay eggs, presumably because either the focus controlling <b>egg</b> <b>transfer</b> from the ovaries to the uterus or the one controlling egg deposition was composed of male tissue. Many of the nonovipositing gynandromorphs laid eggs while dying or could be induced to deposit eggs after implantation of hormone-producing glands or topical application of a juvenile hormone analog. Some of the noninseminated gynandromorphs laid eggs at the rate characteristic for inseminated females, suggesting that an oviposition focus (mapping in the head region) suppresses oviposition in virgin females, but not in gynandromorphs whose focus is composed of male tissue. Some of the inseminated gynandromorphs oviposited eggs at a low rate, possibly because the focus responsible for detection of insemination could not function properly. Some of the inseminated gynandromorphs laid unfertilized eggs, revealing the importance of the focus controlling sperm release from the seminal receptacle. Foci controlling <b>egg</b> <b>transfer,</b> egg deposition and sperm release are located in the thorax, according to mosaic fate mapping results and studies on the reproductive behavior of decapitated females.

In contrast, Humphrey(1969), also working with the mouse, furnished direct evidence showing that priming with oestrogen was not necessary for implantation. Finn & Martin (1970) argued that Humphrey was able to obtain implantation because the nidatory oestrogen surge was preceded by 4 days of progesterone treatment, and, had the progesterone treatment been shorter, oestrogen priming would have been necessary for implantation.
