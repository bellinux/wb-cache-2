5|$|Critical {{response}} to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized {{his relationship with}} Vincent as an <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; {{it was the first}} depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of the exact nature of Chad's sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{cooperation}} between the Mongols and their Christian subjects in Antioch, other Christians in the Levant regarded the Mongol approach with unease. Jacques Pantaléon, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, saw the Mongols as a clear threat, and had written to the Pope to warn him about them in 1256. The Franks did, however, send the Dominican David of Ashby {{to the court of}} Hulagu in 1260. In Sidon, Julian Grenier, Lord of Sidon and Beaufort, described by his contemporaries as <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> light-headed, took an opportunity to raid and plunder the area of the Beqaa Valley in Mongol territory. One of the Mongols killed was Kitbuqa's nephew, and in retaliation, Kitbuqa raided the city of Sidon. These events added to the level of distrust between the Mongols and the Crusader forces, whose own center of power was now in the coastal city of Acre.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the physical component of stigmatization exists an association of homeless people with mental illness. Many people consider the mentally ill to be <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> childlike and treat them with fear and exclusion, using their mental incapacitation as justification for why they should be left out of communities.|$|E

25|$|Public opinion {{during the}} strike was divided and varied greatly in {{different}} regions. When {{asked in a}} Gallup poll in July 1984 whether their sympathies lay mainly with the employers or the miners, 40% said employers; 33% were for the miners; 19% were for neither and 8% did not know. When {{asked the same question}} during 5–10 December 1984, 51% had most sympathy for the employers; 26% for the miners; 18% for neither and 5% did not know. When asked in July 1984 whether they approved or disapproved of the methods used by the miners, 15% approved; 79% disapproved and 6% did not know.

25|$|An {{analysis}} of the events by the International Strategic Studies Association described the deployment of an Aegis cruiser in the zone as <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> felt that the value placed on Aegis cruisers by the US Navy had played a major part {{in the setting of}} a low threshold for opening fire. Vincennes had been nicknamed 'Robocruiser' by crew members and other US Navy ships, both in reference to its Aegis system, and to the supposed aggressive tendencies of its captain.|$|E

When the Mongol general Kitbuqa sent his nephew with a small force to obtain redress, they were ambushed and killed by Julian. Kitbuqa responded forcefully by raiding the city of Sidon, destroying walls and slaying Christians although it is said that the castle remained untaken.|$|E
25|$|Buchloh's {{critique}} {{has been}} subject to revision. His attention is given to dismantling a mythologized artistic persona and utopian rhetoric, which he regarded to be <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> even (it is implied) proto-fascist. Since Buchloh's essay was written, however, {{a great deal of}} new archival material has come to light. Most significantly, Beuys's proposal for an Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial, submitted in 1958. It has been claimed that the existence of such a project invalidates Buchloh's claim that Beuys retreated from engaging with the Nazi legacy, a point that Buchloh himself has recently acknowledged, although the charges of romanticism and self-mythologizing remain.|$|E

He was fined £1000 by Hampshire and £500 by the ECB. The panel {{considered}} this to be a serious breach of the regulations, particularly given his status as a senior cricketer and club captain. Mascarenhas also stated that he tweeted this after a night out and his actions were stupid and <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> that he regretted any offence it may have caused and that his tweet didn't reflect his true views on Miller.|$|E
25|$|After the Conservative {{government}} tabled {{its fiscal}} update, NDP leader Jack Layton asked his predecessor, Ed Broadbent, to contact former Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien {{to discuss a}} coalition to oust the Conservatives from power. The plan became public almost immediately. Labelling {{the absence of an}} economic stimulus plan as <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> the removal of public funding to parties as an attack against democracy, the opposition threatened to topple the weeks-old government by voting against the fiscal update. The opposition parties counted on the probability that Governor General Michaëlle Jean would invite a Liberal-NDP coalition able to hold the confidence of the House of Commons to form a government, instead of any other options available to her.|$|E
25|$|For {{twenty years}} junior {{minister}} in a Tory government, {{he became the}} most successful of Whig Foreign Secretaries; though always a Conservative, he ended his life by presiding over the transition from Whiggism to Liberalism. He was the exponent of British strength, yet was driven from office for truckling to a foreign despot; he preached the Balance of Power, yet helped to inaugurate the policy of isolation and of British withdrawal from Europe. <b>Irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> flippant, {{he became the first}} hero of the serious middle-class electorate. He reached high office solely through an irregular family connection; he retained it through skilful use of the press—the only Prime Minister to become an accomplished leader-writer.|$|E

25|$|During November {{a series}} of floods {{affected}} many parts of Britain. On 22 November a man died after his car was washed down a flooded brook in Chew Stoke, Somerset and trapped against a small bridge. A 26-year-old man was also killed as his car overturned in torrential rain in Devon. In Sonning, Berkshire a 91-year-old was apparently witnessed to have gone swimming in the flooded Thames and was missing, feared dead. A Downing Street spokesman said that 300 properties were flooded in 24 hours in England and Wales on 22 November. Heavy rains led to overtopping of the Grand Western Canal near to Halberton, Devon forcing homes to be evacuated as the canal wall breached, spilling the canal contents on lower land. The Environment Agency and Police via the media stressed that motorists should take great care when driving through flood waters after {{a series of}} fatalities involving motorists during the flooding of 2012. In Welney, Norfolk a man who posted a video of driving a 4x4 vehicle through deep floodwaters along the closed A1101 road online, was branded as <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> dangerous by Norfolk Police. While Cambridgeshire Police said that drivers who drove through floods and got stuck could face prosecution, after several vehicles were stranded in floodwaters.|$|E
25|$|Sada Abe {{was born}} in 1905. Her mother doted on Sada, who was her {{youngest}} surviving child, and allowed her to do as she wished. She encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the shamisen, both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with geishas and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor. Geishas were considered glamorous celebrities at the time, and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her musical lessons, and wearing stylish make-up. As family problems over her siblings, sister Teruko and brother Shintaro, became more pressing, Abe was often sent {{out of the house}} alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers. At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, she was raped by one of her acquaintances. Her parents initially defended and supported her, but she became a difficult teenager. As she became more <b>irresponsible</b> <b>and</b> uncontrollable, her parents sold her to a geisha house in Yokohama in 1922, hoping to find her a place in society with some direction. Toku Abe, Sada's oldest sister, testified that Sada wished to become a geisha. Sada herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity.|$|E

Anti-censorship groups criticised the attacks, saying they hurt their cause. A purported spokesperson for the attackers recommended that the wider Australian public protest the filter by signing the petition of Electronic Frontiers Australia.|$|E
