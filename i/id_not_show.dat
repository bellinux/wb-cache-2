40|$|Lesions of the parieto-occipital {{junction}} (POJ) {{in humans}} cause gross deviations of reaching movements and impaired grip formation if the targets {{are located in}} the subjects peripheral visual field. Movements to central targets are typically less impaired. This disorder has been termed optic ataxia. It has been suggested that a general deficit of online corrections under central as well as peripheral viewing conditions might be sufficient to explain this discrepancy. According to this hypothesis, patients with optic ataxia should demonstrate an impaired online correction of grip aperture under central viewing conditions if the target object changes its size during the grasping movement. We investigated this prediction in a patient with optic ataxia (I. G.) in a virtual visuo-haptic grasping task. We imposed an isolated need for online corrections of the hand aperture independently of positional changes of the target object. While we found some general inaccuracies of her grasping movements, the patient d <b>id</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> a specific impairment of online adjustment of grip aperture. On the contrary, I. G. smoothly adjusted her grip aperture comparable to healthy subjects. A general deficit of fast movement correction affecting targets in peripheral as well as central visual fields thus does not appear to account for the overt visuomotor deficits in optic ataxia. Rather, it seems more likely that an anatomical dissociation between visuomotor pathways related to actions in the central and in the peripheral visual field underlies the dissociation of visuomotor performance depending on the retinotopic target position in optic ataxia...|$|E

30|$|Although General Didactics (GD) and Instructional Design (<b>ID)</b> have <b>not</b> <b>shown</b> {{many points}} of contact in the past, {{there are some}} obvious parellels from the {{perspective}} of their historical development. This will be examined in detail in this article. More specifically, we speak about model building, which has characterized General Didactics and Instructional Design for some decades. However, the models of General Didactics and Instructional Design are not problem-free with regard to the continuity and advancement of both disciplines. First, we will describe the historical roots of both disciplines and examine which elements of theory are of central importance. Second, we will try to answer the question of which kind of model building could be considered as predominant and what problems result from this predominance. In order to do this, we will describe empirical studies on the use of instructional models and discuss these studies {{from the perspective of}} the philosophy of science. Third, we will draw inferences for future processes of model building in order to prevent the same problems that happened in the past from happening again. Finally, we will discuss the issue of what General Didactics can learn from Instructional Design and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTTo evaluate, {{by means}} of histomorphometry, {{terminal}} vertebral plate thickness, intervertebral disc thickness and its correlation on different age groups, seeking to identify its correlation. Methods: C 4 -C 5 and C 5 -C 6 cervical segments removed from human cadavers of both genders were assessed and divided into five groups of 10 -year age intervals, from 21 years old. TVP and intervertebral disc thickness evaluation was made {{by means of}} histomorphometry of histological slides stained with hematoxylin and eosyn. Lower C 4 TVP, upper C 5 TVP, and upper C 6 TVP de were compared between {{each other and to}} the interposed intervertebral disc thickness between relevant TVP. Results: The thickness of terminal vertebral plates adjacent to the same <b>ID</b> did <b>not</b> <b>show</b> statistic differences. However, the comparison of upper and lower vertebral plates thickness on the same cervical vertebra (C 5), showed statistical difference on all age groups studied. We found a statistical correlation coefficient above 80 % between terminal vertebral plate and adjacent intervertebral disc, with a proportional thickness reduction of both structures on the different cervical levels studied, and also on the different age groups assessed. Conclusion: Terminal vertebral plate shows a morphologic correlation with the intervertebral disc next to it, and does <b>not</b> <b>show</b> correlation with the terminal vertebral plate on the same vertebra...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{perinatal}} nutritional iron deficiency (ID) produces learning impairments in children. Research has also shown that catecholamines like epinephrine and norepinephrine play a pivotal role in the consolidation of memories. In this study, we sought to determine if perinatal ID impairs the following: 1) noradrenergic synaptic function in the hippocampus; and 2) several forms of hippocampus-dependent fear learning. Electrophysiological brain slice methods were used to examine noradrenergic-mediated synaptic efficacy in the CA 1 -hippocampus of rats that were subjected to perinatal ID or control (CN) diets. Rats were fed ID (3 mg Fe/kg) or CN (45 mg Fe/kg) diets on gestational d 14. These diets were maintained until postnatal d (P) 12 after which all rats were switched to the CN diet. Hippocampal slices were prepared between P 26 and P 30. The noradrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) (1, 2, or 4 μmol) was used to induce modulatory increases in synaptic efficacy in the hippocampal slices. CN slices showed a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy as the result of ISO perfusion in the slice bath, whereas <b>ID</b> slices did <b>not</b> <b>show</b> increases in synaptic efficacy as the result of ISO perfusion. ID and CN groups did not differ when ISO was perfused through slices from adult rats (P 61). Both young and adult ID rats showed reduced levels of hippocampus-dependent fear learning compared with the young and adult CN rats. Together, these findings suggest that ID may impair early forms of noradrenergic-mediated synaptic plasticity, which may in turn play a role in adult learning deficits...|$|R
