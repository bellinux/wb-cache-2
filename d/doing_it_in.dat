25|$|Young's career {{took another}} {{interesting}} twist in 2000 when the Australian cricket federation approached him for help. Fielding {{has long been}} an under-developed aspect of cricket, as teams have concentrated on developing bowlers and batsmen. The Australians, observing how fielding was a central part of baseball, decided to exploit an opportunity by having Young coach their players on catching, throwing and positioning. Young was appointed as an assistant coach up until 2005 when his contract was not renewed and instead moved back to Chicago to manage the Rockford Riverhawks. During the 2005 Ashes series the Australian teams fielding had slipped and lost the Ashes to England {{for the first time since}} 1987. John Buchanan then made the decision for Australia to have a full-time fielding coach and Young became speculated in the media as the first baseball coach to coach a national cricket team and announced he would like to finish his managerial career <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> January 2011, Young came out in support for the United States Youth Cricket Association, modeling the organization's apparel at a photo shoot on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne, only hours before the Aussies were to take on the English in a One Day International match. He is also the current fielding coach of the Indian Premier League team Kings XI Punjab.|$|E
