5|$|The XB-70's maiden <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> on 21 September 1964. In {{the first}} flight test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|A 23.5morgen (20.1hectare) {{piece of}} land two miles east of Roberts Heights was {{acquired}} for an aerodrome and named Zwartkop after a nearby hill. No. 1 <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> formed at Zwartkop Air Force Station on 26 April 1920, equipped with DH-9s. After {{the formation of a}} second flight, 1 Squadron was established in early 1922.|$|E
5|$|Black Arrow, officially capitalised BLACK ARROW, was a British {{satellite}} carrier rocket. Developed {{during the}} 1960s, {{it was used}} for four launches between 1969 and 1971. Its final <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{the first and only}} successful orbital launch to be conducted by the United Kingdom, and placed the Prospero satellite into low Earth orbit.|$|E
25|$|More than 280 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> {{cancelled}} at Heathrow airport, over 120 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled at Doncaster Sheffield Airport and 80 more <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled due {{to health}} and safety reasons at Manchester Airport. Many <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> delayed at Ireland's airports {{on the morning of}} 19 January due to the high winds in Ireland, however by afternoon they were delayed because of high winds elsewhere in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|...Notes: <b>Flights</b> <b>are</b> routed Keflavik-Bergen-Stavanger-Keflavik. <b>Flights</b> <b>are</b> routed Stavanger-Sandefjord-Copenhagen. This <b>is</b> why the <b>flight</b> {{departs from}} the {{domestic}} terminal.|$|R
25|$|All {{flights in}} and out of Heathrow were halted for a short time after the accident. When {{operations}} resumed, many long-haul outbound <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> either delayed or cancelled, and all short-haul <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled {{for the rest of the}} day. Some inbound <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> delayed, and 24 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> diverted to Gatwick, Luton and Stansted. In an attempt to minimise further travel disruptions, Heathrow Airport received dispensation from the Department for Transport to operate some night flights. Even so, the following day (18 January) a total of 113 short-haul <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled due to crews and aircraft being out of position.|$|R

5|$|The 1945 Japan–Washington <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> a record-breaking air voyage made {{by three}} {{specially}} modified Boeing B-29 Superfortresses on September 18–19, 1945, {{from the northern}} Japanese island of Hokkaidō to Chicago in the Midwestern United States, continuing to Washington, D.C. The <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> made by three United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) generals and other airmen returning to the United States from their overseas duty after World War II. At that date, it involved the heaviest load carried by an American aircraft (144,000lb, 65,300kg), the longest nonstop flight made by the USAAF (5,840mi, 9,400km), and the first nonstop flight from Japan to the United States made with a complete aircraft. However the flight did not break the then-world distance record established by the Royal Air Force in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was a 5-year-old Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation with 17,224 airframe hours. It carried 11 American civilian crew members and 96 military passengers. The <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{operated by the}} Flying Tiger Line as Military Air Transport Service (MATS) Charter flight 739.|$|E
2500|$|Charter <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> {{operated}} from Manston by Seguro Travel Limited, {{operating as}} [...] "Kent Escapes". The 2007 Kent Escapes <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> operated by Sky Wings using a McDonnell Douglas MD-80. Seguro then swapped operators on 16 August because of problems. The <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> {{taken over by}} BMI for a period. At {{the end of the}} season, <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> operated by Futura, a Spanish-based airline, using the Boeing 737. Futura Airlines ceased trading during September 2008 and Seguro Travel on 10 September 2008.|$|R

5|$|The club's widest victory {{margin in}} the league was their 11–1 win against Carlisle United in the Third Division North on 14 January 1939. Their biggest win in the top <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{achieved}} on 28 December 2013, with a 6–0 victory over Fulham.|$|E
5|$|The {{first flight}} by an RAAF C-17 to Antarctica was {{conducted}} in November 2015. The aircraft transported supplies for the Australian Antarctic Division from Hobart to Wilkins Runway, and its crew practised evacuating casualties from Wilkins after the cargo was unloaded. This <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> reported {{to have been the}} first time the RAAF had flown missions to the Australian Antarctic Territory since the Antarctic <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn in 1963. Further flights occurred in early 2016. A trial winter airdrop was also conducted at Casey Station in June that year. In September 2017 air-to-air refuelling was used to enable a Globemaster to drop supplies at Davis Station.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{was the first}} trans-Atlantic hijacking since five Croatian nationalists hijacked TWA Flight 355 on September 10, 1976. In that incident, the domestic New York-Chicago <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> forced to fly to Paris, France.|$|E

5|$|American Airlines Flight 77 was a {{scheduled}} American Airlines domestic transcontinental passenger flight from Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, to Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California. The Boeing 757-223 aircraft serving the <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> hijacked by five men affiliated with al-Qaeda on September 11, 2001, {{as part of}} the September 11 attacks. They deliberately crashed the plane into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building.|$|E
5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, the <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{cleared for}} the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} {{approach to the}} airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E

25|$|Nine of {{the planned}} <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled. Suborbital <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> planned for four other astronauts {{but the number of}} <b>flights</b> <b>was</b> cut down {{gradually}} and finally all remaining were cancelled after Titov's <b>flight.</b> Mercury-Atlas 9 <b>was</b> intended to be followed by more one-day flights and even a three-day flight but with the coming of the Gemini Project it seemed unnecessary. The Jupiter booster was, as mentioned above, intended to be used for different purposes.|$|R
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work.|$|E

North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting, supplied by the North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company. Street lights were provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, {{as well as by the}} provision of an electricity supply.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} {{as possible to}} speed up construction, but the first <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. It eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|E
