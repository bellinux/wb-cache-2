The National Trust has reported this problem in a number of buildings under their ownership, and developed solutions and fine-tuned their maintenance programme so as to minimise indoor and surface mould growth risk. This paper reports findings from an extensive mould-testing scheme in Blickling Hall, a National Trust property in Norfolk, England, for an appraisal of airborne and surface mould levels within a total of eight rooms, including the famous Long <b>Gallery.</b> The <b>testing</b> protocol used combines active (aggressive) air sampling and surface sampling, analysis of the β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) activity to quantify mould levels and particle counting. The results show that the airborne mould levels are quite low in all spaces, due to satisfactory maintenance of indoor hygrothermal conditions by conservation heating. On the other hand, while the National Trust’s developed solutions and maintenance programme have proved effective to avoid surface mould growth in those locations that historically suffered from microbial activity (such as behind book presses, picture frames and tapestries), the results show that the surface cleaning around windows should be improved to tackle surface water due to condensation, which is considered to be the main driver behind high surface NAHA activity obtained in these areas.|$|R

Some of the cone calorimeter test results were {{compared with those of}} the horizontally ventilated laboratory-scale <b>gallery</b> fire <b>test</b> and the oxygen index test which had been previously conducted on these samples.

In addition, the heat and smoke release properties of the cable samples also depended mostly on the type of the main base polymer of the sheath ma-terial. The correlations between the flame propagation property in the duct fire test and the peak heat release rate in the cone calorimeter test were un-clear. On the other hand, there appeared to be relatively good correlations be-tween the minimum O 2 and maximum CO 2 concentrations in the exhaust gas in the duct fire test and the peak heat release rate in the cone calorimeter test.

Indeed, the highest score (92 % of correct identification) is obtained by Prince et al. [21], on {{a gallery of}} only 100 individuals.

Unlike the approach proposed by Prince et al. [21], which requires 14 landmarks, our technique needs only four landmarks. It is worth noting that though these four landmarks may be detected automatically, the manual annotation is adopted to be sure that identification errors are inherent to choices of the approach rather than to eventual erroneous landmark detection. Reducing the number of landmarks from 14 to 4, allows not only a gain in execution time but an increase in the identification rate, which is advantageous for a practical use.|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{absorbed dose}} rate and photon fluence rate distributions in rock salt around 30 testwise emplaced canisters containing high-level radioactive material (HAW project) and around a single canister containing radioactive material {{of a lower}} activity level (INHAW experiment). The site of this test emplacement was located in <b>test</b> <b>galleries</b> at the 800 -m-level in the Asse salt mine. The data given were calculated using a Monte Carlo method simulating photon transport in complex geometries of differently composed materials. The aim of these calculations was to enable determination of the dose absorbed in any arbitrary sample of salt to be further examined in the future with sufficient reliability. The geometry of the test arrangement, the materials involved and the calculational method are characterised {{and the results are}} shortly described and some figures presenting selected results are shown. In the appendices, the results for emplacement of the highly radioactive canisters are given in tabular form. (orig.)
