40|$|Background: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the current status of the occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) in the construction industry and the effect of OHSMS on accident rates. Differences of awareness levels on safety issues among site <b>general</b> <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> occupational health <b>and</b> safety (OHS) <b>managers</b> are identified through surveys. Methods: The accident rates for the OHSMS-certified construction companies from 2006 to 2011, when the construction OHSMS became widely available, were analyzed to understand the effect of OHSMS on the work-related injury rates in the construction industry. The Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency 18001 is the certification to these companies performing OHSMS in South Korea. The questionnaire was created to analyze the differences of OHSMS awareness between site <b>general</b> <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> OHS <b>managers</b> of construction companies. Results: The implementation of OHSMS among the top 100 construction companies in South Korea shows that the accident rate decreased by 67 % and the fatal accident rate decreased by 10. 3 % during the period from 2006 to 2011. The survey in this study shows different OHSMS awareness levels between site <b>general</b> <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> OHS <b>managers.</b> The differences were motivation for developing OHSMS, external support needed for implementing OHSMS, problems and effectiveness of implementing OHSMS. Conclusion: Both work-related accident and fatal accident rates were found to be significantly reduced by implementing OHSMS in this study. The differences of OHSMS awareness between site <b>general</b> <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> OHS <b>managers</b> were identified through a survey. The effect of these differences on safety and other benefits warrants further research with proper data collection...|$|R
