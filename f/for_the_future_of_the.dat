5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe. If the mass {{density of the}} universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state {{similar to that in}} which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{the board}} of {{trustees}} took the controversial decision to close the theatre for refurbishment. Many members of the theatre profession feared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Vic. Following several public meetings in the winter of 2007/2008 a newly formed board of trustees appointed Dick Penny, the director of the Watershed Media Centre as executive chairman.|$|E

5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a positive sign <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism also triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Gebhard's conversion had widespread implications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire's electoral process, established by the Golden Bull of 1356. The council continued {{for more than a}} year, and eventually moved to other cities; although several times they seemed close to negotiating a conclusion to the crisis, a successful agreement remained beyond their reach. They also offered Gebhard a sum of money to relinquish his claim, which he refused on the high moral grounds of religious principle.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before {{returning}} to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} consumer advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms {{in the wake of the}} U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state.|$|E

5|$|Announcing plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British {{military}} on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed {{plans to}} reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft, and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice. PA02, the second development MRA4, achieved its first flight in December 2004 and {{was used to test}} elements of the mission system and the air vehicle. BAE Systems received a contract worth £1.1 billion for 12 MRA4s on 18 July 2006; three were to be development aircraft and nine more converted to production standard. The Nimrod MRA4 successfully released the Sting Ray torpedo {{for the first time on}} 30 July 2007.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{received}} a commission from Calvert as the colony's Attorney General on July 18, 1688, and {{arrived in the}} colony in October 1688. En route, Carroll changed his family motto from In fide et in bello forte (strong in faith and war) to Ubicumque cum libertate (anywhere {{so long as there}} be freedom). Soon after he left, the Protestant William of Orange invaded England, James II fled, and Parliament—which had been leery of James' Catholicism—recognized William and his wife Mary as the new King and Queen two weeks after Carroll's arrival in Maryland. This event, known as the Glorious Revolution, had profound implications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maryland colony and for Carroll.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spitfire, {{many of the}} {{production}} jigs and machine tools had already been relocated by 20 September, and steps were being taken to disperse production to small facilities throughout the Southampton area. To this end, the British government requisitioned the likes of Vincent's Garage in Station Square Reading, which later specialised in manufacturing Spitfire fuselages, and Anna Valley Motors, Salisbury, which was to become the sole producer of the wing leading-edge fuel tanks for photo-reconnaissance Spitfires, as well as producing other components. A purpose-built works, specialising in manufacturing fuselages and installing engines, was built at Star Road, Caversham in Reading. The drawing office in which all Spitfire designs were drafted was relocated to Hursley Park, near Southampton. This site also had an aircraft assembly hangar where many prototype and experimental Spitfires were assembled, but since it had no associated aerodrome no Spitfires ever flew from Hursley.|$|E

5|$|In April 2003, a Japanese {{television}} advertisement {{revealed that}} both Mother 3 and a combined Mother 1+2 cartridge were in {{development for the}} handheld Game Boy Advance. Mother 3 abandoned the Nintendo 64 version's 3D, but kept its plot. It became a bestseller upon its Japanese release in 2006, yet did not receive a North American release {{on the basis that}} it would not sell. Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi stated that he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, as Mother 1, Mother 1+2 and Mother 3 were not released outside Japan. Despite this, Ness's recurrence in the Super Smash Bros. series signaled favorable odds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mother series.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Commissioner Perry had {{put forward}} three options <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mounted police: the force could be {{absorbed into the}} Canadian military; the remit of the force could be reduced to simply {{policing}} the far north; or the force could be assigned a much wider role in public and secret policing across the whole of Canada. Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be unacceptable to Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for the force.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E

5|$|Stone brought Terry Hayes {{to write}} the {{screenplay}} entitled Return of the Apes. Set in the near future, a plague is making humans extinct. Geneticist Will Robinson discovers the plague is a genetic time bomb embedded in the Stone Age. He time travels with a pregnant colleague named Billie Rae Diamond {{to a time when}} Palaeolithic humans were at war <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet with highly evolved apes. The apes' supreme commander is a gorilla named Drak. Robinson and Billie Rae discover a young human girl named Aiv (pronounced Eve) to be the next step in evolution. It is revealed that it was the apes that created the virus to destroy the human race. They protect her from the virus, thus ensuring the survival of the human race 102,000 years later. Billie Rae gives birth to a baby boy named Adam.|$|E
5|$|The British and French {{struggles in}} India became but one theatre {{of the global}} Seven Years' War (1756–1763) {{involving}} France, Britain and the other major European powers. The signing of the Treaty of Paris (1763) had important consequences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert's Land, and the ceding of New France to Britain (leaving a sizeable French-speaking population under British control) and Louisiana to Spain. Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Along with its victory over France in India, the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful maritime power.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire. His conversion had widespread implications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire's electoral process established by the Golden Bull of 1356. In this process, seven Imperial Electors—the four secular electors of Bohemia, Brandenburg, the Palatinate, and Saxony; and the three ecclesiastical electors of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne—selected an emperor. The presence {{of at least three}} inherently Catholic electors, who collectively governed some of the most prosperous ecclesiastical territories in the Empire, guaranteed the delicate balance of Catholics and Protestants in the voting; only one other elector needed to vote for a Catholic candidate, ensuring that future emperors would remain in the so-called Old Faith. The possibility of one of those electors shifting to the Protestant side, and of that elector producing an heir to perpetuate this shift, would change the balance in the electoral college in favor of the Protestants.|$|E

5|$|Waterfall Gully Road is {{meandering}} and in {{some parts}} quite narrow. This has led to concerns regarding safety, as the road is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists. After {{the death of a}} cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair and resurfacing of the road intensified, with two petitions being tabled in parliament. The accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by TransportSA, and although the results were not released to the public at the time, it called for an investigation of {{the entire length of the}} road. As of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, with the road missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.|$|E
5|$|Eberle {{made his}} NHL debut with the Oilers on October 7, 2010, against the Calgary Flames. He {{recorded}} his first goal, on the penalty kill {{in the third}} period, deking past defenceman Ian White on a two-on-one before scoring on a backhand deke past goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff. The goal was later voted by fans as the NHL's Goal of the Year on the League's Facebook page, as well as Play of the Year on The Sports Network's website. He later added an assist on the powerplay, taking a shot that deflected off teammate Shawn Horcoff's shinpads. The Oilers {{went on to win}} the game 4–0. Eberle was named the first star of the game. Later in the season, Eberle suffered a high ankle sprain after colliding with opposing forward Aleš Kotalík during a game against the Flames on January 1, 2011. While sidelined with the injury, he underwent an unrelated emergency appendectomy four days later. Missing 13 games with his ankle injury, he returned to action in early February. During a game against the Vancouver Canucks late in the season, on April 5, Eberle received a hit to the head from opposing forward Raffi Torres. While Eberle was not injured on the play, Torres received a four-game suspension for the hit. Eberle finished the season with 43 points (18 goals and 25 assists) in 69 games, leading his team in scoring and ranking sixth among league rookies. Though the Oilers finished with the worst record in the NHL for the second straight year, expectations remained high in Edmonton <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team, as Eberle's success as a rookie was matched by the performance of fellow first-year forwards Taylor Hall and Magnus Pääjärvi.|$|E
