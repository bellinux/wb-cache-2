50|$|Other {{significant}} differences exist {{depending on the}} time period of the data and formula used for calculating growing degree-days. First, to be comparable <b>growing</b> <b>degree-day</b> numbers from various sources need {{to come from the}} same time period. Due to both a variable climate and climate change, a comparison of a ten-year period from the 1970s and the 2000s would be inappropriate as the variation and trends over time would make them incomparable. Furthermore, a sufficient time period is suggested to allow the averaging to smooth out some of the variability. The standard time period in use is the climatological normal period of 30 years, however if 30 years of data is not available then at the minimum five years should be used. However a five-year period is not directly comparable to a 30-year period. How data are averaged (i.e., hourly, daily, or monthly) is also very important. While weather stations today can average data to an hour, a minutes or even seconds, historical data used to calculate growing degree-days has been done mostly on daily or monthly averages (the table above was done using monthly climatological normals). Shorter term averaging to minutes, or more commonly hourly, arguably better reflects the true thermal effects on the crops, but will result in <b>growing</b> <b>degree-day</b> values that are lower than both daily and monthly. Monthly averaged data can be very problematic as it can underestimate heat accumulation during the first and last months of the growing season. Therefore, it is paramount that one know the time period that the <b>growing</b> <b>degree-day</b> values are calculated from so as to be comparable.|$|E

50|$|The Winkler index {{uses the}} {{standard}} method of calculating growing degree-days in viticulture {{and is based}} on using a base temperature of 50 °F (10 °C) with no upper temperature cut-off. The first issue is that 50 °F (10 °C) is not likely the best base temperature even though it is the most commonly used value. Even the early research on this topicstressed that the base temperature threshold for accumulation for early versus late budding varieties is likely strongly cultivar specific. Various research worldwide has pointed to base temperatures ranging from 39 to 45 °F (4 to 7 °C), but there has been little confirmation of these thresholds across numerous wine regions and for a wider range of varieties. At {{the other end of the}} formula, the calculation for growing degree-days used in viticulture and wine production does not normally use an upper cut-off. Conceptually an upper cut-off would be applied if the plant system stopped being photosynthetically active at some point due to heat stress from high temperatures. While this may be proven for some crops, there is not a universal number for an upper threshold for grapes so the majority of the published data for comparison purposes in viticulture and wine production does not limit maximum temperatures. This issue is problematic because many weather stations today have integrated the corn <b>growing</b> <b>degree-day</b> method in their software. The corn <b>growing</b> <b>degree-day</b> method uses both a base temperature adjustment and an upper threshold, neither of which are common in viticulture and wine production use, and can confound any comparison with published data using the simple average method.|$|E

They help determine when to apply pesticides for the best control of pests and when to harvest the first cutting of alfalfa for the highest quality hay. What are <b>growing</b> <b>degree-days?</b> <b>Growing</b> <b>degree-days</b> (GDD) {{is a measure of}} the amount of heat needed for plants, insects, and microorganisms to grow and develop. If a plant or insect is too cold, it cannot grow. However, at some minimum temperature, growth begins. The warmer the plant or insect is, the faster it grows up to a maximum temperature when growth stops. Growth and development rates of plants, insects, or microorganisms are assumed to be roughly linear between the minimum and maximum threshold temperatures. Temperatures above the threshold maximum may cause it to stop growth and development or that the rate of change remains constant. For each day that the average temperature is one degree above the minimum temperature, one degree day accumulates. Degree-days (24 -hour period) provide an estimate of the growth stage of a plant, insect, or microorganism based on temperature measurements. The warmer the weather, the faster degree-days accumulate until the maximum threshold temperature is reached. GDD start to accumulate on the biofix (beginning) date of January 1 each year. For example, the minimum threshold temperature for alfalfa growth is 42 °F and the maximum threshold temperature for alfalfa is 110 °F. If the day's high and low were 93 °F and 51 °F respectively, then the average daily temperature of 72 °F for the day would result in an accumulation of 30 GDD (72 °F- 42 °F = 30 GDD). If the average temperatures were to go below 42 °F threshold or above 110 °F threshold, no GDD would accumulate. The average daily temperature is calculated by adding the days high and low together and dividing the result by two; then to get degree-days subtract the minimum developmental threshold temperature (Sakamoto...|$|R

Modeled thermal time to peak, i. e., AGDD at peak GDD, showed a strong inverse linear trend with respect to latitude with r 2 of 0. 92 for Russia and Kazakhstan and 0. 81 for Ukraine. MODIS VIs tracked similar seasonal responses in time and space and were highly correlated across the growing season with r 2 > 0. 95.

Later flush-shoot growth depended on the number of leaves retained on the parent shoot, {{the presence or absence of}} a connection to the tree below the parent shoot, and on the season, declining with limiting <b>growing</b> <b>degree-days</b> in winter and accelerating with increasing <b>growing</b> <b>degree-days</b> in summer. In both seasons, reserves beyond the parent (previous season 2 ̆ 7 s) shoot contributed the major source of carbohydrate for continuing flush-shoot growth, and particularly the growth of leaves. The combinations of seasonal conditions, shoot parameters before the commencement of flush-shoot growth, and flush-shoot morphology permit the inference of allometric relationships that can be applied to the quantitative modelling of vegetative shoot morphology and growth in macadamia...|$|R
40|$|Timothy (Phleum pratense L.) was {{elevated}} in 1988 and 1989 at four {{locations of}} differing latitude in southern and northern Quebec and northeastern Ontario {{to determine whether}} latitude influences nutritional quality. Three cultivars of timothy (Salvo, Champ and Bounty) were evaluated at various growth stages. The following quality components were examined: neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), hemicellulose (HEM), crude protein (CP), and in vitro dry matter digestibility. Differences in quality among the locations were measured for the growth stages that were common to all sites. The rate of change in quality with advancing phenological development was also examined to determine differences among locations. The results indicated that {{there were significant differences}} in quality among the locations. Although quality was not consistently better for either the northern or southern locations, it showed a tendency to be superior at the southern locations. Locations with the highest dry matter yields were also observed to have inferior forage quality. The rate of change in quality at the locations was not homogeneous {{for the majority of the}} quality components. At the northern locations, the rate of change in quality was generally greater than the southern sites. The rate of change in forage quality with <b>growing</b> <b>degree-days</b> was, in general, greater at the northern locations. Furthermore, timothy at the northern locations reached the same level of a given quality component at a lower accumulation of <b>growing</b> <b>degree-days</b> than at the southern locations...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 North American {{cultivation}} of Ribes L. may expand as small fruit growers seek species to diversify horticultural crops. The Ribes industry was suppressed for decades {{out of fear}} that cultivated black currants and gooseberries would intensify the fungal disease white pine blister rust (WPBR) on five-needle pine (Pinus L. section Quinquefoliae) species. These pines were historically vital to the timber industry. Today, plant breeders seek to strengthen the Ribes small fruit industry through production of material suitable for North American conditions. Paramount to this effort is the development of resistance against major pests and diseases. Growers must be able to recognize the attributes of available genotypes prior to field establishment. The objectives of this research were to determine disease resistance and phenological characteristics of Ribes selections at the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR) in Corvallis, Oregon. Since the early 1930 's, plant breeders have used immune black currant (R. nigrum L.) germplasm as a control tactic against the exotic WPBR, caused by the basidiomycete fungus Cronartium ribicola J. C. Fischer. In 1999, a seedling population was generated at the NCGR from a cross involving susceptible pistillate R. nigrum 'Ben Lomond' and immune staminate parent R. ussuriense Jancz. x R. nigrum 'Consort. ' To test the inheritance of resistance in the F₁ population, aeciospore and urediniospore treatments were applied in 2008 to single-leaf softwood cuttings under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. Resistant F₁ phenotypes segregated in a 1 : 1 ratio consistent with the pattern of simple dominant inheritance of a single gene. Artificial inoculations testing aeciospore and urediniospore infectivity produced equivalent disease severity in the experimental Ribes genotypes. Resistance to the native powdery mildew fungus, Podosphaera mors-uvae (Schwein.) U. Brown and S. Takamatsu, was also evaluated in the F₁ population. Individuals segregated for resistance in a 1 : 3 ratio after exposure to elevated disease pressure in the greenhouse. Fifteen F₁ genotypes were resistant to both fungal pathogens and are candidates for further breeding trials. In a second study, five years of spring phenological survey data were analyzed using a <b>growing</b> <b>degree-day</b> (GDD) model, with the objective to identify cultivars adapted to North American conditions. Ribes section Calobotrya was the earliest group to reach "first bloom," followed sequentially by R. [superscript]xnidigrolaria Bauer hybrid species, section Symphocalyx, section Grossularia, section Ribes, and lastly, section Botrycarpum. Early and late-flowering accessions were identified for each taxon...|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} issues and limitations {{associated with the}} use of <b>growing</b> <b>degree-days.</b> First, the Winkler index and its classification of climate regions by <b>growing</b> <b>degree-days</b> only describe one aspect of an area's climate—mean daily temperature. Many other important factors which contribute to a region's suitability for viticulture (and its terroir) are excluded; among them sun exposure, latitude, precipitation, soil conditions, and the risk of extreme weather which might damage grapevines (e.g., winter freezes, spring and fall frosts, hail, etc.). As originally developed the climates of California were defined for relatively large areas using only one or two climate stations. This macroscale approach will invariably not capture the microscale influences that are an important aspect of growing any crop. To address these issues research has been increasingly using spatial climate data to better depict within region and even within vineyard differences in climate and therefore ripening and wine style potential. To create spatially appropriate climate data numerous stations and/or sensors are used to collect data which can then be interpolated over the landscape due to known interactions with elevation, aspect, slope, and distance to the coast or other water bodies using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Instead of depicting a region as all one Winkler region (Napa Valley AVA being a Region III for example), spatial data summaries show the Napa Valley having a full range of Winkler regions, 12% a Region II, 56% a Region III, and 30% a Region IV (whereas the table above shows one station in Napa, St. Helena as being a Region IV).|$|R
