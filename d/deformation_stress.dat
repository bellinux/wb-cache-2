40|$|The {{theory of}} the <b>deformation</b> <b>stress</b> state {{is based on the}} actual corpuscular {{structure}} of matter characterized in terms of mechanics by the fact that an increase in the distance of two adjacent atoms is accompanied by the origin of an attractive force and a reduction in their distance by the origin of a repulsive force. These forces differ significantly from the classical internal forces, which are the forces of the mechanics of perfectly solid bodies. These express the equilibrium of forces with reference to the given area within the loaded body, and have no direct deformation effect. This paper defines the quantities of the <b>deformation</b> <b>stress</b> state – the deformation force and the <b>deformation</b> <b>stress</b> – the direct manifestation of which is a deformation. The author introduces the term of <b>deformation</b> <b>stress</b> state theory (DSS theory) to the field of the theory of elasticity dealing with the stress state of deformable bodies. The quantities and the equations of this theory also form the basis for the formulation of the theory of failure, which makes it possible to determine reliably the safety margin and the strength of a multiaxially loaded body from the stress state described by the static quantities (stress tensor) and uniaxial strength. ...|$|E

The mathematical model of AMRSM was established and the basic principle of multi-failure mode sensitivity analysis for reliability with AMRSM was given. The important parameters of turbine blisk failures are obtained by the multi-failure mode sensitivity analysis of turbine blisk. Through the reliability sensitivity analyses of multiple failure modes (<b>deformation,</b> <b>stress</b> and strain) with the proposed method considering fluid–thermal–solid interaction, it is shown that the comprehensive reliability of turbine blisk is 0. 9931 when the allowable <b>deformation,</b> <b>stress</b> and strain are 3. 7 × 10 − 3 m, 1. 0023 × 109 Pa and 1. 05 × 10 − 2 m/m, respectively; the main impact factors of turbine blisk failure are gas velocity, gas temperature and rotational speed.
