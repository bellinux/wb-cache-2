40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} how different <b>delineator</b> <b>post</b> configurations affect driver speed in night-time traffic. In addition, the potential speed effect of introducing a secondary task was investigated. The study was carried out in a car simulator on a road stretch including straight road sections as well as curves with different radii. Fourteen drivers participated in the study and the results show that absence of delineator posts leads to reduced speed. However, provided that there are delineator posts continuously present along the road, the overall driver speed is basically the same, regardless of the spacing between the delineator posts. The results also imply that to reduce driver speed in curves with small radius, using more compact spacing of posts in these curves as compared to in curves with a larger radius, could be a potential strategy. Additionally, the speed reducing effect of a secondary task was only prevailing where the task was initiated...|$|E

Delineators {{are used}} to mark roadways to {{indicate}} to motorists {{the location of the}} edge of the road, lane reduction transitions and curves. They are an effective guidance device especially at night and adverse weather conditions. Due to their location near traffic, delineators are often impacted by out-of-control or drifting vehicles. Therefore, they must be designed to be robust enough to take impact loads and must be flexible. The standard method for delineator testing is usually live impact testing or laboratory testing like rigidity or bending test. These tend to be costly and laborious and are not always an optimum solution because they are done post manufacturing. In addition, these tests do not give any insight into the dynamics of the delineator. Information on high stress and high strain areas, areas of failure, impact force on the delineator are unknown. This data can be obtained by constructing an accurate analytical model for the delineator. To the best of our knowledge, no such analytical model for delineator has been developed in the open literature because the physics involved is complex. For instance, the forces imposed on the delineator are likely due to the friction of the outer surface, weight and impact speed of the vehicle. The flexibility of the post is likely due to the material properties, wall thickness, shape, and size. Although all of these factors affect the performance of a delineator, it is not known how much each contributes. Analyzing flexible delineators is a challenge because it involves non-linear analysis. An analytical model will provide an emulation environment to do simulation and fine tune parameters before doing live impact testing. Based on the results from impact testing design parameters can be modified to get better performance from the delineators. In this thesis, delineator assembly was modelled in SolidWorks and the geometry was imported to ANSYS Explicit Dynamics Solver for finite element and impact analysis. In Explicit Dynamics, impact simulation was performed and the results such as maximum equivalent stress, max equivalent strain, impact force and kinetic energy on the <b>delineator</b> <b>post</b> are presented.

The commission was on synthesising knowledge of and regulations for <b>post</b> <b>delineators</b> in the Nordic countries. The review started with a broad approach where all literature on <b>post</b> <b>delineators</b> was searched in the databases TRAX and ITRD. After sorting {{out some of the}} material some references were ordered, after which a new sorting out was carried out along with supplementing the material with other references. In total, this report includes 31 references. The {{literature review}} consists of three parts: - Road user effects of <b>post</b> <b>delineators.</b> - The function of <b>post</b> <b>delineators.</b> - Regulations for <b>post</b> <b>delineators</b> in the Nordic countries...|$|R
50|$|Delineators {{are small}} {{reflective}} panels mounted on lightweight metal posts or flexible plastic tubes used to outline roadways and paths. These are about 1.2 meters/4 feet high. In the USA, yellow reflective material {{is used for}} delineators on {{the left of the}} road, and white delineators are used to the right of traffic. In Queensland, Australia, where vehicles drive {{on the left side of}} the road, roadworks delineators shall comprise red delineators on the left side and white delineators on the right (two-way roadway) or yellow on the right (one-way roadway). Delineators should be erected 1 m minimum from the edge of the travelled path and at a uniform height of approximately 1 m (39 inches) above the road surface. <b>Delineator</b> <b>posts</b> should be frangible or otherwise non-hazardous.|$|R
