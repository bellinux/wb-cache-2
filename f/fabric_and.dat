These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E

Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs.

Through the analysis of fabric properties difference, integration of structural characteristics of parts, optimization of sewing process and post-production process reengineering, the author proposes the prerequisites and principles related to the splicing of two <b>fabrics,</b> <b>and</b> discusses the common problems in the splicing of knitting <b>and</b> tatting <b>fabrics</b> <b>and</b> specific process optimization route...|$|R
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through <b>fabric,</b> <b>and</b> can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, 1825, Cofresí plundered the sloop Neptune. The {{merchant}} ship, with a {{cargo of}} <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> provisions, was attacked while its dry goods were unloaded at dockside in Jobos Bay. Neptune {{was owned by}} Salvador Pastorisa, who was supervising the unloading. Cofresí began the charge in a sloop, opening musket fire on the crew, and Pastoriza fled in a rowboat. Despite a bullet wound, Pastoriza identified four of the eight to ten pirates (including Cofresí). An Italian living in Puerto Rico, Pedro Salovi, was reportedly second-in-command during the attack. The pirates pursued and shot those who fled. Cofresí sailed Neptune out of Jobos Port, a harbor in Jobos Bay (near Fajardo), and adopted the sloop as a pirate ship.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine cavalry {{was armed}} with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the {{shoulder}} across the back and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant, i.e. a throat-guard lined with <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armor. Light lamellar and scale armor was also used.|$|E
5|$|For {{three hundred}} years, Belton House was {{the seat of}} the Brownlow and Cust family, who had first {{acquired}} land in the area in the late 16th century. Between 1685 and 1688 Sir John Brownlow and his wife had the present mansion built. Despite great wealth they chose to build a modest country house rather than a grand contemporary Baroque palace. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. However, the new house was fitted with the latest innovations such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and more importantly completely separate areas for the staff. As the Brownlows rose from baronets to barons upward to earls and then once again became barons, successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> design of the house changed little.|$|E
5|$|John Cunningham {{was born}} in Croydon in south London on 27 July 1917, {{in the midst of}} the First World War. His father, Arthur Gillespie Cunningham, worked for the Dunlop Rubber Company at Fort Dunlop based in Birmingham. He rose to the {{position}} of company secretary. In 1910 he married Evelyn Mary Spencer. Her family owned an engineering company in Coventry which supplied the <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> textiles company Courtaulds with heavy machinery. In the 1920s, her grandfather was Lord Mayor of Coventry. The family located to Croydon where John was born, along with two elder sisters Mary and Janet and a younger brother, William. John attended Bowden House School, a preparatory school at Seaford, East Sussex until he was 9. He was subsequently a pupil at Whitgift School, a public school in Croydon. In 1926, on a school holiday, he took a flight in an Avro 504. His experiences encouraged him to enter the officers training corps at the school. A personal tragedy occurred in 1930 when his father died. Still, Cunningham did well at school, particularly in the mathematics field. He was keen on entering the aviation industry as a teenager.|$|E

5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|The Priory's {{principal}} church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, was reconfigured {{after the}} dissolution of the monasteries losing the western third of its nave. Reformed as an Anglican parish church, its parish boundaries were limited {{to the site of the}} ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane. The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty, responsible for the upkeep and security of its <b>fabric</b> <b>and</b> the land within its boundaries. With the advent of street lighting, mains water and sewerage during the Victorian era, maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution. Thus, in 1910, it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security. Great St Barts' present parish boundary includes just 10 feet (3.048 m) of Smithfield — possibly delineating a former right of way.|$|E
