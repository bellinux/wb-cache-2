2500|$|Although not {{specifically}} {{mentioned in the}} Constitution, Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate {{and the power to}} compel cooperation with an investigation. The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress's power to legislate. Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress's power to legislate, it is as broad as Congress's powers to legislate. However, it is also limited to inquiries that are [...] "in aid of the legislative function;" [...] Congress may not [...] "expose for the sake of exposure." [...] It is uncontroversial that a proper subject of Congress's investigation power is the operations of the federal government, but Congress's ability to compel the submission of documents or testimony from the President or his subordinates is often-discussed and sometimes controversial (see executive privilege), although not often litigated. As a practical matter, the limitation of Congress's ability to investigate only for a proper purpose ("in aid of" [...] its legislative powers) functions as a limit on Congress's ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens; matters that simply demand action by another branch of government, without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress, must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers. The courts are highly deferential to Congress's exercise of its <b>investigation</b> <b>powers,</b> however. Congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate, and the courts have interpreted Congress's regulatory powers broadly since the Great Depression.|$|E

Justice Wood concluded that the law lagged well behind technical developments and patterns of crime and recommended a systematic and comprehensive review of legislation and procedures to assist the pursuit of law enforcement. The Surveillance Devices Bill 2007 (NSW) was introduced into the New South Wales Parliament on 6 November 2007. The bill replaced the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW) and expanded the application of the legislation so that it also applies to data surveillance devices, optical surveillance devices and tracking devices. The aim of the bill was to implement national model legislation developed by the Joint Working Group of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers’ Council on National <b>Investigation</b> <b>Powers.</b> The Second Reading Speech states that for serious crimes like murder, terrorism, drug manufacture and importation it is essential that law enforcement agencies have every possible tool at their disposal to make their investigations and prosecutions as successful as possible.The Act was assented to on 23 November 2007.

5000|$|However, most crimes by servicemembers against local civilians occur off duty, and in {{accordance}} with the particular SOFA are considered subject to local jurisdiction. Details of the SOFAs can still prompt issues. In Japan, for example, the SOFA includes the provision that service members are not turned over to the local authorities until they are charged in a court. In a number of cases, local officials have complained that this impedes their ability to question suspects and investigate the crime. American officials allege that the Japanese police use coercive interrogation tactics and are concerned more with attaining a high conviction rate than finding [...] "justice". American authorities also note the difference in police <b>investigation</b> <b>powers,</b> as well as the judiciary. No lawyer can be present in investigation discussions in Japan, though a translator is provided, and no mention made of an equivalent to America's Miranda rights. Another issue is the lack of jury trials in Japan, previous to 2009 all trials were decided by a judge or panel of judges. Currently, Japan uses a lay judge system in some criminal trials. For these reasons American authorities insist that service members be tried in military tribunals and reject article 98 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{arguments}} about policing in Australia have {{been marked by}} a concern over an increasingly interventionist role of police in politics. Police, both departments and unions, have been playing {{a prominent role in}} public debates over law and order issues,police staffing levels and other policy matters. It is argued that historical scrutiny ofpolicing since the 1890 s indicates a continuing role and influence ofpolice in both policy making and law reform. Ifsuch has been the case, then understanding the contemporary political role of police in Australia requires re-evaluation of the changing contexts affecting the visibility and prominence of police interventions. In a recent analysisof the role of police organisations in debates about the criminal justice system and law reform, Peter Sallmann has criticised the increasingly prominent public role of police chiefs in such debates (Sallmann, 1986).
