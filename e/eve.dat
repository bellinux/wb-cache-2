50|$|<b>EVEs</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} in animals, plants and fungi. In vertebrates <b>EVEs</b> derived from retroviruses (endogenous retroviruses) are relatively common. Because retroviruses integrate into the nuclear genome of the host cell as an inherent part of their replication cycle, they are predisposed to enter the host germline. In addition, <b>EVEs</b> related to parvoviruses, filoviruses, bornaviruses and circoviruses {{have been identified}} in vertebrate genomes. In plant genomes, <b>EVEs</b> derived from pararetroviruses are relatively common. <b>EVEs</b> derived from other, non-retrotranscribing virus families, such as Geminiviridae, have also been identified in plants.|$|R

5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original <b>Eve</b> to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight off the <b>Eve</b> persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the <b>Eve</b> persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original <b>Eve</b> from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E
5|$|After the show's {{transition}} from NBC to DirecTV, Eve's storylines emphasize her romance with Julian and difficult relationship with Vincent. Believed dead, Vincent reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to <b>Eve</b> after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens {{to kill her}} if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting <b>Eve</b> out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks <b>Eve</b> into rehab after she relapses, abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. Vincent arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, Viki Chatsworth, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. Vincent plies <b>Eve</b> with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, <b>Eve</b> and Julian assist Vincent {{with the birth of}} his son on the Russells' kitchen table, when <b>Eve</b> explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. <b>Eve</b> plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, <b>Eve</b> assures Julian that they love each other emotionally and intellectually; Julian vows that the Crane family will take more responsibility for their actions now that Alistair is dead. At the rehearsal dinner, <b>Eve</b> and the other dinner guests eat Vincent and Viki's poisoned mushroom sauce. She dies, but is resurrected when witch Tabitha Lenox renounces magic and becomes a born-again Christian. In the series finale, Kay uses her magic to heal Julian's penis. Since T. C., Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, <b>Eve</b> and Vincent are the only two Russells in the final episode.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Eve</b> {{initially}} {{believes that}} her baby died, she learns that he survived when she discovers Vincent Clarkson in 2007. Hidden Passions identifies Vincent as born on Christmas Day. The book states that Alistair arranged for Vincent's death, but the hitman Jack placed the baby into social services without Alistair's knowledge. The series changed Alistair's involvement in Vincent's life; instead, Alistair abuses and manipulates Vincent {{as a tool}} for his plans to maintain power over Harmony. For most of the series, <b>Eve</b> and Julian's child is believed to be Chad Harris-Crane, who is later shown to be Liz's child from her rape by Alistair. After the apparent death of her child, <b>Eve</b> leaves Boston and gives up music to attend medical school. Alistair sends her money (which she uses to pay her tuition) to keep quiet about her relationship—and child—with Julian. <b>Eve</b> eventually moves to Harmony and becomes a respected physician at Harmony Hospital. She marries T. C. and has two children, Whitney and Simone.|$|E
