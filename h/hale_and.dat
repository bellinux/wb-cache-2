5000|$|... 1741: The sitting members, Thomas <b>Hales</b> <b>and</b> Thomas Trefusis, (who were {{supporters}} of Robert Walpole) were challenged by Daniel Boone <b>and</b> William Banks. <b>Hales</b> <b>and</b> Trefusis {{were supported by}} Richard Edgcumbe who was managing the Cornish Boroughs for the Government and controlled the Grampound corporation, but Boone and Banks arranged for an alternate Mayor to be elected and indemnified the Sheriff of the County against any legal expenses if he delivered the writs for the election to their Mayor and was sued. They secured their election by 27 votes to 23, while an alternative poll by the original Mayor returned <b>Hales</b> <b>and</b> Trefusis with 35 votes to 17 for their opponents.

5|$|The English Civil War {{affected}} all of England; even {{families were}} split over Royalist or Parliamentarian loyalties. Little is recorded over the divisions within Hale Barns, but <b>Hale</b> <b>and</b> Hale Barns did {{emerge from the}} Civil War more or less untouched by events– {{though there was a}} heavy tax to pay to support the Parliamentarian army they avoided much of the requisitioning of supplies and animals for passing armies.

5|$|The {{settlements}} of <b>Hale</b> <b>and</b> Hale Barns {{are closely}} linked; what {{would later become}} Hale Barns {{spent most of the}} medieval period {{as an extension of the}} more dominant Hale. During this era the land around <b>Hale</b> <b>and</b> Hale Barns was used agriculturally because although the soil is poor draining, it is fertile. By the middle of the 15th century Hale Barns had established an identity completely separate from neighbouring Hale as demonstrated by the tithe barn which was established around this time. The tithe barn was for storing the tithes – a tenth of the farm's produce which was to be given to the church. Such an establishment can be seen as a sign of the area's prosperity. The original barn no longer survives but there is a drawing of it (from 1844). It is the source of the village's name. The first explicit reference to the village of Hale Barns– rather than Hale– is in a document from 1616.|$|E

Downman, superintendent at Woolwich, was a first-cousin of Admiral Hugh Downman.|$|E
5|$|Erinys– The {{daughter}} of Thanatos. After {{the destruction of}} Atlantis, Erinys searched for Kratos, killing various Spartans as a warning for Kratos to stop his quest to find Deimos. Erinys eventually found Kratos in the Mounts of Aroania, and after a land battle, an aerial battle ensued as Erinys shape shifted into an enormous bird before being killed by Kratos, after which, Kratos took her power, the Scourge of Erinys. The character was overdub voiced by Jennifer <b>Hale</b> <b>and</b> Erin Torpey in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E

5|$|Follow-up {{confirmation}} {{observations were}} made by the Keck 1 telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, the <b>Hale</b> <b>and</b> Shane telescopes in California, the Harlan J. Smith and Hobby-Eberly telescopes in west Texas, the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands, and by telescopes at the WIYN (including MMT) and Whipple observatories in Arizona. The Spitzer Space Telescope was also used. Kepler-11's planetary system became the first discovered extrasolar system with more than three transiting planets, as well as the most compact and flattest system yet discovered, according to NASA. The planets of Kepler-11, including Kepler-11e, were announced jointly at a press conference on February 2, 2011. The findings were published in the journal Nature on February 3.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{discovered}} on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan <b>Hale</b> <b>and</b> Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with {{any degree of}} certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was {{visible to the naked eye}} for a record 18months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, in {{the next}} year, the Great Fire of London (1666) was to be of benefit to him, when he {{received}} one of the City of London's first new artistic commissions to paint twenty-two full length portraits of the so-called 'Fire Judges' (those appointed to assess the property disputes arising from the fire). These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew <b>Hale</b> <b>and</b> Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E

50|$|The only {{break in}} his Parliamentary career came in 1741: at the {{notoriously}} corrupt rotten borough of Grampound, his opponents had contrived a disagreement over {{who was the}} rightful Mayor and therefore returning officer for the constituency. According to their Mayor, <b>Hales</b> <b>and</b> his pro-government colleague Thomas Trefusis were re-elected by 35 votes to 17; however, his opponents had arranged for the Sheriff to direct the writ for the election to their own nominee, so it was {{his version of the}} result (declaring <b>Hales</b> <b>and</b> Trefusis defeated by 27 to 23) which was returned to Parliament. <b>Hales</b> <b>and</b> Trefusis initially petitioned against this outcome, but withdrew their protest before a decision had been reached. Hales returned to the Commons at a by-election for Hythe three years later.|$|R
