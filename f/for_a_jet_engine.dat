Power {{settings}} for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labeled as [...] "N1" [...] and [...] "N2". N1 and N2 refer to the spools, or shafts, of a jet engine on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured {{as a percentage of}} maximum N1 or N2 rpm. Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions. The Tu-154 manual indicates that a go-around must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2. This is because jet engine throttle response is not linear; jet engines have to [...] "spool up" [...] in order to produce more thrust. At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> to [...] "spool up" [...] to full power. On PLF 101, the N2 values were not recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32%-33% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51%-52% N1 for the given conditions. As such, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a go-around at this point, even though they were still above Minimum Decision Altitude (MDA). However, they did not go around, and continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not.|$|E

50|$|The {{costs of}} air travel {{disruption}} in Europe after a volcanic eruption in 2010 forced aircraft manufacturers to specify limits {{on how much}} ash they considered acceptable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> to ingest without damage.
