30|$|Extensively raised {{beef cattle}} {{contribute}} to {{the highest levels of}} enteric methane (CH 4) gas emissions among all livestock. Expensive techniques and logistics hinder monitoring of such gas. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} use an inexpensive laser methane detector (LMD) apparatus to determine the enteric CH 4 levels from a herd of beef cows raised on semi-arid rangelands. A total of 24 cows were selected from Boran and Nguni cows (n =[*] 12 per breed) from two different farms. The parities of the cows were as follows: parity 1 (n[*]=[*] 6), parity 2 (n[*]=[*] 6), parity 3 (n[*]=[*] 6) and parity 4 (n[*]=[*] 6). An observer used a hand-held LMD to measure enteric CH 4 emissions plumes during the late afternoon hours when the animals were resting (either standing or lying down). Point measurements (expressed in ppm/m) were taken for six consecutive days and repeated once after every three months. The ratio of CH 4 output <b>per</b> <b>kilogramme</b> DMI was not different in within-breed and between-breed in both seasons. Generally, the dry season recorded the highest CH 4 output <b>per</b> <b>kilogramme</b> of live weight of cow. For example, Boran cows in parity 2 produced the highest output of 1.0 [*]±[*] 0.04  g CH 4 <b>per</b> <b>kilogramme</b> live weight of cow while Nguni cows in parities 1, 2 and 4 each produced 0.9 [*]±[*] 0.04  g CH 4 <b>per</b> <b>kilogramme</b> live weight of cow in the dry season. All the animals maintained optimal body condition scores in both seasons (ranging between the lowest of 3.2 [*]±[*] 0.01 and the highest of 3.4 [*]±[*] 0.01). Based on the results of the study, it is concluded that cows from both herds produced higher CH 4 <b>per</b> <b>kilogramme</b> live weight of cow in the dry season while maintaining optimal body condition scores in both seasons.|$|R
30|$|Both the Nguni and Boran breed {{showed no}} {{differences}} in CH 4 output <b>per</b> <b>kilogramme</b> DMI while within-breed differences for CH 4 output <b>per</b> <b>kilogramme</b> of cows’ live weight were observed in both seasons. Based on the results obtained in this study, both the Boran and Nguni breed had similar direct methane output irrespective of occupying different rangelands. This could be attributed from the similar non-selective foraging behaviour and mechanisms, which they use to adapt to their environment. The study also showed that an LMD machine {{can be used to}} produce reasonable values for CH 4 output for extensively-raised beef cattle.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination alongside cervical cancer screening programme in Slovenia. Methods: A previously published Markov model representing natural history of HPV infection was adapted to Slovenian context. The model followed a cohort of 12 -year-old girls to 85 -year-old women. Two strategies were compared: HPV vaccination alongside conventional cytological screening versus screening alone. Analysis was performed from the health care payer perspective. Results: Vaccination with screening compared with screening alone was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 23 178 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> quality adjustedlife-year (QALY) gained and 54 536 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained (LYG) at the discounting rate of 5 %. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICER was most sensitive to the need for booster dose and to different values of discount rates. In case the booster dose was assumed 10 years after initial vaccination, the ICER value was increased to 58 690 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> QALY. On the otherhand, using lower values of discount rates than the base case 5 % significantly reduced the ICER value. Conclusion: According to the cost-effectiveness thresholds of 30 000 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> QALY which was adopted by the Health Council in Slovenia, HPV vaccination alongside screening programme can be regarded as cost-effective.

40|$|A novel {{energy and}} cost {{effective}} transport chain for stranded natural gas utilized for power production with CO 2 capture and storage is developed. It includes an offshore section, a combined gas carrier, and an integrated receiving terminal. In the offshore process, natural gas (NG) is liquefied to LNG by {{liquid carbon dioxide}} (LCO 2) and liquid inert nitrogen (LIN), which are used as cold carriers. The offshore process is self-supported with power, hot and cold utilities and can operate with little rotating equipment and without flammable refrigerants. In the onshore process, the cryogenic exergy in LNG is used to cool and liquefy the cold carriers, which reduces the power requirement to 319 Â kWh/tonne LNG. Pinch and exergy analyses are used to determine thermodynamically optimized offshore and onshore processes with exergy efficiencies of 87 % and 71 %, respectively. There are very low emissions from the processes. The estimated specific costs for the offshore and onshore process are 8. 0 and 14. 6 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> tonne LNG, respectively, excluding energy costs.

METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on clinical data of the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) and the Finland Herceptin (FinHer) trials.

RESULTS: On the basis of HERA data, our model yielded an overall survival rate of 71. 8 % for the T group versus 62. 8 % for the control group [risk ratio (RR) = 0. 87) after 10 years and 62. 9 % versus 52. 7 % (RR = 0. 84) after 15 years. Cost-effectiveness resulted in 40505 Euros (<b>EUR)</b> <b>per</b> life years gained (LYG) after 10 years and 19673 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> LYG after 15 years. For the FinHer regimen, overall survival after 10 and 15 years resulted in 81. 8 % versus 66. 1 % (RR = 0. 81) and 73. 6 % versus 57. 0 % (RR = 0. 77).
