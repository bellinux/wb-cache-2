50|$|The uniform {{organisation}} of {{the town}} and its institutions give evidence that the Harappans were a very disciplined people. Commerce and administrative duties were performed according to standards laid out. Municipal administration was strict - the width of most streets remained the same over a long time, and no encroached structures were built. Householders possessed a sump, or collection chamber to deposit solid waste in order to prevent the clogging of city <b>drains.</b> <b>Drains,</b> <b>manholes</b> and cesspools kept the city clean and deposited the waste in the river, which was washed out during high tide. A new provincial style of Harappan art and painting was pioneered. The new approaches included realistic portrayals of animals in their natural surroundings. Metalware, gold and jewellery and tastefully decorated ornaments attest to the culture and prosperity of the people of Lothal.|$|R

40|$|During rain events, {{herbicides}} can {{be transported}} {{from their point}} of application to surface waters where they may harm aquatic organisms. Since the spatial pattern of mobilisation and transport is heterogeneous, the contributions of different fields to the herbicide load in the stream may differ considerably within one catchment. Therefore, the prediction of contributing areas could help to target mitigation measures efficiently to those locations where they reduce herbicide pollution the most. Such spatial predictions require sufficient insight into the underlying transport processes. To improve the understanding of the process chain of herbicide mobilisation on the field and the subsequent transport through the catchment to the stream, we performed a controlled herbicide application on corn fields in a small agricultural catchment (ca. 1 km 2 ) with intensive crop production in the Swiss Plateau. For two months after application in 2009, water samples were taken at different locations in the catchment (overland flow, tile drains and open channel) with a high temporal resolution during rain events. We also analysed soil samples from the experimental fields and measured discharge, groundwater level, soil moisture and the occurrence of overland flow at several locations. Several rain events with varying intensities and magnitudes occurred during the study period. Overland flow and erosion were frequently observed in the entire catchment. Infiltration excess and saturation excess overland flow were both observed. However, the main herbicide loss event was dominated by infiltration excess. This is in contrast to earlier studies in the Swiss Plateau, demonstrating that saturation excess overland flow was the dominant process. Despite the frequent and wide-spread occurrence of overland flow, most of this water did not directly reach the channel. It mostly got retained in small sinks in the catchment. From there, it reached the stream via macropores and tile <b>drains.</b> <b>Manholes</b> of the drainage system and catch basins for road and farmyard runoff acted as additional shortcuts to the stream. Although fast flow processes like overland and macropore flow reduce the influence of herbicide properties due to short travel times, sorption properties influenced the herbicide transfer from ponding overland flow to tile drains (macropore flow). However, no influence of sorption was observed during the mobilisation of the herbicides from soil to overland flow. These two observations on the role of herbicide properties contradict, to some degrees, previous findings. They demonstrate that valuable insight can be gained by spatially detailed observations along the flow paths...|$|R
40|$|Urban larval {{mosquito}} control strategies include elimination of aboveground water-holding containers by private residents (`source reduction') and larviciding of belowground storm <b>drains</b> and utility <b>manholes.</b> Effective source reduction {{is dependent on}} public education campaigns that identify key sources of mosquitoes, target at-risk neighborhoods, and create an informed and motivated citizenry. I conducted 242 yard surveys for mosquito larval habitats paired with Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) questionnaires administered to residents in six socioeconomically-diverse neighborhoods in the greater Washington, D. C. metropolitan area, and sampled 201 belowground habitats adjacent to these households. In chapter 2, I analyze associations between resident socioeconomic status, knowledge, attitudes, practices and mosquito indices. In chapter 3, I examine variations in larval habitat quality, quantity and type across neighborhoods of differing socioeconomic status. In chapter 4, I compare larval populations in aboveground and belowground habitats. The implications for educational literature and mosquito management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|External direct {{surveys were}} {{performed}} for elevated {gamma} levels with a PG 2 portable detector {{connected to a}} PRM 5 - 3 meter and for elevated {alpha} and {beta} levels with an NE portable detector. No {gamma} activity above background was detected. Several locations, the floor and west wall of building 579 and the manhole, had low levels of {beta} activity, up to 87 {+-} 49 dis/min. These values are below the allowable residual surface contamination limits for removable beta activity. There is water in the Mixed Bed Exchange Vessel, the Cation Exchange Vessel, the Closed <b>Drain</b> Tank, the <b>manhole</b> {{and some of the}} pipes. The accessible internal surfaces of the pipes, tanks and columns had higher levels of {beta} activity up to 172 {+-} 52 dis/min and some {alpha} activity up to 106 {+-} 29 dis/min. After the water is removed from the vessels, tanks, and lines, they should be surveyed to determine whether the areas accessible for smear surveys are representative of the general inside contamination levels. There are elevated levels of radionuclides in the resin from the Cation Exchange Vessel and in the water from the manhole. Since the radionuclide concentrations in the manhole water are less than ten times the site release criteria, it does not need any processing before it is released to the onsite drains. Although there are RCRA metals on the resin in the Cation Exchange Vessel, the amount that is removed during a leaching analysis is below the toxicity Characteristic level. Therefore, the resin is a radioactive waste not a mixed waste...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{effectiveness}} of soil management practices on surface and subsurface water quality {{at the field}} scale is becoming increasingly important in the Lake Champlain Basin and other agricultural watersheds. During 2012 and 2013, field plots (22. 9 x 45. 7 m) were established at the Lake Alice Wildlife Area in Chazy, NY to begin a long-term water quality monitoring study. Plots were established in a cool season grass field (1 ha) leased and managed by the William H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute in Chazy, NY. The soil type transitions from an excessively drained outwash soil on the upslope to a very poorly drained silty clay series at the toeslope. Tile drainage lines were installed in each plot and <b>drained</b> to concrete <b>manholes</b> {{at the corner of}} each plot where water was sampled and measured. Plots were randomly assigned to a tile-drained (TD) or naturally-drained treatment (UD). Tile outlets were plugged in the UD treatment to enable natural drainage conditions. Surface runoff water was collected at the lower boundary of each plot by shallow PVC-lined trenches that outlet to the manholes. Continuous water flow from each hydrologic pathway was measured in 5 -gallon buckets with v-notch weirs and pressure transducers. Total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus SRP), unreactive phosphorus (UP) and sediment (TSS) loads were estimated by multiplying the mean hourly runoff volume by the respective sample concentration for each hydrologic pathway. Data were collected April 21, 2014 through June 30, 2015. Loading rates were unable to be calculated from February 22, 2015 through April 9, 2015 due to freeze/thaw cycles preventing accurate water flow data collection. Event-based loading for TP, SRP, UP, TSS, and water yield were calculated in addition to cumulative losses over the study duration. No significant differences in cumulative TP exports were found between treatments (UD = 230. 9 g ha- 1; TD = 233. 9 g ha- 1). Approximately 55 % more SRP and 158 % more TSS was exported by UD (130. 8 g ha- 1; 168. 8 kg ha- 1) than TD (84. 2 g ha- 1; 65. 5 kg ha- 1). Unreactive P exports from TD (149. 7 g ha- 1) were 50 % greater than UD (100. 1 g ha- 1). Two runoff events dominated the treatment response. An intense rain storm on May 16, 2014 generated the greatest sediment losses in both treatments during an individual event, contributing 65 and 67 % of the cumulative losses from TD and UD, respectively. This event was also responsible for 40 % of UP losses from TD. A 3 d rain/snowmelt event beginning on December 24, 2014 resulted in 61 and 84 % of all SRP losses for TD and UD, respectively. The results {{of this study indicate that}} tile drainage may not have a negative impact on water quality relative to a naturally drained field. However, additional years of data are needed to develop more robust conclusions as different management strategies and weather conditions could result in different outcomes...|$|R
