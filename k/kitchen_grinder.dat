30|$|The brown-colored neem (A. indica) bark used in {{the present}} study was {{collected}} from the university campus, Burdwan University, Burdwan. The collected A. indica bark was thoroughly washed with double distilled water to remove muddy materials and soaked in 0.1  N NaOH to remove lignin-based color materials followed by 0.1  N H 2 SO 4 (King et al. 2008; Naiya et al. 2009). The washed A. indica bark was dried in sun for 15  days. The resulting product was directly used as biosorbent. The dried bark was then cut into small pieces and ground to powder with <b>kitchen</b> <b>grinder.</b> For this experimental study, the powdered materials were sieved to obtain particle size of 250  µm prior to use as biosorbent without any further treatment. The physiochemical characterization of the AiBP biosorbent has been reported elsewhere (Srivastava and Rupainwar 2011; Sadhukhan et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} only. The {{culture of}} Penaeus monodon has explicitly defined {{the need for}} diet formulations or supplementary feeds that would promote optimum growth and survival of the animal. A total of 28 feed combinations were developed for P. monodon. Fish meal, shrimp head meal, squid head meal, Ascetes spp. rice bran, and soybean cake were used as primary ingredients in these feeds. The commercial vitamin mix No. 22 {{was added to the}} dry ingredients. Gelatinized corn starch and wheat flour were used as binders. The pellets were extruded using a portable <b>kitchen</b> <b>grinder</b> with a diameter of 4 mm. The products were either sun-dried for 8 hours or oven-dried overnight at 50 degree C to stabilize moisture at 8 - 10 %. The pellets were then kept in covered glass bottles and stored in the laboratory at room temperature. The cost of the feeds excluding labour were also computed. The pellets were analyzed for protein, fat, carbohydrate, crude fiber, ash, and moisture contents using standard procedures. They were also analyzed for water stability. To test the stability of pellets in water, 2 -g samples were placed in plankton nets (mesh # 40) and suspended in water for two, and six hours. The undissolved samples were then vacuum-dried and the moisture determined. Cost of the feeds ranged from P 1. 10 to P 2. 60 per kg depending on the feed ingredient. Squid and Ascetes spp. were rather expensive for use as basic ingredients. Proximate analysis of dry weight showed percentage protein content ranged from 20 - 63 g; fat, 8 - 20 g; carbohydrate (by difference), 11 - 36 g; ash, 8 - 28 g; moisture, 6 - 11 g; and crude fiber, 5. 13 g. Stability tests showed that after two hours, 35 - 88 % of solids remained intact and after 6 hours, 20 - 55 % of the pellets remained undissolved. When a pellet disintegrates easily, pollution of the water occurs. Chances for the shrimp to feed on the pellet is minimized when the pellet is unstable. Thus, the search for a more compact feed pellet has to be continued...|$|E

It can also be used for illumination (oil lamps) or as the base for soaps and detergents. Some cosmetics also use olive oil as their base.|$|R
50|$|An {{immersion}} blender, stick blender, wand blender, hand blender, or Bermixer (after {{the brand}} name of professional models made by Dito-Electrolux) is a <b>kitchen</b> blade <b>grinder</b> used to blend ingredients or purée food in the container {{in which they are}} being prepared. Larger immersion blenders for commercial use are sometimes nicknamed boat motors (popularized by Emeril Lagasse and Alton Brown). Uses include puréeing soups and emulsifying sauces.|$|R

Special multifunctional kitchen robots {{that are able to}} perform several functions (e.g. grinding, cutting, and even vacuum cleaning and polishing) are able to reduce costs even more. Examples of these devices were e.g. the (now discontinued) Piccolo household appliance from Hammelmann Werke (previously based in Bad Kissingen.) It was equipped with a flexible axis, allowing a variety of aids to be screwed on.|$|R
30|$|Seven {{medicinal}} plants (chamomile, milfoil, rattle, brotherwort, pot marigold, linden, peppermint) were randomly collected from spontaneous flora grown in NW Romania. Three specimens of each plant species were intensely rinsed with tap water and distilled water and dried in an oven at 40 °C until weight is constant. In order {{to accelerate the}} digestion process, samples were grinded to powder with a <b>kitchen</b> mixer <b>grinder</b> and sieved through a 100 -μm mesh. Five sub-samples from each plant species were used for analysis.|$|R

The Agar machine gun was one of about fifty or so hand-cranked machine guns developed for the war during this period. It was named after its inventor, Wilson Agar (sometimes spelled Wilson Ager). The gun was nicknamed the [...] "Coffee Mill Gun" [...] because the crank and the ammunition hopper {{on the top of}} the weapon gave it a look similar to that of a common <b>kitchen</b> coffee <b>grinder.</b>|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the finite}} nature of mineral {{phosphorus}} reserves, effective management of anthropogenic phosphorus flows is currently {{under investigation by}} the international research community. This article emphasizes the importance of urban phosphorus flows, which are often marginalized due to the greater magnitude of agricultural phosphorus flows. A study on phosphorus flows in Gothenburg, Sweden, points out the potential role of solid waste in nutrient management, as the amounts of phosphorus in solid waste and in wastewater were found to be equal. Importation of food commodities accounts for 50 % of the total inflow of phosphorus, and food waste is a major contributor of phosphorus to solid waste. The results suggest that solid waste incineration residues represent a large underestimated sink of phosphorus. Focusing on wastewater as the sole source of recovered phosphorus is not sufficient. The Swedish national goal on phosphorus recycling, which is limited to sewage sludge, targets only a part of the total phosphorus flow that can potentially be recovered. In contrast to previous studies, agricultural flows in Gothenburg were marginal compared to flows related to the urban waste management infrastructure. We emphasize the need for debate on preferable routes for disposal of waste with a high phosphorus content. Both recovery potential and usefulness of the recovered product for agricultural purposes have to be considered. Impacts of five waste management strategies on phosphorus flows were evaluated: incineration of all the waste, comprehensive food waste separation, installation of <b>kitchen</b> <b>grinders,</b> urine diversion, and separation of blackwater and food waste...|$|R
40|$|Four {{systems for}} {{household}} food waste collection are compared in relation {{the environmental impact}} categories eutrophication potential, acidification potential, global warming potential as well as energy use. Also, a hotspot analysis is performed in order to suggest improvements {{in each of the}} compared collection systems. Separate collection of household food waste in paper bags (with and without drying prior to collection) with use of <b>kitchen</b> <b>grinders</b> and with use of vacuum system in kitchen sinks were compared. In all cases, food waste was used for anaerobic digestion with energy and nutrient recovery in all cases. Compared systems all resulted in net avoidance of assessed environmental impact categories; eutrophication potential (- 0. 1 to - 2. 4 kg NO(3) (-) eq/ton food waste), acidification potential (- 0. 4 to - 1. 0 kg SO(2) (-) eq/ton food waste), global warming potential (- 790 to - 960 kg CO(2) (-) eq/ton food waste) and primary energy use (- 1. 7 to - 3. 6 GJ/ton food waste). Collection with vacuum system results in the largest net avoidence of primary energy use, while disposal of food waste in paper bags for decentralized drying before collection result in a larger net avoidence of global warming, eutrophication and acidification. However, both these systems not have been taken into use in large scale systems yet and further investigations are needed in order to confirm the outcomes from the comparison. Ranking of scenarios differ largely if considering only emissions in the foreground system, indicating the importance of taking also downstream emissions into consideration when comparing different collection systems. The hot spot identification shows that losses of organic matter in mechanical pretreatment as well as tank connected food waste disposal systems and energy in drying and vacuum systems reply to the largest impact on the results in each system respectively...|$|R
