2500|$|The five-pin XLR is the {{standard}} connector for DMX512, the most common protocol for controlling professional lighting and related equipment. Three-pin XLR connectors are increasingly common instead. These are electrically compatible with a simple <b>jumpering</b> 1–1, 2–2, 3–3 between them. [...] However, using three-pin XLR connectiors for DMX512 is specifically prohibited by section 7.1.2 of the DMX512 standard.|$|E

50|$|The {{qualification}} {{standard was}} 7.60 metres {{with a minimum}} of 12 <b>jumpers</b> advancing. Each <b>jumper</b> had three opportunities. Since only 5 <b>jumpers</b> met the standard, the next 7 longest <b>jumpers</b> also advanced.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} also simple to modify {{for the sake}} of system {{expansion}} and enhancement. Many different modifications to increase the system clock speed were possible, including some that required nothing more than jumpers (e.g. the 3.5 MHz speed upgrade obtained by <b>jumpering</b> the clock divider, with no software modifications or changes to the ICs on the board.) There was also a minor industry in user-installable system upgrades such as real time clocks, 4 MHz upgrades, double density floppy upgrades, character enhancements for the display (reverse video, blinking, etc.), and the addition of hard disk interfaces such as SASI and SCSI. Most of these upgrades were accomplished through the use of daughter boards that plugged into existing IC sockets on the board, with the original IC either replaced by a more capable IC or placed into a socket on the daughter board.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jumper</b> pins (points to be {{connected}} by the <b>jumper)</b> are arranged in groups called <b>jumper</b> blocks, each group having at least one pair of contact points. An appropriately sized conductive sleeve called a <b>jumper,</b> or more technically, a shunt <b>jumper,</b> is slipped over the pins to complete the circuit.|$|R

When Carpenter enters the theater to avoid <b>Jumper</b> (and watch straight porn), <b>Jumper</b> follows him. Unaware of <b>Jumper's</b> nature, Carpenter cannot resist temptation {{and they give}} each other handjobs and oral sex. He brings <b>Jumper</b> to his motel room for more fun.

40|$|A hanging <b>jumper</b> beam of a {{transmission}} tower is adopted as a countermeasure against a short fault of <b>jumper</b> conductors under strong winds. However {{it is thought}} that the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam may cause the vibration of transmission tower members due to its weight when the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam starts to vibrate under strong winds. The authors have conducted an excitation test of a strain transmission tower with the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam to comprehend the dynamic behaviors of the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam. In this paper the effects of the oscillation of hanging <b>jumper</b> beam on side members are investigated based on the excitation test data, and the information for estimating the vibration of the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam under a string wind is organized...|$|R

5000|$|When a <b>jumper</b> {{is placed}} over {{two or more}} <b>jumper</b> pins, an {{electrical}} connection is made between them, and the equipment is thus instructed to activate certain settings accordingly. For example, with older PC systems, CPU speed and voltage settings were often made by setting <b>jumpers.</b> Informally, technicians often call setting <b>jumpers</b> [...] "strapping". To adjust the SCSI ID <b>jumpers</b> on a hard drive, for example, is to [...] "strap it up".|$|R

25|$|Winmar {{donated the}} <b>jumper</b> {{he was wearing}} in the {{photograph}} to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in 1998. Prior to the commission's disbanding in 2005, Geoff Clark, the chairman of ATSIC at the time, removed the framed <b>jumper</b> from the commission's offices in Canberra {{to his home in}} Warrnambool, Victoria. Clark was forced to return the <b>jumper</b> to Winmar, which was later donated to the National Museum of Australia, where it featured in Off the Walls, an exhibit of Indigenous Australian art. In May 2012, the <b>jumper</b> was auctioned by Sotheby's, but was passed in after the bidding reached A$95,000. In September of the same year, Museum Victoria purchased the <b>jumper</b> for $100,000, with the intention to display it at the First Peoples exhibition at Melbourne Museum in July 2013. However, the authenticity of the <b>jumper</b> has been questioned, with the St Kilda Football Club published a statement in March 2005 suggesting that the <b>jumper</b> given to ATSIC {{may not have been the}} actual <b>jumper</b> worn during the game, citing differences between sponsors' logos present on the <b>jumper.</b> Similar questions were raised prior to the <b>jumper's</b> auction in 2012.|$|R
