Specific objectives for the study were to establish whether schools have established <b>procurement</b> <b>committees,</b> teaching and learning material selection <b>committee,</b> that coordinate <b>procurement</b> of biology resources for teaching and learning The study used the input- output systemic theory of organization as trans-disciplinary and integrative. The study was conducted in Nakuru District of Rift Valley Province. The study adopted a descriptive survey design targeting 18 public secondary schools. The strata comprised category of national, provincial and district category of schools. The distribution of school type comprised day, boarding, boys, and girls and mixed secondary schools. The strata included 2 national, 8 provincial and 8 district category of schools. Respondents were headteachers, deputy headteachers, and science heads of departments, Bursars, form two students and the district quality assurance and standards officer. Research instruments were validated through the application of content validity determined by expert judgment of supervisors, while reliability of questionnaire was determined by split-half method with Spearman-rank correlation coefficient of 0. 75 after pre-testing to respondents in four purposively selected pilot schools. Upon obtaining a research permit from the National Council for Science and Technology, to proceed with the study, the researcher personally administered the questionnaires to collect data. Collected data were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively with Statistical Program for Social Sciences version 17. 0. Descriptive statistics was applied to analyzed data obtained. Findings revealed that, all schools have constituted procurement also called tender committee, but are yet to form teaching and learning material selection committee. Biology resources for teaching and learning are satisfactory, at a ratio of 1 : 3 with request for quotation dominantly used for procurement. There is dearth of procurement information among headteachers, deputy headteachers and science heads of departments, majority who opted to remain neutral or not responding to question items. Challenges identified were delayed fund disbursement, limited training in <b>procurement</b> amongst <b>procurement</b> <b>committee</b> members, limited budgets, costly science resources and lack of appropriate science resource suppliers in the market. It is recommended that, factors likely to hinder the achievement of set strategies and targets to improve classroom- teaching be explicitly addressed.

In this research, the writer conducts an evaluation on the related function or organization, the used document or form, the used accounting record and the procedure creating the official vehicle procurement system using the auction mechanism.

The strengths include there has been function separation among the operational functions, there has been authorization of competent functions, many forms used has been given printed sequenced number, the <b>procurement</b> <b>committees</b> composed of civil servants both from internal institution and other technical institutions, the position rotation has been conducted. Meanwhile, the weaknesses include SPPBPPTK, SPPBJ, BAPBJ and SPM-LS that should be distributed to SPI and practically are stored in PPTK of fixture division, KPA and PPKom and it is given only when there is an examination from SPI, in the official vehicle procurement the high cost is still required, the number of <b>procurement</b> <b>committee</b> existing in DPPKAD is limited, it is because the qualification of being the member of committee is to have the certificate of goods/service procurement skill so that DPPKAD should take the member of committee from other SKPD.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{the making of the}} Danish public {{procurement}} law, and treats the question of why a specific national law was created as an alternative to issuing a national decree of the European Union’s public procurement directive. The study concludes that first of all the arrival of the EU public procurement directive was greeted by public procurement tenders as well as business interest organisations as a welcomed opportunity to revise public procurement rules and to end the poor ambience between interest actors. They perceived the rules as inflexible and hostile towards innovation. Especially the public procurers and the businesses were fed up with situation were complaints imposed high transactions costs. As the above mentioned actors did not find the new public procurement directive to offer sufficient change, actions were taken especially by KL in order to establish a unique Danish public procurement law with clearer and less rigid rules. The result has been a process in which many compromises have been made, but where the public <b>procurement</b> <b>committee</b> nonetheless has managed to create adjustments in regards to the public procurement directives and its shortcomings. Thus, based on the empirical findings the study concludes that somewhat fragile political compromise was created to cope with the poor procurement culture. The interest actors within the public procurement arena find that the making of the Danish public procurement law has indeed led to the establishment of a more flexible and less bureaucratic and rigid culture within public procurement. Still, it is uncertain whether or not this compromise will last in the long run...|$|R
