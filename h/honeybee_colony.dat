40|$|<b>Honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> {{mortality}} {{is a problem}} at a world wide scale. Insecticides in agriculture and horticulture might contribute, especially the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, which is a commonly used systemic insecticide that might induce several effects at sublethal concentrations. Furthermore it is very persistent in soil and water. At several locations in the Netherlands imidacloprid {{was found in the}} surface water in relatively high concentrations. The exceeding of the acceptable levels was suggested to be causally related to <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> losses, and several groups in society are concerned. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether concentrations of imidacloprid in surface water influence honeybee mortality in the Netherlands. Therefore monitoring data of honeybee mortality from 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009 and several covariates are used. Data of honeybee mortality are linked to maximum values of imidacloprid concentrations in surface water. For a realistic risk valuation, three foraging distances are used, i. e. 1000 meters, 3000 meters and 7500 meters. Peak concentrations of imidacloprid within a radius of 7500 meters around the colonies appeared negatively correlated with honeybee mortality. However, imidacloprid was aliased with the factor beekeeper, so the earlier shown correlation is possibly a disguised beekeepers effect. A negative effect of imidacloprid in surface water on <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> survival in the Netherlands is therefore not shown in this study. Although it can not be proven that imidacloprid has no influence on honeybee mortality, it seems unlikely that imidacloprid in surface water as a single factor is relevant to the current problem.

From July 2011 to May 2012, 330 colonies were monitored. Honeybees, wax, beebread and honey samples were collected. Morbidity and mortality information provided by beekeepers, colony clinical visits and availability of analytical matrix were used to form 2 groups: healthy colonies and colonies with disorders (n =  29, n =  25, respectively). Disorders included: (1) dead colonies or colonies in which part of the colony appeared dead, or had disappeared; (2) weak colonies; (3) queen loss; (4) problems linked to brood and not related to any known disease. Five common viruses and 99 pesticides (41 fungicides, 39 insecticides and synergist, 14 herbicides, 5 acaricides and metabolites) were quantified in the samples. The main symptoms observed in the group with disorders are linked to brood and queens. The viruses most frequently found are Black Queen Cell Virus, Sac Brood Virus, Deformed Wing Virus.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{decline in}} <b>honeybee</b> <b>colonies</b> {{during the past}} 50 years has often {{been linked to the}} spread of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and its interaction with certain honeybee viruses. Recently in the United States, dramatic <b>honeybee</b> losses (<b>colony</b> collapse disorder) have been reported; however, there remains no clear explanation for these colony losses, with parasitic mites, viruses, bacteria, and fungal diseases all being proposed as possible candidates. Common characteristics that most failing colonies share is a lack of overt disease symptoms and the disappearance of workers from what appears to be normally functioning colonies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR to monitor the presence of three honeybee viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV), during a 1 -year period in 15 asymptomatic, varroa mite-positive <b>honeybee</b> <b>colonies</b> in Southern England, and 3 asymptomatic colonies confirmed to be varroa mite free. All colonies with varroa mites underwent control treatments to ensure that mite populations remained low throughout the study.

40|$|According to the {{previous}} studies, the pollen income to the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> varies seasonally and increases parallel to the upswing of brood rearing.

As the first step to analyse such probable regulation, the diurnal and seasonal variations of the number of pollen-foragers were observed correspondent to the population growth of a single <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony.</b> The counts were made about weekly from late April to mid September on the days of favorable weather conditions in 1959. The number of homing bees and pollen-foragers among them were counted at the hive entrance from 8 : 00 to 17 : 00 for 10 minutes at intervals of an hour. The population growth was estimated by BODENHEIMER' smethod and corrected by NICKEL-ARMBRUSTER's death rate. The results are summarized as follows : 1) Except under unfavorable weather condition, the pollen-foragers were always more abundant in the forenoon than in the afternoon, while other homing bees were often more abundant in the afternoon than in the afternoon. 2) From the records taken during 10 : 00 to 10 : 10 a. m., the fluctuation of the number of homing bees was more conspicuous than that of the pollen-foragers. The number of homing bees corresponded in general to that of more than 10 days old bees (potential foragers) but the number of pollen-foragers showed no such correlation. 3) The ratio of the pollen-foragers to the homing bees was high during early spring, early June, early July and late summer, except early spring and late summer, the periods being approximate to that of rapid increases of the eggs laid. 4) Consequently, it is assumed that the foraging efficiency is determined by 1) the duration of a single pollen-foraging trip, 2) the trip number per day and 3) the weight of each pollen loads foraged, being variable according to seasons and kind of pollen sources and that from the result 3 mentioned above, a regulative mechanism to change the workers into the pollen-foragers occurred in the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony...</b>|$|E
40|$|Bio-sampling is a {{function}} of bio-indication. Bio-indication with honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera L) is where the research fields of environmental technology and apiculture overlap. The honeybees are samplers of the environment by collecting unintentionally and simultaneously, along with nectar, pollen, water and honeydew from the flowers or on the leaves, other matter (in bio-indication terms: target matter) and accumulating this in the colony. Collected target matter, in this thesis heavy metals, the plant pathogens Erwinia pyrifoliae and Erwinia amylovora and the soil pollutant γ-HCH, is collected from the colony by subsampling. Subsampling the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> is done by taking and killing bees from the hive (sacrificial) or by collecting target matter from the bee’s exterior without killing the bee (non-sacrificial). In environmental technology terms the application of the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> is a Passive Sampling Method (PSM). In this thesis the possibilities and restrictions of the PSM <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> are explored. Bio-indication is a broad research field with one common factor: a living organism (bio) is applied to record an alteration of the environment (indication). The environment may be small such as a laboratory or big such as an ecosystem. Alterations in the organism may vary from detecting substances foreign to the body to mortality of the organism. In environmental technology the concept Source-Path-Receptor (SPR) is applied to map the route of a pollutant. It describes where in the environment the pollution is, how it moves through the environment and where it ends. This environment is the same environment of all living organisms, ergo also honeybees. Honeybees depend on flowers for their food. In the SPR concept, a flower can be a source, path or receptor. Along with collecting pollen, nectar, water and honeydew, target matter is collected by honeybees. Each honeybee functions as a micro-sampler of target matter in the environment, in this case the flower. Each honeybee is part of a <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> and in fact the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> is the bio-sampler. The <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> is a superorganism. The well-being of the colony prevails over the individual honeybee. Food collection is directed by the colony’s need. Foragers are directed to the most profitable food sources by the bee dance and food exchange (trophallaxis). The result of this feature is that mainly profitable sources are exploited and poor food sources less or not at all. During the active foraging period hundreds to thousands of flowers are visited daily. The nectar, pollen, water and honeydew plus the unintentionally collected target matter is accumulated in the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony.</b> In order to obtain target matter the colony must be subsampled. This is done by picking bees from the hive-entrance (hive-entering bees) or inside the hive (in-hive bees) and processing them for analysis (sacrificial). This is the most commonly applied method. However, it is possible to subsample the colony without picking and processing the bees by collecting target matter from the hive-entering bee’s exterior (non-sacrificial). For non-sacrificial subsampling of the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> the Beehold device with the sampling part Beehold tube has been developed. The results of bio-indication with honeybee colonies are qualitative and indicative for follow up study (Chapter 1). Six bio-indication studies with honeybee colonies for bio-indication of heavy metals, the plant pathogens Erwinia pyrifoliae and Erwinia amylovora and the soil pollutant γ-HCH are presented. Chapter 2 describes how the concentration of eighteen heavy metals in honeybees fluctuate throughout the period of July, August and September (temporal) at the study sites: the city of Maastricht, the urban location with an electricity power plant in Buggenum and along the Nieuwe Waterweg at Hoek van Holland (spatial). A number of the metals have not been previously analysed in honeybees. To study whether honeybees can be used for bio-indication of air pollution, the concentrations of cadmium, vanadium and lead were compared to concentrations found in honeybees. The honeybee colonies were placed next to the air samplers. Only significant differences of metal concentrations in the ambient air also show in honeybees. This was the case with vanadium in ambient air and honeybees. The spatial and temporal differences of cadmium and lead were too futile to demonstrate a correspondence (Chapter 3). In a national surveillance study in 2008 the concentration of eighteen metals in honeybees has been analysed. The results showed a distinct regional pattern. Honeybees in the East of the Netherlands have higher concentrations of heavy metals compared to the bees in the West. Besides regional differences local differences were also recorded. An approximate description of the land use around 148 apiaries (> 50 % agriculture, > 50 % wooded area, > 50 % urban area and mixed use) indicated the impact of land use on metal concentrations in honeybees. In areas with > 50 % wood significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals were detected (Chapter 4). Subsampling of the honeybee colonies in Chapter 2, 3 and 4 was done sacrificially. In the studies presented in Chapter 5, 6, and 7 the honeybee colonies were subsampled non-sacrificially or simultaneously non-sacrificially and sacrificially. The plant pathogen E. pyrifoliae causes a flower infection in the strawberry cultivation in greenhouses. In greenhouse strawberry cultivation honeybees are applied for pollination. In Chapter 5 the combination pollination / bio-indication by honeybee colonies is studied. This proved to be a match. E. pyrifoliae could be detected on in-hive bees prior to any symptom of the infection in the flowers. In the Beehold tube, the bacterium was detected {{at the same time as}} the first tiny symptoms of the infection. In Chapter 5 the principles on which the Beehold tube is based are presented and discussed. The plant pathogen E. amylovora causes fireblight in orchards. The combination pollination / bio-indication has also been applied in this study performed in Austria in 2013. It is known that E. amylovora can be detected on honeybees prior to any symptom in the flower or on the fruit tree. A fireblight outbreak depends on flowering period, humidity and temperature. In 2013 no fireblight infection emerged in the orchards where the study was performed. Therefore, the bacterium could not be detected on the honeybees. γ-HCH (Lindane) is one of the soil pollutants in the Bitterfeld region in Saxony-Anhalt in Germany. It is the result of dumping industrial waste around the production locations. Although γ-HCH is bound to soil particles there is a flux to groundwater and surface water. Consequently, the pollution may end up in the sediments of the streambed and flood plains. The study objective was to investigate the hypothetic route of γ-HCH from polluted soil (source), via soil erosion and atmospheric deposition (route) to the receptor (flowering flowers) by detecting γ-HCH in the Beehold tube. Although on average over 17000 honeybees passed through the Beehold tube daily for a maximal period of 28 days, no γ-HCH has been detected. The pollen pattern in the Beehold tube revealed where the bees collected the food (Chapter 7). The application of the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> has pros and cons. Distinctive pros are many micro samplers, the extensive collection of matter (both food and target matter) and the accumulation in the colony. For successful bio-indication with honeybee colonies, determining factors are: the target matter, location of the target matter, distance between target matter and the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony,</b> individual or pooled subsampling, the minimal sampling frequency and sample size, and sacrificial or non-sacrificial subsampling applied solely or in combination. Taking bees from a colony impacts upon the colony’s performance and consequently the passive sampling method. Based on a long-years’ experience and inter-collegial discussion it is stated that 3 % of the forager bees (hive-entering) and 1. 5 % of the in-hive bees can be sampled safely without impacting upon the colony. This restriction does not apply when carrying out non-sacrificial subsampling of the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> (Chapter 8). Performing bio-indication with honeybee colonies has more applications than have been exploited so far. Further research can make a change. In particular I mention here the combination of pollination and bio-indication and the application of non-sacrificial subsampling solely or in combination with sacrificial subsampling. Everywhere Apiculture is practiced (all over the world except the polar areas) bio-indication with honeybee colonies can be applied in a simple, practical and low cost way.  ...|$|E

This task allocation system needs to be flexible enough to allow the colony to quickly adapt to an ever-changing environment. In this study, we examined possible mechanisms by which a <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> regulates the division of labor between scouts (foragers that search for new food sources without having been guided to them) and recruits (foragers that were guided via recruitment dances toward food sources). Specifically, we examined the roles that the availability of recruitment dances and worker genotype has in the colony-level regulation of the number of workers engaged in scouting. Our approach was threefold. We first developed a mathematical model to demonstrate that the decision to become a scout or a recruit could be regulated by whether a potential forager can find a recruitment dance within a certain time period. We then tested this model by investigating the effect of dance availability on the regulation of scouts in the field. Lastly, we investigated if the probability of being a scout has a genetic basis. Our field data supported the hypothesis that scouts are those foragers that have failed to locate a recruitment dance as predicted by our model, but we found no effect of genotype on the propensity of foragers to become scouts...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{regulation}} mechanism {{based on the}} idea of the "common stomach" to explain several aspects of the resilience and homeostatic regulation of <b>honeybee</b> <b>colonies.</b> This mechanism exploits shared pools of substances (pollen, nectar, workers, brood) that modulate recruitment, abandonment and allocation patterns at the colony-level and enable bees to perform several survival strategies to cope with difficult circumstances: Lack of proteins leads to reduced feeding of young brood, to early capping of old brood and to regaining of already spent proteins through brood cannibalism. We modeled this system by linear interaction terms and mass-action law. To test the predictive power of the model of this regulatory mechanism we compared our model predictions to experimental data of several studies. These comparisons show that the proposed regulation mechanism can explain a variety of colony level behaviors. Detailed analysis of the model revealed that these mechanisms could explain the resilience, stability and self-regulation observed in <b>honeybee</b> <b>colonies.</b> We found that manipulation of material flow and applying sudden perturbations to colony stocks are quickly compensated by a resulting counter-acting shift in task selection. Selective analysis of feedback loops allowed us to discriminate the importance of different feedback loops in self-regulation of <b>honeybee</b> <b>colonies.</b> We stress that a network of simple proximate mechanisms can explain significant colony-level abilities that can also be seen as ultimate reasoning of the evolutionary trajectory of honeybees...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Pheromones are {{chemicals}} {{produced as}} liquids by specialised cells or glands and transmitted {{into the environment}} as liquids or gases. In contrary to hormones, which are excreted in organism and have effect exclusively on organism that produced them, pheromones are excreted outside organism and effect on different individuals of the same species. Pheromones mediate nearly all aspects of <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony</b> life including social defence, brood care, mating, orientation, foraging and reproduction. Pheromone investigation has high economic importance. With use of pheromones {{it is possible to}} manipulate with pest insects on crops or to direct honeybees during pollination on target plants...|$|E
40|$|The queen is the {{dominant}} female in the <b>honeybee</b> <b>colony,</b> Apis mellifera, and controls reproduction. Queen larvae are selected by the workers and are fed a special diet (royal jelly), which determines caste. Because queens mate with many males {{a large number of}} subfamilies coexist in the colony. As a consequence, there is a considerable potential for conflict among the subfamilies over queen rearing. Here we show that honeybee queens are not reared at random but are preferentially reared from rare "royal" subfamilies, which have extremely low frequencies in the colony's worker force but a high frequency in the queens reared...|$|E

Internet of Things (IoT) technology enables integration of wireless sensors inside beehives to enable remote monitoring of various beehive parameters from remote location using Internet. Detection of certain critical events in beehive is hard to be explicitly program due to complex dependence between multiple input parameters. Machine learning algorithms give computers the ability to learn to detect these events without being explicitly programmed. Detection of these event from streams of data collected from IoT sensors is possible using Complex Event Processing (CEP) which applies machine induced knowledge do detect and warn beekeepers about certain events in beehive...|$|R
