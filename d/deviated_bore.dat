40|$|One of the {{technical}} challenges in deviated drilling is the transport of drill bit cuttings to the surface. The complexity arises due to the narrow settling clearance for the cuttings {{and the presence of}} a cuttings bed on the low side of the bore hole. Fluid rheology is the determining factor in the efficiency of this operation. Drilling fluid selection for possible field use is the focus of this dissertation. The problem has been treated with a two-pronged strategy: (i) macroscopic studies that involve numerical models for the prediction of effects of rheology on drilling fluid flow through <b>deviated</b> <b>bore</b> holes; and (ii) microscopic experimental studies that provide physical insights into the fluid forces and relevant rheological parameters in cuttings resuspension. The objective {{of this study is to}} propose guidelines for fluid selection and rheological characterization of drilling fluids for the industry. The numerical study demonstrates that power law index is a significant parameter in determining the local flow regime in the different regions of the annulus and hence accurate control of power law index is critical in optimizing bore hole flow. In laminar flow, the shear thinning nature of a fluid does not aid flow through the narrow regions. Turbulence in the wider regions of the annuli aids flow through the narrow regions. The wall shear stresses are dependent only on the pressure drop, gap width and the local flow regimes. Eccentricity is found to hinder flow through the narrow regions of the annuli and certain combinations of rheology and eccentricity can cause stationary 'plug like' zones inside the annuli. The experimental study combined with microscopic calculations identified lift force as the limiting force in particle mobilization and put in perspective the possible importance of normal stresses due to the viscoelastic behavior of the fluid. It is shown that viscous characterization of the fluid is inadequate to predict the particle mobilization velocities even for very simple situations. Characterization of the fluid viscoelastic properties can provide qualitative information on the importance of fluid rheology for particle mobilization. The parameters of interest identified are the magnitude and strain sensitivity of linear viscoelastic moduli...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Velocity {{anisotropy}} referse the directional inequality of velocity on the subsurface. Often {{sedimentary rocks}} are anisotropic and occurse at all scales from core plugs to reservoirs. In this thesis velocity anisotropy of shale and sandstone was analysed from core sample and well log data. The core sample was taken at a shallow and intermediate depth {{from the northern}} North Sea (Gullfaks and Statfjord Fileds) and deeply buried, the Haltenbanken Area. The well log data were vertical and <b>deviated</b> well <b>bore</b> from Statfjord Field. The estimated velocity anisotropy from the core sample varied from weak (å= 0. 11 and ã= 0. 11) for immature source rock type Draupne Formation, å= 0. 02 and ã= 0. 07 for calcite cemented Broom Formation (Brent Group) and å= 0. 15 and ã= 0. 27 for cap rock type Lange Formation from the Haltenbanken Area. Velocity anisotropy from the well log data also show evidence of anisotropy on the Statfjord Field shale formations. The predicted velocity anisotropy from the well log data was substantial due to layer induced anisotropy (~ å= 0. 15 - 0. 25 and ~ã= 0. 43 - 0. 531) shale formations. The observed degree of anisotropy from the core sample and well log data was dependent on: the volume and type of clay minerals, the provenance, the depositional environment, diagensis, compaction, kerogen (TOC) content. This study also observed how velocity anisotropy can make huge difference to a reservoir performance and subsurface imaging by emplmenting the estimated anisotropic parameters. The methods and {{the results obtained on}} this study may be used as potential indicator of remote detection of source rock, reservoir rock and cap rock...|$|R
