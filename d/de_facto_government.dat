Russian officials had {{de facto control}} of South Ossetia's security institutions, including the armed forces; South Ossetia's <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> was largely staffed with Russians and South Ossetians with Russian passports, who had occupied equivalent government positions in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Today, the ROC is the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>{{government}}</b> of Taiwan; {{whereas the}} PRC is the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> over Mainland China. However, each government {{claims to be}} the legitimate government of all China de jure. The arguments below are frequently used by proponents and/or opponents of these claims.|$|E
50|$|In Argentina, the {{successive}} military coups that overthrew constitutional <b>governments</b> installed <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments</b> in 1930-1932, 1943-1946, 1955-1958, 1966-1973 and 1976-1983, {{the last of}} which combined {{the powers of the}} presidential office with those of the National Congress. The subsequent legal analysis of the validity of such actions led to the formulation of a doctrine of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments,</b> a case law (precedential) formulation which essentially said that the actions and decrees of past <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments,</b> although not rooted in legal legitimacy when taken, remained binding until and unless such time as they were revoked or repealed de jure by a subsequent legitimate government.|$|R

The Honduran Supreme Court also ruled that the proceedings had been legal. The government that followed the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> established a truth and reconciliation commission, Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación, which {{after more than a}} year of research and debate concluded that the ousting had been a coup d'état, and illegal in the commission's opinion.|$|E
25|$|Ghana and Senegal {{recognized}} the government immediately {{when it was}} established and the Republic of Dahomey {{recognized the}}m as the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government.</b> Guinea, Liberia, the Ivory Coast, and Tanganyika all denounced the coup and the assassination.|$|E
25|$|Chaos persisted {{until the}} Convention, elected by {{universal}} male suffrage {{and charged with}} writing a new constitution, met on 20 September 1792 and became the new <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> of France.

The following day – 22 September 1792, the first morning of the new Republic – was later retroactively adopted {{as the beginning of}} Year One of the French Republican Calendar.|$|E
50|$|In the 1831 papal bull Sollicitudo Ecclesiarum, Pope Gregory XVI drew a clear {{distinction}} between <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> recognition and <b>de</b> jure, saying that the church would negotiate with <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments,</b> but that was not an endorsement of either their legitimacy or policies.|$|R

SIDE also took part in coordinating Operation Condor with other Latin American intelligence services.|$|E
25|$|As a {{reaction}} of the abdication of king Ferdinand VII in favour of Napoleon, the Junta declared itself sovereign and supreme authority of the Kingdom on June 18, 1808, during the Peninsular war, becoming so the legitimate and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> of the Kingdom until Galicia was conquered by the Napoleonic troops in 1809. At the effect of having a broader base and representativeness, it briefly admitted among its members churchmen (the bishop of Ourense) and titled noblemen.|$|E
25|$|For the {{following}} {{ten years of}} civil war in Britain, the Covenanters were the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> of Scotland. In 1642, they sent an army to Ulster in Ireland to protect the Scottish settlers there from the Irish Catholic rebels who had attacked them in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. The Scottish army remained in Ireland {{until the end of}} the civil wars, but was confined to its garrison around Carrickfergus after its defeat at the Battle of Benburb in 1646.|$|E

50|$|Genta's {{ideas were}} not {{confined}} to the fringes, as they influenced some sections of the military <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments,</b> especially the National Reorganization Process (1976-1983).

25|$|Following the {{expulsion}} of its President Manuel Zelaya, Honduras' membership of the Organization was suspended unanimously at midnight on 5 July 2009. The <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> had already announced it was leaving the OAS hours earlier; this was not, however, taken into account by the OAS, which does not recognize that government as legitimate. An extraordinary meeting had been conducted by the OAS in Washington, D.C., with Zelaya in attendance. The suspension of Honduras was approved unanimously with 33 votes (Honduras did not vote). This was the first suspension {{carried out by the}} OAS since that of Cuba in 1962.|$|E

In June 1983, after the Comité's fall in 1982, he formed, with other southerners who had held important posts under the governments of François Tombalbaye and Félix Malloum, an opposition party, the Groupe des patriotes et democrates tchadiens. On April 27, 1984, in Lagos, the group signed an accord with the Forces Populares et Revolutionnaires du Tchad, {{with the goal of}} forming a third force, opposed to both the Chadian government and the GUNT insurgents.|$|E
25|$|To {{command the}} {{invasion}} of France, Roosevelt chose General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had successfully commanded a multinational coalition in North Africa and Sicily. Eisenhower chose to commence Operation Overlord on June 6, 1944. Supported by 12,000 aircraft and the largest naval force ever assembled, the Allies successfully established a beachhead in Normandy and then advanced further into France. Though reluctant to back an unelected government, Roosevelt recognized Charles de Gaulle's Provisional Government of the French Republic as the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> of France in July 1944. After most of France had been liberated from German occupation, Roosevelt granted formal recognition to de Gaulle's government in October 1944. Over the following months, the Allies liberated more territory from Nazi occupation and began {{the invasion of}} Germany. By April 1945, Nazi resistance was crumbling {{in the face of}} advances by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, the Bolshevik 11th Red Army invaded Azerbaijan {{and then}} Armenia {{and put an}} end to the {{national}} <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments</b> that existed in those two countries.

50|$|Because {{they were}} <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments,</b> {{there was a}} legal {{controversy}} {{about the validity of}} decree-laws. In 1945, the Supreme Court of Argentina accepted them only if they were needed to fulfill the aims of the government. When the military government dissolved and civilian rule was reestablished, the decree-laws were no longer valid, unless the Congress ratified them.|$|R
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1918, he and Jumanca became {{involved}} in reestablishing Adevărul, which, inspired by the Fourteen Points, became connected with the fight for emancipation of Romanians in Transylvania and Banat, and their eventual union with Romania. Before the Aster Revolution, Flueraș and Jumanca were charged with contacting the Romanian National Party, negotiations which led, in early October, {{to the creation of}} Consiliul Național Român Central (CNRC, the Central Romanian National Council). The CNRC was instrumental in convoking the Alba Iulia Assembly of December 1, 1918, one which declared Transylvania's secession from the Hungarian Republic, and its will to join with Romania; Flueraș was the Assembly's vice president, and subsequently served as Chief of Department of Social Security and Hygiene in the Directory Council (the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> of the region, led by Iuliu Maniu). Among the other Social Democrats in the Council were Jumanca, Albani, and Enea Grapini.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the queen}} showed {{increasing}} signs of mental instability. On , seventeen doctors signed a document declaring her unable {{to manage the}} kingdom, with no prospect for her condition to improve. John was reluctant to take the reins of power, rejecting {{the idea of a}} formal regency. This opened the way for elements of the nobility to form a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> via a Council. Rumors circulated that John exhibited symptoms of the same insanity, and that he might be prevented from ruling. According to longstanding laws that guided the institution of regency, were the regent to die or become incapable for any reason, and having children of less than fourteen years (which was John's situation at the time), government would be exercised by the guardians of those children or, if guardians had not been formally named, by the wife of the regent. In John's case, {{that would have been a}} Spanish infanta. Fear, suspicion and intrigue engulfed the entire institutional framework of the nation.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of sovereign states recognise Abkhazia {{as an integral}} part of Georgia and support its territorial integrity according to the principles of international law, although Belarus has expressed sympathy toward the recognition of Abkhazia. Some have officially noted Abkhazia as under occupation by the Russian military. The United Nations has been urging both sides to settle the dispute through diplomatic dialogue and ratifying the final status of Abkhazia in the Georgian constitution. However, the Abkhaz <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> considers Abkhazia a sovereign country even if it is recognised by few other countries. In early 2000, then-UN Special Representative of the Secretary General Dieter Boden and the Group of Friends of Georgia, consisting of the representatives of Russia, the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, drafted and informally presented a document to the parties outlining a possible distribution of competencies between the Abkhaz and Georgian authorities, based on core respect for Georgian territorial integrity. The Abkhaz side, however, has never accepted the paper as a basis for negotiations. Eventually, Russia also withdrew its approval of the document. In 2005 and 2008, the Georgian government offered Abkhazia a high degree of autonomy and possible federal structure within the borders and jurisdiction of Georgia.|$|E

500|$|Louis XVI was {{executed}} on 21 January 1793, and on 8 August of that year, {{on the eve}} of the Reign of Terror, the new <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> executive, the Committee of Public Safety, suppressed all academies, and with it the commission, requiring them to justify their existence. Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, a member of the convention, argued that the importance of reforming weights and measures was such that the work of the commission should be allowed to continue. [...] On 11 September 1793 the commission was reconstituted as the commission temporaire.|$|E
500|$|At {{the hearing}} for Dhlamini and Mlambo on 4 March 1968, Beadle {{dismissed}} the statement from London, {{saying it was}} a decision by the UK government and not the Queen herself, and that in any case the 1961 constitution had transferred the prerogative of mercy from Britain to the Rhodesian Executive Council. [...] "The present government is the fully <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>government</b> and as such is the only power that can exercise the prerogative," [...] he concluded. [...] "It would be strange indeed if the United Kingdom government, exercising no internal power in Rhodesia, were given the right to exercise the prerogative of clemency." [...] The Judge President Sir Vincent Quenet and Justice Hector Macdonald agreed, and the application was dismissed. Dhlamini, Mlambo and Shadreck were hanged two days later.|$|E
50|$|Critics have {{frequently}} likened the invaders and their methods as veiled {{references to the}} various military-led coup d'états which occurred {{at the time in}} the country. The three versions written by Oesterheld (the first part, its remake and the second part) were contemporaneous with the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments</b> of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, Juan Carlos Onganía and the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Although the 1830 {{constitution}} {{remained in}} effect for eighty-seven years, <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments</b> violated it repeatedly. In the 1878-90 period, the Blancos and Colorados initiated the framework for a more stable system through understandings called [...] "pacts between the parties." [...] This governing principle, called coparticipation (coparticipación), meaning the sharing of formal political and informal bureaucratic power, has been formally practiced since 1872.|$|R
5000|$|The {{club has}} also been accused of {{supporting}} several <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>governments</b> of Argentina.
