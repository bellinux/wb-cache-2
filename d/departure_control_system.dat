40|$|At a {{time when}} airline {{business}} is facing a very competitive period, the strategy took up to shape thefuture is crucial. Airlines need to continuously invest in innovative IT solutions which enable them to improve and optimize specific processes rapidly. Amadeus IT Group provides an extended variety of pioneering IT and Distribution Solutions to this market. Altéa <b>Departure</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Systems</b> (DCS) are the Amadeus solutions designed to automate key airport services. The purpose of this master thesis was to specify, design and implement a working prototype of an interface that integrates two airport IT Solutions; Altéa <b>Departure</b> <b>Control</b> Flight and Altéa Baggage Reconciliation System (BRS). The prototype’s main goal was to demonstrate a usable interface between the two systems providing benefits to airlines in terms of weight and balance engineering operations and a complete baggage tracking. The first phase of this project involved {{to become familiar with}} both systems, from goals to functionalities. Afterwards, a complete pre-study was dedicated to investigating message formats in the airline industry and current flows of information between Altéa DCS. In addition, a user study was conducted mainly focusing on agents activities concerning loading processes to determine the needs and requirements of the FM-BRS Interface users. Functional requirements were gathered from various meetings in which team members representatives from both teams attended. The prototype was evaluated in different test environments with expert representatives from Customer Management Baggage Team and Flight Management Team. The result of the 6 -month thesis is a first prototype of a standalone interface which tolerates a flow of communications not only between these two Amadeus Systems, but also with other DCS or BRS. A qualitative analysis shows the benefits that can be archived if the interface is implemented by airlines. The analysis’ conclusions are used to assess results obtained whilst testing the prototype. To conclude, a feasibility study suggested that further work needs to be put in the prototype in terms of functionalities and messages format selection...|$|R

The ICCI-DCS had additional airport modules added, the first being the flight information display system followed by the signage system to control checking counters/departure gate electronic signage. This new system was then installed in Phoenix, Arizona for America West Airlines; EDS was the primary vendor.|$|E
50|$|Users access an airline’s {{inventory}} {{through an}} availability display. It contains all offered flights {{for a particular}} city-pair with their available seats in the different booking classes. This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co-operation with another airline. If the city pair is not one on which the airline offers service, it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines. The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces. Depending {{on the type of}} co-operation, it supports access to the last seat (last seat availability) in real-time. Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so-called passenger name record (PNR). Among other data, the PNR contains personal information such as name, contact information or special services requests (SSRs) e.g. for a vegetarian meal, as well as the flights (segments) and issued tickets. Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re-entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger. In addition, most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications (aka frequent traveller systems). Before a flight departs, the so-called passenger name list (PNL) is handed over to the <b>departure</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that is used to check-in passengers and baggage. Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and special service requests is also transferred to flight operations systems, crew management and catering systems. Once a flight has departed, the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked-in passengers (e.g. passengers who had a reservation but did not check in (no shows) and passengers who checked in, but did not have a reservation (go shows)). Finally, data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems.|$|E

40|$|This study {{intends to}} propose "Self-Service Technology Adoption Model" by {{utilizing}} {{the knowledge and}} experiences of front line experts. The Agent-Based Model has a fuzzy inference system to let passengers choose a check-in option: a conventional style check-in position or a self-service kiosk. The experiments are conducted with observed data, which are collected from the airline’s <b>Departure</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> (DCS). We tried approximating the experimental space to “the real world” and evaluating the proposed model by measuring how it reproduces the observed self-service usage rate in “the real world”. This study also suggests the efficient practice of air–travel passenger handling with self-service kiosks in an international passenger terminal by the simulation of the proposed agent-based model. Through conducting the experiments, the scenario and the key factor are indicated, which may possibly accelerate the self-service usage rate with cost effective way and less impact for customer services...|$|E
40|$|A <b>departure</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (DCS) is an {{administrative}} tool used by airports to handle boarding and baggage management. However the DCSs used by smaller swedish airports are outdated and tied to desktop applications {{which are a}} hassle to update. The {{solution to this problem}} is to develop a new web based DCS. A DCS needs hardware to fully function (scanners, printers), this poses the problem of communicating between a web browser and hardware. To solve this problem a local server was developed to handle the hardware and communication with the browser which was then integrated into a web application. When developing the DCS, readability and further development was kept in mind making code quality and code commenting key factors. To evaluate whether these factor positively affected readability, an interview was conducted. The foundation of a web based DCS was developed and according to the interview results the conclusions is that code commenting, proper naming and modularity increases source code comprehension...|$|E

A precisely built model of airport processes is the prerequisite of proper implementation of the simulation, pointing out both the advantages and disadvantages of this models and their implementation in practice...|$|E
40|$|A {{sequential}} optimization {{method is}} applied to manage air traffic flow under uncertainty in airspace capacity and demand. To support its testing, a decision support system is developed by integrating a deterministic integer programming model for assigning delays to aircraft under en route capacity constraints to reactively account for system uncertainties. To reduce computational complexity, the model assigns only <b>departure</b> <b>controls,</b> while a tactical control loop consisting of a shortest path routing algorithm and an airborne holding algorithm refines the strategic plan to keep flights from deviating into capacity constrained airspace. This integrated approach is used to conduct thirty-two, 6 -hour fast-time simulation experiments to explore variations in the number and severity of <b>departure</b> <b>controls,</b> tactical reroutes, and airborne holding controls. Three feasible types of traffic flow controls emerged. The first type relied primarily on <b>departure</b> <b>controls</b> and strategic reroutes on the 300 to 400 nmi look-ahead horizon and worked best when rerouting occurred at a frequency of 10 to 15 minutes. The second type generated more tactical reroutes on the 200 – 300 nmi look-ahead horizon and required little airborne holding or pre-departure control when rerouting occurred at a frequency of 5 minutes. The last type relied heavily on airborne holding controls and infrequent updates to the weather avoidance reroutes. This last type was the least desirable solution due {{to the impact of}} its airborne holding on airspace complexity and airspace users. I...|$|R
