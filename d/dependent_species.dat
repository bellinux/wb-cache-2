5|$|Whitebark pine {{communities}} have been heavily damaged {{due to the}} effects of blister rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the whitebark pine trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark's nutcracker. Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on <b>dependent</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{practical}} {{question in}} active vegetation restoration is whether certain plants facilitate the recruitment and persistence of other plants (as predicted by theories of succession), or whether initial community composition determines long-term community composition (priority effects). If the former applies, {{it may be}} more effective to plant facilitative species first, and wait to plant <b>dependent</b> <b>species</b> as conditions become appropriate (e.g., when enough shade is provided by overstory species). If the latter applies, it is probably best to plant all desired species at the outset.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{habitat types}} for {{wildlife}} {{have been provided}} by mixed satoyama landscape {{as a result of}} the Japanese traditional agricultural system that also facilitates the movement of wildlife between a variety of habitats. The migration of wild animals can occur between ponds, rice paddies, grasslands, forests, and also from one village to another. [...] Ponds, reservoirs, and streams in particular play a significant role in the survival of water <b>dependent</b> <b>species</b> such as dragonflies, and fireflies. In the early stages of their life cycle, they spend most of their time in water. Deciduous oaks such as Quercus acutissima and Quercus serrata are planted by farmers to maintain deciduous broad-leaf trees. Succession to dense and dark laurel forest is prevented by farmers that cut down these trees for firewood and charcoal every 15 to 20 years. Many plant and animal species are able to live in these deciduous forests because of traditional management practices.|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} first {{correction}} to the equilibrium phase space distribution {{and its effects}} on spectra and elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions. We show that the departure from equilibrium on the freezeout surface is the largest part of the viscous corrections to v_ 2 (p_T). However, the momentum dependence of the departure from equilibrium is not known a priori, and it is probably not proportional to p_T^ 2 as has been assumed in hydrodynamic simulations. At high momentum in weakly coupled plasmas it is determined by the rate of radiative energy loss and is proportional to p_T^ 3 / 2. The weaker p_T dependence leads to straighter v_ 2 (p_T) curves at the same value of viscosity. Further, the departure from equilibrium is generally <b>species</b> <b>dependent.</b> A <b>species</b> <b>dependent</b> equilibration rate, with baryons equilibrating faster than mesons, can explain "constituent quark scaling" without invoking coalescence models.
