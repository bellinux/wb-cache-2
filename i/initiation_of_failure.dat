40|$|The {{need for}} {{accurate}} material models {{to simulate the}} deformation, damage and failure of polymer matrix composites under impact conditions is becoming critical as these materials are gaining increased use in the aerospace and automotive communities. The aerospace community has identified several key capabilities which are currently lacking in the available material models in commercial transient dynamic finite element codes. To attempt to improve the predictive capability of composite impact simulations, a next generation material model is being developed for incorporation within the commercial transient dynamic finite element code LS-DYNA. The material model, which incorporates plasticity, damage and failure, utilizes experimentally based tabulated input to define the evolution of plasticity and damage and the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> as opposed to specifying discrete input parameters such as modulus and strength. The plasticity portion of the orthotropic, three-dimensional, macroscopic composite constitutive model {{is based on an}} extension of the Tsai-Wu composite failure model into a generalized yield function with a non-associative flow rule. For the damage model, a strain equivalent formulation is used to allow for the uncoupling of the deformation and damage analyses. For the failure model, a tabulated approach is utilized in which a stress or strain based invariant is defined {{as a function of the}} location of the current stress state in stress space to define the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Failure surfaces can be defined with any arbitrary shape, unlike traditional failure models where the mathematical functions used to define the failure surface impose a specific shape on the failure surface.

The edge surface of the plate between the two notches is struck by a cyl-indrical projectile of diameter equal to {{the distance between the}} notches and made of the same material as the plate. The plate material is modeled as heat-conducting, microporous, elastoviscoplastic, and isotropic. Both the brittle and the ductile failures initiate at points adjoining the notch-tip surface that are on the midplane of the plate and propagate toward the outer surfaces. Even for a relatively thin plate, the difference in the times <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> on the mid and front surfaces is significant. Also the two failure modes on the mid surface initiate much later than that predicted by the plane strain analysis. Thus an experi-mentalist observing fracture on the front or the back face of the plate will see it initiate much later than the times given by the plane strain analysis of the problem. For a steel plate, it is found that the failure mode transitions from brittle to ductile at an impact speed of about 21. 8 m=s...|$|R

To this end, we simulate the transient response of composites with nonuniform arrangements of their microstructures. First, a constitutive model that reproduces experimentally measured response of a glass-fiber composites is identified and adjusted. This involves a Mie–Grüneisen equation of state for the dilatational response together with a Voigt model for the isochoric behavior which is modified to include damage effects from void nucleation and growth. Then, with the aid of this constitutive model, a sequence of simulations of composites with nonuniform distributions of the reinforcement are executed. We find that composites with increasing volume fraction of the reinforcement along the impact direction tend to attenuate the intensity of the propagating waves. This attenuation delays the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> mechanisms to higher impact velocities and improves the composite’s sturdiness...|$|E
30|$|The {{choice of}} rock failure models defines the {{magnitude}} of minimum and maximum allowable mud pressures. For example, applying the Mogi–Coulomb rock failure model, the minimum allowable mud pressure is much less compared to when either the Mohr–Coulomb failure model or the Hoek–Brown failure model is adopted (Elyasi and Goshtasbi 2015). Also, predicted mud windows are narrower and conservative with the Hoek–Brown model (Elyasi and Goshtasbi 2015). The failure criterion selected therefore has a prominent influence on the defined safe mud window. Due to its simplicity, the linear-elastic analysis {{is often used to}} predict the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> In terms of stress, the onset of tensile or compressive failure happens when the respective tensile and compressive rock strength is exceeded. Whereas the criterion for tensile failure is defined by when the minimum effective stress is greater than the rock tensile strength, the criterion for compressive failure is determined by whichever compressive failure criterion is deemed appropriate (McLean and Addis 1990) (e.g. Mohr–Coulomb, Drucker–Prager and Hoek–Brown).|$|E

The objective of this work was to examine some of the parameters which influence the interface static shear strength, including surface finish, cement type, pre-treatments and porosity. Surface finish {{was found to have}} the greatest effect on the interface strength. Increasing the surface roughness by a factor of 100 increases the interface shear strength by a factor of 20. However, increasing the surface roughness above a certain value was found to have no additional affect. This was due to failure in the cement itself rather than at the cement–stem interface. There were significant differences between some of the different cement types regarding the interface strength. Pre-heating the stem produced a six fold reduction in cement porosity at the stem–cement interface, however, resulting in only a minor influence on the static interface strength. Generally, no significant correlation was found between the cement porosity and the static interfacial shear strength...|$|E

However, these stresses are not higher than those reported for other kinds of prostheses, e. g. acetabular cup, tibial plateau. From these findings, together with clinical observations, it is hypothesized that the femoral surface cup is more sensitive to local loosening than other prostheses.
