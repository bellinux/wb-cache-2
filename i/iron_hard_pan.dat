About 185 great groups are recognized in the United States. Horizons marked by clay, <b>iron,</b> humus and <b>hard</b> <b>pans</b> and soil features such as the expansion-contraction of clays (that produce self-mixing provided by clay), temperature, and marked quantities of various salts are used as distinguishing features.|$|R

40|$|Crop {{diversification}} is {{advocated for}} improvement of income of lowland rice farmers in the Mekong region, including Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. One common problem of adding non-rice crops after wetland rice is excess water caused by reduced drainage associated with the <b>hard</b> <b>pan</b> that is commonly created to store water in the paddy for the rice crop. This paper firstly describes the water balance in the lowland fields particularly on how deep percolation is decreased by the <b>hard</b> <b>pan,</b> {{and the effect of}} wet cultivation on soil compaction and water availability in the subsequent crops such as mungbean. Experimental work in Cambodia shows how non-rice crops such as mungbean and peanut often fail completely or partially due to excess water. The common experience is complete failure of the early wet season non-rice crop when rain started earlier and the lowland paddy is saturated with water, but also non-rice crops often do not grow well due to shallow root systems confined to the top soil above the <b>hard</b> <b>pan.</b> Destructing the <b>hard</b> <b>pan</b> may help non-rice crops, but the process is expensive and may have an adverse effect on subsequent rice crops. Experimental work has also demonstrated that where irrigation water is available, irrigation is often not effective as it causes soil saturation in the top soil. Ways to minimize the excess water problem are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Soil {{structure}} strongly affects its {{tendency to}} form a <b>hard</b> <b>pan.</b> One such common soil condition related to hardpan is soil pH.

40|$|Development {{of sensors}} {{to detect the}} {{location}} and depth of <b>hard</b> <b>pans</b> in real time is a major restriction on the application of Site Specific Crop Management (SSCM). In this study, a soil compaction profile sensor equipped with four horizontal operating penetro-meters for on-the-go sensing and mapping of the location and intensity of <b>hard</b> <b>pans</b> arti-ficially formed in a soil bin was developed and tested. The leading edge of a 600 mm long vertical soil cutting blade held four 8 mm diameter, 80 mm long, and 30 degree conic tip stainless steel soil penetrating rods equally spaced at 100 mm vertical intervals. With this arrangement, when the cutting blade was driven into the soil up to a 500 mm depth, the conic tips sensed soil penetration resistances at 100, 200, 300 and 400 mm depths. The penetration resistance force was transmitted by the rod end to the elastic diaphragm of a hydrostatic oil chamber beneath each rod. Each oil chamber was connected to a force magnifying piston and cylinder located off the soil engaging tools. The penetration force was magnified five times before being sensed by a strain gage load cell.

40|$|Eight {{years after}} planting, root systems were {{compared}} for 30 Pinus radiata D. Eton trees excavated {{from each of}} five different ripping treatments and an unripped control. Taproots of trees from deep-ripped (100 cm) treatments penetrated to a far greater depth (153 cm) than those from the shallow-ripped treatment (60 cm). Taproots of trees planted on the unripped site penetrated to a maximum depth of 48 cm {{because of the presence}} of a <b>hard</b> <b>pan.</b> A single line rip (deep or shallow) resulted in some orientation of primary lateral roots. This orientation became more pronounced in the secondary lateral roots, which were confined along the line of the rip. Although lateral roots were more evenly distributed in the unripped and cross-ripped treatments, least development was in the north-east quadrant and greatest development in the south-west. The number of butt-swept trees was not significantly affected by treatment, but ths severity of stem deviation and sinuosity resulting from initial butt sweep was related to treatment. The straighter the taproot and the deeper its penetra-tion, the less stem deviation. It is suggested that all sites with a shallow <b>hard</b> <b>pan</b> be deep-ripped, using winged rippers, to maximise soil disturbance, and that forests on the Canterbury Plains have rows orientated south-west to north-east...|$|R

30|$|Some {{researcher}} {{found that}} bulk density was higher in greenhouse soils than uncovered soil. In recent years, {{there has been}} increasing interests in intensive vegetable cultivation, this caused the soil compacted. Compaction of soils causes a reduction in soil pore space. This reduces {{the rate at which}} water can infiltrate and drain through the soil. It also reduces the available space for oxygen in the plant root zones. For this reason, some of the major consequences of compaction are poor drainage, poor aeration, and <b>hard</b> <b>pan</b> surfaces which cause runoff. Repeated cultivation of some soils leads to a breakdown of soil structure and this also increases the likelihood of compaction.|$|R
