25|$|The {{avionics}} is {{a further}} development of the <b>integrated</b> <b>modular</b> <b>avionics</b> (IMA) concept found on the A380. The A350's IMA will manage up to 40 functions (versus 23 functions for the A380) such as undercarriage, fuel, pneumatics, cabin environmental systems, and fire detection. Airbus stated that the benefits includes reduced maintenance and lower weight because as the IMA replaces multiple processors and LRUs with around 50% fewer standard computer modules known as line-replaceable modules. The IMA runs on a 100 Mbit/s network based on the AFDX standard, as employed in the A380, {{in place of the}} architecture used on the A330/A340.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, UAC {{announced}} that a new next-generation integrated avionics suite has started flight-testing. The new avionics suite—called the ИМА БК, the Russian acronym for Интегрированная модульная авионика боевого комплекса (<b>integrated</b> <b>modular</b> <b>avionics</b> combat systems)—replaces a system designed in 2004 called Багет (Baguette) used on previous Su-35. The still-in-development system has more than 4 million lines of code. The IMA BK makes use of indigenous Russian multi-core microprocessors and a new indigenous real-time operating system. The new avionic suite also makes use of fiber-optic channels with a throughput of the more 8 Gbit/s, which is up from 100 Mbit/sec for traditional copper wires. The new IMA BK integrated avionics suite designed to automatically detects, identifies and tracks the most dangerous targets and offers the pilot the best solution to engage an enemy. “The new system takes control of {{almost all of the}} key sensors of the aircraft—radar, navigation and communication that in previous aircraft were controlled by separate computers,” the company says.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{increasing}} {{requirement for}} satellites, space probes and (unmanned) aircraft {{is that they}} exhibit robust behaviour without direct human intervention. Autonomous oper-ation is required in spite of incomplete knowledge of an uncertain environment. In particular, embedded equipment that processes sensing data must consider uncertain input parameters while managing its own activities. We show how uncertainty may be addressed in constraint-based planning and scheduling functions for aerospace equipment, contrasting with some current practice in <b>Integrated</b> <b>Modular</b> <b>Avionic</b> (IMA) design. We produce a conditional plan that takes account of foreseeable contingencies, so guaranteeing system behaviour in the worst case. Executing {{a branch of the}} plan corresponds to synthesising a deterministic finite state automaton capable of discrete event commanding of an avionic sub-system. Experimental results show the feasibility of the approach for realistic aerospace equipment. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectronic sets {{operated}} on aircraft are usually summarized as “avionic architectures” (for “aviation electronic architecture”). Since the 70 s, avionic architectures, composed of digital processing modules and communication buses, are supporting {{more and more}} avionic applications such as flight control, flight management, etc. Hence, avionic architectures have become a central component of an aircraft. They have to ensure a large variety of important requirements: safety, robustness to equipment failures, determinism, and real-time. In response to these requirements, aircraft manufacturers have proposed several solutions. This article has a twin objectives: firstly to survey {{the state of the}} art of existing avionic architectures, including the IMA (for <b>Integrated</b> <b>Modular</b> <b>Avionic)</b> architecture of the most recent aircraft; and secondly to discuss two challenges for the next generation of avionic architectures: reconfiguration capabilities, and integrating COTS processing equipment such as multi-core processors. We believe that these two challenges will be central to the next generation of IMA architectures (called IMA- 2 G for IMA 2 d generation) ...|$|R

40|$|In modern <b>integrated</b> <b>modular</b> <b>avionic</b> systems, {{applications}} share hardware {{resources on}} a common avionic platform. Such an architecture necessitates strict requirements on the spatial and temporal partitioning of the system to prevent fault propagation between different aircraft functions. One way to establish a temporal partitioning is through pre-runtime scheduling of the system, which involves creating a schedule for both tasks and a communication network. While the avionic systems are growing more and more complex, so is the challenge of scheduling them. Scheduling of the system has {{an important role in}} the development of new avionic systems since functionality typically is added to the system over a period of several years and a scheduling tool is used both to detect if the platform can host the new functionality and, in case this is possible, to create a new schedule. For this reason an exact solution strategy for avionics scheduling is preferred over a heuristic one. In this paper we present a mathematical model for an industrially relevant avionic system and present a constraint generation  procedure for scheduling of such systems. We apply our optimisation approach to instances provided by our industrial partner. These instances are of relevance for the development of future avionic systems and contain up to 20 000 tasks to be scheduled. The computational results show that our optimisation approach can be used to create schedules for such instances within reasonable time...|$|R

The software that implements {{most of the}} satellite functionality {{has to deal with}} this fact {{and is one of the}} reasons why software has become one of the major cost drivers in satellite projects. Similar problems have triggered developments in other industrial domains like AUTOSAR in the automotive area or <b>Integrated</b> <b>Modular</b> Architecture (IMA) in the aerospace industry [8].

The goals of the Open <b>Modular</b> <b>Avionics</b> Architecture for Space Applications (OMAC 4 S) initiative started by Astrium, Fraunhofer FOKUS, STI, SYSGO and TTTech are to outline a solution that helps to reduce complexity and costs for space avionics significantly.

In this paper we describe how standardization and the usage of already proven technologies from other industrial domains will help to limit the effect of the software development on schedule and costs of satellite projects.
