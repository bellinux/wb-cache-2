25|$|Meg's {{father is}} a physicist, researching {{the mysteries of the}} space/time continuum, {{specifically}} five-dimensional means of travel between planets. He is also the father of Meg, Sandy, Dennys and Charles Wallace. He has been missing for some time as the novel opens. Not even his government colleagues <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> He is usually referred to as Mr. Murry. His first name is revealed in the fifth and last Time novel An Acceptable Time. In the television adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time, he is renamed Jack. He first appears in a flashback in Chapter One.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Walter Bishop (John Noble) is at a graveyard, {{where he}} solemnly stares at an unknown gravestone. Olivia, Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) begin searching for Walter. Nina tells Olivia that an energy cell {{was stolen from}} her {{mechanical}} arm by Jones, {{and that he was}} formerly a Massive Dynamic employee who had looked up to Bell as a [...] "father figure" [...] until they had a falling-out. When Olivia demands to speak to Bell, Nina explains that she does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> as Bell has been communicating these past few months [...] "strictly electronically". Nina believes Jones is trying to confront Bell, and promises Olivia that if she stops Jones, Nina will arrange a meeting between her and Bell.|$|E

500|$|Lisa is {{transferred}} to Walter's lab, where he gives her special drugs to extract Rusk's thoughts from her mind. Instead, Rusk gains control of Lisa's body and demands to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> His description of the murderer leads them another naval officer, who tells them Rusk's physically abused wife Teresa (Annie Parisse) hired him for the murder. Believing that he has left her mind, they learn too late that Rusk is still in control of Lisa; he goes to exact revenge on Teresa, but is stopped by Peter before he can go through with the murder. Lisa is eventually able to purge Rusk from her consciousness. The final scene shows an unrelated car crash victim suddenly waking up, mumbling in Russian: [...] "My Star", the pet name Rusk called his wife, meaning that Rusk is back.|$|E

2500|$|In The New Jerusalem, Chesterton made {{it clear}} that he {{believed}} that there was a [...] "Jewish Problem" [...] in Europe, in the sense that he believed that Jewish culture (though not Jewish ethnicity) separated itself from the nationalities of Europe. He argued that he was quite in favour of a Jew becoming Prime Minister or Lord Chancellor, under the condition, though, that [...] "every Jew must be dressed like an Arab [...] The point applies to any Jew, and to our own recovery of healthier relations with him. The point is that we should know where we are; and he would <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> which is in a foreign land." [...] He suggested the formation of a Jewish homeland as a solution, and was later invited to Palestine by Jewish Zionists who saw him as an ally in their cause. Later he grew out of the notion of Palestine as a Jewish homeland, and suggested somewhere in Africa instead.|$|E
2500|$|A {{turning point}} in Zimmer's career {{occurred}} with the 1988 film Rain Man. Hollywood director Barry Levinson was {{looking for someone to}} score Rain Man, and his wife heard the soundtrack CD of the anti-apartheid drama A World Apart, for which Zimmer had composed the music. Levinson was impressed by Zimmer's work and hired him to score Rain Man. In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers (mostly a Fairlight CMI) mixed with steel drums. Zimmer explained that [...] "It was a road movie, and road movies usually have jangly guitars or a bunch of strings. I kept thinking don't be bigger than the characters. Try to keep it contained. The Raymond character doesn't actually <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> The world is so different to him. He might as well be on Mars. So, why don't we just invent our own world music for a world that doesn't really exist?". Zimmer’s score for Rain Man was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989, and the film won four Academy Awards including Best Picture.|$|E

2500|$|On April 21, 2016, Gerardo {{was arrested}} by the National Police of Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was arrested {{following}} an extensive money laundering investigation between Latin American officials and the U.S. government that linked him to several shell companies he used to purchase assets in the Americas and overseas. This information was discovered in 2015 through the massive information leak known as the Panama Papers. Following his arrest, Tobares' family spoke {{to the press and}} talked about the investigation. They said they encountered problems in Mexico when the Argentine consular authorities were rotated and new personnel took over the case. In an effort to continue their search, they tried to increase their activity on social media, but they said that some people (who they suspect worked for Gerardo) told them that Tobares was with them or that they had seen him alive in Mexico. Ana Soledad said she was told that Gerardo was once in Argentina and wanted to speak to her, but she refused. [...] "We just want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> so we can bring him home, with his people, with his friends he loved and loved him. We do not want to know who took him. We just want to know, even anonymously, where he is," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|The veteran Garth McKenzie and debutant Alan Thomson {{departed}} from line and length {{with the new}} ball and Geoff Boycott (37) and Brian Luckhurst (74) added 92 for the first wicket. In the increasing gloom Boycott tried to square-cut a long hop from Johnny Gleeson and edged it to Rodney Marsh, providing the keeper with {{the first of his}} 355 victims in Test cricket. Alan Knott came in as nightwatchman and was bounced by Thomson in the poor light, Jack Fingleton claiming that 'He can be excused. he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> bowling.'. In the morning – the first Sunday's play at the Gabba – Knott took his score to 73, joined by John Edrich (79) and Basil d'Oliveira (57) as they slowly batted into the fourth afternoon with the crowd giving them a slow hand-clap. The Monday was a rest day with three and a half inches of rain falling, but the wicket was covered, so there would be no danger of a gluepot as in the 1950–51 Brisbane Test. The following day Colin Cowdrey (28) overtook Wally Hammond's record of 7,249 runs to become the most prolific Test batsmen, which earned him an ovation from the crowd. The [...] "Golden Arm" [...] of Doug Walters was able to both swing the ball and produce line and length to dismiss Knott, take the last two wickets and return figures of 3/12, but the other bowlers suffered; McKenzie 2/90, Thomson 1/136, Gleeson 2/92 and Jenner 1/86. Rod Marsh had been brought in as wicket-keeper because of his superior batting skills and took four catches, but dropped three as he fumbled the ball and was dubbed [...] "Iron Gloves" [...] by the press. England overtook the Australian total to finish with 464, the third highest Test innings without a century at the time, to give them a lead of 31 runs. The Australian selector Neil Harvey commented that Ray Illingworth [...] "gave up any thought of going for a win when he lost the toss", and most of the commentators agreed.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, miss," [...] said Matlack, promptly, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> He's a real hermit. He's off by himself, {{most likely}} miles away." ...|$|E
