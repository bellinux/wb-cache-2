Priklausomai nuo ūkininkavimo sąlygų, mikromicetai pašaruose produkuoja toksiškus gyvuliams ir žmonėms junginius – mikotoksinus. Jie neigiamai veikia organizmą – hepatotoksiškai, nefrotoksiškai, imunosupresyviai, estrogeniškai, kancerogeniškai. Tai gali sukelti žmonių ir gyvulių mikotoksikozes (Bakutis, 2004). Vis didesnis dėmesys skiriamas mikotoksinų užterštoms pašarinėms žaliavoms. Sandėliuojant pašarus būtina laikytis sanitarinių higieninių reikalavimų, kadangi pašarinėse žaliavose gausu įvairių maisto medžiagų, yra palanki terpė daugintis daugeliui mikroorganizmų. Dėl visuotinio išplitimo mikotoksinai laikomi vienu svarbiausių žmogaus ir gyvulių sveikatos rizikos veiksnių (Bakutis, 2004). Vienintelis patikimas būdas išvengti pašarinių žaliavų užterštumo mikotoksinais – užkirsti kelią mikromicetams daugintis. Šiam tikslui taikomi skirtingi pašarų užsikrėtimo mikromicetais ir užterštumo mikotoksinais kiekio bei toksiškumo nustatymo metodai. Turi būti taikomos ir kompleksinės profilaktikos priemonės: tinkamos žaliavų sandėliavimo sąlygos, fizikiniai bei cheminiai grūdų apdorojimo būdai (konservantai, detoksikuojamieji preparatai) (Bakutis, 2004). Darbo tikslas: Atlikti, 2005 - 2009 metų laikotarpyje, tirtų LSMU VA Gyvūnų gerovės tyrimų laboratorijoje, atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų užterštumą mikotoksinais, analizę. Darbo uždaviniai: 1. Atlikti literatūros šaltinių analizę. 2. Įvertinti atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų užterštumą mikotoksinais (deoksinivalenoliu, zearalenonu, aflatoksinu B 1) 2005 – 2009 metų laikotarpiu. 3. Palyginti skirtingų atvežtinių žaliavų (kukurūzų, sojos rupinių, rapsų išspaudų saulėgrąžų išspaudų,) užterštumą mikotoksinais. 4. Įvertinti atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų pavojingumą gyvūnams. Aim of study: The {{purpose was}} to analyse <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> samples <b>of</b> {{mycotoxin}} concentration, which were researched {{in the period of}} 2005 - 2009 in the Animal Welfare Research Laboratory. Main tasks: 1. To analyze literature sources. 2. To assess mycotoxin (deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, aflatoxin B 1) contamination <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> in the period of 2005 – 2009. 3. To compare mycotoxin contamination <b>of</b> different <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> (maize, soybean meal, rapeseed cake, sunflower cake). 4. To assess the risk for animals <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> Material and methods: - it was selected 72 samples <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> i. e. 36 maize samples, 21 soybean meal sample, 6 rapeseed cake samples and 9 sunflower cake samples. - it was analyzed each mycotoxin concentration separately (DON,ZON, AFB 1) in maize, soybean meal, rapeseed cake and sunflower cake. Aflatoxin B 1, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol concentration were assessed with thin-layer chromatography method. Diffusion <b>of</b> mycotoxins in <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> during 2005 – 2009 was determined using statistical analysis methods. Results and discussion: 1. During the investigation period (2005 - 2009) aflatoxin B 1 concentration varied from 0, 0007 to 0, 005 mg/kg in maize, from 0, 001 to 0, 02 mg/kg in soybean meal, from 0, 001 to 0, 0033 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 0013 to 0, 007 mg/kg in sunflower cake. During this period zearalenone concentration varied from 0, 1 to 1, 33 mg/kg in maize, from 0, 17 to 2 mg/kg in soybean meal, from 0, 08 to 1, 2 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 05 to 1, 3 mg/kg in sunflower cake. The minimum concentration of deoxynivalenol was 0, 06 mg/kg, the maximum concentration – 3, 5 mg/kg in maize, minimum – 0, 15 mg/kg and maximum – 1, 2 mg/kg in soybean meal, minimum – 0, 125 mg/kg and maximum – 0, 8 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 3 mg/kg to 0, 9 mg/kg varied in sunflower cake. 2. During the investigation period mycotoxin concentrations were compared in the <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> and assessed, that AFB 1 concentration was decreased 46 per cent in maize, and in sunflower cake – 78 per cent. ZON concentration was decreased 36 per cent in maize, 88 per cent – in soybean meal, 14 per cent increased in sunflower cake. DON was decreased 56 per cent in maize, 54 per cent was increased in soybean meal and 51 per cent in sunflower cake. 3. The most contaminated <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> were maize and sunflower cake. AFB 1 was assessed 0, 02 mg/kg, ZON – 0, 65 mg/kg and DON 1, 15 mg/kg in maize. AFB 1 was 0, 0095 mg/kg, ZON – 1, 1 mg/kg and DON – 0, 5125 mg/kg in sunflower cake. The least contaminated was soybean meal – AFB 1 concentration was 0, 001 mg/kg, ZON – 0, 09 mg/kg and DON – 0, 24 mg/kg. AFB 1 concentration was 95 per cent higher than was in soybean meal, ZON was higher 84 per cent and DON concentration was higher 79 per cent. 4. Assessed mycotoxin concentrations in <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> don‘t exceed recommended rates, but if these materials will be added to the mixed feed, ZON and DON quantities can be dangerous for the animals health. If we want to protect <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> from mycotoxin contamination, we have to harvest on time and properly, apply the correct rotation, store in the suitable conditions, use antifungal agents. If the mycotoxins are already in the feed, then it may help mycotoxin binders...|$|R

Denna rapport syftar till att öka medvetenheten hos ICA om verksamhetens miljöpåverkan genom att analysera vattenfotavtrycket – vanligen kallat Water Footprint – för ett livsmedel. Vattenfotavtryck är ett verktyg inom miljösystemanalys som används för att kartlägga sambandet mellan produktion och konsumtion av produkter och vattenanvändning. Studien visade att vattenfotavtrycken är ungefär 14 500 liter/kg och 16 500 liter/kg för svensk respektive irländsk nötfärs. Ursprunget till fodret samt vilka sorters vatten som används visade sig vara avgörande för vilka konsekvenser vattenfotavtryck ger upphov till. Utvärdering av de negativa konsekvenserna är en genomgående svårighet med vattenfotavtryck, en lösning kan vara att relatera vattenfotavtryck till den lokala vattenstressen samt hushållens vattenkonsumtion. ICA {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{companies}} in retail trade in northern Europe and is established in Sweden, Norway and the Baltic countries. ICA is interested in developing the business environmental management by taking into account water-related issues. The purpose of this study is to illuminate the link between company activities of ICA and water use, by applying the tool of water footprint. It is an environmental systems analysis tool that was developed by Professor Arjen Y. Hoekstra at University of Twente and the Water Footprint Network and it is mainly used to calculate the consumption of fresh water that is linked to the consumption of a product. The water footprint concept covers three different types of water; blue, green and grey water, where the green water is rain water, blue water is fresh water and groundwater, and grey water is a theoretical volume of water consumed as a consequence of emission of pollutants. In this study, the blue and green water footprint of Swedish and Irish minced beef has been analyzed. The results showed that the total water footprint of Swedish minced beef is about 14 500 liters per kg, of which about 14 200 liters is green water and 200 liters is blue water. About 98 % of the water footprint is domestic since the majority <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> origins from Sweden. The total water footprint of Irish minced beef is about 16 500 liters per kg, of which about 15 000 liters is green water and 1 500 liters is blue water. Approximately 21 % of the total water footprint is external due to <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> water intense <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> Assessing the environmental and social impacts of the water footprint showed to be difficult because they are multidimensional. As an example, the consequences of a relatively small water footprint in countries with extremely scarce water may be severe, while a much larger water footprint in countries such as Sweden has a relatively small impact. In order to identify water footprints with the potential of causing major environmental and social impacts, data on regional water stress and water availability was used. For example, total household water consumption in water scarce Pakistan is about 58 liters per person and day, roughly 10 times lower compared to the U. S. This water is almost equivalent to the water footprint (52 liters per kg) in Pakistan caused by the production of Irish minced beef. The analysis section also showed that there are substantial difficulties in comparing water footprints of foods in order to identify products with minimum environmental impact. This has two main reasons: First, green water, i. e. evapotranspiration, is a part of the natural cycle of water which varies regionally. Secondly, foods are not always comparable, because different foods provide different nutrients. One solution would be to compare foods on the basis of a common denominator, e. g. animal based foods could be compared on the basis of protein content...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{the general}} {{rules for the}} {{marketing}} <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> are spread over several Directives according to the type <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> concerned. There is Directive 79 / 373 /EEC on compound feed covering also pet food where the rules for the circulation <b>of</b> this <b>feed</b> in the EU are laid down (e. g. labelling requirements). Directive 93 / 74 /EEC lays down the principles for feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes (dietetic feeds). Directive 96 / 25 /EC contains the general rules for the circulation and use <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> Directive 82 / 471 /EEC lays down the marketing conditions for certain products, belonging to the category <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> used in animal nutrition (bio-proteins). Thus, the current rules are found in old Directives and some 50 amending or implementing acts. This has made existing legislation extremely scattered with many cross references and difficult to understand and implement in a uniform way. Feed legislation sets the rules for the different categories as <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> dietetic <b>feed,</b> feed additives and medicated feed, differentiating between food producing animals and pets. Though horses might {{not be used for}} food production in all cases, feed legislation has to consider them as food producing animals because they enter to a significant extent the food chain. The main improvement of the proposal will be achieved by setting modern rules under one Regulation resulting in more legal clarity and a more homogenous market. In particular, the grey zone between <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>feed</b> additives and veterinary drugs would be cleared. Further, the use of claims will be better regulated and thus enforceable for the control authorities. On feed intended for particular nutritional purposes, the current system will be more or less retained. The proposal introduces a broad definition of labelling. Consequently, the required truthfulness of the information attributed to a product is not only limited to the sack label but as well to all other material supporting the sale. Additionally, it is highlighted that sales via the internet are covered by the marketing rules. Furthermore, proposal increases the accuracy of the indication <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> incorporated in compound feed for food producing animals by requiring the indication in descending order of weight. The exact percentage has to be indicated for raw <b>materials</b> in compound <b>feed</b> that are highlighted on the label. The proposal follows the philosophy that information needed by the feed user for an informed choice and safety relevant information must be provided unequivocally and in a harmonised way throughout the Community. Further labelling particulars can be given on a voluntary basis to fulfil special interest of customers, but then these have to be accurate and understandable for each target group, and the industry could label all details voluntarily. Stakeholders will be encouraged to develop EU codes for good labelling practice in the context of voluntary labelling provisions. The proposal is now in negotiation in the Council of the EU and the European Parliament for adoption. vo...|$|R

As with the number of SWUs, the amount <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> required will also depend on the level of enrichment desired and upon the amount of 235U that ends up in the depleted uranium. However, unlike the number of SWUs required during enrichment, which increases with decreasing levels of 235U in the depleted stream, the amount of NU needed will decrease with decreasing levels of 235U that end up in the DU.|$|R
50|$|The basic aim of {{agricultural}} {{policy in the}} mid-1980s, with regard to both crop and livestock production, was self- sufficiency. Record harvests in 1984 and 1985 made it possible virtually to halt grain imports, which had amounted to about 500,000 tons per year. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the government was able to reduce <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> grains to one-third {{the level of the}} previous five-year plan without causing a reduction in per capita meat consumption, an achievement suggesting that the efficiency of animal husbandry had improved. Performance in the agricultural sector as a whole remained uneven in the 1980s, however. Although some outstanding farms were obtaining excellent grain yields, the uneven quality of farm management contributed to large discrepancies in performance between farms.|$|R
40|$|Many {{functions}} such as separation <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>material,</b> improvement <b>of</b> mouth-feeling {{and nutrient}} <b>of</b> <b>feed,</b> enhancement <b>of</b> the digestiblity and utilization,elimination of the proisonous ingredients, and increasement of the storage period are known for feed processing operation. Feed corn {{was used as the}} raw material for study the effects of process variables on the starch digestibility and physical properties in single-screw extrusion system. The process variables were particle size, die temperature, and screw speed. Experimental results showed that: (1) Particle size had strong effects on the starch digestibility, and physical properties <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> corn extrudates. The extrudate''s starch digestibility, expansion ratio, shear force, yellow value, and moisture content <b>of</b> 10 mesh <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> were greater than 18 mesh. (2) For the extrudates of 10 mesh material, the maximum starch digestibility, expansion ratio, and specfic volume occurred at 140 die temperature. Increasing the die temperature increased the yellow value; but decreased the extrudate''s shear force. However, there were no significance differences between moisture content and die temperature. Increasing the screw speed lifted the extrudate''s shear force; but decreased the extrudate''s starch digestibility, epansion ratio, specfic volume, and yellow value. (3) For the extrudates <b>of</b> 18 mesh <b>feed</b> <b>material,</b> increasing the die temperature decreased the extrudate''s expansion ratio, shear force, specfic volume, yellow value, and moisture content. There were no significant effects between extrudate''s starch digestibility and die temperature. Increasing the screw speed raised extrudate''s starch digestibility and specfic volume; but reduced the extrudate''s expansion ratio, shear force, yellow value, and moisture content. 飼料加工之目的，在於分離原料中所需之部份、改善其適口性及營養成份 ，以提高飼料之消化率，增進飼料之利用率，進而除去飼料中有毒物質， 促使飼料安定，增加貯藏時間而不變質。本研究以單軸擠壓機加工飼料玉 米，探討改變加工參數 [...] 物料粗細度、模具溫度及螺軸轉速等因子，對 於擠壓產品之澱粉消與物理特性所造成之影響。經由本研究實驗所得之結 果如下： (1) 物料粗細度對於擠壓產品澱粉消化率與物理特性影響非常 顯著。 且粗物料之擠壓產品所測得之澱粉消化率、 膨發率、剪切力、黃 度值及含水率均較細物料之擠壓產品為高。 (2) 於粗物料擠壓產品方面 ，模具溫度於 140 ℃時，具最佳之澱粉消化率、膨發率及最大之比容積 。 當溫度上升時產品之黃度值隨之上升，而剪切力隨之下降。 對產品含 水率則無顯著影響。當螺軸轉速增加工時，產品剪切力隨之增加，而澱粉 消化率、膨發率、比容積及黃度值則隨之下降。 對於產品之含水率亦無 顯著影響。 (3) 於細物料擠壓產品方面， 當模且溫度上升時，產品之膨 發率、剪切力、比容積、黃度值及含水率等物理特性均隨之下降， 對於 澱粉消化率則無顯著影響。 螺軸轉速增加時，澱粉消化率及比容積隨之 增加，而膨發率、剪切力、黃度值及含水率等，則隨之減少...|$|R

The <b>feeding</b> rate <b>of</b> three kinds <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>materials</b> was controlled to maintain the suitable residual concentration. The fed-batch fermentation {{results indicated that the}} optimal concentrations of fructose, L-valine and (NH 4) 2 HPO 4 were about 20 g/L, 0. 5 g/L and 0. 6 g/L for cyclosporin A production, respectively. The cultivation of Beauveria nivea could produce cyclosporin A up to 6. 2 g/L for 240 hrs through a continuous feeding-rate-controlled-batch process under the optimal feeding conditions...|$|R
40|$|Regrinding is an {{essential}} step in many mineral processing flowsheets as a final preparatory step for mineral separation. It is normally carried out in open-circuit ball mills or rod mills. Wide fluctuations occurring in the hardness and size distribution <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> to regrinding mills result in a nonuniform product fineness and processing inefficiency. Using a previously developed regrinding model, this paper presents the dynamic analysis and design considerations of a control system for open-circuit grinding, using the traditional P-, PI-, and PID-control algorithms. This study shows the utility of simple analysis techniques in designing a mineral process control system with special attention given {{to the effect of}} sampling and analysis time on control system performance...|$|R

50|$|Diagnosis {{is often}} made based on history, {{clinical}} signs, {{and response to}} treatment, but the best diagnostic tool involves endoscopic visualization of the stomach in a process called gastroscopy. The horse is fasted for at least 6 hours prior to the procedure to help reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> in the stomach. They are then sedated, and an endoscope is passed {{through one of the}} nostrils, into the esophagus, and down to the stomach. The endoscope must be at least 2 meters to visualize the non-glandular region of the stomach, and 2.5-3 meters to visualize the glandular region. This is a simple and minimally invasive procedure that allows for definitive diagnosis and can be used to track healing of lesions once treatment has begun.|$|R
