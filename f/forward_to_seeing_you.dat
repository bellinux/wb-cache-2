We are grateful for the opportunity to serve and look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> what <b>You</b> will do among us today. All these things we ask in the Name of Your Son, Jesus Christ.

And do believe that {{although}} grief had so changed me from myself and warped me from my old instincts, as to prevent my looking <b>forwards</b> with pleasure <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> again, yet that full amends are made in the looking back with a pleasure more true because more tender than any old retrospections.

They have pushed me to excel and never accept less than I deserve and work towards. They are also the source of my interests, and have been supporting my intellectual and physical strengths since childhood (all those mini-science projects have not gone wasted; we can now laugh at how big of a mess I always made). To my sister Grace and my brother-in-law Jun for always being there when graduate student life became lonely. Also to my extended family members for being proud of me and believing in me. Special mention to my grandfather, the late Thomas McLaren, whose drive and determination inspires me to this day. Special thanks to my life-long friends and to {{all the members of}} the Cooke lab. Each and every one of you has been a role model to me and I look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> what <b>you</b> all accomplish in the future.

I attended the annual AFS meeting in Hartford at the end of August and have many news items from the Board of Governors meeting that preceded the meeting.

The most important news was the acceptance of Paul Brouha’s resignation by the Board of Governors. Bob Kendall the director of publications will serve as the interim director and a national search scheduled for Paul’s replacement. AFS has been productive during the 12 years Paul Brouha was involved at the Society Office, see the most recent Fisheries for a recap by Paul. One of the important activities that Paul was involved in was the Fishable Waters Act, if enacted could affect the way we do business in years to come (the Act is highlighted later in the newsletter for more information) ...|$|R

40|$|NDS {{was created}} in 1964 {{following}} advice to the DG from the International Nuclear Data Scientific Working Group (INDSWG). Initially {{it was called the}} Nuclear Data Unit with its main objectives to collect, compile and review nuclear data particularly those relevant for the worldwide fission reactor programs. INDSWG met four times with additional recommendations that NDU should organise international meetings, encourage discussion between Nuclear Data producers in various countries and act as a Data Centre. INDSWG changed its name to INDC and has continued to review NDS’ work and offer advice and recommendations. NDU became the Nuclear Data Section in 1970 and has continued with its mission to provide accurate fundamental data to Member States and to act as a Coordination Cen-tre for Networks and as a stimulus for data work around the world. Thus in 2014 we are able to celebarate the 50 th anniversay of NDS and we will do this by a special session {{at the start of the}} 30 th INDC meeting on 2 nd June. We will be hearing more of the devel-opement and highlights of the section from former Section Heads and I would like to invite any former staff members and people connected to the NDS to attend, for details see page 2. To remind us of days gone past the photograph above shows staff members in 1969; many other photographs and memorabilia will be available to view at the meeting.

The theme for this year is Integrated Health Services Supporting Patient Care Pathways and the conference will take place at Croke Park on Wednesday 19 November 2008. In order to reach as large an audience as possible, we are making arrangements to have the conference streamed over the internet. This also ensures that nurses and midwives can view the conference on our website at their own convenience. We are delighted that once again Mary Harney, TD, the Minister for Health and Children, will open our conference with a keynote address. A registration form is included at the back of this Review. I look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> many of <b>you</b> again! Since our last NCNM Review was distributed, the much-awaited Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance has been published and is entitled Building a Culture of Patient Safety. In this edition, we provide a summary of some of the key points that are addressed in the report. This is an important contribution to the national debate on quality and safety within our health services. It contains much that is of direct relevance to nursing and midwifery. One of the key conclusions of the report is that professionals have a responsibility to keep themselves up to date through a process of continuing professional development.

He's writing a letter to the Times answering something they said in a leader, and also a private note calling attention to their delay in printing his previous communication, and he wants to be delicately ironical without being in any way offensive. He wants to hint without actually threatening that very probably he will go over to the Spectator altogether if they do not become more attentive. The Times used to print his letters punctually, but latterly these automobile people seem to have got hold of it....
