25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of the}} cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.|$|E
500|$|Hilson {{later told}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV News {{that she was}} indeed a little bit {{surprised}} by the reaction she was getting concerning [...] "The Way You Love Me". She clarified that the song was not just sexual: [...] "In that record I'm talking about one guy, I'm talking about one night {{and this is what}} I want on this one night, and I'm not afraid to say it. Not just sexual, I <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about." [...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, because she knew some women were [...] "empowered" [...] by its message. She added that listeners have to be fearless and stand for what they believe in and concluded by saying that [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] is not meant for children.|$|E

The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E

500|$|The {{transports}} {{always took}} off in daylight; weather reports were not available before dawn, and the fighter escort could not operate in darkness. Weather was a constant hazard over the Owen Stanley Range, and clouds could build up faster than an aircraft could climb. Poor flying weather, either over Port Moresby or over the target, could ground the transports {{for a week or}} more at a time. Weather and rough airstrips increased the amount of maintenance required to keep the planes flying. So too did the climate. The high humidity encouraged the growth of fungus which shorted out electrical components; metal surfaces were subject to corrosion; and lubrication oils evaporated in the high temperatures. Critical spare parts were often out of stock, and their delivery was an important role of the intra-theatre air transport. Availability did not <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> the transports; there was also the fighter escorts, which were normally based at another field. If they could not fly, or were required for another mission, then the transports could not fly. For planning purposes, a C-39 planeload was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel, while that of the larger C-53 was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel; but loading charts were not available in 1942, and aircraft were sometimes overloaded.|$|E
500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show {{the kinds of things that}} soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite." [...] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring [...] "the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of his or her aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward what everybody else is running from." ...|$|E

Rather, 'middle power diplomacy' {{is defined by}} the issue area where a state invests its resources and knowledge. Middle Power States avoid a direct confrontation with great powers, but they see themselves as 'moral actors' and seek their own role in particular issue areas, such as human rights, environment, and arms regulations. Middle powers are the driving force in the process of transnational institutional-building." [...] (Soeya Yoshihide) ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} qualifier sometimes {{proposed for}} KDKA {{is that it}} was the first [...] "commercial" [...] station, but there is no consensus here either, as a 1945 advertisement for WWJ claimed that station was the one where [...] "commercial radio began". (WWJ and KDKA were both initially commercial-free, and did not start to accept advertising until the mid-1920s, so in this case [...] "commercial" [...] appears to <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> under the control of a commercial enterprise.) Additionally, Westinghouse's operation of KDKA's broadcasting service under a [...] "Limited Commercial" [...] license appears to have been merely a side-effect {{of the fact that it}} had previously been determined that type of authorization was required for KDKA's original role, of providing private point-to-point communication between company installations.|$|E

2500|$|Citing an Akkadian {{term that}} {{indicates}} a yellow or orange dye, Alter {{argued that the}} word , techashim in [...] is more plausibly translated as [...] "ocher-dyed skins" [...] than [...] "dolphin skins" [...] or [...] "dugong skins." [...] Alter argued that the yellow or orange coloring would be {{in keeping with the}} brilliantly dyed stuff in [...] Professor Richard Elliott Friedman of the University of Georgia wrote that no one knows what the term means, noting that it has been translated to be dolphin skins, badger skins, goatskins, and skins of a particular color. Friedman wrote that it is a cognate of an Arabic word for dolphin, but, since it does not occur in the list of animals that are forbidden or permitted for food in [...] it may not refer to a particular species of animal at all. Friedman concluded that it may <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> tanned skins or leather.|$|E

Tim Gospill, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said [...] "Being independent doesn't <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> not having the government telling you what to do. It means you can criticise the government as well. I'm not at all sure the government understands that." [...] Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Londonderry, in protest at Dyke's resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph to express their [...] "dismay" [...] over Dyke's departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the Telegraph's advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.|$|E

Of their reunion, Case said: [...] "Happiness doesn't <b>just</b> <b>mean</b> lying around in bed saying, 'I love you' everyday for the rest of their lives. Love expresses itself in other ways.
