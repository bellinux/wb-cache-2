25|$|<b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones,</b> the Arkansas co-captain, went on {{to build}} the stadium where the Cotton Bowl Classic is now played.|$|E
25|$|Following three {{straight}} 5–11 seasons, Dallas Cowboys' owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> lured Parcells {{out of retirement}} and made him the head coach in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Despite his injuries, Testaverde's {{performance}} with the Jets endeared him to head coach Bill Parcells, who retired from coaching in 1999. One year after Parcells was lured {{out of retirement}} by Dallas Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones,</b> he brought Testaverde to the Cowboys in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Maaco {{became the}} new title {{sponsor of the}} Las Vegas Bowl {{replacing}} Pioneer Corporation, and the game was rebranded as the Maaco Bowl Las Vegas. In another change, the Motor City Bowl thanks to Little Caesars now carries {{the name of the}} Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. Advocare became the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl. In a stadium shift, the Cotton Bowl Classic moves from its self-named home for 73 years at the grounds of Fair Park to <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones's</b> new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington. The St. Petersburg Bowl was initially to be played without a sponsor after being sponsored by MagicJack in 2008, but just {{a few weeks before the}} Bowl, Beef O'Brady's agreed to be the sponsor, so the game became the [...] "St. Petersburg Bowl presented by Beef O'Brady's".|$|R
50|$|After Fox {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the NFL's National Football Conference division in 1994, KPEJ has carried preseason football games from the Dallas Cowboys, along with team owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones's</b> weekly game discussion program. In 2010, KPEJ also {{acquired the}} rights to Houston Texans preseason games, which aired on tape delay if the game started while a Cowboys pre-game broadcast or pre-season game telecasts was ongoing. KPEJ lost the Dallas Cowboys preseason games to NBC affiliate KWES-TV (channel 9) in 2011, resulting in KPEJ broadcasting Texans preseason games live. In 2014 KMID acquired {{the rights to the}} Dallas Cowboys pre-season games. When conflicts exist that won't allow KMID to air the games KPEJ has been given the rights to air the Dallas Cowboys preseason games. When Dallas plays Houston in the pre-season, KMID airs the Dallas broadcast while KPEJ airs the Texans broadcast.|$|R
50|$|Jones {{also has}} {{appeared}} in several television series, including The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Law & Order, and Criminal Minds (as Karl Arnold aka The Fox). He appeared in seven episodes of the FX series Rescue Me as Peter Reilly, the gay son of Chief <b>Jerry</b> Reilly. <b>Jones's</b> work in Generation Kill was singled out for praise by reviewers Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe and Alan Sepinwall of the Star-Ledger.|$|R
25|$|Evidently, {{there are}} still {{questions}} as to his specific reasons for leaving the game. There were even reports that Parcells had been holding out for more money, and that Cowboys' owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> simply did not think Parcells' performance was worth the money he was demanding for the upcoming season.|$|E
25|$|The Mavericks {{were awarded}} the All-Star Game in an {{announcement}} by NBA commissioner David Stern, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, and Dallas Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> on October 30, 2008. This {{was the first}} All-Star Game to be played in a football stadium since 1996 when San Antonio's Alamodome hosted the event.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue {{indicated}} {{that if the}} NFL expands again, San Antonio {{would be on the}} short list of candidate cities. Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> has acknowledged his support for the city's efforts to become home to an NFL franchise even though public opinion is that he would never let go of his team's presence in the San Antonio market.|$|E
5000|$|Before 2004 season began, the Cowboys faced {{adversity}} {{and were}} forced to adjust. Coming off their first winning season in five years, the team, under Bill Parcells's direction, continued to bring in veteran talent and draft promising prospects. In the off-season, the Cowboys signed quarterback Vinny Testaverde and traded for disgruntled wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. Both Testaverde and Johnson had played for Parcells when he had coached the New York Jets, and both were eager to reunite with Parcells. Johnson was especially happy to be in Dallas, {{as he had been}} deactivated for the final six games of the previous season while with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for [...] "conduct detrimental to the team". In return for Johnson, the Buccaneers received Joey Galloway. The draft saw the arrival of running back Julius Jones, cornerbacks Jacques Reeves and Nate Jones, and college quarterback turned wide receiver Patrick Crayton. In owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones's</b> continuing quest to acquire quarterback talent, the Cowboys traded for the rights to Drew Henson, another baseball player attempting to return to football. Henson starred at Michigan, keeping future NFL quarterback Tom Brady from claiming the starting job outright. His struggles in the New York Yankees farm system led him to reconsider his career and opt for a return to football, similar to Chad Hutchinson, whom the team had acquired two years prior. Hutchinson was later released.|$|R
5000|$|The Cowboys opened 2010 in Washington {{against a}} revitalized Redskins team that now {{featured}} Donovan McNabb (traded from the Eagles in April) and former Broncos coach Mike Shanahan. Although neither team performed well, Dallas lost unexpectedly when {{on the last}} {{play of the game}} Tony Romo threw a pass into the end zone that was nullified by a holding penalty. The Redskins thus won 13-10. In Week 2, Dallas fell to the Bears 27-20 in their second straight home opener loss. This was also the team's first 0-2 start since 2001. Desperate to win, they headed to Houston for the third [...] "Battle of Texas" [...] with the Texans (the first and second were in 2002 and 2006) and beat them 27-13. After coming back from their bye week, the Cowboys suffered another home embarrassment, this time against Tennessee. Dallas's fortunes continued to slide in Week 6 as they lost to Minnesota 24-21. Things steadily got worse the next week as Tony Romo was knocked out with a fractured collarbone while playing the Giants on MNF. Filling in for him was 38-year-old QB Jon Kitna, who hadn't started in two years. Although rusty, he managed two touchdown passes and the Cowboys scored 35 points. But their division rival edged them out 41-35 to win in Cowboys Stadium for the second straight year. By Week 8, the Cowboys found themselves at 1-6 after losing at home to Jacksonville after four Jon Kitna interceptions. After a disastrous 45-7 loss in Green Bay, Wade Phillips was fired (thus breaking <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones's</b> policy of not changing head coaches during the season) and replaced by offensive coordinator Jason Garrett. Now largely eliminated from playoff contention, the Cowboys headed to the Meadowlands for a rematch with New York. This time things would be different as Jon Kitna passed for 327 yards and three touchdowns. An all-around better performance by the team allowed them to win 33-20. After beating Detroit at home, the Cowboys lost a close Thanksgiving game to New Orleans. They next defeated the Colts in Indianapolis 38-35 on an OT field goal to retain faint playoff hopes. However, a home loss to Philadelphia mathematically eliminated them from playoff contention. Week 15 saw them beat the hapless Redskins 33-30. The Cowboys then lost a meaningless game in Arizona and followed that with a meaningless win over the Eagles to end their season at 6-10.|$|R
25|$|AT Stadium, {{formerly}} Cowboys Stadium, is a domed stadium with a retractable roof in Arlington, Texas. After failed {{negotiations to}} return the Cowboys to the Cotton Bowl, <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> along {{with the city of}} Arlington, Texas funded the stadium at a cost of $1.15 billion. It was completed on May 29, 2009 and seats 80,000, but is expandable to seat up to 100,000. AT Stadium is the largest domed stadium in the world.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{his adult}} life, Senator Calvin Ruck lobbied to get the Canadian {{government}} to award a medal posthumously to <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones.</b> Senator Ruck argued that the racist climate of the time precluded Jones or other black soldiers from getting their due recognition, and he felt that it would be appropriate for the government to award the medal to Jones on behalf of all black veterans. Senator Ruck died in 2004, without achieving success.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the Super Bowl hype {{was more}} focused onto Cowboys owner/general manager <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> and head coach Jimmy Johnson. Although the two rebuilt {{the team with}} young talent that {{eventually}} won the previous year's Super Bowl, both men had huge egos that conflicted with each other. Both had different ideas on the future personnel plans for the Cowboys, and both wanted equal credit for the team's recent success (eventually, Johnson would leave the team after the season).|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday, November 19, 2008, Dallas Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> {{said the}} {{suspended}} cornerback would be reinstated by commissioner Roger Goodell, {{but he would}} miss two more games — Sunday, November 23, 2008 and the following game on Thanksgiving, November 27, 2008. He would be back December 7, 2008 at Pittsburgh. This decision meant {{it would be a}} six-game suspension. By the time he would return, he would have been suspended from 22 of a possible 28 games.|$|E
25|$|Not all of {{the fans}} {{accepted}} the NFL's settlement offer, so the case went to trial. The final outcome of the lawsuit was a finding for the plaintiffs against the NFL {{in the matter of}} breach of contract, and not liable for fraudulent inducement. The Cowboys and <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> were dismissed as parties to the lawsuit since the plaintiffs' contracts were solely with the NFL. The plaintiffs were awarded between $5,600 and $22,000 depending on the value of their tickets.|$|E
25|$|Celebrity Rapper and New York City native Jay Z {{attended}} {{the game at}} MetLife Stadium and was seen having a brief conversation with <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> on the field prior to kickoff. This was some what of an event due to Jay Z's agency, Roc Nation, signing on as Dez Bryant’s representation earlier in the month. The pair spoke briefly before the game, which led to questions about whether they were discussing Bryant’s contract negotiations. Jones later claimed that the brief conversation {{had nothing to do}} with contract negotiations.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{broadcast}} in the United States by NBC, with play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg and color commentator Bob Trumpy. Jim Lampley hosted all the events {{with the help}} of analysts Mike Ditka and Joe Gibbs and sideline reporters O. J. Simpson (on Buffalo's sideline) and Will McDonough (on Dallas' sideline). While Lampley was busy covering the trophy presentation, Bob Costas (who also interviewed Dallas head coach Jimmy Johnson and Dallas owner/general manager <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> together prior to the game) covered for Lampley at the host and analysts' desk (and signed off the broadcast for NBC).|$|E
25|$|AT Stadium, {{previously}} named Cowboys Stadium, is a domed stadium with a retractable roof in Arlington, Texas. After failed {{negotiations to}} build a new stadium {{on the site of the}} Cotton Bowl, <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> along with the city of Arlington, Texas a suburb of Fort Worth, funded the stadium at a cost of $1.3billion. The stadium is located in Tarrant County, the first time the Cowboys will call a stadium home outside of Dallas County. It was completed on May 29, 2009 and seats 80,000, but is expandable to seat up to 100,000. AT Stadium is the largest domed stadium in the world.|$|E

Alumni include Dallas Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones.</b> Other Arkansas business alumni include executives of major corporations like S. Robson Walton of Wal-Mart, Glynn Raymer of Raytheon, Rod D. Martin of PayPal, Scott T. Ford of Alltel, and Ed Wilson of Fox Broadcasting Company & Tribune Broadcasting. Other Arkansas alumni have also held Chancellor and President positions at numerous universities including David Wiley Mullins {{who served as the}} Chancellor of North Carolina State University, Dr. David Rankin Southern Arkansas University, and Ray Thornton who served as President of Arkansas State University.|$|E
25|$|All {{assets of}} the Arena Football League were put up for auction. On November 11, 2009, the new league {{announced}} its intention to purchase the entire {{assets of the}} former AFL; the assets included the team names and logos of {{all but one of}} the former AFL and af2 teams. The lone exception was that of the Dallas Desperados; Desperados owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> had purposely designed the Desperados' properties around those of the Dallas Cowboys, making the two inseparable. The auction occurred on November 25, 2009. The assets were awarded to Arena Football 1 on December 7, 2009, with a winning bid of $6.1 million.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{began the}} 1999 season {{with his second}} Daytona 500 win. He {{went on to win}} races at Atlanta, Fontana, Sears Point and Watkins Glen. Before the race at Martinsville, Evernham left Hendrick to form Evernham Motorsports, and he was {{replaced}} by team engineer Brian Whitesell. With Whitesell, Gordon won at Martinsville and Lowe's. During the year, Chip Ganassi Racing owner Chip Ganassi contacted Gordon, expressing interest in signing him, while Dallas Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> wanted to partner with him to form a team. However, Gordon signed a lifetime contract with Hendrick Motorsports starting in 2000, which allowed him to become an equity owner in his No. 24 team.|$|E
25|$|The San Antonio {{metropolitan}} area's smaller {{population has}} so far contributed to its lack of an NFL, MLB, NHL, or MLS team. City officials {{are said to be}} attempting to lure the National Football League permanently to San Antonio. Former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue stated San Antonio was successful in hosting the New Orleans Saints, and that the city would be on the short list for any future NFL expansions. The city has also hosted the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers preseason camps in the past, and the Cowboys practiced in San Antonio through 2011. Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> acknowledged his support for the city to become home to an NFL franchise.|$|E
25|$|After the King renewed Bandar's {{post on the}} National Security Council for an {{additional}} 4-year term in September 2009, Bandar {{failed to make the}} customary public demonstration of his allegiance to the King. This noticeable absence was followed by others: an avid fan of the Dallas Cowboys, Bandar did not appear in his customary seat—next to owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> in Jones's skybox—for the home opener of the new Cowboys Stadium. In October 2009, he was not present in King Abdullah's delegation for the watershed Damascus visit. Most strikingly, in December 2009, Prince Bandar was not present for the return of his father, Crown Prince Sultan, from Morocco. After that event, journalists began to report on Bandar's disappearance, noting that his last appearance in public had been with King Abdullah in Jeddah on 10 December 2008.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the start}} of 1995 season <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> lured All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders away from San Francisco. Dallas started the season 4–0 {{including}} shutting out their division rival New York Giants 35–0 at Giants Stadium to open their season. Emmitt Smith set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that season. They ended the season 12–4 and went into the playoffs as the number 1 seed. In the Divisional round they dispatched their division rival Eagles 30–11 to advance to their 4th consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in which they defeated Green Bay, 38–27. In Super Bowl XXX the Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27–17 at Sun Devil Stadium for their fifth Super Bowl championship. Switzer joined Johnson as the only coaches to win a college football national championship and a Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|After the {{departure}} of long time Cowboy favorites DE/LB DeMarcus Ware and DT Jason Hatcher to free agency, coupled with a season ending knee injury to MLB Sean Lee during Organized Team Activity in late May, the Dallas Cowboys, {{were one of the}} most heavily admonished, and second guessed NFL franchises through the entire preseason, and half-way into the 2014 regular season. Much of the criticism was in response to the Cowboys selecting Notre Dame offensive guard Zack Martin over the perceived Cowboys savior (Texas A QB Johnny Manziel) {{in the first round of}} the NFL draft. Even Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> was uncharacteristically down playing expectations for the upcoming season during spring training, emphasizing to the media and fans, that it might take a little more time for the Cowboys young players to mature into a NFL championship caliber team.|$|E
25|$|After the 1997 season, Moss {{decided to}} go pro. He {{did not have a}} good offseason. Moss's past issues were laid out for all to see, and {{questions}} of his character began to rise. Moss was expected to be the most watched contestant of the NFL Combine, but he did not show up. Rumors swirled that the reason for his absence was to avoid the drug test. Moss opted to work out at the Marshall pro day, where scouts from nearly every NFL team came to watch him work out. Moss turned in a legendary performance, running the 40 yard dash in just 4.25 seconds, despite running into the wind. He also posted a 39-inch vertical leap while catching nearly every pass thrown. Scouts for the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 8th overall pick and were greatly interested in Moss, told owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> that Moss was the greatest individual prospect they had ever seen.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys {{improved}} their defense before the 2005 {{season with the}} additions of first round draft picks DeMarcus Ware and Marcus Spears. Parcells drafted these players in hopes of jumpstarting the team's transition from the traditional 4–3 defense to a 3–4 defense, which Parcells had run {{in all of his}} previous stops. <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> also added a number of high-priced older veteran players, acquiring nose tackle Jason Ferguson and cornerback Anthony Henry via free agency, and linebacker Scott Fujita via the Kansas City Chiefs. On offense, the Cowboys felt the need to upgrade their passing game to complement their top 2004 draft pick, running back Julius Jones, and acquired quarterback Drew Bledsoe via free agency. During his tenure, Parcells made a point of signing players who had played for him in the past, including Bledsoe, Terry Glenn (with the Patriots), Testaverde, cornerback Aaron Glenn, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, and fullback Richie Anderson with the Jets. In 2005, the Cowboys went 9–7, missing the playoffs by one game.|$|E
25|$|At {{the debut}} {{pre-season}} game of Cowboys Stadium, a punt by Tennessee Titans kicker, A. J. Trapasso, hit the 2,100 in. screen above the field. The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. (Many believe Trapasso {{was trying to}} hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and {{the angle of the}} kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines — hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.|$|E
25|$|Since September 1998, KTVT {{has served}} as the {{official}} television partner of the Dallas Cowboys, holding rights to air various team-related programs during the regular season (including the Cowboys Postgame Show, Special Edition with <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> and the head coach's weekly analysis program The Jason Garrett Show, along with specials such as the Making of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders Calendar and postseason team reviews) as well as preseason games that are not televised nationally on broadcast or cable television. Through CBS' contract with the National Football League (NFL), under which it holds primary broadcast rights to the American Football Conference, Cowboys game telecasts on KTVT during the regular season are limited to interconference games against AFC teams played at AT Stadium (including those held every other year on Thanksgiving Day) and, since 2014, cross-flexed games originally scheduled to air on Fox against its fellow teams in the National Football Conference (NFC). Most other regular season games televised over-the-air locally air on KDFW, which {{has served as}} the Cowboys' primary local broadcaster since 1962 (with the exception of a one-season absence due to the transfer of NFC television rights to Fox in 1994, in the precursor to the affiliation switch), through Fox's rights to the NFC; KXAS-TV also carries certain regular season Cowboys games in which the team is a participant via NBC's rights to the Sunday Night Football package.|$|E
500|$|The battleship's wounded {{condition}} is possibly what saved her: although standard procedure was to steam at , New York could make only [...] on her one operable propeller. Due to this, historian <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> {{believes that the}} German U-boat captain misjudged the ship's speed. With no further damage, however, the battleship was able to safely arrive at drydock in Rosyth. As the water dropped in the drydock, a large dent commensurate with a submarine bow was found in her hull.|$|E
500|$|Badly {{damaged by}} the loss of a propeller, the ship sailed to Rosyth under heavy escort for repairs on 15 October. At 01:00 the next morning, a U-boat {{launched}} three torpedoes at the damaged vessel, all of which passed ahead of her. Unlike in previous cases, sufficient evidence existed to suppose that this torpedo attack was not a false alarm—a number of officers and men aboard New York clearly saw the wakes of the torpedoes in the full moonlight, and a submarine was spotted in the immediate vicinity by a patrol shortly after the attack. Ironically, the battleship's wounded condition is possibly what saved her: although standard procedure was to steam at , New York could make only [...] on her one operable propeller. Due to this, historian <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> believes that the U-boat captain misjudged the ship's speed. With no further damage, however, the battleship was able to safely arrive at a drydock in Rosyth. As she was lifted clear of the water, a large dent commensurate with a submarine bow was found in her hull.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the loss}} to the Bills, Cowboys linebacker Charles Haley was so upset he slammed his helmet through a locker room wall, {{screaming}} [...] "We'll never win with a fucking rookie running back!" [...] in reference to Smith's replacement, Derrick Lassic. [...] Team owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> apparently agreed, quickly signing Smith to a contract that made him the highest paid running back in the NFL.|$|E
2500|$|Although Cowboys owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> {{initially}} said Romo {{would remain}} the team's starter when he returned, Prescott's {{success with the}} team {{and the length of}} Romo's injury led to Jones reconsidering his decision. Amid Prescott guiding the team to an eight-game winning streak, Romo conceded his role as starting quarterback to Prescott and began serving as the Cowboys' backup {{when he returned to the}} active roster in Week 11.|$|E
2500|$|The Ring of Honor {{has been}} a source of {{controversy}} over the years. Tex Schramm was believed to be a [...] "one-man committee" [...] in choosing inductees and many former Cowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker Lee Roy Jordan because of a bitter contract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When <b>Jerry</b> <b>Jones</b> bought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor [...] "power" [...] and immediately inducted Jordan.|$|E
