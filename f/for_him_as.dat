5|$|Beauregard Parish {{in western}} Louisiana is named <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> is Camp Beauregard, a former U.S. Army base and National Guard camp near Pineville in central Louisiana. The unincorporated {{community}} of Beauregard, Alabama, is also named for him. Four camps are named after Beauregard in the Sons of Confederate Veterans.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{invested}} {{in real estate}} holdings in Florida, although he sold them in 1926 (three years before the stock market crash, fortunately <b>for</b> <b>him)</b> <b>as</b> they took too {{much of his time}} away from baseball. He enjoyed playing golf and billiards in his spare time.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{officers}} during the great age of discovery there are several {{areas of the world}} named in the earl's honour. Cape Jervis and Gulf St Vincent, South Australia, and Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia were named <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> was the town of Vincentia and Jervis Bay National Park. The County of St Vincent, New South Wales was also named in his honour. Jervis Inlet, in British Columbia, Canada, was also named for him.|$|E

5|$|Colchester made a £200,000 {{offer for}} Jones in June 2007, which was rejected, {{but they made}} another bid the {{following}} day, which was also turned down. QPR's West London derby rivals Fulham also bid <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> did Derby County, who offered £5.75 million for him and teammate Lee Cook. He missed {{the start of the}} 2007–08 season, in the last month of his life, due to a foot injury.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> well, under the same terms.|$|E
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} plant species are named <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> such <b>as</b> the grass, I. dalzelli.|$|R

5|$|Grover Cleveland Hall at Buffalo State College in Buffalo, New York. Cleveland Hall {{houses the}} offices of the college president, vice presidents, and other {{administrative}} functions and student services. Cleveland {{was a member of the}} first board of directors of the then Buffalo Normal School. Grover Cleveland Middle School in his birthplace, Caldwell, New Jersey, was named <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> is Grover Cleveland High School in Buffalo, New York, and the town of Cleveland, Mississippi. Mount Cleveland, a volcano in Alaska, is also named after him. In 1895 he became the first U.S. President who was filmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{record is}} {{primarily}} based on DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The recording sessions were particularly difficult <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> {{he had recently}} undergone back surgery. The record is a concept album detailing {{the end of the}} world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus—the only member of that band not involved in the project—felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the 1928 season, Berg went up to a lumber camp in New York's Adirondack Mountains three weeks before {{reporting}} to the White Sox spring training facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The hard labor did wonders <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> he reported to spring training on March 2, 1928 in excellent shape. By {{the end of the}} season, Berg had established himself as the starting catcher.|$|E

5|$|A diabetic, Keenor {{suffered}} from disabilities {{stemming from a}} hard-living lifestyle {{that may have been}} a consequence of his tough upbringing. Following his retirement from football, he found it difficult to find work due to his ill-health and it became increasingly hard to earn money. Supporters of his former club Cardiff City held a collection during one league match to raise money for Keenor and his family and the Football Association of Wales also organised a fund <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> well as donating him some money. After a long spell in hospital for treatment of his diabetes, Keenor moved his family to Lamberhurst where he and his wife ran a corner shop and also raised chickens to be sold at Christmas time. He later volunteered for the Territorial Army, serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, but was discharged in June 1939 due to continuing problems with his diabetes treatment, just months {{before the start of the}} Second World War. Two of his sons, Frederick and Alfred were both killed in action during the conflict. Keenor and his wife later visited the village of Fruges in northern France where Alfred's plane had been shot down.|$|E
5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|A {{worldwide}} backlash {{over the}} resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding {{at a safe}} house. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig {{on the meaning of}} the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.|$|E

5|$|Burt was {{generous in}} life and honored after death. His {{charitable}} giving to Saginaw during his lifetime was extensive, including funding the City Auditorium, the Burt Manual Training School, a women’s hospital, a Salvation Army and a YWCA that later became Jacobson’s. The town of Burt, Michigan is named <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> is Burt Street in Saginaw, which borders the same block as his former home. The Burt Opera House in Taymouth Township carries his name and is still in use today as a community center. Trips on the paddle steamer Wellington R. Burt were once a popular day excursion along the Saginaw River (1876–1891). Burt {{was inducted into the}} Saginaw Hall of Fame in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Cast {{initially}} {{as young}} convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following {{his success in}} Thelma & Louise (the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows); James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming Demolition Man (1993) {{when he went to}} audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from Demolition Man. They had a wig made <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> his head was shaved for his Demolition Man role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film's early scenes until his hair re-grew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins' allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.|$|E
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E

5|$|Ex-Confederates {{were usually}} a safe voting bloc for the Democrats, {{but many of}} them deserted Goebel because he had, in 1895, {{approached}} and quickly killed his main local political opponent, the grandson of Revolutionary War General and US Congressman Thomas Sandford, the esteemed banker and former Confederate colonel John Sandford, in what he declared was an act of self-defense. On the other hand, blacks had historically been a safe bloc for the Republicans, but Taylor had alienated many of them by not strongly opposing the Separate Coach Bill, which would have racially segregated railroad facilities. Goebel also risked losing support to minor party candidates. Besides John Y. Brown, the dissenting Democrats' nominee, the Populist Party nominated a candidate, drawing votes from Goebel's populist base. To unite his traditional base, Goebel convinced William Jennings Bryan, a hero to most populists and Democrats, to campaign <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> soon as Bryan finished his tour of the state, Governor Bradley reversed course and began speaking in favor of Taylor. While Bradley insisted that his motives were to defend his administration, journalist Henry Watterson believed Taylor had promised to support Bradley's senatorial bid if elected.|$|E
5|$|In a {{flashback}} set in Hong Kong, Oliver learns how to torture suspects effectively to obtain information. In the present, Oliver and Roy Harper locate {{the home of}} Digger Harkness, the boomerang-wielding murderer, where they find A.R.G.U.S. operatives looking <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> well. Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon arrive in Starling City to help Felicity Smoak investigate Sara Lance's death. Digger attempts to kill Lyla Michaels, Roy, and Oliver, but Barry arrives and stops him. Later, Lyla reveals Digger {{was part of the}} Suicide Squad. When Oliver uses extreme interrogation methods against a Russian mob member in order to locate Digger, Barry questions how emotionally stable Oliver is. Digger locates Oliver's hideout and wounds Lyla before escaping. In order to leave town, Digger plants five bombs around the city. While Oliver captures Digger, Barry uses both of their teams to defuse the bombs simultaneously. Digger is incarcerated on the island with Slade Wilson. Before Barry and his team's departure, he and Oliver decide to have a friendly duel.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} year, Fernández {{was moved to}} {{shooting}} guard in the Temple starting lineup, a change that felt strange <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{he was used to}} playing point guard. He was still in frequent playmaking positions, and led the team in assists with 3.6 per game. He increased his scoring average to 12.6 points per game, second on the team, and led the Atlantic 10 in three-point percentage (45.3%). Fernández scored in double figures in 23 games. On December 13, he netted a career best 33 points to upset local rival and third-ranked Villanova 75–65; he shot 7-for-10 from beyond the arc. This earned him Philadelphia Big Five Player of the Week honors for the week of December 7–14. As a result of his performance against Villanova and his 21 points versus Seton Hall, Fernández was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week on December 20. In the Fordham game on January 23, 2010, he took a blow to the head and was forced to leave in the second half. He missed the February 2 game against Richmond with post-concussive symptoms.|$|E
