There were hatches to allow water to return to the river channel either side of the gates, one of which is now a modern sluice. The navigation runs along an embankment for about 450 yd, which is 5 ft high, before it reaches Allbrook Lock. This was moved in 1838, when the railway line was built, and was repaired in 1944. It has a chamber built of bricks, whereas the other locks are turf-sided. A bridge carries the B3335 over the tail of the lock, having been widened since it was first built. At the head of the lock is a gauging station, where the Environment Agency measure the flow and level of the water.The navigation turns to the west, passing under the railway line, and then loops back to return to the eastern side of the railway. It runs along the northern edge of some railway sidings which form part of Eastleigh Works, to reach Withymead Lock. This was unusual, as it included a bypass channel to take excess water around the lock, whereas the other locks used vents in the gates. Just below the lock, the navigation rejoins the river channel. At Barton Bay, the Barton River leaves the navigation, following a course to the west of the channel. A horse bridge carried the towpath over the river, which used to supply water to Barton Peveril Mill. The next cut began a little further south, with Bishopstoke or Stoke Lock at the head of it. There are four bridges on Bishopstoke Road, as it crosses the Barton River, the navigation, the river channel and the tailrace of Shears Mill, Bishopstoke. The mill was a large four-storey building, which was demolished in the 1920s. Four years before demolition, two water turbines of 20 in and 36 in diameter were installed, and were retained after the demise of the mill, in the hope that they could be used to generate DC power for the village. Several community groups were looking at the possibility of restoring the water turbines to generate electricity.|$|E

40|$|Glass eels {{are known}} to reach the shores of Holland by using ocean {{currents}} and selective tidal transport (DM ¿ Downstream Movements). Most of the fish ladders that are installed at the interface of salt and fresh waters, however, are designed for fish that are attracted by freshwater currents and that actively move upstream (Upstream Migratory (UM) behaviours). From this, we questioned the efficiency of these fish ladders for glass eel immigration. We tested our hypothesis of UM versus DM behaviours by comparing the catch of glass eel in two experimental fish ladders: a siphon and an <b>eel</b> <b>trap,</b> appealing to DM and UM behaviours respectively. These traps were installed at two sluice complexes in Holland and operated at night during the glass eel season of 2005. These experiments were supplemented by direct scuba observations. The results showed that most glass eels gained access to inland waters by DM instead of UM behaviours. At low tide, none of the glass eel were observed to reach fresh waters as the water velocities in the cracks of the sluice doors were too high for upstream migration. At high tide, many glass eels were observed to reach fresh waters by DM-behaviours and small cracks in the sluice doors. These results suggested that DM-behaviours are important to glass eel migration at the interface of fresh and salt waters. Access to inland waters may be improved by providing small openings in or around sluice doors that allow for DM behaviours at nigh...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} status of Te Atiawa historical knowledge in Port Nicholson Block secondary schools. (1) It uses the metaphor of tuna (eels) inhabiting the Waitangi Stream in Central Wellington (now pumped underground) to argue that Te Atiawa histories of place need to be resurfaced in local schools, much as the Waitangi Stream has been resurfaced at Waitangi Park. A pre-interview questionnaire enables nine Te Atiawa experts and nine senior history teachers to reflect upon the cultural continuities and discontinuities they experienced when learning about history in familial and secondary school settings. A series of elite interviews also encourages the participants to discuss the dominance of Pakeha grand narrative accounts of New Zealand, local and Maori history. A survey of unit topics taught in 24 Port Nicholson Block secondary school history and social studies classes, meanwhile, provides a snap-shot of topics taught in local history and social studies classes in 2005. These survey results are {{compared with those of}} a nationwide survey conducted by the New Zealand History Teachers' Association (2005). Te Atiawa interviewees experienced higher levels of cultural discontinuity than their teacher counterparts. Though the Te Atiawa interviewees' relatives employed a holistic view of history and frequently used landscapes, flora and fauna to serve as historical texts, their teachers (like the teacher participants' relatives and teachers) were less inclined to do so. The Te Atiawa interviewees, moreover, believed their teachers held stereotypical views of Maori historical figures and events. Only one teacher shared similar concerns about the stereotyping of Maori. Some teachers, however, did value familial narratives and particularistic (e. g. local) knowledge. Consequently, these teachers, like their Te Atiawa counterparts, experienced some degree of cultural discontinuity when Eurocentric forms of universalistic knowledge were accorded greater status than the particularistic knowledge of their families and/or local communities. This research, moreover, indicates that Te Atiawa histories of place are still rendered largely invisible in Port Nicholson Block secondary schools' history and social studies classes. Skills associated with GIS mapping and visual, ecological and optimal functional literacy, also appear to be undervalued. Additionally, most of the teacher participants know little about the tribes inhabiting the area they work in and their topic preferences reflect their feelings of disconnectedness. However, the teacher participants are generally supportive of the potential development of a place-based education partnership between the participating schools and local Te Atiawa people. While the Te Atiawa interviewees want meaningful input into the design and delivery of a partnership model, the teachers feel unable to fulfil these wishes. Insufficient professional development opportunities, resource constraints, professional rivalries, student/parental prejudices and timetable constraints are all cited by the teachers as hurdles to be overcome. Consequently, the Te Atiawa interviewees remain alienated from local secondary schools, while the teacher participants feel trapped in an institutional secondary school culture that I liken, metaphorically, to a hinaki (<b>eel</b> <b>trap).</b> Given the barriers that separate the two groups of participants, this research concludes with recommendations for the consideration of all interested parties. (1) There are variations in the naming of this tribal grouping. In addition to Te Atiawa, the names Te Ati Awa and Ngati Awa have also been used to describe the same tribal grouping. I have followed the advice of the principal historian of the Wellington Tenths Trust and used the name Te Atiawa throughout this research...|$|E

It was also used to make rigging, sails and lengthy anchor warps, and roofs for housing. Frayed ends of flax leaves were fashioned into torches and lights for use at night. The dried flower stalks, which are extremely light, were bound together with flax twine to make river rafts called mokihi.|$|R
