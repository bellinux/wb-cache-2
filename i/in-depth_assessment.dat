40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of the Adaptive Torsion Wing (ATW) concept to replace conventional control surfaces and enhance the manoeuvrability of a UAV. The ATW concept is a thin-walled closed section two-spar wingbox whose torsional stiffness can be adjusted through the chord-wise position of {{the front and rear}} spar webs. The reduction in torsional stiffness allows external aerodynamic loads to induce aeroelastic twist that {{can be used as a}} function of the flight conditions to obtain a desired roll control authority. Modelling of the concept was performed using a low fidelity quasi-static aeroelastic suite developed in MATLAB. The variation of structural figures of merit are evaluated and discussed. Finally, an MDO study was performed to have <b>in-depth</b> <b>assessments</b> of the potential benefits of the ATW in replacing ailerons and providing sufficient roll control...|$|R

5000|$|In {{patients}} undergoing rehabilitation with {{a stroke}} population or other {{central nervous system}} disorders (cerebral palsy,etc.), Bobath, also known as Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT), is often the treatment of choice in North America. The Bobath concept is best viewed as a framework for interpretation and problem solving of the individual patient’s presentation, along with their potential for improvement. [...] Components of motor control that are specifically emphasized, are the integration of postural control and task performance, the control of selective movement for the production of coordinated sequences of movement and the contribution of sensory inputs to motor control and motor learning. [...] Task practice is a component of a broad approach to treatment that includes <b>in-depth</b> <b>assessment</b> of the movement strategies utilized by the patient to perform tasks, and identification of specific deficits of neurological and neuromuscular functions. [...] Many studies have been conducted comparing NDT with other treatment techniques such as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF stretching), as well as conventional treatment approaches (utilizing traditional exercises and functional activities), etc. Despite being widely used, based on the literature, NDT has failed to demonstrate any superiority over other treatment techniques available. [...] In fact, the techniques compared with NDT in these studies often produce similar results in terms of treatment effectiveness. [...] Research has demonstrated significant findings for all these treatment approaches when compared with control subjects and indicate that overall, rehabilitation is effective. [...] It is important to note, however, that the NDT philosophy of “do what works best” has led to heterogeneity in the literature in terms of what constitutes an NDT technique, thus making it difficult to directly compare to other techniques.|$|E
