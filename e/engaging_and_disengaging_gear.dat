25|$|Besides {{the hand}} grenade and golf clubs, Mills {{was also the}} {{inventor}} of the Patent Instantaneous <b>Engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>Disengaging</b> <b>Gear</b> for Ships and Boats. It was used worldwide and had a great reputation for efficiency and for life saving. Another of his inventions was a telescopic walking stick seat.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the bus bar to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> the <b>gears.</b> It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to <b>disengage</b> the <b>gears</b> instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} <b>disengage</b> that <b>gear</b> until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|R

50|$|This type of clutch has {{protruding}} circular {{edge and}} a hole {{for them that}} <b>engages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengages</b> during operation. This type is less effective since human foot or hand power on clutching reaches about 10 KN or 1,000 kg.|$|R
50|$|Lockup torque {{converters}} that <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> at certain speeds can make these speeds unstable — the transmission wastes less power above {{the speed at}} which the torque converter locks up, usually causing more power to the wheels for the same throttle input.|$|R
50|$|The Top Spin is {{a thrill}} ride {{developed}} by HUSS Park Attractions, {{and is the}} generic name {{for a series of}} rides from other manufacturers that follow the same principle. The ride consists of a passenger platform suspended between two counterweighted arms. The arms are turned by motors, while the platform generally only has brakes that are <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged</b> at various points of the ride cycle. A typical top spin program runs the main arm motors while <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> the platform brakes so that it will rotate in exciting ways. The minimum rider height requirement is 54 inches; maximum is 80 inches due to the seat and restraint design. The ride was debuted in 1990 with it proving an instant success with European fairgoers.|$|R

5000|$|The Attachment Unit Interfaces {{that were}} used with 10BASE5 [...] "thick net" [...] in the 1980s and 1990s used DA15 {{connectors}} for connectivity between the Medium Attachment Units and (Ethernet) network interface cards, albeit with a sliding latch to lock the connectors together {{instead of the usual}} hex studs with threaded holes. The sliding latch was intended to be quicker to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>and</b> to work in places where jackscrews could not be used for reasons of component shape.|$|R
50|$|Screw-lock (or screw gate): Have a {{threaded}} sleeve over the gate {{which must be}} <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged</b> manually.

50|$|Some {{time after}} {{commercial}} television appeared around 1936, the Musa connector {{came to be}} used as a standard video connector; its distinctive feature being that unlike most other types of coaxial connector, it is <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged</b> by a straight push-pull action, making it ideal for patch bays. In such professional telecommunications and video applications, the connector performed well until the end of analogue (525 or 625 line) television.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of the <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> operations of a helicopter rotor during which blades can come in intermittent contact with the droop or flap stops. The problem is formulated {{within the framework of}} finite element based flexible multibody dynamics that allows the analysis of rotorcraft systems of arbitrary topology with the potential of contact among various components of the system. Contact is assumed to be of finite duration, and the forces acting between the contacting stops are explicitly computed during the simulation. The modeling of contact consists of three parts: the evaluation of the relative distance between the stops, a unilateral contact condition which is transformed into a holonomic constraint by the addition of a slack variable, and a contact model which describes the relationship between the contact force and the local deformation of the contacting bodies. The proposed analysis procedure is validated by comparison with experimental data, and the aeroelastic analysis of shipboard <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> operations of a H- 46 rotor is presented...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} prevent the DC link voltage from rising too roughly, the brake chopper is a simple {{protection}} device that shorts the DC link through a power resistor when the DC link voltage exceeds a fixed threshold. As shown schematically in Fig.  1, an insulated gate bipolar rectifier (IGBT) chopper circuit is used to rapidly <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> the resistor. The chopper works on a hysteresis band, i.e., the turn-off voltage (1.05  pu) is set below the turn-on threshold (1.06  pu).|$|R
50|$|A manual transmission, {{also known}} as a manual gearbox, stick shift, n-speed manual (where n is its number of forward gear ratios), standard, MT, or in colloquial U.S. English, a stick (for {{vehicles}} with hand-lever shifters), is a type of transmission used in motor vehicle applications. It uses a driver-operated clutch <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged</b> by a foot pedal (automobile) or hand lever (motorcycle), for regulating torque transfer from the engine to the transmission; and a gear selector operated by hand (automobile) or by foot (motorcycle).|$|R
25|$|It {{was during}} his time at sea that Mills {{witnessed}} great loss of life caused by the unsafe <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> methods used on ship lifeboats.

Mills was awarded a Gold Medal by the Mercantile Marine Service's Association for his efforts, {{as well as an}} Exhibition Gold Medal. The Board of Trade quickly approved his design and it came into worldwide use in both naval and merchant vessels.|$|R
