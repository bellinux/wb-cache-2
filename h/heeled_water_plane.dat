50|$|A {{spar buoy}} is a tall, thin buoy that floats upright {{in the water}} and is {{characterized}} by a small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> area and a large mass. Because they tend to be stable ocean platforms, spar buoys are popular for making oceanographic measurements. Adjustment of the <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> area and the mass allows spar buoys to be tuned so they tend to not respond to wave forcing. This characteristic differentiates them from large <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> area buoys such as discus buoys that tend to be wave followers. Spar buoys are often used as stable platforms for wave measurement devices and air-sea interaction measurements. Spar buoys range in length from a few feet to the 354-foot (108 meter) RV FLIP. To avoid the difficulties inherent with shipboard launch and recovery, helicopter deployment of large spar buoys has been studied.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} ancient shorelines formed by late-Pleistocene proglacial lakes {{have been found}} in eastern upper Michigan. These shorelines delimit several <b>water</b> <b>planes,</b> the {{uppermost}} of which is correlated with the Main Lake Algonquin stage. This correlation is based on the continuity of the highest <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> with Main Algonquin shorelines in Wisconsin and Ontario, the strength of the shoreline features, its altitudinal relationship with lower <b>water</b> <b>planes,</b> and a reinterpretation of radiocarbon dates from the Sault Ste. Maria area. The isobases of this <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> have a bearing of S 75 [deg]E. At the time of the maximum extent of Lake Algonquin, ca. 10, 600 yr B. P., its northern, ice-limited border lay along the Munising moraine, the northernmost of the two main morainic systems of eastern upper Michigan. This interpretation lends support {{to the idea of a}} period of slow deglaciation from ca. 11, 000 to 10, 000 yr B. P. An ice lobe occupied the central Lake Superior basin until early Holocene time. Radiocarbon dates on wood found beneath till or outwash at several sites indicate a minor ice readvance from the central Lake Superior basin ca. 10, 000 yr B. P. If true, this would have prevented the development of the post-Duluth series of glacial lakes in the western Lake Superior basin until ca. 9900 yr B. P., well after the end of the main Lake Algonquin stage...|$|R
40|$|Recent concept ship designs {{have called}} for a vessel with the {{capability}} to lift and transport multiple medium displacement combatant boats, approximately 40 to 100 tons, at high speeds over thousands of nautical miles. One such design placed two small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> area (SWATH) side hulls significantly aft of the center hull transom to facilitate a heavy duty hoist system. This thesis determines the optimal longitudinal and lateral positioning of small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> area side hulls, and the number of and associated position of struts that would be used in a large displacement small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> area trimaran design. The analysis explores eighteen different small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> area side hull configurations to verify through a series of computational fluid dynamics calculations the total resistance and wake characteristics of the overall hull designs. A mathematical analysis of the wave making, frictional, and pressure resistance of each of the hull configurations will be developed using the Rankine Panel Method from the surface wave and flow analysis software package called SWAN 2. Static stability and geometry data is generated for the concept design using computer aided design and RHINOMARINE hydrostatic analysis software. A systematic analysis of the results is conducted {{in order to determine the}} optimal side hullseparation, longitudinal position, and number of struts for best resistance and static stability which can then be used in a systems engineering process for further study of the feasibility of the use of a small waterplane area trimaran for a concept design.

50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, windsurfers were {{classified}} as either shortboards or longboards. Longboards were usually longer than 3 meters, with a retractable daggerboard, and were optimized for lighter winds or course racing. Shortboards were less than 3 meters long and were designed for planing conditions. However, this classification by length has become obsolete, as new techniques, designs, and materials have taken the sport in new directions.Most modern windsurfers (1990s and later) are derived from the shortboard design, and are intended to be used ideally in planing mode, where the board is mostly skipping {{over the surface of}} the water, rather than cutting through and displacing the <b>water.</b> <b>Planing</b> is faster and gives more maneuverability, but requires a different technique from the displacement mode (which is also referred to as slogging or schlogging). Generally smaller boards and smaller sails are used as the wind increases.|$|R
50|$|Within this zone, 19 {{miles east}} of Meade, is Big Basin, {{approximately}} circular, about a mile in diameter and 100 feet in depth. It has no drainage out, and drainage into it frequently results in shallow ponding at various low areas over the floor. Notching the rim at the southwest is a smaller basin, also without outlet, and separated from the larger one by a low divide. A short distance to the east is still another, called Little Basin, and {{on the rim of}} this is a sharply cut sink hole, St. Jacob's Well. Here, again, the <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> of the ground water is revealed. The floor of Little Basin, close to the foot of its encircling bluff, shows a number of shallow depressions, apparently the nearly healed scars of other and earlier sink holes.

500|$|A half-hour later, Shinano {{was making}} 10 knots with a 13 degree list. At 06:00 her list had {{increased}} to 20 degrees after the starboard boiler room flooded, {{at which point}} the valves of the port trimming tanks rose above the waterline and became ineffective. The engines shut down for lack of steam around 07:00, and Abe ordered all of the propulsion compartments evacuated an hour later. He then ordered the three outboard port boiler rooms flooded in a futile attempt to reduce the carrier's list. He also ordered Hamakaze and Isokaze to take her in tow. [...] However, the two destroyers only displaced [...] between them, about one-fourteenth of Shinanos displacement and not nearly enough to overcome her deadweight. The first tow cables snapped under the strain and the second attempt was aborted for fear of injury to the crews if they snapped again. The ship lost all power around 09:00 and was now listing over 20 degrees. At 10:18, Abe gave the order to abandon ship; by this time Shinano had a list of 30 degrees. As she <b>heeled,</b> <b>water</b> flowed into the open elevator well on her flight deck, sucking many swimming sailors back into the ship as she sank. A large exhaust vent below the flight deck also sucked many other sailors into the ship as she submerged.|$|R
40|$|Planing crafts were {{specifically}} designed to achieve relatively high speeds on the <b>water.</b> When a <b>planing</b> craft is running at high speed, dynamic pressure on the bottom makes the boat rise {{on the surface of}} the water. This reduces the area of the sinking surface of the boat to increase air resistance. Air resistance means the resistance that occurs when the hull and deck house over the surface of the water come in contact with the air current. In this paper, we carried out a CFD numerical analysis to find optimal deck houses that decreased air-resistance on the <b>water</b> when <b>planing</b> crafts are running at high speed.

5|$|Founded in 1960 as Grønlandsfly, {{the airline}} started its first {{services}} with Catalina <b>water</b> <b>planes</b> {{and within the}} decade expanded to include DHC-3 Otters as well as Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, some of which remain in active service. The majority of operations were based on helicopters until the newly established Greenland Home Rule began investing in a network of short takeoff and landing airfields. These were very expensive to construct and Greenland's airport fees are still {{among the highest in}} the world; they also required a new fleet: DHC-7 turboprops uniquely suited to the harsh terrain and weather conditions in Greenland. The reliability of connections improved as the domestic airport network expanded in the 1990s: increasing use of the Dash 7s made the airline less restricted by inclement weather. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Air Greenland acquired a Boeing 757 and an Airbus A330, allowing it to open connections to Copenhagen, until then operated by SAS which also competed mid to late 2000s. In the 21st century, it competes with Air Iceland for international connections and small charter services domestically.|$|R
