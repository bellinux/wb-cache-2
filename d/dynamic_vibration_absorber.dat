50|$|In {{vibration}} analysis, a <b>dynamic</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber,</b> or vibration neutralizer, is a tuned spring-mass {{system which}} reduces or eliminates the vibration of a harmonically excited system. Rotating machines such as engines, motors, and pumps often incite vibration due to rotational imbalances. A dynamic absorber can be {{affixed to the}} rotating machine and tuned to oscillate {{in such a way}} that exactly counteracts the force from the rotating imbalance. This reduces the possibility that a resonance condition will occur, which can cause rapid catastrophic failure. Properly implemented, a dynamic absorber will neutralize the undesirable vibration, which would otherwise reduce service life or cause mechanical damage.|$|E
