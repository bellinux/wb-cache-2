40|$|The law {{of waste}} {{is an ancient}} {{doctrine}} that has recently invoked new interest among scholars. Scholars largely focus on one category of waste: ameliorative waste. In short, ameliorative waste occurs when a person who does not own the property—but has a possessory interest in it—makes a significant change to the property that increases the property’s value. Scholars discuss ameliorative waste for very different purposes: to understand early American land development, to illustrate economic principles both in theory and for pedagogical purposes, to discuss environmentalist concerns regarding land use, and even to argue for certain tax reforms. No scholar, however, has done anything even close to a comprehensive study of ameliorative waste in the United States. Instead, they all tend to discuss the most famous cases and make gross generalizations based upon them. No scholar’s theory, furthermore, has adequately accounted for why ameliorative waste cases only rarely appear <b>in</b> <b>courts</b> <b>today.</b> <b>In</b> fact, one recent scholar argues that the doctrine is still very relevant to our current jurisprudence...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis examines the {{different forms of}} procedural communication available to the Swedish courts. The choice traditionally stood between oral and written procedure. Today the procedure <b>in</b> the general <b>courts</b> {{is dominated by the}} principle of orality, while <b>in</b> the administrative <b>courts,</b> procedure chiefly takes the written form. This being said, the types of communication procedures used <b>in</b> <b>courts</b> <b>today</b> are constantly changing, the reason being, in part, the advent and advancement of new communication tools such as telephone, video and the internet. The cardinal aspiration for this {{doctoral thesis}} has been to prepare a generous substructure that will allow an assessment of how the principles that constitute the foundation for the choice of a form of procedural communication stand up against the arrival of new conditions. In attaining this goal the thesis takes stock of, structure, and evaluate the current knowledge of the regulation of the forms of procedural communication and the arguments that have been put forward regarding its design and application. The chosen method is a rhetorical-topical audit of the arguments provided by the legislative community. In addition it examines the relationship between these arguments and the activities of the courts and includes a comparative analysis of the current and historic conditions of the procedural communication forms. In the thesis nine different principle topoi (argument sources) for the analysed argumentation are identified and discussed: The Purpose of the Proceedings, Security, Speed, Cost-effectiveness, the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Decision-making, the Parties, Publicity and the Rules and Regulations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} two {{important}} issues alive <b>in</b> <b>court</b> security <b>today.</b> The first {{issue is the}} trend towards security and risk management and the heightened responsibility upon courts to protect those who work or visit there. This trend comes {{in response to a}} number of incidents where people have been killed or injured at the hands of offenders <b>in</b> and around <b>court</b> precincts. The second issue is the shift to courts administrators contracting with private security personnel. Over the last quarter century there has been a widespread shifting of security functions from public to private hands. Today, private sector employees are well recognised in Australia as important players in prisoner transport and court security. What might this contracting 'in' of security services mean for the risk management of courts?...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{questions}} {{in the philosophy of}} law deals with the very nature of legal reasoning. Does this reasoning belong to logic or to rhetoric? This debate, increasingly centered on rhetoric, is not merely a question of language use; it covers and indicates a more basic choice between formal legalism - focusing on rational deduction from the law - and pragmatic judiciarism - focusing on reasonable debate <b>in</b> the <b>court.</b> <b>Today,</b> it is necessary to circumscribe the respective fields of logic and rhetoric in the language of law, while showing how they are sometimes complementary in the resolution of legal problems. But, even when we have acknowledged the need for a rhetoric accompanied by logic, we have to define that rhetoric cautiously. I confront a narrow rhetoric, often called argumentation, with a wider one of interrogative nature. There are two conceptions of rationality at stake. Their comparison enables us to raise the question of the foundation of law, as a locus to use arguments, as well as to solve social problems. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

40|$|Native American Indians charged <b>in</b> tribal <b>court</b> {{criminal}} proceedings are {{not entitled to}} court appointed defense counsel. Under well-settled principles of tribal sovereignty, Indian tribes are not bound by Fifth Amendment due process guarantees or Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Instead, they are bound by the procedural protections established by Congress in the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968. Under the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA), Indian defendants {{have the right to}} counsel at their own expense. This Article excavates the historical background of the lack of counsel <b>in</b> the tribal <b>court</b> arena and exposes the myriad problems that it presents for Indians and tribal sovereignty. While an Indian has the right to defense counsel <b>in</b> federal criminal <b>court</b> proceedings, he does not <b>in</b> tribal <b>court.</b> This distinction makes a grave difference for access to justice for Americans Indians not only <b>in</b> tribal <b>court,</b> but also <b>in</b> state and federal courts. The Article provides in-depth analysis, background, and context necessary to understand the right to counsel under the ICRA and the U. S. Constitution. Addressing serious civil rights violations that negatively impact individual Indians and a tribe 2 ̆ 7 s right to formulate due process, this Article ultimately supports an unqualified right to defense counsel <b>in</b> tribal <b>courts.</b> Defense counsel is an indispensable element of the adversary system without which justice would not 2 ̆ 2 still be done. 2 ̆ 2 Tribes, however, were forced to embrace a splintered system of justice that required the adversary system but prohibited an adequate defense.
