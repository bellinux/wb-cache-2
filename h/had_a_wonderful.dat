Míchel received a lot of criticism and accepted all the blame for the team's bad performances, especially for those who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> season in the 2005–06 season, such as Rubén de la Red, Esteban Granero and Javi García. The reserves produced other quality players, including Juan Mata and Álvaro Negredo.|$|E

500|$|Critic Lorna Bradbury noted {{how many}} of the scenes are [...] "wonderful", each evoking further {{understanding}} of Brooke as a character. Joanna Briscoe also noted that the novel <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> [...] "sense of time and place" [...] because it treats many elements unique to the period in the Britain very well, including Fabianism and class politics. The Great Lover also maintains a very vivid imagery and sensory elements related to The Orchard; as Vanessa Curtis of The Scotsman says, [...] "the fragrance of honey, apples and flowers suffuse the novel".|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, Tom Morello {{revealed}} that Rage Against the Machine shows in 2009 were a possibility, although {{plans for the}} band to record a new studio album were very unlikely.

The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, 13 years old in 1934 when Britten was aged 20. Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s. Hemmings later said, [...] "In {{all of the time}} that I spent with him he never abused that trust", and Crawford wrote [...] "I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man... he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> patience and affinity with young people. He loved music, and loved youngsters caring about music." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, it was {{announced}} that Gordon had decided to leave the show. She asked Channel Seven to release her two years early from her contract. Producers and network executives had urged her to stay with the show because her character was popular with viewers. Gordon said, [...] "I've <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> five years with Channel Seven and Home and Away—it's been an amazing experience {{to be a part of}} this incredible show. I've learnt so much." [...] Gordon filmed her final scenes at the end of February. Fellow Actor Ray Meagher who plays Martha's grandfather Alf Stewart backed her decision to leave the show, but said he was sad that his character would be left on-screen without any blood relatives.|$|E

[...] Leeds manager Don Revie was disappointed to lose, but praised his players' efforts in defeat: [...] "There's {{no doubt about}} it, the better side won, but, at least the lads played their guts out for me. He admitted it was disappointing to finish second in both the League and FA Cup: [...] "It's a bit disappointing to finish second in both Cup and League, but we have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> first season back in Division One, and I am {{very pleased with the}} team."

500|$|Bosanquet did not bat {{in a style}} {{typical of}} a cricketer from Eton, where batsmen were taught to play with style and grace. Warner {{described}} him as [...] "decidedly stiff and awkward looking... He {{does not seem to}} play the ball in a free, unconstrained way, but rather stabs at it and gives one the impression of making his stroke at the very last moment." [...] In Australia, Bosanquet was troubled by fast pitches and struggled against bowlers such as Monty Noble and Bert Hopkins who could make the ball move towards him through the air. Nevertheless, he displayed great confidence in his ability and on a pitch which assisted spinners, he could flick the ball onto the leg side very effectively. He could hit the ball hard, particularly when driving. The Times said: [...] "He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> eye and great strength of fore-arm and anything short he could hit very hard." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} intention {{had been}} to shoot Sleepy Hollow predominantly on location with a $30 million budget. Towns were scouted throughout Upstate New York along the Hudson Valley, and the filmmakers decided on Tarrytown for an October 1998 start date. The Historic Hudson Valley organization assisted in scouting locations, which included the Philipsburg Manor House and forests in the Rockefeller State Park Preserve. [...] "They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> quality to them," [...] production designer Rick Heinrichs reflected on the locations, [...] "but it wasn't quite lending itself {{to the sort of}} expressionism that we were going for, which wanted to express the feeling of foreboding." [...] Disappointed, the filmmakers scouted locations in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, and considered using Dutch colonial villages and period town recreations in the Northeastern United States. When no suitable existing location could be found, coupled with a lack of readily available studio space in the New York area needed to house the production's large number of sets, producer Scott Rudin suggested the UK.|$|E
500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Maurice Hurley thought that [...] "Heart of Glory" [...] was the closest experience he had on the show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script. He later credited fellow executive producer Rick Berman with helping to write the script for [...] "Heart of Glory", saying [...] "When I had a problem, I could go in and we could sit there, close the door, yell and scream. I'd pace, he'd make suggestions. The two of us made stories work in that room {{that had to be}} shot within a couple of days. We were under enormous time pressure, and we were working hand in glove. We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> time, on that show, especially." [...] Hurley wrote the screenplay in two days from a story created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana. Because of the delays, the Klingon language portions of the script didn't make any actual sense in translation and were simply Klingon sounding words created by Hurley.|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, {{following}} {{the hiring of}} former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps onto the series, Francis was let go from the soap opera due to budgetary cuts from Sony Pictures Television and CBS. Phelps had previously stated {{that there would be}} cast changes to the series due to monetary reasons. When asked specifically about reports indicating Francis' dismissal, she said: [...] "Genie and I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> talk when I came to Y and I think we're really quite fond of each other. She's a magnificent actress." [...] Despite confirmations that the actress' dismissal was due to budgetary reasons, Jillian Bowe of Zap2it reported a rumor that [...] "the veteran's tenure on the show wasn't well-received by the brass at CBS and Sony". Sara Bibel of Xfinity reported another rumor about her dismissal, saying it was [...] "no secret" [...] that Francis and Phelps [...] "did not get along" [...] while both worked on General Hospital, and that [...] "few are surprised that the two were not eager to work together again".|$|E
500|$|In February 1925, Barrymore staged Hamlet in London at the Haymarket Theatre, {{which the}} Manchester Guardian later said had [...] "the most memorable first night for years". The reviews were positive, and [...] "although {{none of the}} London critics found Barrymore {{superior}} to [...] Irving and [...] Forbes-Robertson, many were favorable in their comparisons". Among the audience members was the 20-year-old actor John Gielgud, who wrote in his program [...] "Barrymore is romantic in appearance and naturally gifted with grace, looks and a capacity to wear period clothes, which makes his brilliantly intellectual performance classical without being unduly severe, and he has tenderness, remoteness, and neurosis all placed with great delicacy and used with immense effectiveness and admirable judgment". Looking back in the 1970s, he said: [...] "The handsome middle-aged stars of the Edwardian theatre romanticised the part. Even John Barrymore, whose Hamlet I admired very much, cut the play outrageously so that he could, for instance, play the closet scene all out for sentiment {{with the emphasis on}} the 'Oedipus complex'– sobbing on Gertrude's bosom. Yet Barrymore... <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> edge and a demonic sense of humour." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{by spring}} 2009, Kennedy's tumor had spread and {{treatments}} for it {{were no longer}} effective, although this was not disclosed to the public. By June 2009 Kennedy had not cast a Senate vote in three months, and his health had forced him to retreat to Massachusetts, where he was undergoing another round of chemotherapy. In his absence, premature release of his health committee's expansive plan resulted in a poor public reception. Kennedy's friend Chris Dodd had taken over his role on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, but Republican senators and other observers said {{that the lack of}} Kennedy's physical presence had resulted in less consultation with them and was making successful negotiation more difficult. Democrats also missed Kennedy's ability to smooth divisions on the health proposals. Kennedy did cut a television commercial for Dodd, who was struggling early on in his 2010 re-election bid. In July, HBO began showing a documentary tribute to Kennedy's life, Teddy: In His Own Words. A health care reform bill was voted out of the committee with content Kennedy favored, but still faced a long, difficult process before having a chance at becoming law. At the end of July 2009, Kennedy was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He could not attend the ceremony to receive this medal, and attended a private service but not the public funeral when his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver died at age 88 in mid-August. By the end, Kennedy was in a wheelchair and had difficulty speaking, but consistently said that [...] "I've <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> life." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first of}} the five films was Brothers in Law, in which Terry-Thomas played the spiv Alfred Green, a {{performance}} {{which was based on}} Sid Field's characterisation in Piccadilly Hayride. Roy Boulting later recounted that one short scene with Terry-Thomas, Richard Attenborough and Ian Carmichael took 107takes because of Terry-Thomas's unfamiliarity with filming techniques; he initially struggled to hit his marks, or give his line and move on, while still acting. Filming the scene took two days and Boulting described it as [...] "an unique experience for him, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> after-effect". Following Brothers in Law he was cast as Romney Carlton-Ricketts in Blue Murder at St Trinian's by producers Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, before again appearing for the Boulting brothers in the cameo role of a local policeman in Happy Is the Bride. Terry-Thomas starred in two further films in 1957. The first was as Bertrand Welch in Lucky Jim, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Kingsley Amis. Although Amis thought that Terry-Thomas has been [...] "totally miscast as Bertrand, the posturing painter and leading shit" [...] of the book, the critic for The Manchester Guardian considered Terry-Thomas as being [...] "the nearest to a complete success" [...] in the film, in a portrayal that [...] "suggests possibilities for more serious roles". His final part of 1957 was Lord Henry Mayley in The Naked Truth; this brought him together with Peter Sellers for the first time, {{and the two of them}} appeared frequently together over the next few years in scenes in which, Graham McCann considered that each actor's performance [...] "highlight what was special about the other". During one scene Terry-Thomas was dumped in a near-freezing lake, and his health was affected for some time afterwards.|$|E
