5|$|Hershey lost 2–1 in {{overtime}} against Binghamton on October 21. The game would have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> shootout, {{but under the}} first usage of the AHL's new video replay system at Giant Center, a Senators goal that had been overturned with 6.5 seconds left {{in overtime}} was restored. The Bears were held to a single goal in a second straight game in a 3–1 loss to Connecticut Whale on October 26, {{but the next day}} saw their first home win and first shutout victory of the season. They defeated the Albany Devils 3–0 and Holtby, who had been sidelined since the previous week by an upper body injury, made 35 saves. Forward T.J. Syner was recalled from the ECHL's Reading Royals and made his Hershey debut in that game. The Bears finished the month with a 3–2 victory against the Penguins on October 28, marking their first winning streak of the season. Orlov would miss the next four games due to an upper body injury, not returning until November 11.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{police station}} when {{officers}} {{asked him to}} accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arrives to {{the office}} with a fake {{mustache}} to hide {{what he thinks is}} a pimple over his mouth. Michael soon learns that it is a cold sore, and he over-reacts, thinking he has herpes. With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling her about the herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{to higher education}} policies in the knowledge-based society makes {{important to understand the}} relationship between socio-economic family characteristics and educational choices. This paper considers the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college in Argentina as a family's economic decision. The goal is to investigate the impact of family income on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university versus the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college in Argentina. Using a probit model of the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college, the results of this paper show that the income {{of the rest of the}} family has a positive and statistically significant impact on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college. <b>A</b> multinomial logit model (where the choices are no college, community college or university) shows that the income of the rest of the family is important in order to determine the probability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college versus the other two possibilities. Family income also has a positive impact in the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university versus the other two choices. This model also shows that parents education is an important factor in explaining the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university as well as <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college.

50|$|It is {{believed}} by Theosophists {{that most people}} (those at high levels of initiation) <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific Summerland that is set up for people of each religion.

There is also a generic Summerland {{for those who were}} atheists or agnostics in their previous lives. People who belong to religions that don't believe in reincarnation are surprised to find out when they get to heaven that they will have to reincarnate again within <b>a</b> few dozen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few hundred years.

5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and bellmouth provisions east of the station, which would have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd Drive station has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). One stop west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. Kennedy International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{contrasting}} views {{regarding the}} marital status of Tulsidas. According to the Mula Gosain Charita {{and some other}} works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jyeshta month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE). Ratnavali {{was the daughter of}} Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Bharadwaja Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of Kaushambi district. They had a son named Tarak who died as a toddler. Once when Tulsidas had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came to know this, he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the Grihastha (householder's life) stage and became a Sadhu (Hindu ascetic).|$|E

5|$|In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing. The first Test was played in Barbados and Headley was selected, making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930—to the disapproval of some Barbadians who thought his place should have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local player. Batting at number three, he played aggressively in the first innings but the crowd barracked him and he was bowled for 21. However, in the second innings he scored 176, becoming the first West Indian to score a century on his Test debut and only their second centurion overall. He shared century partnerships with both Clifford Roach and Frank de Caires, but these were insufficient to force victory, and the match was drawn. Headley remained in the Test side {{for the rest of the}} series, the only home player other than Roach to appear in all four Tests. In Trinidad, during the second Test, Headley found the unfamiliar conditions difficult—Trinidad was the only Test match ground in the Caribbean which was played on a pitch made from matting instead of grass. Headley scored eight and 39 as West Indies lost the match. The home side levelled the series with their first ever Test victory in the third match of the series, played in British Guiana. In this match Headley became the first West Indian, and only the fifth cricketer of any nation, to score two separate hundreds in a Test match. His first innings of 114 was played mainly in support of Roach, who scored a double century. In the second innings, Headley scored 112 as West Indies batted with a big first innings lead, attacking defensive English bowling.|$|E
