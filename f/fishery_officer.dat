The worms are common to the Mediterranean Sea, and are rare in the British Isles, but found at a number of sites on western and southern coasts.

50|$|Modern day Tuvalu was {{the first}} island nation to be {{impacted}} by Bebe between October 19-22, while it was a British colony and known as the Ellice Islands. The system started to impact Tuvalu during October 19, with intermittent heavy rain reported in the island nation, before the weather deteriorated further during the next day, with strong winds increasing to gale force, flooding and a rough sea reported. During October 20, as the seas were rough, the ship Moana Raoi that had just arrived in Funafuti's lagoon carrying supplies from Suva, Fiji was anchored peacefully. During the next day, as the Funafuti International Airport airstrip was flooded, the fortnightly Air Pacific aircraft that was carrying supplies from Nadi, Fiji, turned back while it was located about 80 km from the airstrip. After a hurricane warning was received at the New Zealand Meteorological Service weather station, its chief tried to warn {{as many people as}} possible, including the Master of the Moana Raoi, the <b>fishery</b> <b>officer</b> of the Van Camp fishing fleet and the agent of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands development authority.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1973. AnthropologyBibliography: leaves 132 - 137. This thesis {{explores the}} ecologic and social {{functions}} {{and implications of}} marine space management as embraced in the Newfoundland Fishery Regulations. [...] The Newfoundland Fishery Regulations constitute a particularly interesting body of legislation in that those regulations which apply to the inshore cod fishery were not, in the main, enacted with a view toward husbanding the resource. Rather, they represent a response {{on the part of}} government officials to political pressure exerted by inshore fishermen for the legal codification of regulations which allocate access to resources with respect to particular technologies. [...] This need to regulate the extractive process is largely a product of the non-random distribution of fish concentrations over the fishing grounds and the varying productive potentials of the technologies used. Those technologies which can operate only under a relatively narrow range of environmental conditions (e. g. trap and handline) are afforded protection from competing technologies (gill net and trawl) by setting aside specific locations and/or areas for the exclusive use of the former. [...] Ecologically, the Newfoundland Fishery Regulations function to provide for an equitable division of resources for local fishermen. This division is in turn related to the numbers of fishermen exploiting a given area and the amount of exploitable space available. In an area such as Fermeuse where there are substantial numbers of fishermen and only limited amounts of exploitable space I found relatively stringent restrictions which limited the bulk of exploitative opportunities to those technologies which required the least amount of operating space thereby permitting the maximum density of fishing unit participation. Space consuming technologies such as trawl wherein three or four units could control an area which might be profitably exploited by twenty or thirty handline units are banned from large expanses of the community's fishing grounds. The Newfoundland Fishery Regulations then emerge as a major force in balancing the available space with the number of fishing units. [...] In addition, the Regulations function to protect local fishermen from the modernized and highly mobile fishing operations which are becoming increasingly prevalent in Newfoundland waters. [...] Sociologically, the Regulations function to minimize social conflict in an intensely competitive fishing milieu where the rewards fall to those who prove to be the shrewdest in getting their share of a scarce commodity (exploitative opportunity). Because the Regulations are codified into formal law (which is external to the community) disputes engendered on the fishing grounds tend to be less personalized. This depersonalizing effect is further reinforced by the presence of a federal <b>fishery</b> <b>officer.</b> His role is particularly important as an enforcer of regulations and as a mediator in disputes, between opposing technological interests. Because the <b>fishery</b> <b>officer</b> is not directly involved in the extractive process he is regarded as impartial and is commonly sought for adjudication in what are often highly emotional confrontations which could degenerate into a personal encounter that might seriously endanger the social fabric of the community...|$|E

40|$|Redd {{counting}} is {{an integral}} part of most Fishery Officers duties. The number and distribution of salmonid redds throughout salmonid catchments provides invaluable information on the range and extent of spawning by both salmon and sea trout. A project was initiated by the Fisheries Science and Management Team of Central Area, North West Region in England in liaison with the Flood Defence function. The main objective of this project was to assess redd count data for Central Area and attempt to quantify these data in order to produce a grading system that would highlight key salmonid spawning areas. By showing which were the main areas for salmon and sea trout spawning, better informed decisions could be made on whether or not in-stream Flood Defence works should be given the go-ahead. The main salmonid catchments in Central Area were broken into individual reaches, approximately 1 km in length. The number of redds in these individual reaches were then calculated and a density per lkm value was obtained for each reach. A grading system was devised which involved looking at the range of density per km values and dividing this by five to produce 5 classes, A - E. A sixth class (F) was used where the density per Ion value was 0. 00. This grading system was calculated at two levels of detail. Grades for salmon and sea trout were produced for each individual catchment and also on an Area-wide level. Maps were produced using a range of colours to represent the grade for each reach. These maps provide a highly useful overview of the status of salmonid spawning for each catchment over individual years and highlight the key salmon and sea trout spawning areas in each catchment. These maps and the associated summary data should now provide Flood Defence and Fisheries staff with a fairly detailed overview of the status of spawning in any location within the. main salmonid catchments in Central Area. Although these maps are very useful they should only be used as a guide. The current practice of consulting with the local <b>Fishery</b> <b>Officer</b> should be continued to ensure that expert local knowledge is taken into account...|$|E
