25|$|The story then {{follows the}} doctor's wife, her husband, and their impromptu “family” {{as they attempt}} to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who can still see (though she must hide this fact at first). The {{breakdown}} of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find each other. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> and inexplicably as it struck.|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{suddenly}} in 1794 and disappearing <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> ten months later, the prints of the enigmatic Sharaku are amongst ukiyo-e's best known. Sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors, introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized {{the differences between}} the actor and the portrayed character. [...] The expressive, contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with the serene, mask-like faces more common to artists such as Harunobu or Utamaro. [...] Published by Tsutaya, Sharaku's work found resistance, and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared, and his real identity is still unknown. [...] Utagawa Toyokuni (1769–1825) produced kabuki portraits in a style Edo townsfolk found more accessible, emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding Sharaku's realism.|$|E
50|$|The group flee <b>just</b> <b>as</b> {{everything}} <b>suddenly</b> {{starts to}} rumble and rocks cave in. The Lady {{had ordered the}} Earthmen to dig through {{the roof of the}} underworld for an invasion of the overworld. The group manages to climb high enough to break through the surface, and they realise that they have emerged in the heart of Narnia.|$|R
6000|$|They stand dose together, {{unaware that}} COOK has thrown up the [...] service shutter, {{to see why}} the {{clearing}} takes so long. Her [...] astounded head and shoulders pass into view <b>just</b> <b>as</b> FAITH <b>suddenly</b> [...] puts up her face. JOHNNY'S lips hesitate, then move towards her [...] forehead. But her face shifts, and they find themselves upon her [...] lips. Once there, the emphasis cannot help but be considerable. [...] COOK'S mouth falls open.|$|R
5000|$|On March 30, 1965, de Silva {{was badly}} injured {{by a car}} bomb {{deployed}} by the Viet Cong insurgency. About eleven that morning, as de Silva spoke on the telephone, he looked out his office window at the American Embassy. A car had its hood was raised, and a policeman was angry. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> de Silva <b>suddenly</b> recognized grey smoke from the detonating device [...] "the car exploded with 350 pounds of C-4 plastic". Flying glass fragments penetrated his face, throat, chest, and hands; he could see only [...] "a red screen". de Silva was back at his post in four weeks, but not fully recovered.|$|R
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the poem came when Boberg was walking home from church near Kronobäck, Sweden, and listening to church bells. A sudden storm got Boberg’s attention, and then <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as it had made its appearance, it subsided to a peaceful calm which Boberg observed over Mönsterås Bay. According to J. Irving Erickson: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctor and}} his wife with their new [...] "family" [...] make {{their way back to}} the doctor's house, where they {{establish}} a mutually supportive permanent home. The next day, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as his sight had been lost, the Japanese man recovers his sight. As the friends all celebrate, the doctor's wife stands out on the porch, staring up into a white overcast sky and seems to be going blind until the camera shifts downwards, revealing that she sees the cityscape.|$|E
2500|$|This scene {{takes the}} last line of the long {{quotation}} from Zhang Hua's text as its subject, showing the emperor surrounded by his wives and children, the group forming a triangular formation reminiscent of the mountain in Scene 6. [...] At first sight, the family group suggests stability and permanence, but the viewer may be expected to remember the earlier reference to the fragility and impermanence of a mountain made of dust, and realise that these familial relationships can collapse <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The opening three-hour movie pilot {{introduces}} {{viewers to}} 56-year-old Pete [...] "Skag" [...] Skagska (Malden), a hard-working steel mill foreman of Serbian-Orthodox ancestry, who {{dealt with a}} lot of fire in both his professional and personal lives. The dark lairs of welding, colossal machinery, and working-class ideals from the people he supervised was the only life Skag knew, until a series of events turned his world upside down. On the homefront, his devoted second wife Jo (Piper Laurie), 12 years his junior and the only Jewish member of the Skagska family, was at times growing distant from Pete; his two eldest sons, David (Craig Wasson) and John (Peter Gallagher) were also growing apart from him, but were feuding with him over their radically different ideals and their respective decisions in life; and most profoundly, his elderly father, Petar Sr. (George Voskovec), who also lived in the household, was suffering from the aftermath of a debilitating stroke. Skag's concern and mental anguish over these issues was about to reach its boiling point <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Skag <b>suddenly</b> suffered a stroke, as well, finding himself incapacitated, emotionally scarred, and unemployed for an untold period of time.|$|R
50|$|As Hjörvarđr {{was also}} {{killed in the}} battle, Skuld became the Queen of Denmark but did not rule well and only for a short time. Bödvar Bjarki's {{brothers}} Elk-Froði and Thorir (Þorir) Houndsfoot went to Denmark to avenge their brother. The Swedish queen Yrsa gave them a large Swedish army headed by Vöggr. They seized the wicked elf queen by surprise, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> she had <b>suddenly</b> attacked the king, tying her arms so she could not use her magic arts. With no spells to prevent it, they then slew all of her supernatural rabble. After this, a cruel vengeance was exacted on the captured Skuld in retribution for her treachery and fratricide and she was tortured to death {{through a variety of}} the most dreadful ways. The rule over the kingdom was then restored to King Hrólfr's daughters. When all this was accomplished, everyone went home.|$|R
60|$|And {{the others}} were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> glad as Peter Rabbit. Johnny Chuck was {{especially}} glad, for, you see, Farmer Brown's boy had once found Johnny's snug home, and Johnny had had to move <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> did Granny and Reddy Fox. Johnny knew just how Reddy must feel, for he had had many narrow escapes in his short life. You can read all about them in the next book, The Adventures of Johnny Chuck.|$|R
2500|$|He {{moved from}} the cathedral to the collegiate church of St. Martin, also in Tours, where he became a subdeacon in 1465. [...] Johannes Ockeghem was {{treasurer}} at that institution, and the two composers seem to {{have known each other}} well. [...] Later in 1465 Busnois moved to Poitiers, where he not only became master of the choirboys but managed to attract a flood of talented singers from the entire region; by this time his reputation as singing teacher, scholar and composer seems to have spread widely. [...] But he departed in 1466 <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as he came for no known reason, and the former master was given his old job back. [...] He then moved to Burgundy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Happier still," [...] Frank said gently. [...] "I lost {{my mother}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> only five weeks ago. I {{went out for}} a walk, leaving her as well as usual, and when I came back she was dead; so I can feel for you with all my heart." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> the {{avalanche}} stopped again. Slone saw, {{from the great}} oval hole it had left above, that it was indeed deep.

50|$|At Amanogawa High School, {{they are}} hosting a {{cultural}} festival where Gentaro Kisaragi gets his fortune told by Mr. Chuta Ohsugi before the Kamen Rider Club, consisting of Gentaro {{and his friends}} space nerd Yuki Jojima, budding scientist Kengo Utahoshi, football team captain Shun Daimonji, cheerleader Miu Kazashiro, and goth Tomoko Nozama, begins its dedication to the past Kamen Riders. However, other than social butterfly JK being a no show, a mysterious girl falls from the sky as Gentaro saves her and they {{take her to the}} hospital. The Kamen Rider Club learns her name to be Nadeshiko Misaki from Subaruboshi High School before the group is attacked by Dustards. Realizing that the Dustards are after her, Gentaro protects Nadeshiko from them before he transforms into Kamen Rider Fourze to fight <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Nadeshiko <b>suddenly</b> transforms into Kamen Rider Nadeshiko to help take out the Dustards. Soon after, the Virgo Zodiarts arrives to demand Nadeshiko Misaki from Kamen Rider Fourze as he assumes Elek States to fight the Horoscopes. Deciding to change back into Base States, Kamen Riders Fourze and Nadeshiko execute a Double Rider Rocket Punch to force the Virgo Zodiarts to fall back. After, the Kamen Rider Club learns that Gentaro is in love with Nadeshiko. Spiriting Gentaro off before she can answer Kengo's questions of where she obtained her Kamen Rider system from, Nadeshiko starts to become more vocal as she and Gentaro become closer before he takes her to the Rabbit Hatch. When Nadeshiko takes off her space helmet to kiss him, Gentaro realizes that she is not human.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Chuck Versus the Ring", Chuck {{activates}} {{the modified}} Intersect 2.0. Flashes from Intersect 2.0 can grant Chuck entirely new abilities {{in addition to}} the old ones, such <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> knowing kung fu, a foreign language or how to play the guitar. He flashes on these skills <b>just</b> <b>as</b> they become useful for solving problems, which in [...] "Chuck Versus the Ring" [...] occurred <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Sarah was put in mortal danger. Actor Zachary Levi has confirmed that the new abilities provided by the Intersect will have a glitch and won't last. Part of the third season will therefore focus on Chuck learning to use and control the new abilities of Intersect 2.0.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Travers didn't {{dream of}} protesting. For {{the moment she}} was unable to speak. This man was very fierce and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as it had been gripped (making her think incongruously in the midst of her {{agitation}} that there would be certainly a bruise there in the morning) she felt her arm released and a penitential tone come into Lingard's murmuring voice.|$|E
60|$|Robert's {{uncertainty}} about Rome, my dearest Sarianna, has {{led him into}} delay of writing. We dropped here upon summer, {{and a few days}} afterwards, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly,</b> the winter dropped upon us. Such wonderful weather, such cold, such snow--enough to strangle one. The rain has come, however, to-day, and though everything feels wretched enough, and I am languid about schemes of travelling, we talk of going next week, should nothing hinder.|$|E
60|$|He {{brought the}} whisky and soda himself across the room. Horridge resumed {{his seat and}} held out his hand almost eagerly. For a moment or two he shook as though he had an ague. Then, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as it had come upon him, the fit passed. He drained the {{contents}} of the tumbler at a gulp, set it down empty by his side, and stretched out his hand for a cigar.|$|E
60|$|Behind {{their backs}} {{was a small}} window, with a wheel {{ventilator}} {{in one of the}} panes, which would suddenly start off spinning with a jingling sound, <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> stop, and <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> start again.|$|R

60|$|He {{stood up}} suddenly, and Cruchot {{saw that he}} was a short man. And <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> Cruchot caught a glimpse of a memory picture of Ah Chow, and in that picture Ah Chow was tall. To the gendarme all Chinagos looked alike. One face was like another. But between tallness and {{shortness}} he could differentiate, and he knew that he had the wrong man beside him on the seat. He pulled up the mules abruptly, so that the pole shot ahead of them, elevating their collars.|$|E
60|$|Ma {{thinks it}} is hard that Orion's share of the land should be swept away {{just as it is}} right on the point (as it always has been) of {{becoming}} valuable. Let her rest easy on that point. This letter is his ample authority to sell my share of the land immediately and appropriate the proceeds--giving no account to me, but repaying the amount to Ma first, or in case of her death, to you or your heirs, whenever in the future he shall be able to do it. Now, I want no hesitation in this matter. I renounce my ownership from this date, for this purpose, provided it is sold <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as he can sell it.|$|E
60|$|But at last it came midnight, {{and then}} suddenly, in an instant, {{all the lights}} went out and {{everything}} was as dark as pitch--not a spark, not a glimmer anywhere. And, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly,</b> all the sound of music and dancing and merrymaking ceased, and everybody began to wail and cry until it was enough to wring one's heart to hear. Then, {{in the midst of all}} the wailing and crying, a door was flung open, and in came six tall and terrible black men, dressed all in black from top to toe, carrying each a flaming torch; and by the light of the torches King Selim saw that all--the princes, the noblemen, the dancing-girls--all lay on their faces on the floor.|$|E

60|$|Likewise {{he learned}} to romp with the master, to be tumbled down and rolled over, and be the victim of innumerable rough tricks. In return he feigned anger, bristling and {{growling}} ferociously, and clipping his teeth together in snaps that had all the seeming of deadly intention. But he never forgot himself. Those snaps were always delivered on the empty air. At the end of such a romp, when blow and cuff and snap and snarl were last and furious, they would break off suddenly and stand several feet apart, glaring at each other. And then, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly,</b> like the sun rising on a stormy sea, they would begin to laugh. This would always culminate with the master's arms going around White Fang's neck and shoulders while the latter crooned and growled his love-song.|$|E
6000|$|It seems a pity {{that you}} should waste your life for nothing. I'm afraid you'll think me a heartless flirt. I'm not that. At the time I feel all I say. But ...

There are people like that, aren't there? It goes <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> as it comes. And when it goes--well, it's gone for ever. I can't understand then what on earth I saw in {{the man who made}} my heart go pit-a-pat. I'm dreadfully sorry I caused you so much pain. You took it so much more seriously than I expected. And afterwards I didn't know what to do. You must--you must try to forgive me.|$|E
60|$|Barrington drove {{straight}} home, {{and made}} his way directly to his study. Now that he was free from his wife's influence, and looked back upon his recent interview, he realized {{for the first time the}} folly and indignity of the whole proceedings. He was angry that, a man of common sense, keen witted and farseeing in the ordinary affairs of life, should have placed himself so completely in a false, not to say a humiliating position. And then, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>suddenly,</b> he forgot all about himself, and remembered only her. With a breath of violets, and the delicate rustling of half-lifted skirts, she had come softly into the room, and stood looking at him inquiringly. Her manner seemed to indicate more a good-natured curiosity than real anxiety. She made a little grimace as he shook his head.|$|E
