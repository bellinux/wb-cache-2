25|$|Empress Mentewab was crowned co-ruler {{upon the}} {{succession}} of her son (a first for a woman in Ethiopia) in 1730, and held unprecedented power over government during his reign. Her attempt to continue in this role {{following the death of}} her son 1755 led her into conflict with Wubit (Welete Bersabe), his widow, who believed that it was <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> preside at the court of her own son Iyoas. The conflict between these two queens led to Mentewab summoning her Kwaran relatives and their forces to Gondar to support her. Wubit responded by summoning her own Oromo relatives and their considerable forces from Yejju.|$|E
2500|$|Andreyeva {{improved}} to [...] {{to win the}} Soviet title in 1949, but again was ranked second globally behind another Soviet world record breaker, this time Klavdia Tochonova. The 1950 season {{proved to be the}} career-defining one for the 35-year-old Andreyeva. First, she won her fourth and final national title in the shot put. She won her first and only major international gold medal at the 1950 European Athletics Championships, beating Tochonova to the title with a championship record mark of [...] That November it was <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> improve the world record, and her throw of [...] in Ploiești, Romania, marked {{the first time that a}} woman had thrown beyond fourteen metres. This record lasted until July 1942, when the emergence of Galina Zybina saw the record brought near seventeen metres by the end of the decade. Andreyeva helped establish a pattern of dominance by Soviet women in the shot put, with Tamara Press in the 1960s, Nadezhda Chizhova in the 1970s and Natalya Lisovskaya in the 1980s retaining the record for the Soviets.|$|E

2500|$|In 1863, {{she removed}} with her father's family to Hartford, Connecticut. A {{few months after}} going into her new home, she fell down stairs, {{and that was the}} {{beginning}} of long years of helplessness, suffering and partial blindness. All known means for her restoration had been tried, but with only partial and temporary success. In 1885, when the wave of [...] "Mental Healing" [...] swept over the U.S., Davis was one of the first who embraced its philosophy. A friend visited her and offered to treat her according to the new method of healing. In four months, the days of pain and the darkened room were over. She then obtained the best teachers and studied with them the philosophy of healing, and went out in <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> pass on the work, in which she has had unusual success. Teaching was evidently her forte, her lectures being clear, strong and logical. Davis was interested in all the advanced movements of the day, including the temperance movement and equal rights.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{the death}} of Iyasu II, his son Iyoas took the throne and rivalry {{exploded}} between {{the mother of the}} late Emperor and his widow. Empress Mentewab had been crowned co-ruler when her then underage son had succeeded her husband. [...] Now that her son was gone, she believed that she was entitled to remain as co-ruler. [...] However, Iyasu's widow, Welete Bersabe (known as Wubit) of the Oromo, strongly believed that it was <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> take the leading role at the court of her son Iyoas as her mother-in-law had done during the previous reign. [...] The young Emperor took the side of his mother against his grandmother. [...] Empress Mentewab gathered her relatives from her native Qwara and their forces flooded into Gondar to support her claims. [...] When news of the arrival of the Qwaran troops arrived, Welete Bersabe also summoned her relatives from Yejju, and throngs of soldiers arrived from that district to uphold her claims. [...] The city of Gondar was swamped by these two tense armies, and a bloodbath seemed imminent.|$|E
2500|$|Garbo's first talking {{film was}} Anna Christie (1930). MGM {{marketers}} enticed {{the public with}} the catch-phrase [...] "Garbo talks!" [...] That same year she starred [...] in Romance. For her performances in these films she received {{the first of three}} Academy Award nominations for Best Actress. (Academy rules at the time allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for their work in more than one film.) In 1932, her popularity allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract and she became increasingly selective about her roles. Her success continued in films such as Mata Hari (1931) and Grand Hotel (1932). Many critics and film historians consider her performance as the doomed courtesan Marguerite Gautier in Camille (1936) to be her finest. The role gained her a second Academy Award nomination. Garbo's career soon declined, however, and {{she was one of the}} many stars labeled [...] "Box Office Poison" [...] in 1938. Her career revived upon <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> comedy in Ninotchka (1939), which earned her a third Academy Award nomination, but after the failure of Two-Faced Woman (1941), she retired from the screen, at the age of 35, after acting in twenty-eight films.|$|E

2500|$|Schmidt {{featured}} Farmer and Greenacre in {{a chapter}} [...] "Freedom and Self-Surrender" [...] {{of a book}} Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality published by the University of California Press in 2012: [...] "The struggle {{at the heart of}} liberal spirituality … was over the firmness and fragility of religious identity in the modern world. … Was the point precisely the freedom of spiritual seeking? Or was the real point to find a well-marked path and to submit to the disciplines of a new religious authority in order to submerge the self in a larger relationship to God and community?… Farmer's eventual acceptance of the Baha'i faith or [...] "the Persian Revelation" [...] … discomfited her liberal, universalistic friends, many of whom preferred ongoing inquiry to actually finding one path to follow. For Farmer, the vision that she found in the Baha'i faith of a new age of religious unity, racial reconciliation, gender equality, and global peace was the fulfillment of Transcendentalism's reform impulses and progressivism's millennial dreams. To her skeptical associates, <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the Persian Revelation represented a betrayal of their deepest ideals as free-ranging seekers whose vision of a cosmopolitan piety dimmed at the prospect of one movement serving as a singular focus for the universal religion." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{looked up}} at me with eyes clear and transcendent as the heavens. But she was {{slightly}} roused. There was the slight motion of the eagle in <b>her</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> look at me, a faint gleam of rapt light in her eyes. It was my unaccustomed Italian.|$|R
