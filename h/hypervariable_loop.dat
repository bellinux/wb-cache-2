The secondary structure contained within this region is dominated by beta strands, which define four antiparallel beta sheets.

The two beta sheets that comprise each beta-sandwich are joined by an alpha helix on one side. These alpha helices define the binding site for this protein, with the binding site incorporating one antiparallel beta strand {{on either side of the}} helix.

This catalog includes large families of predicted 2 transmembrane (2 TM) proteins, including the Rifin, Stevor and Pfmc- 2 TM superfamilies, of which each {{possesses a}} region of extensive sequence diversity across paralogs and between isolates that is confined to a proposed surface-exposed loop on the infected erythrocyte. Here we express epitope-tagged versions of the 2 TM proteins in transgenic NF 54 parasites and present evidence that the Stevor and Pfmc- 2 TM families are exported to the erythrocyte membrane, thus supporting the hypothesis that host immune pressure drives antigenic diversity within the loop. An examination of multiple P. falciparum isolates demonstrates that the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>loop</b> within Stevor and Pfmc- 2 TM proteins possesses sequence diversity across isolate boundaries. The Pfmc- 2 TM genes are encoded within large amplified loci that share profound nucleotide identity, which in turn highlight the divergences observed within the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>loop.</b> The majority of Pexel/VTS proteins are organized together within sub-telomeric genome neighborhoods, and a mechanism must therefore exist to differentially generate sequence diversity within select genes, as well as within highly defined regions within these genes...|$|E

The TCR recognizes the NH 2 -terminal peptide of myelin basic protein (Ac 1 - 11, acetylated at NH 2 terminus) associated with the class II MHC molecule I-Au. Lysine 68 (K 68) and glutamic acid 69 (E 69) of HV 4 � have been mutated both individually and simultaneously to alanine (K 68 A, E 69 A). The responsiveness of transfectants bearing wild-type and mutated TCRs to Ac 1 - 11 –I-Au complexes has been analyzed in the presence and absence of expression of the coreceptor CD 4. The data demonstrate that {{in the absence of}} CD 4 expression, K 68 plays a central role in antigen responsiveness. In contrast, the effect of mutating E 69 to alanine is less marked. CD 4 coexpression can partially compensate for the loss of activity of the K 68 A mutant transfectants, resulting in responses that, relative to those of the wild-type transfectants, are highly sensitive to anti-CD 4 antibody blockade. The observations support models of T cell activation in which both the affinity of the TCR for cognate ligand and the involvement of coreceptors determine the outcome of the T cell–antigen-presenting cell interaction.

The penton contains all necessary components for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. After initial attachment via the head domain of the fiber protein, the penton base interacts with cellular integrins through an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif located in a hypervariable surface loop, triggering virus internalization. In order to investigate the structural and functional role of this region, we replaced the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>loop</b> of serotype 2 with the corresponding, but much shorter, loop of serotype 12 and compared it to the wild type. Here, we report the 3. 6 Å crystal structure of a human adenovirus 2 / 12 penton base chimera crystallized as a dodecamer. The structure is generally similar to human adenovirus 2 penton base, with the main differences localized to the fiber protein-binding site. Fluorescence anisotropy assays using a trimeric fiber protein mimetic called the minifiber and wild-type human adenovirus 2 and chimeric penton base demonstrate that fiber protein binding is independent of the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>loop,</b> with a Kd for fiber binding estimated in the 1 – 2 µm range.

The conformation of the remaining residues of loops longer than 10 residues can also be predicted in many cases.

40|$|Abstract Background The X-linked SRPX 2 gene encodes a Sushi Repeat-containing Protein {{of unknown}} {{function}} and is mutated in two disorders of the Rolandic/Sylvian speech areas. Since it {{is linked to}} defects in the functioning {{and the development of}} brain areas for speech production, SRPX 2 may thus have participated in the adaptive organization of such brain regions. To address this issue, we have examined the recent molecular evolution of the SRPX 2 gene. Results The complete coding region was sequenced in 24 human X chromosomes from worldwide populations and in six representative nonhuman primate species. One single, fixed amino acid change (R 75 K) has been specifically incorporated in human SRPX 2 since the human-chimpanzee split. The R 75 K substitution occurred in the first sushi domain of SRPX 2, only three amino acid residues away from a previously reported disease-causing mutation (Y 72 S). Three-dimensional structural modeling of the first sushi domain revealed that Y 72 and K 75 are both situated in the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>loop</b> that is usually implicated in protein-protein interactions. The side-chain of residue 75 is exposed, and is located within an unusual and SRPX-specific protruding extension to the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>loop.</b> The analysis of non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate (Ka/Ks) ratio in primates was performed in order to test for positive selection during recent evolution. Using the branch models, the Ka/Ks ratio for the human branch was significantly different (p = 0. 027) from that of the other branches. In contrast, the branch-site tests did not reach significance. Genetic analysis was also performed by sequencing 9, 908 kilobases (kb) of intronic SRPX 2 sequences. Despite low nucleotide diversity, neither the HKA (Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé) test nor the Tajima's D test reached significance. Conclusion The R 75 K human-specific variation occurred in an important functional loop of the first sushi domain of SRPX 2, indicating that this evolutionary mutation may have functional importance; however, positive selection for R 75 K could not be demonstrated. Nevertheless, our data contribute to the first understanding of molecular evolution of the human SPRX 2 gene. Further experiments are now required in order to evaluate the possible consequences of R 75 K on SRPX 2 interactions and functioning. </p...|$|E

The hepatocyte detargeting decreased liver damage and increased the maximum tolerated dose of Ad-GL-HB tenfold relative to that of Ad-GL. Intravenous (i. v.) injection of Ad-GL or Ad-GL-HB into tumor-bearing mice produced equally increased survival rates demonstrating that while Ad-GL-HB detargeted hepatocytes, it sustained tumor cell infection after systemic administration.

Here, we determined a detailed experimental GC-T 4 P structure by quantitative fitting of a 2. 3 A ˚ full-length pilin crystal structure into a 12. 5 A ˚ resolution native GC-T 4 P reconstruction solved by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and iterative helical real space reconstruction. Spiraling three-helix bundles form the filament core, anchor the globular heads, and provide strength and flexibility. Protruding <b>hypervariable</b> <b>loops</b> and posttranslational modifications in the globular head shield conserved functional residues in pronounced grooves, creating a surprisingly corrugated pilus surface. These results clarify T 4 P multifunctionality and assembly-disassembly while suggesting unified assembly mechanisms for T 4 P, archaeal flagella, and type II secretion system filaments...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} the isolation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody against human serum transferrin (Tf) and the cloning and sequencing of its cDNA. The antibody competes with the transferrin receptor (TR) for binding to human Tf and is therefore expected to bind at or very close to a region of interaction between Tf and its receptor. From the deduced amino acid sequence, we constructed a 3 -dimensional model of the variable domains of the antibody based on the canonical structure model for the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>loops.</b> The proposed structure of the antibody {{is a first step}} toward a more detailed characterization of the antibody-Tf complex and possibly toward {{a better understanding of the}} Tf interaction with its receptor. The model might prove useful in guiding site-directed mutagenesis studies, simplifying the experimental elucidation of the antibody structure, and in the use of automatic procedures to dock the interacting molecules as soon as structural information about the structure of the human Tf molecule will be available...|$|R
