Wayuk were affected by their defeat. Big Brother assigned the housemates a new task to create exchange gifts for the other team and do it in one hour. In Santa costume, Jessica visited the Luxury House as Wayuk's representative and gave a special good-luck doll to the housemates, leaving Biggel obviously smitten. Deniesse reluctantly went to the Industrial house to deliver High-Voltage's [...] "something naughty" [...] gifts to Wayuk—despite fearing potential retaliation from Paco over the spraying incident (on Day 33), which also made her try to remove the gift for him from the <b>delivery</b> <b>box</b> until Big Brother ordered her to leave it alone.

40|$|The large-scale, 'conventional', {{agro-industry}} food {{system has}} come under attack from supporters {{of the concept of}} Sustainable Development. Critics of 'conventional' food supply systems claim that the use of high-volume, intensified production processes and global markets, transport and distribution channels lead to economic and social marginalisation and degrade natural environments – conditions that are unsustainable in the long term. There has been much recent academic literature discussing the growth of Alternative Food Supply (AFS) as a sustainable solution to the food supply chain concerns raised about 'conventional' agriculture. However, the academic world remains largely in conflict over just how such claims manifest in reality. With reference to these theoretical claims, this project aims to explore the extent to which an AFS system contributes to Sustainable Development at the firm level, with respect to economic, social and environmental sustainability parameters. This project draws on qualitative data from case research of a small-scale, local, organic vegetable <b>delivery</b> <b>box</b> network in Sweden. Based on set criteria, the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the system is analysed, with a focus on the economic. Main results show that at the firm level the studied AFS network creates a sustainable flow of income for suppliers by creating greater market access temporally and geographically. Structural weaknesses in the network, however, threaten its perpetuation if external or internal conditions would change. Higher-level industry and political conditions also threaten the sustainability of the studied AFS network. The paper also highlights key strengths and weaknesses of attempting to holistically analyse sustainability, and wider industry implications for policy makers and, indirectly, consumers...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGene {{transcription}} {{is essential}} for learning, but the precise role of transcription factors that control expression of many other genes in specific learning paradigms is yet poorly understood. Zif 268 (Krox 24 /Egr- 1) is a transcription factor and an immediate-early gene associated with memory consolidation and reconsolidation, and induced in the striatum after addictive drugs exposure. In contrast, very {{little is known about}} its physiological role at early stages of operant learning. We investigated the role of Zif 268 in operant conditioning for food. Zif 268 expression was increased in all regions of the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens in mice subjected to the first session of operant conditioning. In contrast, Zif 268 increase in the dorsomedial caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens core was not detected in yoked mice passively receiving the food reward. This indicates that Zif 268 induction in these structures is linked to experiencing or learning contingency, but not to reward delivery. When the task was learned (5 sessions), Zif 268 induction disappeared in the nucleus accumbens and decreased in the medial caudate-putamen, whereas it remained high in the lateral caudate-putamen, previously implicated in habit formation. In transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the striatonigral neurons, Zif 268 induction occured after the first training session in both GFP-positive and negative neurons indicating an enhanced Zif 268 expression in both striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons.

40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} (e-commerce), as {{a method}} of buying or selling via telecommunications and computer networks, has redefined and changed the ways how people live and how business is conducted (Bushry, 2005). Although popular in most developed countries, it exists only about 15 years in developing countries like China, although growing at a considerable rate (He, 2010). For example, during 2008 - 2012, Chinese online shopping market size ascended from £ 12. 82 billion to £ 130. 30 billion. (PRNewswire, 2014). In 2014, China B 2 C market soared 68. 7 % and C 2 C market increased 35. 2 % comparing to 2013 (iReserach, 2015). Despite the potential exponential growth of e-commerce market, the logistics sector develops at a slower pace and becomes a constraint to e-commerce growth. For instance, infrastructures in most areas in China remain undeveloped and insufficient for modern e-commerce (Zhou, 2013). During festive periods of high demand, express companies had to run a 24 / 7 operation for weeks, yet still remain unable to deliver all goods on time (Qian, 2012). Although e-commerce and logistics are two areas over-researched during the past decades in developed countries, there are still few empirical studies in developed countries that explore and how logistics services and infrastructure impact on the business-to-consumer (B 2 C) markets in China (Zhou, 2013). This study aims to fill this gap by providing empirical evidence on the e-commerce logistics operations in China and how they are integrated with consumer demand. The study is one of few empirical studies that employs mixed-methods with a large scale surveys. Research questions The objectives of this research are to investigate, analyze and evaluate the major e-retailers' logistics operation in China and customers' perceptions toward their logistics service. Specifically, research questions are developed as follows: • What are the main e-retailers' logistics operation modes in China? What are their relative strengths and weakness? • What are the current situation and main challenges of Chinese e-retailers regarding logistics operation? • What factors determine the service quality and customer satisfaction in -retailers' logistics service in China? • To what extent logistics models such as reverse logistics, crowdsourced shipping might, and <b>delivery</b> <b>box</b> can be applied for e-retailers' logistics? Methodology A critical literature review examined e-commerce and logistics management and identified key themes on e-retailers logistics operations comparing developed and developing countries. A conceptual framework of key variables is developed to guide the empirical part of this study. A mixed empirical method was followed. Qualitative methods included focus groups and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with key logistics managers in China using archival research to cross-validate interviews' results. A large-scale survey of logistics service satisfaction was followed with self-administered questionnaires. Data analysis involved correlation and regression analysis for the quantitative data and content analysis for the qualitative data. Findings Firstly, findings suggest that the main challenges for e-retailers in China are: (i) lack of reliable and nationwide 3 PL providers, (ii) the high cost and low efficiency of last-mile logistics, and (iii) increased yet unfulfilled logistical needs from small cities that are excluded from e-commerce {{due to the lack of}} adequate logistics coverage. Reverse logistics was not prioritized by most e-retailers whereas leading e-retailers in China started to develop sustainable logistics operations to enhance their brand reputation. Regarding logistics modes in China, findings suggest that most retailers rely on own means of logistics operations, which offer them the advantage in raising the logistics service quality in China. However, in order to meet the logistics needs of small cities, e-retailers had to collaborate with regional third-party logistics providers and develop their capabilities to extend their delivery range and at the same time reduce logistics cost. Thirdly, the investigation on the customer's side reveals that 56 % customers express a positive judgement toward e-retailers' logistics service in China. Besides safety, delivery dependability, promptness of returns and delivery speed are the most important factors which influence customers' satisfaction level in China. Correlation analysis showed that customers of different ages, occupations and incomes have various preferences on specific logistics service factors (like delivery speed, flexibility and cost). For instance, Chinese youths are easier to lose patience with slow deliveries while employees usually are more concerned with delivery flexibility. Therefore, e-retailers should differentiate their logistics service to meet various needs. Lastly, optimized strategies in the last-mile logistics, reverse logistics and green logistics were analyzed and evaluated. Findings suggest the CAM model (Lee and Whang, 2001), <b>delivery</b> <b>box</b> (Andrew, 2015; Punakivi et al., 2001) and crowdsourced shipping might be effective solutions in the last-mile logistics and reverse logistics. Contribution This research identified and analyzed the current situation and challenges faced by e-retailers in China. A representative sample to further analyze characteristics of Chinese consumer behavior regarding e-commerce logistics service was established. The relationships between various logistics service factors and different customer groups were also explored. Combining with literature arguments, this research also contributes to the choice of logistics modes and optimized strategies in the last-mile logistics and reverse logistics...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this Bachelor Thesis is An enema {{in the first}} birth giving period. The Thesis is {{dividend}} in two parts, theoretical and practical ones. The theoretical part concentrates on course of childbirth, role of midwives during childbirth, communication in pregnancy and during childbirth, enema both the historical overview, {{but also on the}} views of women and experts on the cleansing enema in the first birth giving period and the role of midwives during antenatal preparation. An enema in the first birth giving period {{is one of the most}} common methods of antenatal preparation. Earlier it was a routine matter, today it is a free choice of every woman. Even though, we meet with different views of the cleansing enema in the first birth giving period. The first aim of the research investigation was to ascertain opinions and experiences of women with enema. Based on this aim was chosen research question: What kind of opinion and experiments do the women have with the administration of an enema? The second aim was to ascertain, why some women refuse enema before childbirth and what is led to this decision. The established research question to this aim sounds: Why are the women averse to an enema? The third aim was to ascertain access nursing staff to enema submission. The established research question to this aim sounds: What do nursing staff think about enema in the first birth giving period? So as to reach these aims, the qualitative research investigation in the form of depth interviews of own design, was adopted. The research sample was made up by ten women in puerperium, who gave birth in The Maternity Unit of the Hospital in České Budějovice and ten midwives from delivery room of the Hospital in České Budějovice. The data collected from the interviews were processed via the quantitative analysis. During the research investigation it was ascertained, that only one woman in puerperium, at the first birth, a cleansing enema refused, because the concept of an enema did not know. The second birth already took place after the cleansing enema submission. Another interviewee woman in puerperium states, that the application itself enema and the subsequent emptying was far worse than whole childbirth. Others the interviewee women in puerperium got a cleansing enema as part of the antenatal preparation. They state, that cleansing enema before the childbirth the first birth giving period shortens and combined with hot showers relieves pain. After application of cleansing enema will reduce the afraid and shame associated with leakage of stool in the <b>delivery</b> <b>box</b> and they are able to cooperate with the obstetric staff. For women in puerperium is embarrassing ?push out buttocks? to the midwife and the introduction of a rectal tube into the rectum. The application itself is not embarrassing. The midwives state that a cleansing enema before childbirth is not throw-back, but effective method, that helps to the client, but also whole obstetric staff. It was ascertained that the cleansing enema before childbirth warms the abdominal cavity, relief of pain, especially in combination with warm shower and regular contractions. Properly emptied colon is to prevent leakage of stool when pushing, frees up space for better entry of the fetal head to the pelvic entrance and childbirth so progresses better and thus faster. The advantage of enema for child is clearly preventing infection. The interviewee women in puerperium state that an important responsibility in the application of cleansing enema is communication with client and respect intimacy. The results of this research investigation could be used as the source of information and study material for future students of the branch Midwife. Furthermore, it can be used as education material for midwives, who work in the delivery rooms and for expectant mothers...|$|E
