60|$|Wilhelmina smiled. Something {{of the joy}} of a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> came faintly back to her.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} lit with humour. To have spoken lightly {{on such a}} subject a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> would have seemed incredible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{how about}} it? Do you grasp the psychology? Does it make sense? Only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> {{he was engaged}} to Miss Bassett." ...|$|E
5000|$|No. 21 - Meebles - [...] "Ah, can it be? A <b>few</b> short <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> {{my heart}} was light" [...] ("When the Heart Is Young") ...|$|R
60|$|Men {{took their}} destiny {{in their own}} hands and laughed at Fate and at the links of the chain which she had been forging so {{carefully}} and so patiently ever since she began the business {{on the steps of}} the Stadhuis a <b>few</b> short <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] he repeated, {{and then}} he laughed. [...] "You are not, Jane; and if you {{will return to the}} city of Opar and ask them who dwell there they will tell you that I was not dead a <b>few</b> short <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> No, dear, we are both very much alive." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Ray {{moved forward}} and placed {{deliberately}} upon the table {{the roll of}} papers which I had given up to him a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only met}} you this afternoon--a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> And here we are, {{absolutely}} wedged together on these seats--and my chaperon is dozing half the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is the man}} {{who looked}} in at the window that night," [...] he whispered. [...] "I saw him--only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> It is the same man." ...|$|E
60|$|Colonel Harris, sitting {{near his}} daughter, {{would have given}} worlds {{to know what she}} thought. He himself {{did not know what to}} think. His simple, unsophisticated mind was in a maze. The {{question}} of Luke's possible guilt had suddenly loomed up before him, dissipating the former blind impulse of partisanship and loyalty. Mr. Dobson too looked puzzled, the old family solicitor who had seen Luke and his brothers and sister grow up, who a <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> nay minutes, <b>ago</b> would have sworn to his client's innocence before the entire world, he too now was face to face with a hideous feeling of doubt.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Gamp {{went home}} to the bird-fancier's, and was knocked up again that very night for a birth of twins; Mr Mould dined gayly in the bosom of his family, and passed the evening facetiously at his club; the hearse, after {{standing}} {{for a long time}} at the door of a roistering public-house, repaired to its stables with the feathers inside and twelve red-nosed undertakers on the roof, each holding on by a dingy peg, to which, in times of state, a waving plume was fitted; the various trappings of sorrow were carefully laid by in presses for the next hirer; the fiery steeds were quenched and quiet in their stalls; the doctor got merry with wine at a wedding-dinner, and forgot the middle of the story which had no end to it; the pageant of a <b>few</b> short <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> was written nowhere half so legibly as in the undertaker's books.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} till half an <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> But, after all, why should her going off {{with him to}} Anglebury for a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> do her any harm? Anybody who knows how pure she is will feel any such thought to be quite unjust. I have been trying this morning to help on this {{marriage}} with Wildeve--yes, I, ma'am--in the belief that I ought to do it, {{because she was so}} wrapped up in him. But I much question if I was right, after all. However, nothing came of it. And now I offer myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-day,--only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> I {{was telling}} him where you lived when your uncle came along for the tobacco. They talked a while together, and then went off." ...|$|E
60|$|Ann, however, {{produced}} it--which, {{considering that}} Mr. Bullsom had carefully placed it there a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> was not extraordinary--and Brooks sipped the wine with inward tremors, {{justified by the}} result.|$|E
60|$|Excitement {{seemed to}} have steadied my nerves. I forgot all the minor tragedies which had been real enough things to face only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> I spoke calmly and decisively.|$|E
60|$|An <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> an <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> We {{rested in}} the shade; And now, {{why should we}} seek to know What way the wilful waters flow? There is no fairer glade.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you {{are talking}} nonsense," [...] Philippa insisted. [...] "You say that you saw Major Felstead fifty-six <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> You cannot mean {{us to believe that}} fifty-six <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> you were at Wittenberg." ...|$|R
6000|$|BRODIE. No, Jean, this {{is where}} it ends. Uncle, {{this is where}} it ends. And to think that not an <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> I still had hopes! Hopes! Ay, not an <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> I thought of a new life. You were not forgotten, Jean. Leslie, you must try to forgive me ... you too! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "We had {{the pleasure}} of knocking them both down a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> As it was a private affair, we won't go into details." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he said, [...] "God {{is against}} me! And yet a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> I dared {{to think that}} He had guided me to a haven of rest and forgetfulness! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your husband already knows, madame," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply. [...] "Only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> I proved to him whence had come the leakage {{of so many}} of our secrets lately." ...|$|E
60|$|Cecily. Your brother Ernest. He arrived {{about half}} an <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
60|$|ELLIE. Only half an <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> I became Captain Shotover's white wife.|$|R
5000|$|Lennon {{complains}} about the sound again, {{saying that it}} was better two <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
60|$|Louise sighed,--she {{was really}} very sleepy. Then, as the {{thoughts}} began to crowd into her brain, she began also to remember. Some part of the excitement of a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> returned.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{probably}} {{found himself}} {{too weak to}} appear in public," [...] replied Flo Stanton. [...] "I'm sure if I had been all but drowned a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> I would prefer bed to society." ...|$|E
60|$|Tinville {{remained}} {{one of the}} last; he and Merlin seemed {{suddenly to}} have buried the hatchet, which a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> had threatened to destroy {{one or the other}} of these whilom bosom friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{where you}} make a mistake, my hearty. They most likely landed two or three <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> runnin' down the western shore, where they'd find {{sheltered}} water. Them men ain't fools if they are villains, an' by noon knowed the brig couldn't hold together much longer. The chances are she was bilged two <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> an' has gone to pieces by this time." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "7pm Woke Up An <b>Hour</b> <b>Ago</b> (feat. Spank Rock) from Michel Poiccard by The Death Set (2011) ...|$|R
60|$|From {{the pocket}} of his coat he drew the letter which Blakeney had written an <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Who knows?" [...] {{said the}} man, {{shaking his head}} despondently. [...] "They {{departed}} together a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> in a boat with forty rowers, and they took with them the King and Queen of Pingaree!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} Lenora, Mr. Ashleigh," [...] he remarked. [...] "However, if it {{interests}} you, I will tell you why I know she has been abducted. Only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> I was talking to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{well did}} Peter know the sound; [...] The {{language}} of those drunken joys [...] To him, a jovial soul, I ween, [...] But a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> had been [...] A gladsome and a welcome noise. [...] 880 ...|$|E
60|$|She left an <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> by {{the early}} train, he was told. She has gone into the country.|$|R
60|$|Yes; not two <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> He {{announced}} the fact before my father, my mother, Connie, the servants, everybody.|$|R
60|$|I had {{suspended}} my packing {{in order}} to sit on my bed and brood. I was utterly depressed. There are crises in a man's life when Reason fails to bring the slightest consolation. In vain I tried to tell myself that what had happened was, in essence, precisely what, twenty-four <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> I was so eager to bring about. It amounted to this, that now, at last, Audrey had definitely gone out of my life. From now on I could have no relations with her of any sort. Was not this exactly what, twenty-four <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> I had wished? Twenty-four <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> had I not said to myself that I would go away and never see her again? Undoubtedly. Nevertheless, I sat there and groaned in spirit.|$|R
