25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the black woodpecker, the European green woodpecker and the lesser spotted woodpecker are also themselves common. The population of white-backed woodpecker, a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl and the Ural owl. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard, the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E

50|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is a {{somewhat}} less specialised ant hunter than the European green woodpecker. In its foraging strategy it is intermediate between many Dendrocopos {{species on the}} one hand, and the often ant-specific members of the genus Picus. This reduced ant specialisation of the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> allows it to be sympatric with European green woodpeckers and even to breed at about 100 meters from them.|$|E
5000|$|Besides these partner-specific vocalisations, {{aggressive}} noises can {{be heard}} from both sexes, but more often the male. Typical are individual, sharp kuek sounds that may, with increasing irritation, be placed in sequence and be continued as kek. A single kuek may be also be a predator warning, as begging nestlings will immediately fall silent if this call is made by either parent. Individual drumming activity by <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> can be quite varied, but they drum on more occasions than European green woodpeckers. Drumming frequence can be 20 Hertz, with a [...] "drum roll" [...] lasting up to 40 beats, or two seconds. Both sexes drum, but the female less often than the male, and usually more quietly and shorter. <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> often continue {{to use the same}} well-resonating drum sites for years - these can even be at a considerable distance from the nest. <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> often use metal covers on masts and roofs as drumming substrate due to their favourable resonance characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, ants {{and their}} immatures {{make up the}} lion's share of the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker's</b> diet, {{particularly}} in spring and summer. Wood ants of the genus Formica as well as members of Lasius and Myrmicinae such as Myrmica spp. predominate, and with termites may make up 90% of the diet. Besides those, caterpillars, crickets, bark and wood beetle larvae, flies, spiders and lice {{are part of the}} diet. In late autumn and early winter, <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> switch to including significant amounts of vegetable matter, such as berries and other fruits, in their diets on a regular basis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grey-headed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> live in both {{deciduous}} {{and mixed}} forests. They breed in May and lay {{five to ten}} eggs which are brought up by both parents. The young hatch after 15-17 days, and fledge in 24-25 days.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} for hybridisation between grey-headed and European green woodpeckers. However, these seem extremely rare. It {{appears that the}} female partner was invariably a <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> Nothing has been reported concerning the fertility of such hybrid offspring. Their plumage resembles a <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> more closely, but with a red parting on the head, a reddish nape and a brighter iris, while some were conspicuous for their dark coloration.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{distinguished}} from the similar, but smaller, <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> by its yellowish, not grey, underparts, and the black lores and facial 'mask'. In Europe, its green upperparts and yellow rump can lead to confusion with the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> or possibly the female golden oriole, though the latter is smaller and more slender with narrower wings and longer tail. The closely related, very similar Levaillant's woodpecker occurs only in north-west Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Calls {{made by the}} European green {{woodpecker}} and <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> resemble each other. The far-carrying territorial song of the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is more melodic and cleaner than the explosive [...] "laughter" [...] of the {{green woodpecker}}. The call series consists of ten to fifteen utterances of declining pitch and gradual slowing. The verse may appear melancholic and [...] "dying". The territorial song of females is similar, but somewhat quieter, less melodious, but more croaky and often shorter.|$|E
50|$|Long {{thought to}} be subspecies, the South East Asian <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> in the Himalayas and those in Sumatra were defined, in 2014, to be {{separate}} species Picus guerini and Picus dedemi, respectively, so that as of 2016, three subspecies remain part of Picus canus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grey-headed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> have uniformly {{olive green}} upperparts, {{transitioning}} across the neck to a light grey, the head being that latter colour. The typical woodpecker markings {{are small and}} not particularly conspicuous. It has a grey head with black moustache, and the male has a red crown. It has a shorter neck, slimmer bill and slightly rounder head than the green woodpecker.|$|R

50|$|As the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> prefers {{undisturbed}} {{and ancient}} forests with natural cohort structure {{as well as}} riparian forests for breeding, the destruction of such habitat is {{the greatest threat to}} the species.|$|E
50|$|The Sumatran {{woodpecker}} (Picus dedemi) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Picidae endemic to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, where it is found in forest and woodland habitats in montane areas.

This species was considered conspecific with the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Picus canus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is more {{demanding}} than the European green woodpecker {{in terms of}} its habitat. It prefers old mixed coniferous forest with a high proportion of dead trees, feeding primarily on ants, although not being as exclusively dependent on this group as the green woodpecker. The grey-headed woodpecker's nest is typically excavated into dead or severely damaged trees.|$|E
5000|$|The eastern grey {{woodpecker}} or <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Dendropicos spodocephalus) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Picidae. It is a resident breeder in eastern Africa.

50|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>{{woodpecker}}</b> (Picus canus), {{also known}} as the grey-faced woodpecker, is a Eurasian member of the woodpecker family, Picidae. Along with the more commonly found European green woodpecker and the Iberian green woodpecker, it is one of three closely related sister species found in Europe. Its distribution stretches across large parts of the central and Eastern Palaearctic, {{all the way to the}} Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is 28 - 33 cm {{long and}} weighs 110 - 206 g. Specimens {{of the more}} {{widespread}} of the two Eastern subspecies, P. c. jessoensis, are usually a little larger and heavier than individuals from the type locality. On average, it is somewhat smaller and lighter than the European green woodpecker. In the field, this distinction in size is difficult to make. Its size is approximately that of a Eurasian collared dove.|$|E
50|$|In the Kellerwald, {{parts of}} which are also a Special Protection Area (for birds), a number of bird species still or once again breed, among them the black stork, the common raven, six kinds of {{woodpecker}} (among them the rare middle spotted woodpecker and the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker),</b> the black and the red kite (which here reach their highest population density anywhere in Hesse), the peregrine falcon, the Tengmalm's owl, the honey buzzard, the Eurasian eagle owl and the great grey shrike.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is {{difficult}} to record, as isolated breeding pairs don't often call. These are therefore easily overlooked, and population records have corresponding gaps. It is probable that European populations, especially at the north-western margin of the range, have receded in numbers and distribution. Since the 1990s, populations seem to be recovering {{as a result of}} mild winters. Globally, there is a slight reduction in population numbers, but insufficiently so for an elevated threat status. The species is therefore considered safe.|$|E

Woodpecker species are present on Oiti, such as <b>grey-headed</b> <b>{{woodpecker}},</b> the white-backed woodpecker, the black woodpecker and the syrian woodpecker. Other bird species include the ortolan bunting, the horned lark, the eurasian skylark, the tawny pipit, the alpine accentor, the black redstart, the northern wheatear, the common rock thrush, the black storck and the white-winged snowfinch. As well as a great number of rare predatory birds, for example the golden eagle, the short-toed snake eagle and the peregrine falcon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{is found}} in wide parts of Central, Northern and Eastern Europe, {{as well as a}} wide belt south of the boreal {{coniferous}} forests across Asia {{all the way to the}} Pacific coast, Sakhalin and Hokkaid≈ç. Its northern limit is at the border between closed coniferous and mixed forest; the southern limit is where tree steppe transitions to treeless shrubby steppe. In East Asia, the species is most differentiated, and south of Manchuria covers the Korean Peninsula, as well as large parts of eastern China and Farther India, the mountain forests of the Malay Peninsula.|$|E

There is an eighteen-hole golf course on the northern slope of Hammerstein's H√∂he. Access to the hills is restricted by a hunting preserve, where a herd of fallow deer is kept. The wild boar population is relatively large. Amongst the most important species of bird are the middle and lesser spotted woodpeckers, the European green woodpecker and the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> A high density of breeding red kites live {{around the edges of the}} forest, especially in the east and south.Buzzard, goshawk, sparrowhawk and hobby also breed here.

5000|$|Just like in humans, the {{distribution}} of trabeculae in bird species is uneven, depending on the loading conditions. The bird with the highest density of trabeculae is the kiwi, a flightless bird. There is also uneven distribution of trabeculae within the similar species such as the Great spotted woodpecker or <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> After examining a microCT scan of the woodpecker‚Äôs forehead, temporomandibulum, and occiput {{it was determined that}} there is significantly more trabeculae in the forehead and occiput. Besides the difference in distribution, the aspect ratio of the individual struts was higher in woodpeckers than in other birds of similar size such as the Eurasian Hoopoe or the Lark. The woodpeckers‚Äô trabeculae are more plate-like while the hawk and lark have rod-like structures networked through their bones. The decrease in strain on the woodpecker‚Äôs brain has been attributed to the higher quantity of thicker plate-like struts packed more closely together than the hawk or hoopoe or the Lark. Conversely, the thinner rod-like structures would lead to greater deformation. A destructive mechanical test with 12 samples show the woodpecker‚Äôs trabeculae design has an average ultimate strength of 6.38MPa, compared to the lark‚Äôs 0.55MPa.|$|E

40|$|Diverse {{group of}} cavity-nesting birds inhabit {{secondary}} forests of northeastern China, accounting for {{about one-third of}} breeding avian species. We examined differences in nest-site characteristics amongfour cavity-nesting birds, including two cavity excavators (i. e., great spotted woodpecker [Dendrocopos major] and <b>grey-headed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> [Picus canus]) and two secondary cavity-nesters (i. e., yellow-rumped flycatcher [Ficedula zanthopygia] and Eurasian nuthatch [Sitta europaea]) in Dagang Forestry Farm, Jilin Province, China. We detected total 160 active hole nests in the breeding season of 2008, including 58 nests of cavity excavators and 102 of secondary cavity-nesters. Secondary cavity-nesters tend to prefer Salix pierotii for nestingtrees, but the excavators not. Picus canus used south-facing cavities, {{which may have been}} due to thermal advantages. Nest tree and nest-site quadrat characteristics were different between the two excavator species. Specifically, there were significant differences in the entrance diameter and cavity inner diameter between the nest sites of Dendrocopos major and Picus canus, and the entrance length and canopy height of nest tree between Ficedula zanthopygia and Sitta europaea. The characteristics at the scale of nest tree were important for distinguishing nest sites for cavity excavators as well as secondary cavity-nesters. Discriminant analyses illustrated that Ficedula zanthopygia and Sitta europaea used cavities excavated by Dendrocopos major and Picus canus, respectively. Differences in size of nesting holes excavated by different woodpeckers could affect the usage of nest sites by secondary cavity-nesters, which may have an impact on avian community structure in secondary forests...|$|E
