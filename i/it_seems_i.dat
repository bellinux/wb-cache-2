2500|$|Although {{the band}} has {{described}} its style as [...] "math rock" [...] and [...] "math metal", drummer Matt McDonough said in 2009: [...] "I honestly don't know what 'math metal' is.

I don't really see Mudvayne as an innovator in anything." [...] Music critics and journalists have categorized the band as alternative metal, experimental metal, extreme metal, hard rock, heavy metal, industrial metal, math metal, metalcore, neo-progressive metal, neo-progressive rock, nu metal, progressive rock, progressive metal and shock rock.|$|E
2500|$|Debauchery is {{a primary}} theme {{throughout}} the album, stemming from Wainwright's struggles with addiction and quest for fame.

The song has been called an [...] "ode to subtle addictions and the way our compulsions rule our lives." [...] The music video for [...] "Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk", directed by Giles Dunning and released by DreamWorks in 2001, features Wainwright performing the song at a piano inside a warehouse and scenes of him walking around New York City.|$|E
