5|$|A protein as a {{stand-alone}} <b>infectious</b> <b>agent</b> stands {{in contrast to}} all other known infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, all of which contain nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both). For this reason, a minority of researchers still consider the prion/TSE hypothesis unproven.|$|E
40|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>agents</b> are {{ubiquitous}} in nature. They can be broadly distinguished into microparasites (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa), macroparasites (nematodes, trematodes and cestodes), ectoparasites (fleas and ticks), parasitic castrators and parasitoids. Although {{these types of}} <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> are very different {{in the way they}} affect their host, they all tend to live on or in their hosts for most of their life while benefiting from its nutrients. Ecologically speaking, <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> are part of food webs (networks of species that have trophic consumer-resource relations). They are in essence consumers of resources (their hosts), but they differ from typical consumers in having only one victim per life stage and not necessarily killing or fully consuming their victims. The interaction between <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> and their hosts can result in subclinical or clinical disease in infected host individuals. Subclinical, <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> possibly have an impact on life-history traits, behaviour, feeding or other individual-level aspects of their hosts because of increased energy use. Infected predators may have a reduced ability to hunt and catch prey, while infected prey may be easier to catch or less nutritious. Clinical, <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> may increase mortality in their hosts. By changing behaviour or survival of their hosts, <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> indirectly influence other species, including non-host species, of their ecological community. These effects could be measured through an <b>infectious</b> <b>agent’s</b> influence on energy flow, biodiversity, community interactions and the abiotic part of the ecosystem. In that way <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> may affect structure, functioning and stability of ecological communities. In this thesis we use data collection, data analysis, and mathematical and computational modelling to study the potential impact of different types of <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> in food webs and ecosystems. First, we show results of field research on macroparasites of top predators. The research provides an illustration of the diversity of parasites and their hosts in real life systems. Second, we systematically classify the effects of <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> on energy flow, community interactions, diversity, and at the ecosystem level, covering a broad range of <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> in a broad range of host species. We also classify their diversity, types and functional roles. We discuss a concept of new indirect approach of modelling <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> in food webs and give a simple model of a microparasite in a very basic Lotka-Volterra consumer-resource system. Third, we quantify the clinical and subclinical impacts of <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> on food web structure and stability, using an indirect approach by adding <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> not as stand-alone species, but through the effects they have on their hosts. Finally, we show an example of a new approach based on multiplex networks {{that could be used in}} future for modelling the effects of <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> in food webs, explicitly recognizing different types of interaction between <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> and its hosts that occur in complex systems. This thesis makes an attempt to shed the light on the importance of <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> as potentially major players in food webs. They can play a much more positive, and even essential, role, in addition to their already established negative image. A healthy ecosystem may be one that is rich with <b>infectious</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

5|$|In generic sense, {{vaccination}} {{works by}} priming {{the immune system}} with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune response, via use of an <b>infectious</b> <b>agent,</b> is known as immunization.

5|$|Whether prions cause {{disease or}} are merely a symptom {{caused by a}} {{different}} agent is still debated by a minority of researchers. The following sections describe several hypotheses: Some pertain to {{the composition of the}} <b>infectious</b> <b>agent</b> (protein-only, protein with other components, virus, or other), while others pertain to its mechanism of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the <b>infectious</b> <b>agent.</b> If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
40|$|Exposure to <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> during {{pregnancy}} and early childhood {{is associated with}} the development of schizophrenia and other serious psychiatric diseases in later life.

The <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> were chiefly intracellular micro-organisms including miliary tuberculosis, Herpes simplex, varicella, measles, Pneumocystis carinii, and Plasmodium falciparum.

5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack {{phagocytic}} cells, {{but many}} plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When {{a part of}} a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular <b>infectious</b> <b>agent.</b> RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an <b>infectious</b> <b>agent</b> more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of <b>infectious</b> <b>agent.</b> He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E

40|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>agents</b> {{are part}} of food webs and {{ecosystems}} via the relationship with their host species that, in turn, interact with both hosts and non-hosts. Through these interactions, <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> influence food webs in terms of structure, functioning and stability. The present literature shows {{a broad range of}} impacts of <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> on food webs, and by cataloguing that range, we worked towards defining the various mechanisms and their specific effects. To explore the impact, a direct approach is to study changes in food-web properties with <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> as separate species in the web, acting as additional nodes, with links to their host species. An indirect approach concentrates not on adding new nodes and links, but on the ways that <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> affect the existing links across host and non-host nodes, by influencing the ‘quality’ of consumer–resource interaction as it depends on the epidemiological state host involved. Both approaches are natural from an ecological point of view, but the indirect approach may connect more straightforwardly to commonly used tools in infectious disease dynamics...|$|R

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1800s Louis Pasteur perfected {{experiments}} which disproved the then-popular theory of spontaneous generation and from which he derived the modern theory of (infectious) disease.

He then derived a vaccine by altering the <b>infectious</b> <b>agent</b> so as to make it harmless and then introducing this inactivated form of the infectious agents into farm animals, which then proved to be immune to the disease.|$|E

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{have the}} potential {{to play a role in}} the decline of threatened wildlife populations, as well as negatively affect their long-term viability, but determining which <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> present risks can be difficult. The southern resident killer whale, Orcinus orca, population is endangered and little is known about infectious diseases in this species. Using available reference literature, we identified 15 <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> (bacteria, viruses, and fungi) reported in free-ranging and captive killer whales, as well as 28 additional <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> reported in free-ranging and captive odontocete species sympatric to southern resident killer whales. <b>Infectious</b> <b>agents</b> were scored as having a high, medium, or low ability to affect fecundity or reproductive success, to cause disease in individual animals, and to cause epizootics. Marine Brucella spp., cetacean poxvirus, cetacean morbilliviruses, and herpesviruses were identified as high priority pathogens that warrant further study. Using identified pathogens to develop a standardized necropsy and disease testing protocol for southern resident killer whales and sympatric odontocetes will improve future efforts to better understand the impacts of priority and non-priority <b>infectious</b> <b>agents</b> on southern resident killer whales.

25|$|Anatomical {{barriers}} include physical, {{chemical and}} biological barriers.
