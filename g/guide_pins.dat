5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the <b>guide</b> <b>pins,</b> and they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.|$|E

30|$|In {{cases where}} a {{cortical}} button is employed {{to secure the}} graft to the femur, our group has observed an unsteady movement of the <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> that is not securely fixed in bone when over drilled with a cannulated femoral drill. This common scenario is presumed to occur when the drilling sequence produces the smaller cortical button drill hole before the larger graft tunnel socket. In this situation, the tunnel <b>guide</b> <b>pin</b> would be loose within the cortical button drill hole. As a consequence of drilling over a loose <b>guide</b> <b>pin,</b> the drill might “wobble” and possibly alter the tunnel shape and aperture dimensions. To our knowledge, this observation was not {{reported in the literature}} with no previous study comparing the effect of changing the drilling sequence of the femoral tunnel on the tunnel shape.|$|R

50|$|During {{the third}} day solo in lunar orbit, Worden began to have some {{problems}} with the Mass Spectrometer. This was located {{on the end of}} a boom that is deployed and retracted periodically throughout the mission. Frequently instruments in the CM were indicating that it had failed to retract. To get it to retract properly he had to cycle the retract/deploy switch several times. During the EVA on the return to Earth, he inspected the housing and found that <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were barely coming through the guide slot. Further it was found that the problems with retraction always occurred after the housing had been in the shadow of the spacecraft, but would retract fully after being in sunlight. This was caused by the motor stalling out, implying that the parts of the boom were being deformed by thermal expansion. To stop this occurring, several modifications were made to the instruments used on Apollo 16 and Apollo 17.|$|E

The new keyboard organized pitches in a similar fashion to an ordinary piano keyboard but also emphasized the different classes of pitches by using different shapes and colors of keytops. The 1/1 series was assigned to large white natural keys arranged rising in diagonal rows, the 5/4 series on raised black sharp keys between the white keys, the 7/4 series on square red keys followed by square yellow 63/32 and blue 45/32 keys behind the white keys (a 6/5 series could be added using buttons raised above the sharp keys if desired). Key motion was linear and used two <b>guide</b> <b>pins.</b> The staggered keyboard arrangement separated distant key signatures and aligned octaves and was transpositionally invariant but not generalized, although the abbreviated pedalboard implied 3, 5, and 7 axes for 14 key-notes using three ranks of identical key levers.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{availability}} of water power this system was used until {{the closure of the}} Clausthal and Lautenthal Pits in the 1930s (e.g. at the Silbersegen Shaft and the Black Pit or Schwarze Grube). steam power was first used in earnest when the stone coal necessary for its operation could be delivered by railway {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. Electricity began to be generated at about the same time using water power from the Upper Harz Water Regale - an extensive network of ponds, dams, ditches and tunnels, originally built to supply the mines with water power. In 1900 water was passed through turbines and electrical winding engines. At that time modern pits emerged with steel hoist frames. The most important innovation in the Upper Harz hauling technology was the Albert Cable (Albert-Seil). Chief Mining Engineer (Oberbergrat) Wilhelm Albert (1787-1846) made a cable out of steel wire which was first successfully tested on 23 July 1834 at the Carolina Shaft. That was the birth of the wire cable. As the distance between shaft and workings lengthened and increasing quantities of material had to be moved, wheelbarrows or small wagons (the Hunte or Hunde) were used underground as horizontal methods of transportation. Up to 1800 they ran on wooden planks with flangeless wheels and <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> (Spurnägeln). Thereafter iron rails took over, initially as hand-forged rails (Hammelpfote) only one metre long. Until 1900 the wagons were almost always pushed by hand. Pit ponies were not used in the Upper Harz. From 1905 at the Clausthal Ore Mine (Erzbergwerk Clausthal) underground haulage was carried out using conductor engines in the gallery known as the Tiefsten Wasserstrecke or [...] "Deepest Watercourse". In the Grund Ore Mine (Erzbergwerk Grund) battery-driven locomotives were used from the 1970s and, finally, diesel engines on wheels with rubber tyres. One feature mining in the Upper Harz was the underground transportation of material in boats on the Tiefe Wasserstrecke about 300 metres deep, in Clausthal and Zellerfeld from 1835 to 1898.|$|E
30|$|The torn ACL {{was removed}} to clearly {{visualize}} the ACL footprint. Two 2.4 -mm <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were inserted from the lateral femoral cortex to the femoral ACL footprint behind the resident’s ridge and just anterior to the cartilage margin (Iwahashi et al., 2010) with an anterolateral entry femoral aimer (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy). Two 5.0 - to 6.0 -mm femoral tunnels matched with the graft diameters were {{created for the}} AMM/AML and PL grafts by over-drilling via the <b>guide</b> <b>pins.</b> For the tibia, three 2.4 -mm <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were parallelly inserted from the medial tibial cortex to the anteromedial portion of the tibial ACL footprint (Otsubo et al., 2012) with a tibial tip aimer (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy). The <b>guide</b> <b>pins</b> were over-drilled to create two anteriorly-located tunnels (4.5 - to 5.0 -mm) for the two portions of the AMM/AML graft and one posteriorly-located tunnel (5.0 - to 6.0 -mm) for the PL graft, matching the graft diameters. Two Endobutton-CLs (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy) with appropriate loop lengths were connected to each loop end of the two grafts. The unified tibial end of the PL graft was sutured with two No. 2 polyethylene sutures using a Krackow stitch. Each tibial end of the bifurcated AMM/AML graft was also sutured with a No. 2 polyethylene suture by a Krackow stitch, respectively.|$|E
