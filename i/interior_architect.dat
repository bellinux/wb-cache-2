500|$|Robert and Evelyn Foehl {{were the}} first to {{conceive}} of the hotel. Robert Foehl trained at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, California. He then bought the Hotel San Marcos in Chandler, Arizona. Following that, he managed the Jokake Inn in Scottsdale. Evelyn Foehl managed the Hacienda del Sol in Tucson {{as one of the few}} women in the hotel business. The two established a core of investors to build a new hotel on an [...] site in Scottsdale and to design it, they hired Edward L. Varney, one of the most prominent local architects of the time. Varney set the hotel around a central pool lounge and used extended horizontal lines in the wings where rooms included air conditioning for year-round operation, a first for Scottsdale. A curving porte-cochere with abstract Southwestern designs in cast concrete opened onto a high-ceiling lobby which gave guests a [...] "sense of arrival", a feature often used by Frank Lloyd Wright. The tall lobby connected the guests to a restaurant, a lounge, a nightclub, and the central pool. The interior design was conceived and executed by <b>interior</b> <b>architect</b> Thelma Hawkins, the director of Barker Bros. Phoenix Studio of Interior Design. The project was completed on December 20, 1956 at a cost of $1.5million, an amount equivalent to $million in current value.|$|E

40|$|Wellbeing is {{affected}} by our physical surroundings, which are an extension {{of who we are}} as people. The built environment, sensitively designed, can offer a sense of belonging for the individual, the family and the community, thereby positively affecting wellbeing. <b>Interior</b> <b>architects</b> can respond to the diverse needs and aspirations of people through their skills in design and their knowledge of occupation. This paper explores the attributes that <b>interior</b> <b>architects</b> bring to the perception and development of the built environment, and how they can contribute to wellbeing through their impact on social sustainability. It examines how socially sensitive and responsible <b>interior</b> <b>architects</b> can create environments that enrich people’s lives by redefining traditional constructs of interior architecture practice, and using interdisciplinary strategies to address issues of social sustainability in an increasingly complex world. Through real-life examples, the authors describe how <b>interior</b> <b>architects</b> can work to create built environments that are socially sustainable and responsible, and enhance {{the quality of life for}} individuals and communities. As a result, other disciplines may see opportunities for collaborative interdisciplinary work in the area of wellbeing...|$|R
