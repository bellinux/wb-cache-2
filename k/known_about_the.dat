5|$|Péron did {{not report}} seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he {{described}} them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most of what is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> King Island emu today stems from a 33-point questionnaire {{that he used to}} interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bird in life until then.|$|E

His father later married Floradise Polo (née Trevisan).|$|E
5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> habitats they occur in, {{especially for the}} ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{life and career}} of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, {{he appears to have}} been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E

5|$|Liquid helium {{below its}} lambda point (called heliumII) {{exhibits}} very unusual characteristics.
