5|$|At 07:53, {{minutes before}} the Israeli attack was to commence, <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> near El-Qantarah became heavily engaged with a brigade {{composing}} the 18th Division's right flank, as Egyptian troops sought to secure the town and its vicinity. Fuad, the division commander supported the brigade with two companies of T-62 tanks. To prevent <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> in the area from being outflanked, Gonen ordered Nir to remain near El-Qantarah to help contain the Egyptian attack. This left Adan with only 50 tanks under Amir's command {{to carry out the}} attack.|$|E
5|$|At 5:30AM on 21 March, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> {{attacked}} simultaneously on {{the three}} bridges. Combat engineers built a pontoon bridge {{in the north and}} the troops crossed the river. The Israeli spearheads pushed across the Allenby Bridge and advanced towards Shunat Nimreen.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, other {{difficulties}} were surfacing. Sharon {{reported to}} Southern Command that {{one section of}} the roller bridge, being towed by Erez's brigade, had been damaged and that the engineers needed a few hours to repair it. He also requested additional forces to help secure the corridor, noting the stiff resistance facing Reshef's brigade. Sharon's report prompted Bar-Lev to alert Adan to prepare to open the corridor with his division. Sharon argued for Adan's division to cross the canal on rafts and to proceed with Operation Abiray-Lev without waiting for the bridges. Both Gonen and Bar-Lev rejected Sharon's suggestion since, without a secure corridor to the canal, <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> on the west bank would be threatened with encirclement. Subsequently, Bar-Lev ordered that no more <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> or equipment would cross to the west bank until the bridges had been laid.|$|E
50|$|On 11 September, an <b>Israeli</b> <b>force</b> {{infiltrated}} the Jordanian territories in the Al-Rahwa, Hebron sector, {{and attacked}} {{the police station}} there. After long clashes with a Jordanian unit from the Desert Guards, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>force</b> was forced to withdraw repulsed.|$|R

5|$|The {{village of}} Isdud was {{occupied}} by the Egyptian army on May 29, 1948, and became the Egyptians' northernmost position during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. While the Israelis failed to capture territory, and suffered heavy casualties, Egypt changed its strategy from offensive to defensive, thus halting their advance northwards. Egyptian and <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> clashed in the surrounding area, with the Egyptians being unable to hold the Ad Halom bridge over the Lachish River. <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> surrounded the town during Operation Pleshet, and shelled and bombed it from the air. For three nights from 18 October the Israeli Air Force bombed Isdud and several other locations. Fearing encirclement, Egyptian forces retreated on October 28, 1948 {{and the majority of}} the residents fled. The 300 townspeople who remained were driven southwards by the Israel Defense Forces.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords calling for Palestinian {{administration}} of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} night hours of 24 October 2001, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli Army (IDF) {{launched}} an incursion into Beit Rima in {{what became the}} first major Israeli military raid into Palestinian-controlled territory, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The IDF stated {{the intent of the}} raid was to capture the alleged killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was shot dead by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in retaliation for Israel's assassination of the party's leader Mustafa Zibri (Abu Ali Mustafa) in August. About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the Israeli settlement of Halamish for interrogation. Most were released before the day's end, but eleven men remained in Israeli custody, two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze'evi's assassination. In the course of the raid, <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> killed six Palestinians, including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police, and wounded seven others. The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an olive grove near the local police station, while Israeli military officials stated all those killed had either fired on <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups. The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7:00 am, a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers. <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> also demolished three homes in the town, alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze'evi's killers.|$|E

Many refugees from areas captured by <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> in 1947–48 {{fled to the}} Bethlehem area, primarily settling in what became the official refugee camps of 'Azza (Beit Jibrin) and 'Aida {{in the north and}} Dheisheh in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.|$|E
5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E
5|$|As a Fatah field commander, {{he fought}} <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> at the Battle of Karameh, gaining a {{reputation}} as an unyielding commander. Abu Ali Iyad was also a leading organizer and participant in guerrilla raids against Israeli localities. He {{was one of the}} last Palestinian commanders to fight the Jordanian Army in the aftermath of the Black September conflict. He was killed in the countryside around Ajlun and Jerash by Jordanian forces in July 1971. His partisans claimed that he was executed, and as retaliation, they assassinated Jordanian prime minister Wasfi al-Tal four months after Abu Ali Iyad's death.|$|E
50|$|On April 4, 1951, a <b>force</b> of <b>Israeli</b> {{soldiers}} and Border Police {{set out for}} Hamat Gader in order to assert Israeli sovereignty over the site. Since Israel {{was not allowed to}} have soldiers in the DMZ, members of the patrol were disguised as policemen. Syrian soldiers guarding the entrance to Hamat Gader ordered them to turn back immediately, but the <b>Israeli</b> <b>force</b> refused. Once the <b>Israeli</b> <b>force</b> had passed, the Syrians opened fire. Of the 22 {{soldiers and}} policemen in the force, seven were killed, three were wounded and one was taken prisoner. The skirmish became known as the Al-Hamma Incident.|$|R

5|$|During the 1936–39 Arab {{revolt against}} British Mandate rule, Deir Ghassaneh {{was the scene}} of rebel gatherings and British {{military}} raids. In 1967, Bani Zeid was occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War, but it was transferred to full Palestinian security and administrative control in 2000. The next year it became the first Palestinian-controlled town to be the site of major operation by <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> during the Second Intifada. When Fathiya Barghouti Rheime was elected mayor in 2005, Bani Zeid became the first Palestinian locality with a woman as head of the municipality, in concurrence with nearby Ramallah. The current mayor is Abdel Karim Abu Aql, elected in 2012.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock {{on the road}} that had to be used by the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E
5|$|El-Qantarah {{also saw}} heavy {{fighting}} as {{troops from the}} 18th Division engaged <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> within and around the town. By early morning the division commander, Brigadier General Fuad 'Aziz Ghali, was able to set up his command post there. Close quarter combat and even hand-to-hand fighting took place as the Egyptians cleared the ghost town building by building. Fighting was intense, {{and by the end}} of October 7, the town and its outskirts as well as two nearby fortifications of the Bar Lev Line were under Egyptian control.|$|E

5|$|Fortifications {{and other}} {{structures}} {{were built in}} the rural villages under Zahir's control. In Deir Hanna, Zahir's brother Sa'd built a large fortress and an adjacent mosque, both of which were severely damaged during a siege by Jazzar Pasha in 1776. In Khirbat Jiddin, he rebuilt the demolished Crusader fortress {{with the addition of a}} mosque and hamaam (bathhouse). The mosque was destroyed by <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> when the village was captured during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In Shefa-'Amr, Zahir's son Uthman built a large fortress with four towers, of which one remains standing. Another of his sons, Ahmad, rebuilt the Crusader fortress in Saffuriya.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion {{was able}} to hold Ain Ghasin until the afternoon, when it retreated to Nefisha. As for the reconstituted 85th Battalion, it was ordered to occupy Jebel Mariam, Heneidac and Touscan. The battalion's commander, Lt. Col. Monsif, found during a {{reconnaissance}} that Touscan was surrounded by large <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> and under heavy fire, and so limited his battalion's defenses to Jebel Mariam and Heneidac only, occupying the former with the battalion's main forces, including two companies of paratroopers, and placing a single company at Heneidac.|$|E

5|$|Quneitra was the Syrian {{headquarters}} for the Golan Heights. The Israeli capture of the city occurred in chaotic circumstances on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> advancing towards Quneitra from the north-west prompted Syrian troops to deploy north of the city, under heavy bombardment, to defend the road to Damascus. At , Syrian radio broadcast an announcement that the city had fallen, though it actually had not. Alarmed, the Syrian Army's redeployment turned into a chaotic retreat along the Damascus road.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} officially {{began when}} a lone Israeli S-199 bombed Egyptian positions in Isdud at 18:00 on June 2. Five light planes—two Fairchild 24s, two Rapides and one Bonanza—also made bombing runs between 20:25 and 21:30. The bombardment {{did not make}} an impression on the readying Israeli soldiers, and {{in light of the}} noise created by the Egyptian anti-aircraft guns, the Israelis considered that the plane was lucky to have survived the run. In addition, the troops were exhausted, not having had proper sleep in the four days preceding the operation. At 22:00, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>forces</b> started moving against the Egyptian positions.|$|E
