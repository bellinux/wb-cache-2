500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E
500|$|Philippe {{was able}} to get an {{emergency}} loan of $250,000 from a Lebanese company, but this did not go very far to completing the work on the project. [...] <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> help in redrawing his budget and a larger loan of $500,000 from a large Paris bank through J. Jay Frankel, a financier on Wall Street. [...] Philippe's investors believed that the re-budgeting and additional loan would complete {{at least half of the}} resort and allow it to open for business, but Philippe continued to make expensive changes in the project such as adding more windows to all of the suites. [...] When it was evident that the project was once again in financial trouble, one of the investors in the property offered Philippe a loan for an additional $750,000, provided that the project would now result in a more modest resort. [...] Philippe was highly insulted and told the investor offering the additional funding, [...] "I have created a Cadillac. [...] You want to put into it a Chevrolet engine." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B+', {{feeling that the}} series was [...] "getting better with each new episode, and now that it’s been picked up for a full season, I’m {{genuinely}} excited {{to see where the}} show goes from here. “Eye Spy” is a big step in the right direction, delving further into the history of these characters while laying groundwork for future stories. S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t need superheroes to be a captivating TV series, and making sure the human elements are developed {{is the best way to}} guarantee the show’s success." [...] He felt that Armand [...] "does impressive work depicting the mental toll of Akela’s experience, and her intensity early in the episode makes for a poignant final moment when she lays down in her prison cell, finally at peace after years of torment." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode 7.9 out of 10, praising the [...] "darker and edgier elements" [...] of the episode, the Akela/May fight, and Ward's storyline, pointing out that [...] "some viewers have found [...] to be dull. I actually quite enjoyed Ward’s material in the pilot, and this episode was an especially nice spotlight for him ... <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> nice action beats along the way and one of the funnier moments of the episode". He did, however, criticize the fact that half of the team members are unready for combat, stating [...] "3 out of 6 team members being unready for combat is 2 too many." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress {{to declare}} war on Germany. One week later, Theodore Roosevelt asked President Wilson for {{permission}} to lead a [...] "Rough Rider"-type regiment against the Germans in France. While Roosevelt was waiting for Wilson's answer, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> kidding from his friend Masterson, who wrote Roosevelt on May 14, 1917: [...] "I wish you would arrange for an appointment with Tex Rickard and myself to meet you at your office when convenient. We {{want to tell you}} how to organize your European expedition and how to win your battles when you get there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{a natural}} at the piano, Basie {{preferred}} drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of Sonny Greer, who also lived in Red Bank and became Duke Ellington's drummer in 1919, Basie at age 15 switched to piano exclusively. Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer {{set out on}} his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pick-up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson's [...] "Kings of Syncopation". When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> jobs in Asbury Park at the Jersey Shore, and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.|$|E
2500|$|After Ashok Kumar {{became a}} star of Hindi films, the Ganguly family visited Mumbai regularly. Abhas Kumar {{changed his name to}} 'Kishore Kumar' and started his cinema career as a chorus singer at Bombay Talkies, where his brother worked. Kumar's first film {{appearance}} was in Shikari (1946), in which his brother, Ashok played the lead role. Music director Khemchand Prakash gave Kumar a chance to sing [...] "Marne ki duayen kyon mangu" [...] for the film Ziddi (1948). After this, Kumar was offered many other assignments, but he was not very serious about a film career. In 1949, he settled in Mumbai. Kumar played the hero in the Bombay Talkies film Andolan (1951), directed by Phani Majumdar. Although <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> acting assignments {{with the help of his}} brother, he was more interested in becoming a singer. But Ashok wanted Kumar to be an actor like him.|$|E

2500|$|Another reason {{might have}} been his anguished self-examination on whether he was fit to be a {{minister}} at all. These anxieties he poured out to a neighbouring minister, Mr Wodrow of Eastwood, {{at the time of}} his call to Cambuslang. He felt he was [...] "nothing but a hollow hypocrite" [...] because he had been preaching since his ordination on the nature of Conversion and was a [...] "perfect stranger to it himself". He was always very serious and dutiful, and preferred the company of righteous people, but had no inward experience of conversion. He had been [...] "haunted with atheistic thoughts and blasphemous suggestions". He was jealous and suspicious of friends (he said) and complained of his own pride and [...] "self-carnality". He was also much depressed by conversations with ordinary people, who told him about their experiences of conversion, which [...] "he has been a stranger to". Mr Wodrow thought him a sincere, studious and depressive sort of person, with the tendency of such people to be over-critical of themselves and rather obsessive on the details of theological study. He advised Mr M’Culloch that his obvious sincerity and great knowledge both scripture and doctrine made him a far better person to be a minister than many he knew. Mr Wodrow noted the many [...] "bodily marks" [...] of Mr M’Culloch’s anguish — including piercing headaches. It is obvious he was going through some sort of mental breakdown, though he did report that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> solace from reading the Bible in extreme times, when he longed for death.|$|E

5000|$|Nunb's name {{originated}} {{from the fact}} that he was referred to as [...] "Number Nine" [...] on creature packaging. In an interview, Richard Marquand described Nien Nunb as, [...] "...a Muppet, a guy under the deck does his thing. <b>He's</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> dialogue to do. <b>He's</b> <b>got</b> this funny, twitchy face.

60|$|There was an {{unfairness}} {{about it}} that perplexed Frederick, until he found solace in dwelling upon the failure Tom had made of life. Then it was, in quiet intervals, that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> comfort and stiffened his own pride by showing Tom over the estate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tim Lacy told me <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> once from a croaker uptown and fed 'em to {{his girl}} in soda water. From {{the very first}} dose he was ace-high and {{everybody}} else looked like thirty cents to her. They was married {{in less than two}} weeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} there, lad--quite right.
