5|$|Since the <b>first</b> <b>section</b> of the Istrian Y, which {{constitutes}} {{the bulk of}} the E751 route, started in 1976, with the <b>first</b> <b>section</b> opening in 1981, there were no high-performance road routes in Istria. Instead, the E751 was signposted along state roads, specifically the D66 spanning Rijeka and Pula, and then switched to the D21 in Pula {{all the way to the}} Kaštel border crossing. As the Istrian Y system was being developed, the E751 designation was gradually transferred to the new route, with consistent signposting of the E751 along the A9 and the A8, just as the D3 state road designation west of Rijeka was transferred to the B8 and B9 (later replaced by the A8 and A9 respectively).|$|E
