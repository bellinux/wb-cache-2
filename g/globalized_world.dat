5|$|Some poetry {{types are}} {{specific}} to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may {{think of it as}} written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly <b>globalized</b> <b>world,</b> poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.|$|E

25|$|Continued {{wars and}} other {{problems}} eventually led to a diminished status. The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Prior to the Second World War, Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came {{under the rule of}} an authoritarian government, which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy. Eventually democracy was peacefully restored {{in the form of a}} parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century, that started a new <b>globalized</b> <b>world</b> with economic and ecological challenges.|$|E
25|$|Italy and Lebanon {{are linked}} by an ancient friendship, which finds {{its roots in}} their common Mediterranean heritage, their antique civilizations and {{thousands}} of years of common history, intense trade relations and deep cultural and human exchanges. In the 16th century, the special relationship between Emir Fakhreddine and the Medicis family of Tuscany was instrumental in forging modern Lebanon as we know it today, which is a unique mixture of Western and Arabic cultures. Lebanon also left important traces in Italy’s history: in 1584 the Maronite College was founded in Rome, fostering contacts between clergymen, researchers and young students, which today is being continued under the framework of Inter-University cooperation. This excellent level of bilateral relations between Italy and Lebanon is reinforced today by the common views of the two countries on a number of Middle East issues, and by the growing awareness that in a <b>globalized</b> <b>world</b> the two shores of the Mediterranean sea share the same destiny.|$|E

25|$|After {{writing a}} column about Japanese popular culture {{for nearly a}} decade for the ezine PopMatters and penning over 600 entries in an online travelblog, Holden {{published}} the memoir, Peripatetic Postcards: The journey of life, through 25 of the world's cities, in 2010. Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what Holden calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life’s road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, Peripatetic Postcards operates at two levels: seeking to convey the panoply of human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly <b>globalized</b> <b>world,</b> while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience.|$|E

Benjamin Powell used the phrase differently in his book, Out of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy, writing that in the absence of child labor some youth faced starvation. In a 2010 book on human rights, Children's Rights and Human Development, child psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry used the phrase [...] "think of the children" [...] to urge clinicians to incorporate a process sensitive to developmental stages when counseling youth.|$|E

500|$|Bloomberg View {{columnist}} William Pesek said: [...] "Japan's {{corporate culture}} of denial, of ignoring problems {{and letting them}} fester, keeps running up against a <b>globalized</b> <b>world</b> that values agility, innovation and transparency. Olympus demonstrates all too painfully how much Old Japan tolerates a lack of accountability among senior executives; inadequate disclosure; a disinclination to challenge authority and absolute deference to corporate boards regardless of share performance." [...] While he also observed that {{the independence of the}} directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. [...] "Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked." [...] Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price [...] "trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of the people who run listed companies. Somehow, they {{lose sight of the fact}} that they manage businesses, not share prices." ...|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} and curator Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi described Ogboh's work as capturing [...] "the maddening hyper-visuality of Lagos". Ogboh was among Nzewi's most anticipated artists at the 2014 contemporary African art festival [...] In 2013, Ogboh reported reception of his Lagos Soundscapes as mixed: annoying some and intriguing others. Quiet European cities {{have considered the}} work [...] "noisy and obtrusive", in one case destroying a speaker and calling the police on the installation. The artist appreciated the installation's effect on Nigerians abroad, and how being in earshot of the soundscape confused them in their foreign environment. Art historian Carol Magee noted how even {{in the business of}} the Lagos Soundscapes, she felt a stillness in which her attention was focused and the patterns unchanging despite the cacophony of the scene. Malawian visual artist Massa Lemu described Ogboh's work as embodying Afropolitanism, in which African cities were representative of a busy, <b>globalized</b> <b>world</b> and its multiple cultures centralized in one place. Lemu thought of Ogboh's soundscapes as [...] "auditory landscapes" [...] that recreate a sense of the Lagos environment. He additionally compared Ogboh's practice with that of sound artists James Webb (South Africa) and Magdi Mostafa (Egypt), though these two tend to manipulate their recordings where Ogboh instead recontextualizes the original. For this reason, Lemu considered Ogboh's work to be closer in lineage to John Cage's recontextualized found sounds than the practice of El Anatsui or Romuald Hazoume recycling found objects as commentary on economic conditions.|$|E

2500|$|The Lee {{government}} {{planned to}} use a pool of young Korean Americans {{for the promotion of}} after-school English education in public schools in rural areas, with the aim {{to improve the quality of}} education. Prior to assuming the presidency, Lee's transition team announced it would implement a nationwide English-immersion program in order to provide students with the language tools necessary to be successful in a highly <b>globalized</b> <b>world.</b> Under this program, all classes would have been taught in English by 2010. [...] However, Lee abandoned the program after facing strong opposition from parents, teachers, and education specialists. He then attempted to implement a program where all English courses in middle and secondary schools would be taught in English only, which would require the government to educate many teachers in Korea and recruit university students studying abroad in English-speaking countries.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the direct costs of the tuition, some argue that mandatory Swedish effectively replaces elective courses in languages such as French, German and Russian, that these persons argue {{are more important than}} Swedish in a <b>globalized</b> <b>world.</b> University students are required not only to master their selected field, but also to study at least two languages beside their mother tongue, one of which is obligatorily Swedish for Finnish-speakers. As study material is often in English, this effectively removes the free choice; the two [...] "voluntarily chosen" [...] languages must be Swedish and English. Despite being a neighbour of Russia, it is in practice possible to study Russian only in some schools (due to low interest or it not being offered); only 1.5% of the Finns have a good knowledge of Russian. Also very few Finns speak Estonian (which is not taught in most schools), a language of the same Finnic language group as Finnish, and national language of Finland's southern neighbour Estonia, although Finnish is popular in Estonia.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in Mexico City, {{during the}} mid–1990s, whilst McOndo {{coalesced}} {{as a literary}} movement, [...] "La generación del crack" [...] (The Crack Generation — Jorge Volpi, Ignacio Padilla, Eloy Urroz, Pedro Ángel Palou, and Ricardo Chávez-Castañeda) presented Mexican realist literature flouting the Magical Realism strictures of the Latin American Boom; their ideologic advocacy emphasised that every writer find a voice, not a genre. Their initial publication was the Manifiesto Crack (Crack Manifesto, 1996) published a month earlier than the McOndo (1996) short-story anthology; the literary manifestos proved ideologically sympathetic. Nonetheless, despite shared ideologic antipathy to Magical Realism, McOndo and The Crack Movement were unalike; Edmundo Paz-Soldán observed that McOndo is [...] "a moment in {{the celebration of the}} creative mixture of high- and popular- culture", whilst The Crack Movement has [...] "proposed a sort of élitist re-establishment of values." [...] Literary-world gossip postulates that the anti–magical militancy of McOndo and The Crack Movement derives more from commercial jealousy than from artistic divergence; nonetheless, the criticism might have been ideologically motivated by the international success that allowed magic realist fiction to establish the exotic Macondo as the universal image of Latin America; hence, who controls the novel market controls the cultural image of Latinoamérica that the <b>globalized</b> <b>world</b> perceives.|$|E
