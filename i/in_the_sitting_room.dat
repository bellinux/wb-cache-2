25|$|This {{example of}} Gothic Revival {{architecture}} is particularly noteworthy for its exterior trim details. Typically, the gable ends, at the edges, feature curvilinear (or gingerbread-type) vergeboards in residential Gothic Revival styled buildings. The Lake–Peterson House has simple pointed arches with ornamented pendants. The windows are also somewhat unusual in their variety. Three of the home's four sides have bay windows and other windows are topped by limestone hood molds. The windows themselves show differing forms as well, including the double-hung sash {{windows on the}} second floor and the diamond-paned windows with colored glass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{a legend}} in East Anglia about a ghostly black hound from hell that roams the coast and lonely lanes of Norfolk. The hound {{is the size of}} a small horse and appears from the depths of Beeston Bump with malevolent flaming red eyes. Anyone confronted by the Doom Dog will be dead within a year. Sometimes, Black Shuck has {{appeared}} headless and, at other times, he appears to float on a carpet of mist, rather than running. The Black Shuck often terrifies his victims out of their wits, although the apparition is said not to harm its victims. The legend was the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Conan Doyle had been on a golfing holiday at the nearby Links Hotel in West Runton, and it was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>room</b> of the hotel that his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, recounted the legend of the Black Hound from the Bump.|$|E

2500|$|The Simple Villa, a {{style of}} home built from around 1895, often appears {{in the form of}} {{structures}} larger than the cottages and Victorian style properties built prior to this time. [...] They generally consisted of a hallway with two rooms off each side and an indoor bathroom at the end. [...] Often a [...] "lean-to" [...] attached {{to the back of the}} house would allow for a storage area that might include a wash-house.

2500|$|The Doctor assembles the {{remaining}} guests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>room,</b> {{where he and}} Agatha reveal what they have discovered. Agatha exposes the Unicorn (the thief, but not the murderer) {{as one of the}} guests, Lady Robina Redmond, when she says [...] "toilet" [...] instead of the upper class saying [...] "loo" [...] and drops her posh accent for an East End one. Then the Doctor deduces that Lady Eddison's shutting herself away for months, years ago, allegedly due to malaria, was actually due to her becoming impregnated by another Vespiform while travelling in India in 1885. The Vespiform gave Lady Eddison the necklace before he died; unbeknownst to her, it links her telepathically with their child. The Doctor further reveals that the child, whom she gave up for adoption, is really Reverend Golightly. Recently, during a bout of anger and via the telepathic link, the Reverend had become aware of his alien nature and absorbed the details of the murder mystery his mother was reading at the time, Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. The details of the book prompted him to kill in a fashion inspired by it.|$|E
500|$|The Danebod Folk School {{was first}} built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 1888, but it {{burned to the}} ground on February25, 1917. It was soon rebuilt, and nine months later the current school {{building}} was completed. A three-story brick building, it has gable ends carried up as parapets. The four-story crenelated corner tower and the pointed arches at the entrance are from Gothic and native Danish architecture. The Folk School was renovated in 1946 and is now used by the Danebod Lutheran Church for camps and retreats, and as a meeting place for local groups and clubs. Points of interest are <b>the</b> hand-carved podium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lecture hall, the picture behind the podium, the hand-carved wooden cross on the podium, collection plates made by Dr.Thomsen, and also <b>the</b> statuary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lecture hall and <b>sitting</b> <b>rooms,</b> pictures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>rooms,</b> and <b>the</b> small podium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dining room. Early settlers of the colony founded a residential school <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Danish tradition of folk High Schools and fostered the concept of [...] "learning for living", by which individuals sought to become enlightened and thoughtful citizens. The Folk School Building stands as a testament to these values, and continues to serve as a place for fellowship and lifelong learning. Each dormitory style room is unique in plan and decoration. A large kitchen and dining area provide a perfect setting for group meals and activities. A lecture hall and several classrooms allow ample space for programming.|$|R

2500|$|It {{is set in}} a Grade II listed pink painted Georgian townhouse named Ivy House, in a small seaside town, {{and takes}} its name from the medieval Celtic sport of Cnapan, {{although}} there is little to connect the two today. Dated to the early 19th century, architecturally Ivy House, two-storeys with attic, is described as [...] "painted roughcast, with panelled doorcase and fanlight, the porch with the etiolated, debased classical columns popular all over the region". There are 3 bays on each floor at the front, with a French window on each floor on the western wing, where the restaurant is located. Next door is Sessions House, dated to 1900, but with a stucco front with windows in the late 18th-century style. As of 2001 it had 5 double rooms, a bar, and a restaurant; it is the restaurant for which it has earned its reputation. The interior consists of traditional Welsh oak furnishings. In the hallway is a traditional heavy oak Welsh dresser which contains items belonging to the owners. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>room</b> is a wood-burning stove and books and magazines, and in the dining room is a large stone fireplace, with pictures and pieces of armour on the walls and lace-covered tables. The bedrooms are small, with pine furniture and bright hues, with a [...] "tiny shower". The hotel has been run by the Coopers since 1984; Judith Cooper and her daughter are the chief cooks.

This study included 48 consecutive patients (mean age 25 +/- 6 years) who had a third molar removed surgically under local anaesthesia. The heart rate was monitored continuously during treatment as a measure of anxiety. Preoperative anxiety was scored with the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale. Each patient's anxiety level was assessed when <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waiting <b>room,</b> <b>sitting</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dental chair, during the application of local anaesthesia, application of surgical drapes, time-out procedure, incision, alveolotomy, removal of the third molar, and suturing, and at the end of the procedure.
