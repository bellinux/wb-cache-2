500|$|Contemporary chroniclers of {{the events}} in the revolt have formed an {{important}} source for historians. The chroniclers were biased against the rebel cause and typically portrayed the rebels, {{in the words of the}} historian Susan Crane, as [...] "beasts, monstrosities or misguided fools". London chroniclers were also unwilling to admit the role of ordinary Londoners in the revolt, preferring to place the blame entirely on rural peasants from the south-east. Among the <b>key</b> <b>accounts</b> was the anonymous Anonimalle Chronicle, whose author appears to have been part of the royal court and an eye-witness to many {{of the events}} in London. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham was present for much of the revolt, but focused his account on the terror of the social unrest and was extremely biased against the rebels. The events were recorded in France by Jean Froissart, the author of the Chronicles. He had well-placed sources close to the revolt, but was inclined to elaborate the known facts with colourful stories. No sympathetic accounts of the rebels survive.|$|E

40|$|Although {{strategic}} planning {{has been part}} of the management function for as long as anyone can remember, the emergence of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> plans as a critical subset of the marketing plan in business-to-business markets has not attracted much analysis. This gap needs to be addressed, as <b>key</b> <b>account</b> plans have their own unique complexities. Moreover, the importance of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> plans is increasing. There is a need for a more widespread understanding of the benefits of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> planning, encompassing both processes and outputs. Based on a four-phase research project in 78 international companies, this paper describes current best practice in <b>key</b> <b>account</b> planning.

40|$|Acting in a {{boundary}} spanning role within their organisations, the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager in representing their customers’ needs internally {{is required to}} manage {{a wide range of}} complex internal relationships. This can often lead to incidents of conflict between the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager and other individuals or groups of individuals within the organisation in non-sales functions. Using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), (Flanagan, 1954) together with an interpretive framework for data coding (Spiggle, 1994), this research investigates conflict and the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager’s internal selling role. This research also explores how the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager perceives intraorganisational, interpersonal conflicts and investigates the complex behavioural sequences adopted to manage them. In doing so this research addresses some of the shortcomings of the traditional view of the nature of organisational conflict and how it is managed while extending our understanding of the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager’s internal selling role. In contrast to the majority of research into personal selling, this research takes an interpretive approach through the analysis of transcripts from a series of CIT interviews with <b>key</b> <b>account</b> managers in the field. Twenty-nine <b>key</b> <b>account</b> managers from seven participating FMCG, Blue Chip organisations in the U. K. and U. S. participated in the research. From the CIT interviews conducted, 112 critical incidents were described with both positive and negative outcomes. This research provides further insight into the complexity of conflict, suggesting conflict is inherent within the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management internal selling role, that incidents of conflict do not occur in isolation, that these conflict episodes are complex, having multiple components and that a combination of behaviours can be used in their management. In addressing these issues in the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management context, this research further develops our knowledge of personal selling and the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager’s internal selling role by providing an analysis of the recollections of how conflict is perceived and managed by the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> managers involved.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} different strategic roles of the sales manager in <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management. This thesis looks at the different strategic roles of the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management (KAM) {{from the perspective of}} the sales manager. Previous researches have mainly based on fact that sales manager responds to top-management, and <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager responds to sales manager. Sales manager is typically seen as <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager’s direct superior and at the same time, sales manager is responsible for <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager’s performance to the top-management. According Flaherty and others (2012) sales literature follows a top-down approach and based on sales management specific behaviors to improve poor performance. Nevertheless, today’s research has had more nuances that sales manager’s and <b>key</b> <b>account</b> managers job is more collaboration. Reality of today’s sales manager role have changed from top-down, leader-centered paradigm to more like collaboration which comes a vast network of complex relationships (Flaherty and others 2012). This thesis tries to show that sales manager’s role is not only to be <b>key</b> <b>account</b> managers superior. <b>Key</b> <b>account</b> manager’s and sales manager’s dynamic relationship is unnerved in previous researches. Actually, <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager and sales manager has intense interaction and the information flows one to another and also they both effect on each other’s performance. Sales manager and <b>key</b> <b>account</b> manager, as a conclusion, can be seen as team more than monitored — supervisor partners. According Flaherty and others (2012) reality of today’s sales manager role have changed from top-down, leader- centered paradigm to more like collaboration which comes a vast network of complex relationships. The findings from the interview shows the same; all the interviewees said that nowadays sales managers should collaborate with KAMs. Still, there are seen the effect of regulations, rules and laws which change the style of leadership. Also sales manager take part on operative work. The previous academic literature stated that sales manager position is like invisible. That means sales manager won’t take part that much on operative work. In every interview the result was that operative work with customers is one part of every sales manager job in practice. Motivating KAMs to perform better is important. In a sales oriented organizations everybody knows how much the expected sales target are for KAM’s and at the same time sales manager need to provide all the needed rules that KAM’s could achieve those sales targets. Also this thesis finds out that organizational culture could effect on sales manager’s performance. It could create boundaries between sales manager and KAM but also it could provide framework which help everyday operations in the organization...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - <b>Key</b> <b>account</b> {{management}} is a supplier company initiated relational approach {{that has received}} great attention from both academics and practitioners manifested in the business-to-business relationship literatures. However, there is widespread debate and contention on {{what should be the}} underlying theoretical base for defining this vital part of relationship marketing. With the insights from the social exchange theory, present paper explores how social exchange affects the dynamic nature of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management relationship at the organizational level. Research design, data, and methodology - The paper follows a comprehensive review approach {{to examine the relationship between}} social exchange theory and <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management approach. Conceptual arguments and findings are assessed across studies with the main objective of showing how social exchange theory develops the governance mechanism in maintaining the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> relationship. Results - Since relational norm is considered as a glue for the maintenance of buyer-seller relationship in social exchange theory, factors develop the non-contractual governance mechanism ‘relationship’ in business-to-business relationship and this norm replaces or supplements more formal governance mechanisms such as contracts are explored. Conclusions - This paper advances central relational norm to manage the company’s most important key customers and demonstrates how this norm can be developed in buyer-seller <b>key</b> <b>account</b> relationship. Implications from this new perspective are forwarded...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> {{management}} theme. The traditional view of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management takes its roots in company practice, and considers <b>key</b> customer <b>accounts</b> to be large complex customers, with high financial returns- hence the notion of “key ”- for the supplier firm. The role of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management {{is considered to be}} that of understanding the characteristics and needs of these key customers, then adapting the supplier organization to better serve them, with a view to optimizing on revenues. The nature and value of relationships with key customers per se receives very little attention. The nature and value of networks of relationships influencing these relationships with <b>key</b> customer <b>accounts</b> is given even less consideration. Also, very little consideration is given to the strategic company setting in which these <b>key</b> customer <b>accounts</b> are managed. Taking these factors into account, the end result is complexity which goes beyond the simple issue of the customer’s organizational characteristics. The purpose of the thesis is to identify indicators of the strategic importance of customers to supplier, to characterise <b>key</b> customer <b>accounts,</b> and to analyse the appropriate managerial response to problems in handling such customers. The empirical base used in the thesis consists of five papers with focus on important supplier-customer relationships.
