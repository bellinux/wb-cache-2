The new questionnaire included a more comprehensive set of questions about seven basic issues relating to the TSA to identify the degree and methods of implementation of the recommended framework at different levels such as the following: The conceptual level. Are the concepts used by countries identical in practice to those recommended by the interna-tional frameworks regarding tourism statistics? 2 This relates principally to the <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of visitors covered, that is, of tourism as such.

40|$|Measuring {{process safety}} {{performance}} is a challenge, {{and the wide}} variations in understanding, compliance, and implementation of process safety programs increase the challenge. Process safety {{can be measured in}} three strata: (1) measurement of process safety elements within facilities; (2) benchmarking of process safety elements among facilities; and (3) use of incident data collection from various sources for industrial safety performance assessment. The methods presently available for measurement of process safety within facilities are deficient because the results are strongly dependent on user judgment. Performance benchmarking among facilities is done within closed groups of organizations. Neither the questionnaires nor the results are available to the public. Many organizations collect data on industrial incidents.

El objetivo de esto es conocer y manejarlas con el fin de determinar cuál es la más apropiada para el sector BPO colombiano. Por medio de la contextualización acerca de la definición de Outsourcing, BPO y KPO, se analizaran los diferentes tipos, sus respectivas definiciones y diferencias. La finalidad de esta etapa es conocer y concluir cuales serían los posibles niveles de servicio a los que Colombia podría competir mundialmente. Para poder analizar cuál es el mejor modelo de internacionalización es necesario el análisis a nivel Colombia, en términos de costos de operación, capacidad del recurso humano, infraestructura e inversión. Lo importante de todo este análisis es determinar cuál es el nivel de Colombia, definiendo el estado del sector, detectando ventajas comparativas y posibles puntos que sean claves para determinar el modelo de internacionalización. In this document, we {{will analyze}} {{which are the}} {{theories}} of internationalization {{that have been developed}} so far.

40|$|Teague v. Lane marked, in {{the eyes}} of many, an attempt by the United States Supreme Court to judicially limit the scope of federal habeas corpus review. In Teague, a {{plurality}} of the Court held that new rules of criminal procedure do not apply retroactively to cases which have already become final on direct review at the time the new rule is decided. Thus, in most cases, a petitioner in collateral proceedings will not receive the benefit of any new rules decided after his conviction is affirmed on direct appeal and the United States Supreme Court denies certiorari. Moreover, a plurality of the Court endorsed an approach to retroactivity analysis which would treat retroactivity determinations as a 2 ̆ 2 threshold 2 ̆ 2 matter. Under this approach, a court would first decide whether the rule required to grant a petitioner relief applied retroactively. Only after a court decided that such a rule would apply retroactively would it determine whether the Constitution required such a rule. A plurality of the Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice O 2 ̆ 7 Connor, concluded that 2 ̆ 2 the question of whether a decision [announcing a new rule of law should] be given prospective or retroactive effect should be faced at the time of [that] decision. 2 ̆ 2 The Court stated that the retroactivity of any decision is 2 ̆ 2 properly treated as a threshold question. 2 ̆ 2 The plurality reasoned that retroactivity should be treated as a threshold issue because 2 ̆ 2 once a new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, even-handed justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated. 2 ̆ 2 Therefore, the plurality concluded that the more principled way to handle the question of retroactivity was for the Court to 2 ̆ 2 simply refuse to announce a new rule in a given case unless the rule would be applied retroactively to the defendant in the case and to all others similarly situated. 2 ̆ 2 In sum, the Court stated, “Unless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced. ” In Penry v. Lynaugh a majority of the Court extended the Teague retroactivity doctrine to capital proceedings. Teague leaves 2 ̆ 2 much of the [nonretroactivity] restriction 2 ̆ 7 s content in doubt. 2 ̆ 2 In particular, Teague leaves the following five questions unanswered: (1) What is the status of retroactivity as a 2 ̆ 2 threshold question? 2 ̆ 2 (2) What, precisely, is the scope of a 2 ̆ 2 new rule? 2 ̆ 2 (3) What are the <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of the two exceptions to the general rule of nonretroactivity? (4) Who will bear the burden of both raising and proving the defense of nonretroactivity? and (5) Will the Teague rule apply to the advantage of a petitioner when a 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 constitutional norm constricts available relief? In this Article, each of these areas will be addressed in turn...|$|E

40|$|X, 221 p. ill. Op basis van een voorzichtige schatting zou ongeveer 1 % van de Belgische bevolking te kampen hebben met een ernstige, langdurige mentale aandoening. Het gaat om mensen die lijden aan schizofrenie, bipolaire stoornissen (ook manisch-depressieve stoornissen genoemd), steeds terugkomende ernstige depressies of persoonlijkheidsstoornissen. In België ligt de nadruk bij de zorg nog sterk op de opname in een psychiatrische instelling, hoewel er al andere begeleidingsmogelijkheden bestaan. Het Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg (KCE) pleit ervoor om deze mensen nog meer in de maatschappij te re-integreren, door zorg dichtbij of in de eigen leefomgeving te geven. Een multidisciplinair team, bestaande uit o. a. een psychiater, een psychiatrisch verpleegkundige, een sociaal assistent enz., zou in een aantal gevallen de zorg moeten coördineren. Verder is meer samenwerking tussen het federale en de regionale en gemeenschapsniveaus noodzakelijk. 1 INTRODUCTION AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS 5 [...] 2 GENERAL BACKGROUND: <b>DEFINITIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SCOPE</b> OF THE STUDY 7 [...] 2. 1 CHRONIC AND COMPLEX MENTAL DISORDERS: <b>DEFINITIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SCOPE</b> OF THE [...] STUDY 7 [...] 2. 1. 1 Definition: Mental {{disorder}} 7 [...] 2. 1. 2 Definition: Chronic or severe and persistent {{mental disorders}} 8 [...] 2. 1. 3 Additional {{limitations of the}} scope of this study 8 [...] 2. 2 ORGANISATIONAL FORMS OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE: <b>DEFINITIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SCOPE</b> OF THE [...] STUDY 9 [...] 2. 2. 1 Introduction 9 [...] 2. 2. 2 Definition: Mental health service 9 [...] 2. 2. 3 Typology of mental health services 9 [...] 2. 2. 4 Additional limitations {{of the scope of}} this study 12 [...] 2. 3 OUTCOME EVALUATION: GENERAL PERSPECTIVE 12 [...] 2. 4 EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AND HEALTH CARE POLICY 13 [...] 3 LITERATURE REVIEW: METHODOLOGY 18 [...] 3. 1 INTRODUCTION 18 [...] 3. 1. 1 European Service Mapping Schedule (ESMS) 18 [...] 3. 1. 2 Types of study to be included 18 [...] 3. 2 SEARCH STRATEGY, IN- AND EXCLUSIONCRITERIA 18 [...] 3. 2. 1 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CRD Database (CRD-reports, DARE, [...] HTA) 18 [...] 3. 2. 2 Medline (Ovid), PsycInfo, Embase. 19 [...] 4 LITERATURE REVIEW: RESULTS 21 [...] 4. 1 DEFINITIONS 21 [...] 4. 2 MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, RESIDENTIAL, NON-HOSPITAL 28 [...] 4. 2. 1 Mental Health Services, Residential, Acute, Non-hospital. 28 [...] 4. 2. 2 Mental Health Services, Residential, Non-acute, Non-hospital, Indefinite stay (Daily [...] support, 24 h-support, Lower than daily support). 29 [...] 4. 2. 3 Mental Health Services, Residential, Non-acute, Non-hospital, Time limited stay. 32 [...] 4. 3 MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, OUT-PATIENT AND COMMUNITY 33 [...] 4. 3. 1 Mental Health Services, Out-patient and community, Emergency care (mobile/ nonmobile).

40|$|The EU has {{recently}} put forward an integrated proposal for "Climate Action ¿ Energy for a Changing World", which includes concrete measures {{on how to}} meet the 'energy and climate change package' targets of 2020. The challenge is how these targets can be reached, and how bioenergy can meet the expectations given to it. The EU Biomass Action Plan (BAP) emphasises {{the need for a}} coordinated approach to biomass policy and encourages Member States to establish national Biomass Action Plans (nBAPs), as they are seen as one of the key actions to boost the bioenergy market. This paper presents the drivers, process and the current state of nBAPs <b>and</b> discusses their <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope.</b> Four national BAPs (of Estonia, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK) are compared to yield understanding on the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of these plans. Two regional biomass action plans are also looked into (Scotland and Central Finland) to provide insight of the regional bioenergy strategy development. It can be concluded that common elements are found in the plans; however a holistic and integrated approach with a long-term view on biomass use is still largely missing. JRC.

25|$|Henry Saint Clair Fredericks (born May 17, 1942), {{who uses}} the stage name Taj Mahal, is an American blues musician. He often {{incorporates}} elements of world music into his works.

40|$|Abstract. Cloud {{computing}} {{is a new}} terminology {{that was}} added to IT jargon in early 2007. Still, people overuse this idiom to refer to things that may not relate to its actual <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope.</b> Is it all about web hosting? Is it an old thing in new clothes? Why should organizations consider it? IT, business, and academia folks ask about cloud computing {{with the intent to}} understand it better. This paper tries to demystify cloud computing by simplifying its terms to readers with different IT interests...|$|R
