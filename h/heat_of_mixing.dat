40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Heat {{generation}} {{is a major}} safety concern {{in the design and}} development of Li ion batteries (LIBs) for large scale applications, such as electric vehicles. The total heat generation in LIBs includes entropic heat, enthalpy, reaction heat, and <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing.</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the influence of <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> on the LIBs and to understand whether it is necessary to consider the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> during the design and development of LIBs. In the previous research, Thomas and Newman derived methods to compute <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in LIB cells. Their results show that the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> cannot be neglected in comparison with the other heat sources at 2 C rate. In this study, the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in different materials, porosity, particle sizes, and charging/discharging rate was investigated. A COMSOL mathematical model was built to simulate the heat generation of LIBs. The LIB model was based on Newman’s model. LiMn 2 O 4 and LiCoO 2 were applied as the cathode materials, and LiC 6 was applied as the anode material. The results of <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> were compared with the other heat sources to investigate the weight of <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in the total heat generation. The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in cathode is smaller than the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in anode, because of the diffusivity of LiCoO 2 is 1 × 10 - 13 m 2 /s, which is larger than LiC 6 's diffusivity 2. 52 × 10 - 14 m 2 /s. In the comparison, the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> is not as much as the irreversible heat and reversible heat, but it still cannot be neglected. Finally, a special situation will be discussed, which is the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> under the relaxation status. For instance, after the drivers turn off their vehicles, the entropy, ix enthalpy and reaction heat in LIBs will stop generating, but the heat will still be generated due to the release of <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing.</b> Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate to see if this process has significant influence on the safety and cycle life of LIBs.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model, which incorporates <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in {{the energy}} balance, has been developed to analyze the morphological stability of a planar solid-liquid interface during the directional solidification of a binary alloy. It is observed that the stability behavior is almost that predicted by the analysis of Mullins and Sekerka (1963) at low growth velocities, while deviations in the critical concentration of about 20 - 25 percent are observed under rapid solidification conditions for certain systems.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{have been}} used to obtain the three-dimensional distribution of interfacial mixing and cascade defects in Ti/Pt multilayer system due to single 1 keV $Ar^+$ impacts at grazing angle of incidence. The Ti/Pt system was chosen because of its relatively high <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in the binary alloy and therefore a suitable candidate for testing the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> on ion-beam mixing. However, the calculated mixing profile is not sensitive to the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixing.</b> Therefore the thermal spike model of mixing is not fully supported under these irradiation conditions. Instead we found that the majority of mixing occurs after the thermal spike during the relaxation process. These conclusions are supported by liquid, vacancy as well as adatom analysis. The interfacial mixing is in various aspects anomalous in this system: the time evolution of mixing is leading to a phase delay for Ti mixing, and Pt exhibits an unexpected double peaked mixing evolution. The reasons to these effects are discussed. Comment: 7 pages, 12 figures, Nucl. Instr. Meth. B 211, 524. (2003...|$|E
40|$|The “extremely diluted solutions” (EDS) have {{revealed}} a really intriguing behaviour, characterized by multiple independent variables.

We conducted thermodynamic and transport measurements of the solutions and of the interaction of those solutions with acids or bases. The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain information about the influence of successive dilutions and succussions on the water structure of the solutions under study.
