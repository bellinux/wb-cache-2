5|$|On October 30, 1970, {{less than}} two months after introduction, 26,000 Pintos were {{recalled}} to address a possible problem with the accelerator sticking on once engaged at more than halfway. On March 29, 1971, Ford recalled 220,000 Pintos, all Pintos manufactured prior to March 19, 1971, to address a possible problem with fuel vapors in the <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> filter igniting by a backfire through the carburetor.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E

Featuring the base Barra 182 six-cylinder <b>engine,</b> <b>air</b> conditioning, front power windows, and five-speed manual transmission, with {{the choice of a}} four-speed automatic, the XT was sold in sedan and station wagon body types. The Barra 220 V8 engine was available as an option. Judges of the Australia's Best Cars awards crowned the XT Best Family Car in 2002, and again in 2004, with the Futura receiving the award in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E

In these <b>engines,</b> <b>air</b> compressor cylinders were coupled to the moving pistons, often in a multi-stage configuration.

40|$|An 0. 8 percent fuel savings was {{achieved}} by a reduction in <b>engine</b> bleed <b>air</b> {{through the use of}} cabin air recirculation.

25|$|In {{supersonic}} aerodynamics, unstart {{refers to}} a generally violent breakdown of the supersonic airflow. The phenomenon occurs when mass flow rate changes significantly within a duct.

25|$|With {{turbocharged}} engines, the oil seals on the turbocharger may fail, allowing {{lubricating oil}} into the combustion chamber, where it is burned like regular diesel fuel. In vehicles or installations that use diesel engines and also bottled gas, a gas leak into the engine room could also provide fuel for a runaway, via the <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> intake.|$|E
25|$|The XT-37 was aerodynamically clean, {{so much so}} that a speedbrake {{was fitted}} behind the {{nosewheel}} doors to help increase drag for landing and for use in other phases of flight. Since the short landing gear placed the <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> intakes close to the ground, screens pivoted over the intakes from underneath when the landing gear was extended, to prevent foreign object damage.|$|E

25|$|In December 2014, {{the first}} {{production}} EC135 T3 formally entered service with Aiut Alpin Dolomites, a mountain rescue operator based in Italy. In June 2015, Airbus Helicopters delivered the first retrofitted H135 {{from the earlier}} EC135 standard; changes include an enlarged main rotor, relocated <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> intakes, elevated engine performance, and the horizontal stabiliser's endplates removed and its span increased. In May 2016, the French Defense Procurement Agency awarded Airbus Helicopters a contract to retrofit 35 EC135 used by the Sécurité Civile with the newer avionics.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets {{incrementally}} upgraded the T-34. The Model 1942 featured increased armour and many simplified components. The Model 1943 (confusingly also introduced in 1942) had yet more armour, {{as well as}} increased fuel capacity and more ammunition storage. Also added were an improved <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> filter and a new clutch mated to an improved and more reliable five-speed transmission. Finally, the Model 1943 also had a new, slightly roomier (but still two-man) turret of a distinctive hexagonal shape that was easier to manufacture, derived from the abandoned T-34M project.|$|E
25|$|The IAI Lavi was a single-seat, {{single-engine}} multirole fighter aircraft, principally {{designed to}} conduct high-speed penetration and first-pass bombing missions {{while maintaining a}} high level of manoeuvrability and survivability. It bore considerable similarities in terms of external appearance to the American F-16 fighter, having a similar configuration and several shared design features while being a slightly smaller aircraft. The <b>engine</b> <b>air</b> intake took the form of a plain chin type scoop with a splitter plate, externally resembling that of the F-16, yet internally it was substantially different, not exposing the engine compressor stage forwards (inverse S-duct), thus drastically minimizing the frontal cross-sections of IR and radar alike. In comparison to the F-16, the Lavi was furnished with a less powerful engine and a consequently lower thrust-to-weight ratio.|$|E
