40|$|While {{there is}} an {{impressive}} body of empirical evidence that <b>homografts</b> placed in the highly vascular walls, i. e. the skin, of the hamster's cheek pouch constitute provocative exceptions to the rule that transplantation of genetically alien tissue is followed by rejection (1), the physiological basis of the immunologically privileged status of the cheek pouch as a graft site awaits clarification. Besides demonstrating that intact pouches consistently protect implanted <b>homografts</b> of trunk skin from rejection for long periods, Billingham and Silvers (2, 3) noted that pouch skin behaved as an immunologically privileged tissue when transplanted to the trunks of homologous hosts. It significantly outlived <b>homografts</b> of ordinary skin. Furthermore, they found that even when cheek pouch skin was transposed to a hamster's trunk, it retained its capacity to protect small <b>homografts</b> of ordinary skin, if these were inlaid in shallow beds prepared in its center.

40|$|Hamster {{cheek pouch}} skin, transplanted {{to the side}} of an {{isogenic}} host's chest wall, retains its immunologically privileged status as evidenced by the prolonged survival of inlaid <b>homografts</b> of ordinary skin. Various findings sustain the premise that exemption from rejection by otherwise susceptible <b>homografts</b> in both intact pouch tissue and in established pouch skin isografts is due to an impediment in the afferent pathway of the immunologic reflex, i. e., to deficient lymphatic drainage. Although lymphatics were not apparent when dye was injected into pouch skin grafts or into grafts of ordinary skin sustained by them, lymph vessels were readily and consistently revealed by dye injected into intact trunk skin or established isografts of trunk skin. When suspensions of viable lymph node cells from specifically sensitized parental strain donors were injected superficially into either the intact skin or established grafts of normal skin on F 1 hybrid hamsters, a striking hypertrophy of the regional lymph nodes occurred, due to graft-versus-host reactivity. However, similar cell suspensions inoculated into intact pouch tissue or into pouch skin grafts on F 1 hamsters incited no regional lymphadenopathy, indicating the lack of appropriate pathways to the nodes. When skin <b>homografts</b> were inlaid eccentrically into pouch skin isografts, so that they were in contact with host skin at one edge, rejection occurred. Furthermore, rejection of long-established intrapouch skin <b>homografts</b> resulted if the hosts received: (a) small <b>homografts</b> of ordinary skin transplanted to conventional beds; (b) suspensions of donor strain pouch skin epidermal cells, injected intracutaneously; (c) lymph node cells from specifically sensitized donors of the same strain, i. e. adoptive immunization; or, (d) if a portion of the target <b>homograft's</b> perimeter was surgically approximated to body skin. Treatment of normal hamsters with two closely spaced pulses of ALS, although only marginally effective in prolonging the lives of <b>homografts</b> of trunk skin, enabled pouch skin <b>homografts</b> to survive for very long periods. The influence of this brief treatment with immunosuppressant was still demonstrable if challenge of hosts with the weakly immunogenic pouch skin <b>homografts</b> was delayed for 100 days...|$|R

Nevertheless antibodies against the foreign tissue have been repeatedly demonstrated in the serum of mice in which <b>homografts</b> have regressed. Gorer (5 - 7) has shown that erythrocytes which share antigens in common with a regressed tumor are agglutinated by antibody in the serum, and similar hemagglutinins have been recently reported after sloughing of skin <b>homografts</b> (8). Corer (9) working with leukemic cells, and Billingham and Sparrow (10) working with skin epithelial cells, have also shown that serum antibody can combine with these ceils in vitro and inhibit their growth on subsequent transplantation into susceptible hosts.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{objections}} to the Ross procedure is the genesis of pulmonary valve disease in addition to aortic valve disease.

40|$|Studies on {{transplantation}} immunity {{have usually}} involved various model systems, based on either skin or renal <b>homografts.</b> While {{it is probable}} that a common immunological mechanism underlies the rejection of all foreign grafts, the manifestations of the rejection process may differ according to the nature and function of the transplanted organ. There is, in fact, some evidence in the literature which suggests that solid organ grafts are rejected in a different way from skin grafts. In the case of skin <b>homografts,</b> it seems certain that an intact lymphatic drainage from the graft is crucial for sensitization of the host to occur. In areas such as the anterior chamber of the eye, the central nervous system, and the hamster cheek pouch, where there is no conventional lymphatic drainage, <b>homografts</b> can be installed and will grow with impunity (1). Barker and Billingham (2) showed in experiments with guinea pigs, that for host sensitization to occur against orthotopically placed skin grafts, an intact lymphatic drainage had to be present. These findings added further weight to the results of experiments which showed that the temporary disruption of the lymphatic drainage from skin <b>homografts</b> prolonged their survival (3 - 5) ...|$|R
