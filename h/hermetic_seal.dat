500|$|Specimen AMNH NJ-90Z {{is a small}} {{wedge-shaped}} {{fragment of}} pileus which was accidentally fractured during preparation for study, splitting it in half. Though the researchers had not intended to perform destructive analysis on the sample, this fracturing warranted the sacrifice of {{some parts of the}} specimen for structural and molecular study. [...] Small pieces of the specimen were mounted directly on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) stubs and sputter coated with a gold/palladium alloy. [...] The resulting images showed that little intact tissue remained, and only fragmented and crushed basidiospores were seen. [...] Another sample of the specimen was mounted in spurr's resin (an embedding medium used in electron microscopy) and sectioned with a diamond knife; the resulting sections were examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). [...] The lack of discernible biological material from the mushroom seen in the SEM study was confirmed in the TEM analysis. [...] A final section of the fossil was selected to attempt DNA sequencing. [...] A small sample of the fossil was extracted at the AMNH and sent to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology for DNA amplification. [...] None of the three selected extracts showed any results after the amplification was attempted. [...] It is possible that the fractures and flowlines which split AMNH NJ-90Z during initial preparation had already penetrated into the fossil and destroyed the <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> which would have been needed for preserving the organic matter of the mushroom.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{epoxy resins}} and their {{processes}} {{can create a}} hermetic bond to copper, brass, or epoxy itself with similar coefficients of thermal expansion and {{are used in the}} manufacture of hermetic electrical and fiber optic hermetic seals. Epoxy <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> designs can be used in <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> applications for low or high vacuum or pressures, effectively sealing gases or fluids including helium gas to very low Helium gas leak rates similar to glass or ceramic. Hermetic epoxy seals also offer the design flexibility of sealing either copper alloy wires or pins, instead of the much less electrically conductive Kovar pin materials required in glass or ceramic hermetic seals.Epoxy <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> has a more limited operating temperature range compared to glass or ceramic seals with an operating range of typically -70C to +125C or 150C, though some hermetic epoxy designs are capable of 200C.|$|E

50|$|A <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> is {{the quality}} of something—a container, structure, etc.—being {{airtight}} (excluding passage of air, oxygen, or other gases). Used technically, it is stated in conjunction with a specific test method and conditions of use.|$|E
40|$|Resin {{systems for}} coating hybrids prior to <b>hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> are described. The resin systems are a {{flexible}} silicone junction resin {{system and a}} flexible cycloaliphatic epoxy resin system. The coatings are intended for application to the hybrid after all the chips have been assembled and wire bonded, but prior to <b>hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> of the package. The purpose of the coating is to control particulate contamination by immobilizing particles and by passivating the hybrid. Recommended process controls {{for the purpose of}} minimizing contamination in hybrid microcircuit packages are given. Emphasis is placed on those critical hybrid processing steps in which contamination is most likely to occur...|$|R
50|$|Applications for <b>hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> include {{semiconductor}} electronics, thermostats, optical devices, MEMS, and switches.

40|$|Fiber Sensors {{are poised}} {{to be used in}} future LEPs. The three primary {{vehicles}} for fiber sensors are Department 1, Joint Test Assembly (JTA), and Shelf Life (SL). The National Security Enterprise (NSE) community plans to incorporate optical sensors or systems into these vehicles. Additionally, <b>hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> of optical systems is required if optical technology is to be integrated into LEP and future weapons applications. <b>Hermetic</b> <b>seals</b> will reduce the long-term risk of contamination which can degrade or incapacitate optical components. This study was funded through the Kansas City Plant&#x 27;s (KCP) ESC work package between 2007 and 2009 to develop optical sensors, identify commercial fiber sensors and hermetic connectors, and qualify these sensors against likely weapon lifetime environments...|$|R

50|$|Nitrogen gas (N2) at {{concentrations}} of 98% or higher {{is also used}} effectively to kill insects in the grain through hypoxia. However, carbon dioxide has an advantage in this respect, as it kills organisms through hypercarbia and hypoxia (depending on concentration), but it requires {{concentrations of}} above 35%, or so. This makes carbon dioxide preferable for fumigation in situations where a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> cannot be maintained.|$|E
50|$|After {{several years}} as a trading officer and {{inspector}} in various manufacturing shops, he became engaged in foreign trade, especially consignment shipments of fish to England. During 1882, Bjelland founded an export business. The initial focus of the business was established in fresh salmon, trout and halibut. In 1889 Chr. Bjelland started processing anchovies in a tin can. In 1893 {{he picked up the}} production of sardines packed with a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ferrofluidic is {{the brand}} name of a staged {{magnetic}} liquid rotary sealing mechanism made by the Ferrotec Corporation and was first patented by the predecessor company's co-founder R.E.Rosensweig (USP 3,620,584). The seals {{are the most important}} commercialization of ferrofluids to date. The seals are used in rotating equipment to enable rotary motion while maintaining a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> by means of a physical barrier {{in the form of a}} ferrofluid. The ferrofluid is suspended in place by use of a permanent magnet.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{contacts}} of the reed switch are sealed {{away from the}} atmosphere, they are protected against atmospheric corrosion. The <b>hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> of a reed switch make them suitable for use in explosive atmospheres where tiny sparks from conventional switches would constitute a hazard.|$|R
50|$|Reactive bonding {{approach}} {{is used to}} assemble MEMS components including die attachment and the <b>hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> of micro-system packages.

In addition disposable microfluidic devices with sensing function and immobilized cells can be fabricated.|$|R
50|$|These {{transistors}} {{were the}} first to have both diffused bases and diffused emitters. Unfortunately, like all earlier transistors, the edge of the collector-base junction was exposed, making it sensitive to leakage through surface contamination, thus requiring <b>hermetic</b> <b>seals</b> or passivation to prevent degradation of the transistor's characteristics over time.|$|R
50|$|Metal, {{and some}} hard plastic valve caps have a rubber-washer seal (or a synthetic-rubber-washer seal) inside {{to help make}} a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> (airtight seal). The cap helps prevent air from {{escaping}} from a slightly leaking valve. In addition, the rubber washer prevents the cap from loosening and falling off due to vibrations and hence being lost, by acting as a cushion between the cap and the valve stem {{and in this way}} damping the vibrations, though most caps are a softer plastic making the need for a separate seal unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Vino-Seal is a plastic/glass closure {{released}} by Alcoa. Since its introduction into the European market in 2003, over 300 wineries have utilized Vino-Seal. Using a glass stopper with an inert o-ring, the Vino-Seal creates a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> that prevents oxidation and TCA contamination. A disadvantage with the Vino-Seal is {{the relatively high}} cost of each plug (70 cents each) and cost of manual bottling {{due to the lack}} of compatible bottling equipment outside of Europe. Vinolok is a glass stopper developed and produced by a Czech crystal glass producer Preciosa.|$|E
50|$|The {{seaming head}} then engages the second {{operation}} roller against the partly formed seam. The second operation presses all five steel components together tightly {{to form the}} final seal. The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) Body Hook, c) Cover Hook, d) Body, e) Countersink. All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal.</b> In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.|$|E
40|$|A {{laser diode}} {{collimator}} objective {{was developed in}} support of the Direct Detection Transceiver program. Close attention to optomechanical design issues including athermalization, alignment, selection of materials, mounting of elements, and <b>hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> of the assembly was necessary to insure that the desired optical performance was maintained in space deployment...|$|R
5000|$|Packaging: The {{permeability}} of {{the package}} (materials, seals, closures, etc.) needs to be matched with the sensitivity {{of the package}} contents and the specified shelf life. Some packages must have nearly <b>hermetic</b> <b>seals</b> while others can (and sometimes must) be selectively permeable. Knowledge about the exact permeation rates is therefore essential.|$|R
50|$|The case is {{used with}} {{high-power}} and high-current devices, {{on the order}} of a few tens of amperes current and up to a hundred watts of heat dissipation. The case surfaces are metal for good heat conductivity and durability. The metal-to-metal and metal-to-glass joints provide <b>hermetic</b> <b>seals</b> that protect the semiconductor from liquids and gases.|$|R
50|$|When {{the volume}} of a chamber of either type of pump is {{increased}} (the diaphragm moving up), the pressure decreases, and fluid is drawn into the chamber. When the chamber pressure later increases from decreased volume (the diaphragm moving down), the fluid previously drawn in is forced out. Finally, the diaphragm moving up once again draws fluid into the chamber, completing the cycle. This action {{is similar to that}} of the cylinder in an internal combustion engine. Diaphragm Pumps deliver a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> between the drive mechanism and the compression chamber, allowing the pump to transfer, compress, and evacuate the medium without a lubricant.|$|E
50|$|The cooling of the {{contents}} creates a vacuum in the head space, pulling the lid into tight contact with the jar rim to create a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal.</b> Once cooled, the band is removed to prevent residual water between the jar threads and the lid from rusting the band. If the jar seal is properly formed, internal vacuum will keep the lid tightly on the jar. Most metal lids used today are slightly domed {{to serve as a}} seal status indicator. The vacuum in a properly sealed mason jar pulls the lid down to create a concave-shaped dome. An improper or failed seal or microbial growth will cause the dome to pop upward.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} tool for large round bale handling is the bale spear or spike, {{which is usually}} mounted {{on the back of}} a tractor or the front of a skid-steer. It is inserted into the approximate center of the round bale, then lifted and the bale is hauled away. Once at the destination, the bale is set down, and the spear pulled out. Careful placement of the spear in the center is needed or the bale can spin around and touch the ground while in transport, causing a loss of control. When used for wrapped bales that are to be stored further, the spear makes a hole in the wrapping that must be sealed with plastic tape to maintain a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> for {{airtight}} {{conditions is}} used in archiving significant historical items. In 1951, The U.S. Constitution, U.S. Declaration of Independence, and U.S. Bill of Rights were hermetically sealed with helium gas in glass cases housed in the U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C.. In 2003, they were moved to new glass cases hermetically sealed with argon.|$|R
