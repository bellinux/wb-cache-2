A possibility of strengthening the professional {{element of the}} company was mooted in 1958, when a merger was proposed with the Carl Rosa Company, which was in financial difficulties.

5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans had <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> on many {{of their}} campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E

50|$|<b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> was {{the largest}} and most {{expensive}} experimental project in education funded by the U.S. federal government that has ever been conducted. The most extensive evaluation of <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> data covers the years 1968-1977; however, the program continued to receive funding from the government until 1995. <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> was originally intended to be an extension of the federal Head Start program, which delivered educational, health, and social services to typically disadvantaged preschool children and their families. The function of <b>Follow</b> <b>Through,</b> therefore, was to provide a continuation of these services to students in their early elementary years.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the papal}} plans were not {{supported}} by the other European monarchs, who had lost enthusiasm for the Crusades. Only one western monarch attended the Council, the elderly James I of Aragon, who could only offer a small force. There was fundraising for a new crusade, and plans were made, but never <b>followed</b> <b>through.</b> The projects essentially came to a halt with the death of Pope Gregory on , and the money which had been raised to finance the expedition was instead distributed in Italy.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} was more of a political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a freeway was {{proposed}} by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission to alleviate traffic on US 130 between Camden and Burlington. This freeway was originally planned as a parkway between the two cities in 1932 that never materialized. The proposed freeway, which was to connect the Ben Franklin Bridge to I-295 near the Assicunk Creek, was to cost $53 million and mostly follow a Conrail railroad line between the two cities. However, the NJDOT never <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> with the proposal. In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at the southern terminus of the US 30 concurrency was replaced with an at-grade intersection with jughandles.|$|E
40|$|The National <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> Program is {{a federally}} funded {{initiative}} {{to improve the quality}} of educational services for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This report discusses the implementation and outcomes of the program. In the first part of the paper, a history of the program iJ provided and the diversity of educational approaches in <b>Follow</b> <b>Through's</b> model programs, the gains in basic skills demonstrated by <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> students, and the dissemination of <b>Follow</b> <b>Through's</b> model programs are discussed. The second part considers three components of the <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> program. These are: (1) a holistic approach to instruction; (2) the development and use of research-based instructional programs and practic-s; and (3) effective educational delivery systems that stress sponsorship of local projects, staff development, and implementation of parent involvement activities. The third part, a conclusion, finds that the <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> program is clearly an important source of knowledge waiting to be tapped, and that its most important message may be that there is a critical need to forge a two-directional exchange, indicating the need for a link between research and schooling practice. <b>Follow</b> <b>through</b> has also identified ways of dealing with the evaluation of school improvement efforts, and corroborated findings in the literature on effective teaching and school effectiveness. A reference list of 62 items is included. An appendix lists overall goals and major design features of some widely implemented <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> model programs.

40|$|This {{evaluation}} {{research report}} {{looks at the}} changes in reading performance for the students in one rural school district from 1965 through 1980. During those years, the district moved from 28. 5 per cent of its second grade students at or above grade level to 88. 2 per cent at or above grade level. Similar gains are demonstrated in first and third grade. These gains are discussed in terms of: (I) phonics first, then basal reading instruction; (2) sponsorship; and monitoring and evaluation that resulted from the district's participation as a <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> site in the federally supported <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> Program.

The federal govern-ment selected 138 communities to become <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> sites, and 19 educational centers at universities. or corporations to become <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> sponsors.

5|$|That Chandler {{supported}} Robinson and {{the integration}} of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler {{had the power to}} void Robinson's contract, but he chose to approve it. Further, following extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the Philadelphia Phillies and their manager, Ben Chapman, Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race-based taunting. Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick's decision to indefinitely suspend any members of the St. Louis Cardinals who <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> on a threat to strike in protest of integration.|$|E

In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> with a demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader.

Keč allowed several of {{the passengers}} to use their mobile telephones, allowing {{one of them to}} communicate with the police and keep Sheriff Jan Bergen updated on the situation. Anti-terror police had been called to the scene, and there were plans to storm the aircraft if the situation escalated. After the incident, the police refused to say if they would have stormed the aircraft if Keč <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> his threats to depart to another airport. During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which the police confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{decided to}} reject the offer of the young Kansan (who <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> with the plan and was later killed), and {{that he needed to}} leave the Tonto Basin. Judge Aaron Hackney, editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt {{newspaper}} and a friend, helped him escape to Tombstone, Arizona with the assistance of Neil McLeod. He was a well-known prizefighter in Tombstone {{and one of the most}} successful smugglers along the Arizona–Mexico frontier. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts, it was an ideal location to hide out. Burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora, Mexico. From McLeod, he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection, passing coded messages, and throwing off pursuers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} two games of the season, Tech <b>{{followed}}</b> <b>through</b> on that promise, winning 3316 and 6321 against Bowling Green and Pittsburgh, respectively. A loss to No.3 Miami followed, but a victory over Maryland in the game that followed gave Tech a 31 record, already better than its 1992 win total. After a close loss at No.14 West Virginia that was determined by a missed last-second field goal by Tech placekicker Ryan Williams, the Hokies won five of their last six regular-season games. These wins included victories over Big East opponent Syracuse and No.23 , Tech's traditional rival. With an 83 regular-season record and ranked No.22 in the country by the Associated Press, Tech was extended an invitation to the Independence Bowl, its first bowl bid since the 1986 Peach Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1929, MSHD started {{updating}} the route that US23 <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> the Lower Peninsula. Late that year, the routing {{was moved to}} {{the east side of the}} Saginaw River, and M-47 was extended along the former course on the west side of the river. During 1930, a set of changes realigned the highway's route through the southeast corner of the state. Near Ida, US23 was rerouted along M-50 to Dundee and north through Milan to Ann Arbor, bypassing Maybee and Whittaker. US23 was moved from its inland routing between Omer and Tawas City via Whittemore to follow a shoreline alignment by way of Au Gres along Saginaw Bay around 1932; the former route through Twining and Whittemore became an extension of M-65 and the section from Whittemore east to Tawas City was added to M-55 as a part of these changes.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament now {{seems to have been}} contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, was asked if he would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E
5|$|Vermont {{returned}} to the Boston Navy Yard for repairs after the ceremonies at Hampton Roads concluded; the work lasted from 9 March to 23 June. She then rejoined the fleet off Provincetown; the 1st Division made a trip to Boston for the 4th of July celebration there. Starting on 7 July, the Atlantic Fleet conducted extensive maneuvers until 4 August. Vermont then took part in gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. Additional training exercises <b>followed</b> <b>through</b> {{the end of the}} year, interrupted only by visits to New York City and to Stamford, Connecticut, for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration and Columbus Day, respectively. In late December, she was back in New York City. Vermont then steamed south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which she reached on 12 January 1910. Two months of exercises there followed before gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. The ship was back in Boston on 29 April for repairs that lasted until mid-July. After returning to service, she took on a contingent of Naval Militia at Boston for a cruise to Provincetown from 22 to 31 July.|$|E
