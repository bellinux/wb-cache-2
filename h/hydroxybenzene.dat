The prompt HO(2) yields (HO(2) formed without preceding NO reactions) were determined by comparison to results obtained with CO as a reference compound. This approach was recently introduced and applied to the OH + benzene reaction and was extended here for a number of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

These compounds do not inhibit laccases. It appears that they affect a new target of the mosquito that is different from those of currently existing pesticides. Two anti-Alzheimer molecules, CP 2 and TP 70, discovered in our laboratory were studied for their pharmacokinetics and distribution. The distribution of CP 2 and TP 70 in mouse brain region and various tissues of mice were examined. HPLC analysis revealed that CP 2 treatment in primary neurons accumulates in mitochondria fraction. Similarly, the amount of CP 2 in the brain tissue from wild type and APP/PS 1 mice treated with 25 mg/kg/daily for 2 months also have the highest concentration in the mitochondria fractions in the hippocampus. The results show that CP 2 and TP 70 can penetrate the blood brain barrier and accumulate in the tissue in significant amounts. Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of compound TP 70 were determined.

The synthesized substituted phenols were found to be the substrates but not the inhibitors of laccase. An inverse correlation between the oxidation potential and the laccase oxidation efficiency of halogenated <b>hydroxybenzenes</b> and aminophenols was established. However, substituted di-tert-butylphenols were found to have anti-larval activities in mosquitoes resulting in the death of the larvae just before reaching pupation.

PQ compounds such as N-(3 -aminopropyl) - 6 -methoxy- 4 -methyl- 5 -(3 -(trifluormethyl) phenoxy) quinolin- 8 -amine (PQ 1), N-(furan- 2 -ylmethyl) - 6 -methoxy- 4 -methyl) - 5 -(3 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy) quinolin- 8 -amine (PQ 11), and 6 -methoxy- 4 -methyl-N-(quinolin- 4 -ylmethyl) - 5 -(3 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy) quinolin- 8 -amine (PQ 15) were found to inhibit PKC phosphorylation with IC 50 values of 35 nM, 42. 3 nM, and 216. 3 nM respectively, among which PQ 1 and PQ 11 were found to be potent PKC inhibitors as comparable to that of staurosporine (IC 50 = 33 nM). In chapter three, the tissue distribution of PQ 1 and PQ 11 in normal C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and the effect of PQ 1 on the normal tissues of mice were investigated. Substituted quinolines, PQ 1 and PQ 11 were distributed in the tissues in concentrations that were more than 40 folds of their effective dose.

30|$|It {{is quite}} {{obvious that the}} plant extract {{certainly}} contains substantial quantity of benign chemicals which reduce the metal salt into nanocrystals. It has been practically determined that the quantity of Cinnamomum camphora, as reductant, {{is responsible for the}} size of nanocrystals of AgNO 3. When 50  mL solution of 1  mM AgNO 3 is exposed to as little as 0.1  g of biomass of C. camphora at 30 °C, the nanoparticles are produced within 1  h, although completion of the reaction occurs in 118  h [64]. The absorption spectrum of the reduced product containing different quantities of the leaf extract has revealed that there are two absorption peaks, a strong peak at 440  nm due to particles of one shape in abundance and a weak peak at 360  nm owing to some scattered particles of different shape. It is apparent from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of silver nanoparticles that the morphology of the crystals are slightly different, although their size ranges between 55 - and 80 nm. The nanocrystals produced from small quantity of the biomass are scattered and are of better quality. When the quantity of biomass is increased, the time of formation of nanocrystals is drastically reduced from 118  h for 0.5  g biomass to 24  h for 1.0  g [64]. However, in such cases, the nanoparticles are aggregated, while with low quantity of the biomass, they remain segregated. It has also been observed that with increasing biomass the shape of nanocrystals also changes. The different absorption maxima correspond to different types of the nanocrystals formed. It has been reported by Huang et al. [64] that C. camphora leaf contains alkaloids, <b>hydroxybenzenes,</b> anthracene, steroids, terpenoids, coumarins, lactones, linalools, polysaccharides, amino acids and proteins. The silver and gold nanocrystals have been produced from the dried biomass of leaves. The study of the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the dried leaf biomass before and after reduction of Ag+ and Au 3 + shows changes in the functional groups of biomolecules [64]. There appear absorption bands at 1, 109, 1, 631 and 1, 726  cm- 1 which are attributed to CO, C[*]=[*]C and C[*]=[*]O stretching frequencies, respectively, in the free leaf powder. The IR spectrum of the leaf biomass recorded after the reduction of silver/gold ions shows the disappearance of the band at 1, 109  cm- 1 assigned to polyols present in the leaf biomass. It has been concluded that polyols are mainly responsible for the bioreduction of metal ions leaving behind RCO, which in turn, may react with the solvent to give a neutral species. The decoction of the leaf is a mixture of many compounds which cannot be identified; nevertheless, some of the frequencies remained unaltered which is believed to be due to C[*]=[*]C or ring vibrations. Huang et al. [64] have suggested that the shape of nanocrystals is mainly due to the protective and reductive biomolecules in the suspension. This idea of protective and reductive biomolecules is conceptually vague because when the nanocrystals are separated and dried they do not contain biomolecules to stabilize them. The biomolecules in our opinion react with other species to stay as neutral molecules after the nanocrystals have been isolated from the solvent.|$|R
40|$|Bio-oil，the only liquid {{product in}} fast {{pyrolysis}} process of biomass has {{been expected to}} be very promising in the future, and the technique of pyrolysis of bio-oil has also been attracted considerable attention {{in the field of}} thermal chemical conversion recently. Bio-oil is the complex mixture in the process of depolymerization of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose under non-thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, and it can only be treated as primary liquid fuel not only because of its high oxygen content, viscosity, but also the corrosivity and low calorific value. Many researches have focused on bio-oil’s applications and further treatments. Hydrogenation and catalytic cracking has been attracted much attention in upgrading bio-oil, It’s been found out that heavy component of bio-oil is difficult to crack in the above two cases and in reforming. For the purpose of improving efficiency of bio-oil exploitation and achieving better solutions to problems occurred during bio-oil pyrolysis and gasification,as well as providing necessary data for the design of pyrolysis and gasification equipments, the physicochemical properties analysis of bio-oil produced from wood powder by self-heating biomass fast pyrolysis facility was carried out initially. Then TG, TG-FTIR and tube furnace were employed to investigate pyrolysis characteristics of bio-oil and model compounds of its heavy fractions. Finally, the design of a domestic entrained-flow reactor is introduced for improving efficiency of bio-oil utilization. The thermogravimetric analysis of bio-oil and model compounds of its heavy fractions were carried out under high purify N 2 atmosphere from room temperature to a maximum temperature of 930 ℃ with different heating rates(10 ℃/min～ 30 ℃/min). The results indicated that bio-oil pyrolysis occured in 2 steps. The evaporation of low-boiling point compounds occurred in the first stage,, followed by the cracking of heavy fractions. With increasing heating rate, the starting temperature of weight loss, the maximum velocity of weight loss and its corresponding temperature increased simultaneity; but no difference among the ultimate weight losses was observed. The evolving volatile products during the pyrolysis process were analyzed by FTIR, and the results indicated that: free water, released during the primary stage of bio-oil pyrolysis, flowed by acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones due to their low boiling point. The final products were mainly consisted of H 2 O and CO 2 due to cracking of bio-oil heavy fractions. For the model compounds of heavy fractions of bio-oil, the online analysis showed that <b>hydroxybenzenes</b> had the greatest tendency to decompose, followed by aldehydes and carbohydrate. Levoglucosan pyrolysis occurred in two steps: First, it was dehydrated into small molecules such as aldehydes; and then followed by the cracking of aldehydes. Enhancing heavy fractions cracking such as carbohydrates pyrolysis {{plays an important role in}} improving efficiency of bio-oil usage. Pyrolysis of bio-oil and its model compounds of heavy fractions in tube furnace was carried out over a temperature range of 700 ～ 1000 ℃ under inert atmosphere. The composition and yield of the derived gases as well as distribution of the pyrolyzed product were determined. It is found that with increasing temperature the gas yield goes up. The gaseous product mainly consists of H 2, CO, CO 2 and hydrocarbons such as CH 4 、C 2 H 4 、C 2 H 6. The heating value of eugenol is in the range of 22. 7 ～ 24. 4 MJ/Nm 3, and that of bio-oil is in the range of 22. 7 ～ 24. 4 MJ/Nm 3. 生物质热解制油技术作为生物质热化学转化领域中的前沿技术受到了较多关注。生物油作为初级的液体燃料，既可以将其改质提升成高品位液体燃料，也可以将其气化制备合成气，再合成新的液体燃料。生物油改质主要集中在催化加氢和催化裂解两个方面，其中，生物油重质组分不易在加氢、裂解与重整过程中直接分解，通过研究发现生物油重质组分中多酚的慢速聚合和缩合反应是导致生物油“老化”的重要原因；醛类和糖类等大分子物质在一定条件下聚合反应生成的低聚物导致生物油裂解不完全，因此，对生物油改质的研究尚处在初级阶段。为了提高生物油的利用效率，特别是提高生物油中的不易分解的重质组分的利用效率，更好地处理生物油热解与气化过程中出现的问题，寻找生物油新的利用方法备受关注，而生物油气化制备合成气的技术路线引起了国内外学者的广泛兴趣。 本文首先对由木屑热解得到的生物油进行了各种理化特性的分析，之后利用热重、热重-红外联用、管式炉等对生物油重质组分模型化合物的热解特性进行了实验研究，并与生物油热解特性作对比。 生物油重质组分模型化合物在氮气气氛、不同升温速率下的热重分析实验表明：升温速率的升高使得生物油重质组分模型化合物的初始失重温度、失重峰值温度及对应的最大失重速率均有所增大，升温速率对最终失重量影响较小。采用热重-红外（TG-FTIR）联用技术，对生物油及其重质组分模型化合物热解过程中所释放的气体进行了实时监测，在线分析结果表明：生物油热解反应初始阶段主要析出物为自由水、低沸点的酸类、醇类、醛类、酮类等，随后以H 2 O、CO 2 等为主（主要来自重组分的裂解）。重质组分模型化合物中酚类物质最易热解，其次是醛类物质，糖类物质的热解分为两段。提高生物油的热解效率，关键在提高生物油中糖类等大分子的热解效率。 生物油重质组分模型化合物的管式炉热解实验表明：随热解温度的升高，生物油重质组分模型化合物产气量不断提高，热解气体产物中主要包含H 2 、CO、CO 2 及烃类如CH 4 、C 2 H 4 、C 2 H 6 等,丁香酚的产气低位热值在 22. 7 ～ 24. 4 MJ/Nm 3 之间...|$|R
