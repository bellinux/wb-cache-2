The light enters the eye in a {{direction}} away from the optical axis of the camera and is refocused by the eye lens back along the same axis. Because of this the retina will not be visible to the camera and the <b>eyes</b> <b>will</b> appear natural.|$|E
25|$|Spiders of the ecribellate haplogyne family Caponiidae are {{unusual in}} a number of ways. They differ from other spiders in lacking book lungs and having the {{posterior}} median spinnerets anteriorly displaced to form a transverse row with the anterior lateral spinnerets. Most species have only two eyes, which is also unusual among spiders. A few species of Caponiidae variously have four, six or eight eyes. In some species the number of <b>eyes</b> <b>will</b> increase when the spiderling changes its skin as it grows towards adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Eyes are {{internal}} {{liberties of}} a group of stones that, like external liberties, prevent the group's capture, but unlike external liberties are much harder for an opponent to fill due to the only way to kill a group with an eye is to fill all of its liberties before calling atari. The presence or absence of eyes in a group determine life or death of that group. A group with no eyes, or only one eye, will die unless its owner can develop them. Conversely, a group with two or more <b>eyes</b> <b>will</b> live. An opponent cannot capture such a group because it is impossible to remove all liberties of the group by playing one stone, without violating the suicide rule.|$|E

25|$|Stone-throwers also employ catapults, slings and slingshots {{armed with}} readily {{available}} materials at hand: stones, bricks, bottles, pebbles or ball bearings, and sometimes rats or cement blocks. Slingshots are often loaded with large ball bearings instead of stones. Since the 1987 uprising, {{the technique is}} favoured as one which, to foreign <b>eyes,</b> <b>will</b> invert the association of modern Israel with David, and her enemies with Goliath, by casting the Palestinians as David to Israel's Goliath, Despite there having been frequent acts of protest all over the Palestinian territories, the number of shooting incidents has been less than 3%. Nonetheless, the international press and media focused on the aspect of Palestinian stone-throwing, which garnered more headline attention than other violent conflicts in the world, so that it became iconic for characterizing the uprising. According to Edward Said, a total cultural and social form of anti-colonial resistance by the Palestinian people is commodified for outside consumption simply as delinquent stone throwing or mindless terroristic bombings.|$|E

50|$|In the {{swinging}} flashlight test, a light is alternately shone {{into the left}} and right eyes. A normal response would be equal constriction of both pupils, regardless of which eye the light is directed at. This indicates an intact direct and consensual pupillary light reflex. When the test is performed in an eye with an afferent pupillary defect, light directed in the affected <b>eye</b> <b>will</b> cause only mild constriction of both pupils (due to decreased response to light from the afferent defect), while light in the unaffected <b>eye</b> <b>will</b> cause a normal constriction of both pupils (due to an intact efferent path, and an intact consensual pupillary reflex). Thus, light shone in the affected <b>eye</b> <b>will</b> produce less pupillary constriction than light shone in the unaffected eye.|$|R
