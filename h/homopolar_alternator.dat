40|$|Abstract—The design, construction, {{and test}} of an {{integrated}} flywheel energy storage system with a homopolar inductor motor/generator and high-frequency drive is presented in this paper. The work is presented as an integrated design of flywheel system, motor, drive, and controller. The motor design features low rotor losses, a slotless stator, construction from robust and low cost materials, and a rotor that also serves as the energy storage rotor for the flywheel system. A high-frequency six-step drive scheme is used in place of pulsewidth modulation {{because of the high}} electrical frequencies. A speed-sensorless controller that works without state estimation is also described. A prototype of the flywheel system has been demonstrated at a power level of 9. 4 kW, with an average system efficiency of 83 % over a 30 000 – 60 000 -r/min speed range.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to predict the remaining electrical insulation life of a 60 KW <b>homopolar</b> inductor <b>alternator</b> following completion of NASA turbo-alternator endurance tests for SNAP- 8 space electrical power systems application. The insulation quality was established for two alternators following completion of these tests. A step-temperature aging test procedure was developed for insulation life prediction and applied {{to one of the}} two alternators. Armature winding insulation life of over 80, 000 hours for an average winding temperature of 248 degrees C was predicted using the developed procedure...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to predict remaining electrical insulation life of a polyimide epoxy insulated 60 KW, 208 volt <b>homopolar</b> inductor <b>alternator,</b> following completion of 23, 130 hours of turbo-alternator endurance tests. The sectioned armature winding of this alternator stator was used as means to evaluate and measure end-life at several aging temperatures for development of an Arrhenius plot. A one-half life rate of 11. 3 C was established from these data with a predicted remaining life of 60, 000 hours at an armature winding temperature of 248 C and a total life, including endurance test time, of 61, 645 hours...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three reluctance {{machines with}} flux assistance. These machines provide alternative novel geometries that provide high efficiencies with {{a reduction in}} the ampere turns in the armature windings for torque production, lowering armature winding switching losses and reducing the power electronic rating. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a switched reluctance variant of the <b>homopolar</b> inductor <b>alternator</b> topology. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a simplification of the Dual Stack machine. Both machines use a toroidal field winding to provide additional flux. The methods of connecting armature coils on each stator pole to utilise the armature flux and the choice of power electronic circuitry are important. Testing shows that such machines favour unipolar excitation with single coil per pole for the armature windings. Use of the field winding in series with the armature windings improves torque production. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine can have the mechanical angular displacement between the two stator stacks varied to provide an improved back emf waveshape for smoother torque production. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine has parasitic and axial air gaps that pose interesting design issues (e. g. end thrust). Magnets can be placed in steel sections where flux is unidirectional. An ideal candidate for magnet insertion is the Flux Switching Motor. A Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor has been built that replaces the field windings with ferrite magnets. The Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor achieves efficiencies of over 80 %. It adds no additional cost to the fan application as cost savings in lower temperature rated thermoplastics offsets the cost of magnets. A prototyping circuit incorporating a novel micro-processor program to alter the commutation timings as the machine operates has been designed to allow fast optimisation of each machine for minimum input power. ...|$|R
