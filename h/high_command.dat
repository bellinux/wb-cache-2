5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war on Nazi Germany by Britain and France {{in the aftermath of}} the German invasion of Poland, nine months of stalemate took place along the Western Front. After the Polish Campaign, in October 1939, the planners of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Luftwaffe <b>High</b> <b>Command)</b> and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) turned their attentions to Western Europe.|$|E

Under his command, Damascus was captured in 634 and the key Arab victory against the Byzantine forces was achieved at the Battle of Yarmouk (636), which led to the conquest of the Bilad al-Sham (Levant).|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{dealing with}} the army {{formations}} which South Vietnam might have deployed, {{the question of where}} and when to strike was the main problem that concerned the North Vietnamese. After the strength of both armies had been taken into account, the Central Highlands <b>High</b> <b>Command</b> came up with two offensive options.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Tharoor {{expressed}} {{support for}} Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a social campaign initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1944 invasion of Normandy, the Allied nations conducted a complex series of deceptions under the codename Bodyguard. This was a large strategic plan {{with the aim of}} misleading the German <b>high</b> <b>command</b> as to Allied intentions in 1944. Whilst the main focus of Bodyguard was on the invasion of Western France, additional plans supported operations in the Mediterranean and Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though {{the aims of the}} deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German <b>high</b> <b>command</b> did not come to expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 1944, Heinrich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein's {{death was}} {{announced}} in the Wehrmachtbericht, a bulletin issued by the Wehrmacht <b>High</b> <b>Command.</b> He was buried on 29 January 1944 in the Geschwader cemetery at the Deelen Air Base. His remains were re-interred in 1948. He is now resting next to Prinz Egmont zur Lippe-Weißenfeld at the Ysselsteyn German war cemetery in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1967, the VPAF <b>High</b> <b>Command</b> {{convened a}} meeting to examine what had gone wrong. The actions of 2 January had exposed the flawed tactics {{employed}} by MiG-21 pilots; they broke through the clouds too quickly, {{and they did not}} join up with each other before they attacked the U.S. fighters waiting above them. The VPAF <b>High</b> <b>Command</b> then devised a new tactic which required the deployment of between two or four aircraft for each attack, with a maximum of ten aircraft for each mission to perform guerrilla-style attacks on U.S. bomber formations. Furthermore, after they had examined U.S. air tactics, North Vietnamese commanders decided that MiG-17 pilots should attack U.S. formations from either side, while MiG-21 pilots would strike from above. Before the North Vietnamese Air Force could implement their new tactics, however, the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment was withdrawn from combat for several months to recover from the bloody defeat it had suffered as a result of Operation Bolo.|$|E

5|$|Operation Ironside formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis <b>high</b> <b>command</b> as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. The overall aim of Bodyguard was to tie down German forces away from Normandy by threatening other targets. Ironside's specific objective was to tie up the 17th SS and 11th Panzer divisions deployed {{in the south of}} France.|$|E
5|$|Operation Royal Flush formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis <b>high</b> <b>command</b> as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. Royal Flush developed a series of political misdirections in mid-1944 to support other deceptions between June and July. It evolved from Operation Graffham, a political deception aimed at Sweden between February and March 1944.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian <b>High</b> <b>Command</b> {{warned the}} French and British of their concerns. They {{feared that the}} Dyle plan would put not just the Belgian {{strategic}} position in danger, but also the entire left wing of the Allied front. King Leopold and General Raoul Van Overstraeten, the King's Aide de Camp, warned Gamelin and the French Army Command of their concerns on 8 March and 14 April. They were ignored.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian <b>high</b> <b>command</b> did {{not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps.

5|$|The German <b>High</b> <b>Command</b> did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at Sedan and Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had caught up with the three Panzer divisions. To Guderian, this was madness and would throw away the victory at Sedan and allow the enemy time to recover and reorganise his still formidable armoured units. Guderian decided to push for the Channel, even if it meant ignoring the <b>High</b> <b>Command</b> and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the Sedan bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. Now that they were pushing largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear with speed.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese <b>High</b> <b>Command</b> {{believed}} that the raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south China.

Three of these divisions were released for other operations in March 1945 after the American invasion of Iwo Jima was interpreted as evidence that the Hong Kong-Canton area would be bypassed rather than attacked.|$|E
