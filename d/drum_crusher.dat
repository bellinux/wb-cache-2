2500|$|Disposal of the Herbicide Orange under Operation Pacer HO was {{to begin}} {{in the fall of}} 1974, but because of various delays by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Air Force budget limitation, {{disposal}} was postponed until the fall of 1976. Work was then completed on the <b>drum</b> <b>crusher</b> and work area at Johnston Atoll for the transfer of HO from 55-gallon drums to an R-5 refueler truck, and later for transfer to the incinerator ship. The redrumming activity began on September 30, 1974. As a part of the effort to dispose of the HO stored at Johnston Atoll and Gulfport, Mississippi, an attempt was made to filter out the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-dioxin (TCDD), using filters of coconut charcoal so that the Agents could be re-used or re-sold. [...] The twelve cylindrical filters used at Gulfport, Mississippi, contained approximately 13grams of the contaminant TCDD. They were transferred to Johnston Atoll on December 8, 1976, and were stored in Bunker 785 while awaiting final disposition. While the TCDD was successfully removed, the resultant filters created a disposal problem beyond current technology.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} contains Technical Safety Requirements (TSRs) for the Radioactive and Hazardous Waste Management (RHWM) Division's B 695 Segment of the Decontamination and Waste Treatment Facility (DWTF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The TSRs constitute requirements {{regarding the}} safe {{operation of the}} B 695 Segment of the DWTF. The TSRs are derived from the Documented Safety Analysis (DSA) for the B 695 Segment of the DWTF (LLNL 2004). The analysis presented there determined that the B 695 Segment of the DWTF is a low-chemical hazard, Hazard Category 3, nonreactor nuclear facility. The TSRs consist primarily of inventory limits as well as controls to preserve the underlying assumptions in the hazard analyses. Furthermore, appropriate commitments to safety programs are presented in the administrative controls section of the TSRs. The B 695 Segment of the DWTF (B 695 and the west portion of B 696) is a waste treatment and storage facility located in the northeast quadrant of the LLNL main site. The approximate area and boundary of the B 695 Segment of the DWTF are shown in the B 695 Segment of the DWTF DSA. Activities typically conducted in the B 695 Segment of the DWTF include container storage, lab-packing, repacking, overpacking, bulking, sampling, waste transfer, and waste treatment. B 695 is used to store and treat radioactive, mixed, and hazardous waste, and it also contains equipment {{used in conjunction with}} waste processing operations to treat various liquid and solid wastes. The portion of the building called Building 696 Solid Waste Processing Area (SWPA), also referred to as B 696 S in this report, is used primarily to manage solid radioactive waste. Operations specific to the SWPA include sorting and segregating low-level waste (LLW) and transuranic (TRU) waste, lab-packing, sampling, and crushing empty drums that previously contained LLW. A permit modification for B 696 S was submitted to DTSC in January 2004 to store and treat hazardous and mixed waste. Upon approval of the permit modification, B 696 S rooms 1007, 1008, and 1009 will be able to store hazardous and mixed waste for up to 1 year. Furthermore, an additional <b>drum</b> <b>crusher</b> and a Waste Packaging Unit will be permitted to treat hazardous and mixed waste. RHWM generally processes LLW with no, or extremely low, concentrations of transuranics (i. e., much less than 100 nCi/g). Wastes processed often contain only depleted uranium and beta- and gamma-emitting nuclides, e. g., {sup 90 }Sr, {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 3 }H. Chapter 5 of the DSA documents the derivation of TSRs and develops the operational limits that protect the safety envelope defined for this facility. The DSA is applicable to the handling of radioactive waste stored and treated in the B 695 Segment of the DWTF. Section 5 of the TSR, Administrative Controls, contains those Administrative Controls necessary to ensure safe operation of the B 695 Segment of the DWTF. A basis explanation follows each of the requirements described in Section 5. 5, Specific Administrative Controls. The basis explanation does not constitute an additional requirement, but is intended as an expansion of the logic and reasoning behind development of the requirement. Programmatic Administrative Controls are addressed in Section 5. 6...|$|E

The TSRs constitute requirements regarding the safe {{operation of the}} WASTE STORAGE FACILITIES. These TSRs are derived from the Documented Safety Analysis for the Waste Storage Facilities (DSA) (LLNL 2006). The analysis presented therein determined that the WASTE STORAGE FACILITIES are low-chemical hazard, Hazard Category 2 non-reactor nuclear facilities. The TSRs consist primarily of inventory limits and controls to preserve the underlying assumptions in the hazard and accident analyses. Further, appropriate commitments to safety programs are presented in the administrative controls sections of the TSRs. The WASTE STORAGE FACILITIES are used by RHWM to handle and store hazardous waste, TRANSURANIC (TRU) WASTE, LOW-LEVEL WASTE (LLW), mixed waste, California combined waste, nonhazardous industrial waste, and conditionally accepted waste generated at LLNL as well as small amounts from other U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities, {{as described in the}} DSA. In addition, several minor treatments (e. g., <b>drum</b> <b>crushing,</b> size reduction, and decontamination) are carried out in these facilities. The WASTE STORAGE FACILITIES are located in two portions of the LLNL main site. A 612 is located in the southeast quadrant of LLNL. The A 612 fenceline is approximately 220 m west of Greenville Road. The DWTF Storage Area, which includes Building 693 (B 693), Building 696 Radioactive Waste Storage Area (B 696 R), and associated yard areas and storage areas within the yard, is located in the northeast quadrant of LLNL in the DWTF complex. The DWTF Storage Area fenceline is approximately 90 m west of Greenville Road. A 612 and the DWTF Storage Area are subdivided into various facilities and storage areas, consisting of buildings, tents, other structures, and open areas as described in Chapter 2 of the DSA. Section 2. 4 of the DSA provides an overview of the buildings, structures, and areas in the WASTE STORAGE FACILITIES, including construction details such as basic floor plans, equipment layout, construction materials, controlling dimensions, and dimensions significant to the hazard and accident analysis.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an updated cost assessment for remedial alternatives for soil at the Alkali Lake site in Lake County, Oregon (Figure 1). Conceptual-level cost estimates developed in May 2004 have been updated based on DEQ input, and now include maintenance of existing fences, continued groundwater monitoring, periodic road regrading, and periodic cover maintenance on the CWDA. This report has {{been prepared for}} the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) under Task Order No. 73 - 03 - 30. BACKGROUND The site consists of approximately 450 acres in the scrub-shrub desert lands of south-central Lake County, approximately 60 miles north of Lakeview, Oregon (Figure 2). Alkali Lake and most waterbodies near the site, including West Alkali Lake and the North Depression, are dry {{for most of the}} year. Between 1969 and 1971, about 25, 000 drums containing waste from the production of herbicides were transported to the site. In 1976, the <b>drums</b> were <b>crushed</b> and buried in 12 trenches on the site (i. e., the Chemical Waste Disposal Area [CWDA] as shown on Figure 2). Adjacent to the trenches is a buried pile of 55 -gallon drums that may contain paints, pigments, and solvents. A barbed wire fence and warning signs surround the CWDA and drum mound. Two soil incorporation areas and two soil test plots are present about a half-mile south of the CWDA and were used for pilot tests for soil treatment via sunlight and natural alkaline conditions (Figure 3). Environmental investigations completed at the site have included long-term groundwater monitoring of over 60 monitoring wells; sampling of site soils and surface water; sedimen...|$|R
