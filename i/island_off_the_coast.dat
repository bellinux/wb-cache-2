5|$|Set reports dated April 2012 {{recorded}} that scenes {{would be}} set on Hashima Island, an abandoned <b>island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Nagasaki, Japan. In actuality, the scene was set on an unnamed <b>island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Macau, though based on the real-life Hashima. Sam Mendes explained that the location was a hybrid of a set and computer-generated images. Production chose to include the Hashima model after Daniel Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad whilst shooting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Stockholm. Nordanstad, who produced a short documentary on Hashima Island in 2002 entitled Hashima, recalled Craig taking extensive notes on the island {{at the time of}} the meeting, but was unaware of his interest in it until Skyfall was released.|$|E

The senior d'Hastrel was a {{captain in the}} Languedoc Regiment, in a company of grenadiers. He participated in the Siege of Pondicherry in the Seven Years' War. Etienne d'Hastrel's elder brother, Jacques Bruno D'Hastrel, ecuyer (equerry), Chevalier, and Lord of Rivedoux, was a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis.

5|$|In May 1638, {{fresh from}} his defeat over Kent Island, Claiborne {{received}} a commission from the Providence Land Company, who were advised by {{his old friend}} Maurice Thomson, {{to create a new}} colony on Ruatan <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Honduras in the Caribbean Sea. At the time, Honduras itself was a part of Spain's Kingdom of Guatemala, and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland of Central America. Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island, but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642.|$|E
5|$|Meermin {{was built}} {{for use as a}} slave ship in the VOC's African trade; between 1658 and 1799 the VOC {{acquired}} and transported 63,000slaves to its Cape Colony, now part of South Africa.

5|$|The Sable Island horse, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Sable Island pony, is a type of small feral horse found on Sable Island, an <b>island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in color. The first horses were released on the island in the late eighteenth century, and soon became feral. Additional horses were later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for private use and sale for slaughter, which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction.|$|E

5|$|Piel Castle, {{also known}} as Fouldry Castle or the Pile of Fouldray, is a castle {{situated}} on the south-eastern point of Piel <b>Island,</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of the Furness Peninsula in north-west England. Built in the early-14th century by John Cockerham, the Abbot of neighbouring Furness Abbey, {{it was intended to}} oversea the trade through the local harbour and to protect against Scottish raids. The castle was built using stones from the local beach, and featured a large keep with surrounding inner and outer baileys. It was used as a base by the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487, but by 1534 it had fallen into ruin and passed {{into the hands of the}} Crown. Sea erosion began to cause significant damage to the castle in the early 19th century. In the 1870s the castle's owner, the Duke of Buccleuch, carried out extensive restoration work and erected outworks to protect it against further damage from the sea. In 1920 the castle was given to the town of Barrow-in-Furness and is now in the care of English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire class}} {{is based at}} , also known as Fleet Base West, which is located on Garden <b>Island,</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Western Australia. The {{decision}} to locate all six submarines at Stirling was prompted {{by the lack of}} suitable long-term facilities on the east coast of Australia (although individual submarines can use Fleet Base East in Sydney Harbour as a forward staging facility), and the proximity to Australian offshore interests, including most of the nation's external territories, the oil and natural gas resources of the North West Shelf, and the Indian Ocean sea lines of communication, through which the majority of Australia's seaborne trade passes. The submarines' primary missions are patrolling the waters of Australia and nearby nations, and gathering intelligence through the interception of electronic communications by foreign nations and the deployment/retrieval of special forces operatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions {{suggest that it}} inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view {{is supported by the}} fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a small <b>island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E

5|$|The white-winged fairywren (Malurus leucopterus) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the fairywren family, Maluridae. It lives in the drier parts of Central Australia; from central Queensland and South Australia across to Western Australia. Like other fairywrens, this species displays marked sexual dimorphism and one or more males of a social group grow brightly coloured plumage during the breeding season. The female is sandy-brown with light-blue tail feathers; it is smaller than the male, which, in breeding plumage, has a bright-blue body, black bill, and white wings. Younger sexually mature males are almost indistinguishable from females and are often the breeding males. A troop of white-winged fairywrens in spring and summer has a brightly coloured older male accompanied by small, inconspicuous brown birds, {{many of which are}} also male. Three subspecies are recognised. Apart from the mainland subspecies, one is found on Dirk Hartog Island, and another on Barrow <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Western Australia. Males from these islands have black rather than blue breeding plumage.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} Dromaius {{species were}} present in Australia {{at the time of}} European settlement, and one additional species is known from fossil remains. The insular dwarf emus, D. baudinianus and D. n. minor, originally present on Kangaroo Island and King Island respectively, both became extinct shortly after the arrival of Europeans. D. n. diemenensis, a subspecies known as the Tasmanian emu, became extinct around 1865. However, the mainland sub-species, D. n. novaehollandiae, remains common. The population of these birds varies from decade to decade, largely being dependent on rainfall; in 2009, it was estimated that there were between 630,000 and 725,000 birds. Emus were introduced to Maria Island off Tasmania, and Kangaroo <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of South Australia, during the 20th century. While the Maria Island population died out in the mid-1990s, more birds have since been introduced, and attempts are being made to breed a form similar to the Tasmanian emu. The Kangaroo Island birds have successfully established a breeding population.|$|E
5|$|Unexpectedly, the {{weakening}} trend stopped, as the steering winds {{came from the}} same direction behind the hurricane. It slowed down slightly, and on September 26 the eye of the hurricane became much more distinct. Humberto quickly re-intensified and reached peak winds of 105mph (170km/h), while located about 200 miles (320km) south-southeast of Sable <b>Island,</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Nova Scotia. Just as quickly it strengthened, the hurricane began weakening again. The eye became distorted as the convection became asymmetrical, due to the cooler waters and stronger westerlies. Initially, the NHC forecast Humberto to become extratropical. On September 27, it turned more eastward and later to the east-southeast, and Humberto weakening to tropical storm status about 400 miles (645km) southeast of Newfoundland. The cloud pattern became increasingly elongated and removed from the center, and late on the 27th, the circulation of Humberto degenerated into an open trough in the far northern Atlantic Ocean. The remnants were expected to be absorbed quickly by a larger extratropical storm to its north.|$|E

5|$|When Gilda was {{forecast}} to move near southeastern Florida, gale warnings {{were issued}} from North Key Largo to Fort Lauderdale. Rough seas affected the Florida coastline for about 72hours, causing moderate coastal property damage and beach erosion. After becoming a large subtropical cyclone, gale warnings were issued {{at various times}} from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina {{to the mouth of}} the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. High surf and minor beach erosion were reported along the coastline, and gale force winds were observed from North Carolina to New Jersey. Over the western Atlantic Ocean, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas. One ship reported a wave height of 28ft (8.5m), though no significant marine losses were reported. Around the time of it becoming extratropical, Sable <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Nova Scotia recorded a wind gust of 74mph (119km/h).|$|E
