5|$|Waters {{followed}} Roman Candles {{with a third}} short film, <b>Eat</b> <b>Your</b> Makeup (1968), {{in which}} Divine once more wore drag, this time to portray a fictionalized version of Jackie Kennedy, the widow of recently assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy. In the film, she turns to kidnapping models and forcing them to eat their own makeup. Divine kept his involvement with Waters and these early underground films a secret from his conservative parents, believing {{that they would not}} understand them or the reason for his involvement in such controversial and bad-taste films; they would not find out about them for many years. Divine's parents had bought him his own beauty shop in Towson, hoping that the financial responsibility would help him to settle down in life and stop spending so extravagantly. While agreeing to work there, he refused to be involved in owning and managing the establishment, leaving that to his mother. Not long after, in the summer of 1968, he moved out of his parental home, renting his own apartment.|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} has been praised by critics. Indie Game Magazine praised the first game's artistic design, commenting that [...] "it's an {{incredibly}} terrifying experience {{to try to}} save yourself from the single jump scare that ends the game" [...] and that it was a [...] "fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety {{can be used to make}} an experience terrifying". PC Gamer, when reviewing the first game, commented on the fact that players will likely experience familiarity with the setting due to restaurants such as Chuck E. Cheese's. They also noted that while [...] "the AI isn't some masterwork of procedural unpredictability, it would [...] head straight to you and <b>eat</b> <b>your</b> face off, or it'll play around like an innocent child before closing in for the kill. Your mind will fill in the rest." ...|$|E

Jenna tracks down Maynard and her suspicions are confirmed, after he tells her that his therapist encouraged him to stop his obsession with her and move forward. Later, in the 30 Rock building, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) finds Jenna upset in her dressing room. She tells him why she is in that state and shows him letters that Maynard sent {{to her in the}} past. Kenneth, however, is confused as to why Jenna misses her stalker, leading her to reveal that Maynard has been the longest relationship she has ever had. The next day, Jenna enters her dressing room and sees that her picture is inscribed with the words [...] "I want to <b>eat</b> <b>your</b> boogers." [...] Jenna is touched to find that Kenneth is responsible for the graffito, and thanks him for his thoughtfulness.|$|E

500|$|Born in Baltimore, Maryland to a {{conservative}} middle-class family, Milstead developed an early interest in drag {{while working as}} a women's hairdresser. By the mid-1960s he had embraced the city's countercultural scene and befriended Waters, who gave him the name [...] "Divine" [...] and the tagline of [...] "the most beautiful woman in the world, almost." [...] Along with his friend David Lochary, Divine joined Waters' acting troupe, the Dreamlanders, and adopted female roles for their experimental short films Roman Candles (1966), <b>Eat</b> <b>Your</b> Makeup (1968), and The Diane Linkletter Story (1969). Again in drag, he took a lead role in both of Waters' early full-length movies, Mondo Trasho (1969) and Multiple Maniacs (1970), the latter of which began to attract press attention for the group. Divine next starred in Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), which proved a hit on the U.S. midnight movie circuit, became a cult classic, and established Divine's fame within the American counterculture.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{said the}} song was {{inspired}} by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything I can think of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could <b>eat</b> <b>your</b> cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in {{what has to be}} the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.|$|E
500|$|Ferret-legging {{has existed}} for centuries, but the sport made a brief {{resurgence}} in popularity during the 1970s. According to a 2005 report published in the English Northern Echo newspaper, whether due to a [...] "lack of brave contestants or complaining wives", ferret-legging is now [...] "a dying sport" [...] that is being replaced by ferret racing, in which the animals race through a plastic pipe. Although the sport is now uncommon, annual competitions were held at the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival in Richmond, Virginia from 2003 through 2009. In 2007 the Manitoba Ferret Association held a ferret-legging competition in St. Vital Park, Winnipeg, to raise money {{in support of the}} organization's shelter for homeless ferrets. Marlene Blackburn, who works with the Ferret Rescue League to ensure that no ferrets are harmed in the sport, claims that during the years the competitions have been held in Richmond no contestant has ever been bitten, although some may get a few scratches. According to Kelly Yager of the Manitoba Ferret Association, the animals actually like small, confined spaces. Jay Lugar, spokesman for the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival, said ferrets are [...] "generally very harmless, fun-loving creatures." [...] Reg Mellor, however, commented that at their very worst, they can be [...] "cannibals, things that live only to kill, that'll <b>eat</b> <b>your</b> eyes out to get at your brain".|$|E

2500|$|The band’s next album <b>Eat</b> <b>Your</b> Face, {{released}} jointly through Epitaph and Volcom Entertainment in 2004, {{was hailed}} as a return to form. Founding guitarist Eric Davis had left the band and been replaced by Donald [...] "Don" [...] Horne, while former Slick Shoes bassist Kevin Clark filled the vacant bass position. Musically the album returned to the fast, loud punk rock style the band was known for, {{with many of the}} songs recorded in just a few takes. Lyrically it retained the band’s sense of biting sarcasm and expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. electoral system and the current state of punk rock in the mainstream, amongst other topics.|$|E

2500|$|Omri Petitte for PC Gamer gave Five Nights at Freddy's a {{score of}} 80 out of 100, commenting that the game took a [...] "less-is-more" [...] {{approach}} to its design, and that, while [...] "the AI isn't some masterwork of procedural unpredictability, it would [...] head straight to you and <b>eat</b> <b>your</b> face off, or it'll play around like an innocent child before closing in for the kill.

The game's overall atmosphere was praised for emphasizing the fear and suspense of an approaching threat, rather than {{the arrival of the}} threat itself as in other horror-oriented games. However, the gameplay of Five Nights at Freddy's was criticized for becoming repetitive once a player masters it, as there is [...] "not much more to expect beyond managing battery life and careful timing of slamming doors shut, so those with steely willpower won't find anything else past the atmosphere of it all." [...] Ryan Bates of Game Revolution gave the game a 4.5 out of 5; comparing its camera-oriented gameplay to the 1992 game Night Trap, he praised the game's minimalistic presentation (with particular emphasis on its audio design and lack of music) for contributing to the terror of the game, along {{with the fact that the}} [...] "nervous impulses" [...] of its repetitive gameplay would [...] " [...] almost OCD-type levels, adding to the tense environment."
