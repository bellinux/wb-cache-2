50|$|The Brabazon was {{the first}} {{aircraft}} to be outfitted with 100 per cent powered flying controls; {{it was also the}} first to feature electric engine controls, and the first equipped with high-pressure hydraulics. The large span and mounting of the engines close inboard, together with structural weight economies, demanded some new measure to prevent bending of wing surfaces in turbulence. Thus, one of the innovative features of the Brabazon was a purpose-developed gust-alleviation system, which used an assortment of servos that were triggered from a gust-sensing probe installed on the exterior of the aircraft's nose; an improved version of this system, along with fully automated trimming, was to have been deployed on board the Brabazon Mark II. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> were also designed to operate the aircraft's giant control surfaces.|$|R

Unlike other systems on the orbiter, there was no precedent in earlier spacecraft for a hydraulic system nor for the power unit to drive the hydraulic pumps.

50|$|Underwater {{thrusters}} can {{be divided}} in two main groups, hydraulic thrusters and electric thrusters. Electric thrusters are mainly used on battery operated underwater robots such as AUVs, submarines and electric ROVs. Hydraulic thrusters are mainly used on work class hydraulic ROVs. Hydraulic thruster technology is older than the electrical one, they are more rugged and their weight to thrust ratio is higher than electric thrusters, but maintenance and piping issues cause some dissatisfaction with users. Thanks to developing PMSM electric motors (wrongly knowing brushless DC Motor in market), electric thrusters are becoming more popular in newly designed products. Weight to thrust ratios are higher for hydraulic thrusters than for electric thrusters, but after {{taking into account the}} required hydraulic components including valves, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>units,</b> pipes joints, etc. hydraulic thruster systems come out heavier than electric thrusters.
