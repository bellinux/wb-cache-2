50|$|Dropwise {{condensation}} {{is achieved}} by adding a promoter chemical into the vapor, highly polished surface and surface contaminated with impurities like fatty acids and organic compounds, known as dropwise promoters. Dropwise condensation is provoked artificially {{with the help of}} silicons, teflons, assortment of waxes and fatty acids. These promoters are used to promote dropwise condensation but promoters are highly unstable and lose their effectiveness with time due to oxidation, fouling and removal of the promoter from the surface. Dropwise condensation sustain for a long time by the combined effects of surface coating and periodic injection of the promoter into the vapor neither it does not continue long time and converts to filmwise condensation. So most condensers are designed on the assumption that <b>film</b> <b>condensation</b> will take place on the surface.|$|E
50|$|In {{dropwise}} condensation the condensate liquid collects {{in the form}} of countless droplets of varying diameters on the condensing surface instead of forming a continuous film and does not wet the solid cooling surface. The droplets develop at a point of surface imperfection (pit, scratch), called nucleation sites and grow in size as more vapour condenses on its exposed surface. When the size of droplets is large there comes a time the droplet breakaway from the surface and knock off other droplets and carries it downstream. The moving droplet devours the droplets of smaller size. Dropwise condensation {{is one of the most}} effective mechanism of heat transfer and extremely large heat transfer coefficients can be achieved with this mechanism. There is no liquid film in this case to resist heat transfer as a result heat transfer coefficients can be achieved more than 10 times larger than those associated with <b>film</b> <b>condensation.</b> Heat transfer coefficients is large so designers to achieve a specified heat transfer rate with a smaller surface area and thus a smaller and less expensive condenser.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{a nuclear}} reactor containment, wall {{condensation}} forms with noncondensable gases and their accumulation near the condensate film leads to {{a significant reduction in}} heat transfer. In the framework of nuclear reactor safety, the <b>film</b> <b>condensation</b> in the presence of noncondensable gases is of high relevance with regards to safety concerns as it is closely associated with peak pressure predictions for containment integrity and the performance of components installed for containment cooling in accident conditions. In the present study, CUPID code, which has been developed by KAERI for the analysis of transient two-phase flows in nuclear reactor components, is improved for simulating <b>film</b> <b>condensation</b> in the presence of noncondensable gases. In order to evaluate the condensate heat transfer accurately in a large system using the two-fluid model, a mass diffusion model, a liquid film model, and a wall <b>film</b> <b>condensation</b> model were implemented into CUPID. For the condensation simulation, a wall function approach with a heat/mass transfer analogy was applied in order to save computational time without considerable refinement for the boundary layer.

40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to {{investigate}} theoretically and experimentally the following two phases of heat transfer during condensation of potassium vapore, a. Heat transfer during <b>film</b> <b>condensation</b> of pure saturated potassium vapor on a vertical surface. b. Heat transfer during <b>film</b> <b>condensation</b> of potassium vapor {{in the presence of}} a small quantity of non-condensable gas. Investigators have until recently been unable to explain the large discrepancy between theory and experiment for the case of heat transfer during <b>film</b> <b>condensation</b> of pure liquid metal vapors. Calculations from kinetic theory and irreversible thermodynamics suggest that this difference may be due to a significant thermal resistance at the liquid-vapor interface in addition to that of the condensate film. This interfacial resistance becomes especially noticeable at low vapor pressures and is dependent on a "condensation" coefficient to be determined experimentally. The presence of a trace of non-condensable gas during condensation may greatly reduce the heat transfer rate.

40|$|AbstractThe volume-of-fluid (VOF) {{approach}} is a mature technique for simulating two-phase flows. However, VOF simulation of phase-change heat transfer {{is still in its}} infancy. Multiple closure formulations have been proposed in the literature, each suited to different applications. While these have enabled significant research advances, few implementations are publicly available, actively maintained, or inter-operable. Here, a VOF solver is presented (interThermalPhaseChangeFoam), which incorporates an extensible framework for phase-change heat transfer modeling, enabling simulation of diverse phenomena in a single environment. The solver employs object oriented OpenFOAM library features, including Run-Time-Type-Identification to enable rapid implementation and run-time selection of phase change and surface tension force models. The solver is packaged with multiple phase change and surface tension closure models, adapted and refined from earlier studies. This code has previously been applied to study wavy <b>film</b> <b>condensation,</b> Taylor flow evaporation, nucleate boiling, and dropwise condensation. Tutorial cases are provided for simulation of horizontal <b>film</b> <b>condensation,</b> smooth and wavy falling <b>film</b> <b>condensation,</b> nucleate boiling, and bubble condensation.

An effective means to reducing both size and weight is to replace single-phase thermal management systems with two-phase counterparts that capitalize upon both latent and sensible heat of the coolant rather than sensible heat alone. This shift is expected to yield orders of magnitude enhancements in flow boiling and condensation heat transfer coefficients. A major challenge to this shift {{is a lack of}} reliable tools for accurate prediction of two-phase pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient in reduced gravity. Developing such tools will require a sophisticated experimental facility to enable investigators to perform both flow boiling and condensation experiments in microgravity in pursuit of reliable databases. This study will discuss the development of the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE) for the International Space Station (ISS), which was initiated in 2012 in collaboration between Purdue University and NASA Glenn Research Center. This facility was recently tested in parabolic flight to acquire condensation data for FC- 72 in microgravity, aided by high-speed video analysis of interfacial structure of the <b>condensation</b> <b>film.</b> The <b>condensation</b> is achieved by rejecting heat to a counter flow of water, and experiments were performed at different mass velocities of FC- 72 and water and different FC- 72 inlet qualities.

The heat transfer coefficient is highest near the inlet of the condensation tube, where the film is thinnest, and decreases monotonically along the tube, except for high FC- 72 mass velocities, where the heat transfer coefficient is enhanced downstream. This enhancement is attributed to both turbulence and increased interfacial waviness.
