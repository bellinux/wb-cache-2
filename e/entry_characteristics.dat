50|$|The {{first stage}} known as needs assessment, {{is common to}} any {{instructional}} design process, especially software development. This involves a learner analysis, consultation with subject matter experts and/or the instructor(s). This first step {{is part of the}} development of the expert/knowledge and student domain. The goal is to specify learning goals and to outline a general plan for the curriculum; it is imperative not to computerize traditional concepts but develop a new curriculum structure by defining the task in general and understanding learners' possible behaviours dealing with the task and to a lesser degree the tutor's behavior. In doing so, three crucial dimensions need to be dealt with: (1) the probability a student is able to solve problems; (2) {{the time it takes to}} reach this performance level and (3) the probability the student will actively use this knowledge in the future. Another important aspect that requires analysis is cost effectiveness of the interface. Moreover, teachers and student <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as prior knowledge must be assessed since both groups are going to be system users.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondria undergo fission–fusion {{events that}} render these organelles highly dynamic in cells. We report a {{relationship}} between mitochondrial form and cell cycle control at the G 1 –S boundary. Mitochondria convert from isolated, fragmented elements into a hyperfused, giant network at G 1 –S transition. The network is electrically continuous and has greater ATP output than mitochondria at any other cell cycle stage. Depolarizing mitochondria at early G 1 to prevent these changes causes cell cycle progression into S phase to be blocked. Inducing mitochondrial hyperfusion by acute inhibition of dynamin-related protein- 1 (DRP 1) causes quiescent cells maintained without growth factors to begin replicating their DNA and coincides with buildup of cyclin E, the cyclin responsible for G 1 -to-S phase progression. Prolonged or untimely formation of hyperfused mitochondria, through chronic inhibition of DRP 1, causes defects in mitotic chromosome alignment and S-phase <b>entry</b> <b>characteristic</b> of cyclin E overexpression. These findings suggest a hyperfused mitochondrial system with specialized properties at G 1 –S is linked to cyclin E buildup for regulation of G 1 -to-S progression...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Using Astin’s I-E-O {{model as}} a framework, {{this article explores}} {{the effects of a}} variety of factors on first-year {{persistence}} for conditionally-admitted students participating in a learning community at a public land-grant university. Since the learning community began in 2002, program administrators have collected survey, interview, and academic success indicators for participating students. In 2007, the program received grant funds to more carefully investigate factors that promote and inhibit persistence among students. For students matriculating in 2007, this study collected survey and <b>entry</b> <b>characteristic</b> data to probe predictive factors for persistence after the first year. These data allow us to better identify and understand dominant influences on student persistence as well as plan more informed interventions for students most at risk for departure. Key factors at our university that affected persistence of at-risk students included social integration, academic conscientiousness (most notably the use of self-regulatory learning strategies), and select pre-college characteristics including motivation and college preparatory curriculum. This article serves as a case study; after describing our local context, we present the inputs and environmental factors most predictive of persistence. We close by discussing the implications of this research for universities and colleges seeking to improve support for at-risk students...|$|R

In this ex-post-facto study, the researcher examined the student <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> of 2, 523 Hispanic entering freshmen enrolled anytime between Fall 2000 and Fall 2005 who attempted History, English Composition, or College Algebra {{for the first time}} in either face-to-face or distance education courses at South Texas College. The following student <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the Hispanic students in the study population were examined for their impact on successful course completion and retention: age, country of elementary education, custody of minors, disabilities, English as a second language, gender, high school diploma type, high school GPA, hours of employment, income level indicators, intent to continue employment, intent to transfer, intended length of enrollment, marital status, number of credit hours, parents? education, participation in workforce programs in high school, reason for attending, recent migrant work, resident status, and veteran status. The resulting profile of Hispanic distance education student characteristics was found to be similar to common characteristics noted in the literature for other distance education non-Hispanic populations. Furthermore, the researcher identified significant student <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> for predicting the risk of failing to successfully complete courses or to re-enroll. Finally, the researcher provided suggestions for further research regarding Hispanic student performance and success in higher education as a responsibility of the work of Hispanic human resource development within community colleges. This study provides empirical findings related to the student <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> construct found in current theoretical models of retention in commuter institutions of higher education. The researcher recommends expanding this research to other elements of theoretical models of student departure such as the external environment and the internal campus environment.

Factors considered included student <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics,</b> attitudes toward the computer experience, subjective and objective measures of achievement, as well as sex and grade. A secondary area of emphasis was the effect of sex on attitudes, experiences and performance using the Logo language.

Performance on the objective test was directly related to the combined influence of <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics,</b> post-Logo attitudes and perceptions and self-evaluation which accounted for 28 percent of the variance. The contribution of sex and grade was not supported. One of the best predictors of performance on the bivariate and multivariate level was total mathematics score on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills which increased explained variation to 39 percent despite a reduced sample size. Self-evaluation of Logo competencies was explained by the combined influence of <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> and post-Logo attitudes and behaviors, which collectively accounted for 50 percent of the variance.

40|$|When a {{rigid body}} collides with a liquid surface with {{sufficient}} velocity, {{it creates a}} splash curtain above the surface and entrains air behind the sphere, creating a cavity below the surface. While cavity dynamics have been studied for over a century, this work focuses on the water <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> of deformable elastomeric spheres, {{which has not been}} studied. Upon free surface impact, elastomeric sphere deform significantly, resulting in large-scale material oscillations within the sphere, resulting in unique nested cavities. We study these phenomena experimentally with high speed imaging and image processing techniques. The water entry behavior of deformable spheres differs from rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as well as the subsequent material vibration. Our results show that this deformation and vibration can be predicted from material properties and impact conditions. Additionally, by accounting for the sphere deformation in an effective diameter term, we recover previously reported characteristics for time to cavity pinch-off and hydrodynamic force coefficients for rigid spheres. Our results also show that velocity change over the first oscillation period scales with a dimensionless ratio of material shear modulus to impact hydrodynamic pressure. Therefore we are able to describe the water <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> of deformable spheres in terms of material properties and impact conditions. Comment: 19 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

This research aims at studying, {{by means}} of a theoretical model, the role of certain personal features (gender, age, socioeconomic background, academic record) and some dynamical mechanisms of personality in predicting the students' achievement in French at junior high school. The dynamical mechanisms, relating to the affective <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> (Bloom, 1979), were represented by five attitudes towards school: Negative feelings, Lack of scholastic interest, Aspirations for future studies, "Scholastic anxiety, worry and stress" and "Nice school, distraction place" (Bennacer, 2003). The academic achievement was estimated by both the teachers' grade in French accorded to students and the cloze test score (relating to French comprehension). With a group of 501 students, the model was tested and affined by the paths analysis. We obtained a final structural model which accounts for the interrela-tionships between variables. It allowed us to identify the profile of the student who gets bad academic results in French. The hereby study shows that personal features (distal variables) have direct effects on academic achievement, or indirectly via the dynamic dimensions of personality (proximal variables). These latter play, in the influence mechanism, a mediating role as dependent and independent variables. This supports the findings of other studies indicating that the affective <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> depend on the personal features and affect the students' behavior and their academic achievement (see Bennacer, 2005; Potvin & Paradis, 2000) ...|$|E

The relationship between climate data and the occurrence of BIRD was also investigated. Design Two thousand four hundred and sixty eight cattle were individually identified at feedlot entry, and lot number, body weight, property identification code, breed, gender, and the presence or absence of permanent incisors were recorded for each animal. Daily climate data were collected for the duration of the experiment. Univariate correlations, multivariate analysis and survival analysis techniques were used to {{examine the relationship}} between these feedlot <b>entry</b> <b>characteristics</b> and the outcomes of BRD and growth rate. Results The feedlot entry description of breed had a significant effect on average daily gain. The presence of permanent incisors at feedlot entry was associated with an increase in average daily gain of 0. 1 kg/animal/d. Growth rate decreased by 0. 702 kg/animal/d in cattle treated for BIRD and by 0. 302 kg/ animal/d in cattle identified with anorexia. Treatment for BRD was ten times more likely with Hereford cattle. There was a moderate correlation between minimum daily temperature and the occurrence of BRD. Conclusions This study indicates that breed can affect growth rate and health, specifically the occurrence of BRD, in Australian domestic feedlot cattle. The moderate correlation between minimum daily temperature and the occurrence of BRD indicates potential associations between climate and BRD incidence in Australian feedlots...|$|E
