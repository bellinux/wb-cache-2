500|$|In December 2005, Radiohead asked {{producer}} Spike Stent, who {{had worked}} with artists including U2 and Björk, to help them work through their material. O'Brien told Mojo: [...] "Spike listened to the stuff we'd been self-producing. These weren't demos, they’d been recorded in proper studios, and he said, 'The sounds aren't good enough.'" [...] The collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful and ended in April 2006. In an effort to break the deadlock, Radiohead decided to tour {{for the first time since}} 2004; according to Yorke, [...] "We basically had all these half-formed songs, and we just had to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together.</b> And rather than it being a nightmare, it was really, really good fun, because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one's self-conscious because you're not in the studio ... It felt like being 16 again." [...] In May and June 2006, Radiohead toured major cities in Europe and North America and returned to Europe for several festivals in August, performing many new songs.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} almost universally well {{received}} by the music press upon release, with Jon Landau in the newly launched Rolling Stone magazine noting that [...] "When the Byrds <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> on record they are consistently brilliant." [...] Landau went on to praise the Byrds' musical eclecticism, before stating: [...] "Their music is possessed by a never-ending circularity and a rich, child-like quality. It has a timelessness to it, {{not in the sense}} that you think their music will always be valid, but in the sense that it is capable of forcing you to suspend consciousness of time altogether." [...] Crawdaddy! magazine was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, with Sandy Pearlman describing it as [...] "enchantingly beautiful". Pete Johnson, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, summed up the album as [...] "11 good songs spiked with electronic music, strings, brass, natural and supernatural voices, and the familiar thick texture of McGuinn's guitar playing".|$|E

500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said it was [...] "an amazing episode, in which Homer {{actually}} has an argument with someone, rather than backing down. As he and his father drift further apart, so the family are at a loss at what to do. You can't help but feel sorry for Grampa as a piece of Simpson family history goes up in flames". Nate Meyers for Digitally Obsessed praised Dan Castellaneta's role in the episode and said: [...] "Dan Castellaneta's work as both Homer and Grampa Simpson in [...] is full of emotion and brilliant comic timing. Watch the closing scene carefully as Homer returns to his childhood home, because Castellaneta gracefully dances between a tender father-son relationship and flat-out comedy". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said he [...] "didn’t remember this as a very good episode, but it actually turns out to be quite strong. The initial plot in which Homer and Marge can’t <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> offers plenty of funny moments, and the scenes in which Homer battles with his dad offer depth and much humor. It’s also hard to beat the children's fears of the reverse vampires".|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Shaar Murray {{likens the}} figure to a feminine ideal: [...] "Sometimes {{she is a}} spirit, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a woman as solidly, palpably physical as he is". [...] The figure first appears as [...] "Waterfall" [...] in [...] "May This Be Love", where she offers solace and hope, and as [...] "a soulful, loving sprite" [...] in [...] "Little Wing". [...] However, other writers {{have suggested that the}} figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity, which is clearly what she represents in Hendrix's later song [...] "Angel". Hendrix's brother, Leon, interpreted [...] "Little Wing" [...] (and [...] "Angel") as a general tribute: [...] "He wrote it for his girlfriends, our aunties, and especially for our mama, who looked over us from high above in the afterlife". [...] Hendrix's hand-written lyrics for [...] "Angel" [...] (with the note, [...] "Finished January 14, 1968") use the title [...] "My Angel Catherina (Return of Little Wing)", which suggests that he saw a connection between the two songs. [...] At the time, Hendrix had just finished a short tour of Scandinavia, where he had performed [...] "Little Wing" [...] in concert for the first time. [...] At some point he responded to a question, [...] "Love? I know a girl, Katerina, in Sweden." [...] In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: [...] "So like 'Little Wing' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes... She was a very sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more if I wanted it. And me with my crazy ass couldn't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> so I'm off here and there and off over there." ...|$|E
500|$|Victor and Nikki are {{recognized}} as one of daytime television's most prominent couples. They have also garnered a large fan following, dubbed [...] "Niktor" [...] by viewers. In addition, the couple's weddings have been reported by mainstream media. Scott has said: [...] "Let’s face facts: [...] Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, they’ve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years! [...] Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold." [...] In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had [...] "registered an enduring appeal among viewers", with Braeden replying that, [...] "Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes from {{the wrong side of the}} tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict." [...] In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he [...] "always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki". He also stated in an interview that he considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites. Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: [...] "Young and Restless Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [...] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them." [...] The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: [...] "Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years." [...] They also described their relationship as being a [...] "dominant force" [...] in the soap opera. Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: [...] "Victor and Nikki just can’t, we mean can’t, ever <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship." ...|$|E

Recording will follow in the fall with a release as soon as the suits can <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together.</b> The record will be a concept album centered around an original science fiction narrative". The first performance of new material came at Fun Fun Fun Fest in November, with drummer Trivett Wingo comparing this practice to the first performance of tracks from Gods of the Earth at the 2007 edition of the festival. An update regarding the album was issued in December, explaining that the band had nearly completed the writing process for the record, would begin recording in early 2010, and were to embark on a short regional tour in January.|$|E

Blur {{were going to be}} a headliner in various years but they couldn't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> and more importantly they weren't connecting as a band." [...] BDO organisers were as shocked by the cancellation as those people who had purchased tickets, as they had not received prior notification. Social media was the forum in which the public and media received updates, with Maddah first stating on Twitter that, in the time he had been with the festival, he had only seen the BDO teamwork as hard as possible to fulfil each of Blur's requests. Maddah later stated on Twitter that refund options would be available for those ticket-holders who no longer wished to attend due to Blur's announcement.|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we realized that we either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody seemed right. For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E

2500|$|Autism United, a {{national}} autism group, demanded an apology from CBS over controversial remarks made by HouseGuest Adam Jasinski. During the second episode, Adam stated {{he worked for}} an autism foundation and would spend his winnings on a hair salon for people with developmental disabilities [...] "so retards can <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> and get their hair done". When Sheila confronted him over his highly offensive remarks, Adam responded by saying [...] " [...] can call them whatever [...] want because [...] work with them all day". John Gilmore (the executive director of Autism United) demanded {{action to be taken}} in a letter to Sumner Redstone, Chairman of CBS Corporation, after the Wednesday episode. Gilmore called for the show to be canceled and claimed that the network chose to air the segment for their own personal goals. The organization also contacted several of their advertisers over the issue, including Lowe's, Campbell's Soup, Claritin, Geico, McDonald's and Taco Bell. Autism United are also calling for an investigation into Adam and the foundation he works for. The organization, United Autism Foundation, claims to be a 501 c3 charity (deductions made to the organization would be considered tax deductible under current IRS regulations). The website for United Autism Foundation issued an apology regarding Adam's behavior in the house and stated he will no longer be working for the company after it ends. After winning the show on April 27, 2008, Adam declared he would donate $100,000 to Autism United.|$|E
