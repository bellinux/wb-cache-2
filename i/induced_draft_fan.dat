In virtually all cases, the collection efficiency of wet scrubbers is high enough for boilers with them installed to comfortably comply with the dust emission limits set by environmental authorities. However, wet scrubbers often cause boiler operational problems such as excessive vibration, deposit build-up and wear of boiler <b>induced</b> <b>draft</b> <b>fans</b> due to water droplet carryover and reduced boiler steam output due to blockages in and/or around the scrubber.

Even though the main objective of the power plant is to meet the increasing power demand at low cost, still it is behind the expectations due to low reliability of the power plant. Failures in the boiler side equipment have been considerably responsible for this with a huge financial loss to the country. This project studies the suitable designs for design faults and shortcomings of LVPS to improve {{the reliability of the}} power plant related to the boiler side. By analyzing the past data until the first overhaul of the power plant, it is revealed that the main failures are arisen in the primary air system, coal pulverizing system, secondary air and flue gas systems related to the boiler side. In addition to the low reliability of primary air system, it is not supplying the required total amount of primary air to the system to run the pulverizers within the safe margins. Installing a new primary air fan in the system not only meets the deficiency, but also improves the reliability.

After a post installation event, an audible periodic low frequency vibration in the breeching was noticed at loads ranging from 75 - 95 MWe. A detailed investigation was conducted which included fluid dynamic and vibration {{analyses of the}} fan and system, {{as well as an}} assessment of the fan and motor performance characteristics. Results of the analyses revealed system resistances which generated operating points in the stall region on the fan performance curve. Non-uniform fan inlet flow distributions were characterized by axial and transverse distortion parameters. Data showed relatively high transverse distortion parameters over the affected load range with the maximum of 20. 5 % distortion occurring at 95 MWe; with a corresponding breeching vibration frequency approximately four-thirds shaft speed. Based on the data obtained and observed system behavior, it was determined the phenomenon responsible for the flow-induced vibration was the onset of rotating stall. The magnitude of the pressure pulses associated with this low frequency vibration is capable of causing fatigue damage to large ductwork and producing unwanted acoustic emissions. In light of the large number of similar conversions performed throughout industry and increases in partial-load operation, the accurate diagnosis of such phenomenon is vital for reliable plant operations.

However, for wet cooling towers with medium to high TDS levels, this method is overly conservative, and predicts significantly higher PM 10 emissions than would actually occur, even for towers equipped with very high efficiency drift eliminators (e. g., 0. 0006 % drift rate). Such over-prediction may result in unrealistically high PM 10 modeled concentrations and/or the need to purchase expensive Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs) in PM 10 non-attainment areas. Since these towers have fairly low emission points (10 to 15 m above ground), over-predicting PM 10 emission rates can easily result in exceeding federal Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) significance levels at a project’s fenceline.

40|$|Abstract]: Australia’s {{coal fired}} power {{stations}} {{are the most}} efficient form of providing bulk base load power generation (i. e. electricity) to consumers. This is due to Australia having an abundance of thermal coal reserves, which is the fuel used in coal fired power stations. Therefore it is extremely important that these power stations operate at maximum availability and reliability to ensure the consumer receives cost effective and uninterrupted electricity. Callide C Power Station in Biloela Queensland is a 900 Megawatt (MW) coal fired power station that was commissioned in 2001. Unfortunately Callide C Power Station has been plagued with continuous operational and reliability problems caused from the <b>induced</b> <b>draft</b> (ID) <b>fans</b> since initial commissioning. The ID fan problems have arisen from the bearing lubrication system which provides oil recirculation to the induction motor bearings and fan main shaft bearings. Consequently these issues have caused half-load unit (225 MW) run-backs and full unit (450 MW) trips over the past decade. This project’s aim is to analyse the ID fan lubrication system and then identify and define all root causes and their associated failure modes. Once all root causes are identified through Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process, effective design solutions can be researched and evaluated so a proposed modification design project can be finalised.

40|$|Lecturepg. 45 - 56 <b>Induced</b> <b>draft</b> (ID) <b>fan</b> systems {{often use}} louvers or {{variable}} {{inlet guide vanes}} to control the flow of exhaust through the fans. An ID fan system can be made more efficient by using a variable frequency drive (VFD) to control the fan speed, which controls the air flow without adding restrictions to the flow path. To reduce energy costs, many companies are using more VFDs. This paper discusses how a VFD was the source of high torsional vibration in a motor/ID fan system operating a sufficient margin away from the torsional natural frequencies. This type of system instability is not a classical torsional resonance and would be difficult to predict in the design stage. As a result of the high torsional vibration, several couplings were damaged and a motor shaft experienced a fatigue failure before the problem could be clearly identified and solved. Two different fan systems at the refinery were tested and shown to exhibit similar torsional behavior, although only one of these systems actually failed. Test data showed that the dynamic torque in the couplings was excessive when the original VFD was operated at electrical frequencies above the first torsional natural frequency of the system (21 to 28. 5 Hz depending on the fan and coupling arrangement). Within the normal operating speed range, there was continual reversing torque, which is considered unacceptable for centrifugal equipment. To demonstrate that the VFD was the source of the excitation, the VFD was reconfigured as a soft starter so that it could be bypassed and the fan could ten be operated at constant speed using inlet damper control. When operating across-the-line without the VFD, the dynamic torque was significantly reduced (approximately 10 percent of the motor rated torque). After the test results were reviewed, a new VFD was developed and installed by the manufacturer to prevent the problem from reoccurring within the normal operating speed range. Final measurements are presented that show significant reduction in dynamic torque after the drive modifications were implemented...|$|R
