5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, <b>incision</b> and drainage may be required, in which a small <b>incision</b> is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the <b>incision</b> and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E

50|$|In RK, <b>incisions</b> {{are made}} with a diamond knife. <b>Incisions</b> that {{penetrate}} only the superficial corneal stroma are less effective than those reaching deep into the cornea, and consequently, <b>incisions</b> are made quite deep. One study cites <b>incisions</b> made to a depth equivalent to the thinnest of four corneal-thickness measurements made {{near the center of}} the cornea. Other sources cite surgeries leaving 20 to 50 micrometres of corneal tissue unincised (roughly equivalent to 90% of corneal depth, based on thickness norms).|$|R

5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an <b>incision</b> {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid {{membrane}} to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
30|$|In this case, {{we present}} a patient {{with a history of}} RK 9 years prior who {{underwent}} uncomplicated PRK and then developed postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis. We believe that the removal of corneal epithelium as part of the PRK procedure may have re-opened one or more full-thickness RK <b>incisions,</b> allowing egress of bacteria into the anterior chamber. While RK <b>incisions</b> typically extend through 85 % to 95 % of the corneal stroma, it is common for <b>incisions</b> to transverse the entire thickness of the cornea and cause microperforations. Typically after a RK procedure, the superficial cornea re-epithelializes, covering RK <b>incisions</b> and sealing off the <b>incisions</b> from possible inoculums. PRK requires the removal of the corneal epithelia prior to the stromal photoablation, thus removing the epithelial layer protecting these full-thickness RK <b>incisions.</b> We believe that this breach allowed bacterial inoculum ingress to the anterior chamber, causing bacterial endophthalmitis.|$|R

5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and non-invasive methods {{with the goal of}} obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small <b>incision</b> in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the <b>incision</b> of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Soft tissue reflection: An <b>incision</b> is {{made over}} the crest of bone, {{splitting}} the thicker attached gingiva roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it. The edges of tissue, each {{referred to as a}} flap are pushed back to expose the bone. Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps.|$|E

40|$|What is the {{association}} between clear corneal cataract <b>incisions</b> and postoperative endophthalmitis? The relationship between unsutured clear corneal tunnel <b>incisions</b> and an increased incidence of infection after cataract surgery remains uncertain; however, {{there is a growing}} concern and body of evidence regarding a potential causal association. Although 2 large recent studies from the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute report no greater incidence of endophthalmitis with corneal inci-sions than with sclerocorneal tunnel <b>incisions,</b> 1, 2 the bulk of the recent literature suggests that post-cataract endophthalmitis is more likely with corneal <b>incisions</b> (Table 1). 3 - 6 The concern is fueled by the clear evi-dence of an increased rate for post-cataract infections since 1994, the timeline for the widespread use of unsutured clear corneal cataract <b>incisions.</b> 7 Indeed, laboratory mod-els indicate that corneal tunnel <b>incisions</b> do not provide hermetic sealing under certain condi-tions. 8 - 10 These investiga-tions suggest that the <b>incisions</b> may be compe-tent at physiologic levels of intraocular pressure (IOP) but fail when IOP is lowered.

5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} <b>incision</b> {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an <b>incision</b> in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small <b>incision</b> with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E
5|$|At the {{posterior}} {{angle of the}} wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep <b>incision</b> of the anal area of the wing membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E

5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small <b>incision</b> (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped <b>incision</b> in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an <b>incision</b> in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E

5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an <b>incision</b> in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E

5|$|The Indricotheriinae subfamily, {{to which}} Paraceratherium belongs, was first {{classified}} {{as part of}} the Hyracodontidae family by Leonard B. Radinsky in 1966. Previously, they had been regarded as a subfamily within Rhinocerotidea, or even a full family, Indricotheriidae. In a 1999 cladistic study of tapiromorphs, Luke Holbrook found indricotheres to be outside the hyracodontid clade, and wrote that they may not be a monophyletic (natural) grouping. Radinsky's scheme is the prevalent hypothesis today. The hyracodont family contains long-legged members adapted to running, such as Hyracodon, and were distinguished by incisor characteristics. Indricotheres are distinguished from other hyracodonts by their larger size and the derived structure of their snouts, incisors and canines. The earliest known indricothere is the dog-sized Forstercooperia from the middle and late Eocene of western North America and Asia. The cow-sized Juxia is known from the middle Eocene; by the late Eocene the genus Urtinotherium of Asia had almost reached the size of Paraceratherium. Paraceratherium itself lived in Eurasia during the Oligocene period, 23 to 34 million years ago. The genus is distinguished from other indricotheres by its large size, nasal <b>incision</b> that would have supported a muscular snout, and its down-turned premaxillae. It had also lost the second and third lower incisors, lower canines, and lower first premolars.|$|E
