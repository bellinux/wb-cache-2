5|$|The {{original}} {{starting point}} of the A82 in Glasgow was at Trongate. It proceeded to run westwards along Argyle Street and Dumbarton Road to Dumbarton via Clydebank. On 16 May 1934, the road was rerouted to run along Buchanan Street, New City Road and Great Western Road, whose westward extension from Anniesland Cross had been recently completed. The route between Glasgow and Dumbarton has since broadly remained the same, aside from the <b>declassification</b> of the route {{to the south of}} the M8 when that motorway was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as classified information. Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial <b>declassification</b> of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor {{said in an interview that}} revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, as Perestroyka incited {{the wave of}} <b>declassifications,</b> Zoya Voskresenskaya's story was made public. It transpired that a popular children's writer was for 25 years a leading figure in the Soviet {{intelligence}} service's foreign department. Voskresenskaya's war-time memoirs Now I Can Tell the Truth came out in 1992, 11 months after the author's death.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{deductive}} approach {{for the analysis}} of secure information flows with support for fine-grained policies that include <b>declassifications</b> in the form of delimited information release. By explicitly tracking the dependencies of program locations as a computation history, we maintain high precision, while avoiding the need for comparing independent program runs. By considering an explicit heap model, we argue that the proposed analysis can straightforwardly be applied on object-oriented programs. Comment: Technical Report; 23 page...|$|R
25|$|The {{project was}} carried out in extreme secrecy by a team {{consisting}} of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, and Hunting Engineering at Ampthill, Sperry Gyroscope at Bracknell, Lockheed Aerospace in the United States, and others too numerous to mention, both in the US and the UK. The system was tested at the US Eastern Test Range, Cape Canaveral, and the warheads were tested with two full scale underground nuclear tests - 'UGT's - (Fallon UGT in 1974 and Banon UGT in 1976) at the Nevada Test Site. There were also numerous weapon effects tests to prove the RV/warhead resistance to the radiation-effects of the Galosh warhead; and there were numerous missile tests at the Woomera Missile Range, Australia, to develop various aspects of the RVs, the PAC and decoys. Recent <b>declassifications</b> of official files show that more than half the total project costs were spent in the United States, with industry and government agencies.|$|R
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the <b>declassification</b> of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, at Johnson's request, Middleton {{worked with}} former National Security Advisor Walt Rostow {{to prepare a}} {{rationale}} that Johnson could present to President Nixon that would persuade him to expedite <b>declassification</b> of foreign policy documents of Johnson's administration, including documents concerning the Vietnam War. Johnson died before {{he was able to}} meet with Nixon. However, under Middleton's direction, the Library established a reputation of leadership in <b>declassification</b> and openness, declassifying and opening hundreds of thousands of pages of historical material.|$|E
25|$|Upon <b>declassification,</b> the {{documents}} were used {{contend that the}} British had supported the slaughter {{and that this was}} done in three ways: encouragement of the killing; giving the Indonesian military a free hand by furnishing assurances {{that there would be no}} British intervention while PKI was being crushed; and propaganda operations.|$|E
5000|$|The nuclear-free world {{policy is}} now {{endorsed}} at the local, {{national and international}} levels. The overall anti-nuclear movement gained significant traction in 1954 after public attention was drawn to a particular incident, where the testing of a hydrogen bomb on March 1 accidentally contaminated the [...] "Lucky Dragon", a Japanese fishing vessel. The incident drew sharp criticism from Japanese officials, seeing that the nuclear legacy of World War II was still fresh in Japanese culture. The Manhattan project would later be declassified in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 but at the time, the revelation of the progress the Manhattan project had accomplished drew a slew of criticism from the public Much testing {{had taken place in}} the Bikini Atoll, a small group of islands in the Marshall Islands. Public protest began in 1946 in response to Operation Crossroads during its first <b>declassifications</b> [...] Several large protests with crowds over 50,000 in attendance have taken place since then, most concentrated around the period of the Cold War.|$|R
25|$|Polaris was {{the largest}} project in the Royal Navy's peacetime history. Although in 1964 the new Labour {{government}} considered cancelling Polaris and turning the submarines into conventionally armed hunter-killers, it continued the program as Polaris gave Britain a global nuclear capacity—perhaps east of Suez—at a cost £150 million {{less than that of}} the V bomber force. By adopting many established, American, methodologies and components Polaris was finished on time and within budget. On 15 February 1968, , the lead ship of her class, became the first British vessel to fire a Polaris. All Royal Navy SSBNs have been based at Faslane, only a few miles from Holy Loch. Although one submarine of the four was always in a shipyard undergoing a refit, recent <b>declassifications</b> of archived files disclose that the Royal Navy deployed four boatloads of reentry vehicles and warheads, plus spare warheads for the Polaris A3T, retaining a limited ability to re-arm and put to sea the submarine that was in refit. When replaced by the Chevaline warhead, the sum total of deployed RVs and warheads was reduced to three boatloads.|$|R
40|$|While the Cuban Missile Crisis has {{received}} {{a tremendous amount of}} attention from American scholars, in Canada the historiography concerning the Crisis is quite limited, with few monographs devoted to it. Typically the Crisis might receive a few pages of attention, perhaps a chapter in a book concerned with other topics. This historiographical “blind spot” has allowed misconceptions concerning Canada’s diplomatic and military participation in the Crisis to persist in this country’s collective memory of the Crisis, which is a disservice not only to Canada’s national heritage, but to the thousands {{of men and women who}} strove to prepare Canada for the possibility of thermonuclear war against the Soviet Union and its allies. Making use of the most recent document <b>declassifications</b> and all available secondary scholarship, this thesis examines the true nature of Canada’s oft-overlooked contributions to continental security, and the increasingly hostile personal relationship between President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Particular attention is paid to how understanding of these events has evolved with the release of once-classified materials over the nearly five decades since the Crisis...|$|R
25|$|According to Army reports {{compiled}} by the Criminal Investigation Command (CID) and later reported by the Village Voice following <b>declassification,</b> the Army found the allegations made by 46 veterans at the hearings to merit further inquiry.

25|$|In 2005, {{twenty-two years}} after his death, US {{government}} officials, including {{three members of the}} Central Intelligence Agency, seized and removed several of Senator Jackson's archived documents housed at the University of Washington. Though a team of the university's staff in 1983 removed all information considered classified at the time, the officials were verifying anything still considered classified, or reclassified since then, had been removed. The documents are pending <b>declassification</b> at the University as of March 2005.|$|E
25|$|Fidler {{left the}} Army, but {{continued}} to work on <b>declassification</b> in Washington, D.C., for the Atomic Energy Commission, which replaced the Manhattan Project on January 1, 1947. In 1949, he returned to Berkeley as the Atomic Energy Commission's Area Manager on the West Coast. In this capacity {{he was responsible for}} research activities on the West Coast, and was involved in the selection of the site for the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, the Atomic Energy Commission's second weapons laboratory.|$|E
50|$|The {{operational}} {{control of the}} Polaris submarines was assigned to another NATO Supreme Commander, the SACLANT (Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic), who is based near Norfolk, Virginia, although the SACLANT routinely delegated control of the missiles to his deputy commander in the Eastern Atlantic area, COMEASTLANT, who was always a British admiral.Polaris was the largest project in the Royal Navy's peacetime history.

25|$|Unlike in the Western {{cultural}} sphere, {{which has}} portrayed its foreign intelligence agencies (such as the CIA and MI6) in different media forms, Indian authors and actors have been shy {{to explore the}} area of espionage, especially R, until the 1990s. Unlike CBI, the federal investigative agency of India, whose existence is known {{to the majority of}} people, R receives little to no attention from the populace, which seems to be unaware of the existence of such an organisation or even India's internal intelligence agency, the Intelligence Bureau (IB). Excessive secrecy surrounding activities and rare <b>declassification</b> of the information are considered to be the major reasons behind this.|$|E
25|$|Bentley {{provided}} no documentary {{evidence to support}} her claims and the accuracy of her allegations was long disputed. The subsequent <b>declassification</b> of both Soviet documents and the U.S. codebreaking Venona project in later decades have lent some credence to the basis of Bentley's allegations, and showed that after her defection the Soviet Union temporarily suspended espionage activities in the United States. However, some of Bentley's claims remain controversial due to questions about the accuracy of translations and vague nature of the exact identities of those with code names in Venona (along with several dubious claims made {{in the years following}} her defection to the United States).|$|E
25|$|Kurchatov's speech made it {{apparent}} that the three countries were all working on the same basic concepts and had all encountered the same sorts of problems. Cockcroft missed Kurchatov's visit because he had left for the US to press for <b>declassification</b> of the fusion work to avoid this duplication of effort. There was a widespread belief {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic that sharing their findings would greatly improve progress. Now that it was known the Soviets were at the same basic development level, and that they were interested in talking about it publicly, the US and UK began considering releasing much of their information as well. This developed into a wider effort to release all fusion research at the second Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in September 1958.|$|E
25|$|Activities and {{functions}} of R are highly confidential and <b>declassification</b> of past operations are uncommon unlike agencies like CIA, MI6 and Mossad who have many of their activities declassified. The Secretary (R) reported to the Vohra Committee that R offices abroad have limited strength and are largely geared to the collection of military, economic, scientific and political intelligence. R monitors the activities of certain organisations abroad only insofar {{as they relate to}} their involvement with narco terrorist elements and smuggling arms, ammunition, explosives, etc. into India. It does not monitor the activities of criminal elements abroad, which are mainly confined to normal smuggling without any links to terrorist elements. However, if there is evidence to suggest that certain organisations have links with Intelligence agencies of other countries, and that they are being used or are likely to be used by such countries for destabilising India's economy, it would become R's responsibility to monitor their activities.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the mountainous}} terrain of Oaxaca and Chiapas greatly {{disrupted}} Tropical Depression Eleven-E's organization {{and led to}} its demise, the former cyclone's mid- and lower-level circulations remained intact as they moved into the Bay of Campeche. New and intense convection arose {{as soon as the}} vortex moved back over open water on September4, hours after Eleven-E's <b>declassification.</b> Over the next day, the area of thunderstorms, initially disorganized, coalesced into a tropical depression once again in the southern Bay of Campeche at 18:00UTC on September5. Twelve hours after formation, the NHC upgraded the system to tropical storm status following conclusive reports from a nearby buoy. As a result, the tropical cyclone was named Hermine. Steady intensification continued as Hermine gravitated towards the Texas-Mexico border. Thunderstorm activity increased during the morning of September6 as they continued to wrap around the center of the storm. Later that day, an eye was detected using radar imagery based in Brownsville, Texas, though the storms surrounding it remained rather meager.|$|E
25|$|Fidler also {{submitted}} regular {{reports on}} {{the activity of the}} Radiation Laboratory to the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., and briefed him, on his visits to Berkeley, which were made about once a month between October 1942 and November 1943. As part of his role in coordinating the electromagnetic process, Fidler occasionally visited Chicago, which was more convenient for contractors like Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis Chalmers; Boston, where the offices of Stone & Webster, the main engineering contractor were located; and the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He attained the rank of major. After World War II ended in August 1945, Fidler was transferred to Tennessee, where he worked on the <b>declassification</b> of Manhattan Project documents. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work on the Manhattan Project, which was presented by Groves at a ceremony at Lawrence's home on October 21, 1945.|$|E

500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Second World War was also the dawning of a new [...] "Atomic Age", in which the peacetime potential of nuclear energy began to be explored. Bachelder was among the scientists who opposed the May-Johnson Bill of October 1945, a Congressional bill proposed by the Interim Committee, which would have maintained military control over nuclear research. The bill was defeated in Congress and superseded by the McMahon Atomic Energy Act. In January 1947, the newly formed Atomic Energy Commission approved the <b>declassification</b> of 270 previously secret documents. These included discoveries related to X-radiation and purification of uranium ores, which {{had been made by}} Bachelder {{during the course of the}} war effort. At this time, the rarity and importance of Bachelder's achievements as a woman in science were also acknowledged.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{reaching}} its peak intensity, the hurricane began to steadily weaken. The cold ring of thunderstorm activity surrounding the eye warmed significantly while the eye became cloud-filled and cool. The circulation became tilted north-northeast with height, likely {{a byproduct of}} south-southwesterly wind shear, and the system was downgraded to a Category2 hurricane at 1200UTC on October16. Accelerating northwestward within deep southwesterly flow, continued unfavorable upper-level winds caused the low-level center to rapidly separate from the convective mass. At 1800UTC, Paul was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane; by this time, little deep thunderstorm activity remained near the center. Six hours later, the system was downgraded to a tropical storm while it passed [...] west of Baja California Sur. The remainder of shower and thunderstorm activity dissipated early on October17 and Paul was declared a post-tropical cyclone at 0600UTC. Following <b>declassification,</b> the system moved ashore Baja California Sur near Bahía Asunción while maintaining gale-force winds. Late that evening, the remnant low-level circulation dissipated about 70mi (110km) northwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.|$|E
