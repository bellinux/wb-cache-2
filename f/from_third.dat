5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and <b>from</b> <b>third</b> parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of the race, Bourdais began a slow climb back up the field. The Toro Rosso driver passed Sutil (who later spun out and retired with a gearbox problem), Nakajima and Coulthard, to sit in 15th by lap30. Rosberg fought Glock for 12th, until he passed the Toyota at the turn14 hairpin on lap12. Rosberg's pit stop relegated him to 18th, {{dropping}} six places. Kubica pitted late, on lap25, dropping <b>from</b> <b>third</b> to ninth, one position outside of the points.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Michael Schumacher. Coulthard's teammate Häkkinen began <b>from</b> <b>third.</b> At the first corner Michael Schumacher {{moved to the}} left and Giancarlo Fisichella collided with him and both drivers retired. Häkkinen took the lead of the race which he held until an intruder penetrated circuit limits on lap 25 causing drivers to make pit stops under safety car conditions. Barrichello, meanwhile, had gained thirteen positions to run fifth until the first safety car period. Häkkinen retook the lead after Coulthard pitted on lap 27. Barrichello stayed out on dry slick tyres, taking the lead which he held to clinch the first victory of his Formula One career.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside title rival Massa. Hamilton's McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen started <b>from</b> <b>third</b> {{next to the}} 2007 winner Kimi Räikkönen. Following a spin by Hamilton on the second lap, Räikkönen led most of the race, until rain fell on lap41 and Hamilton performed the penalised pass. Räikkönen crashed on the following lap as the rain became heavier. Massa finished second on the road after Hamilton, followed by Nick Heidfeld of BMW Sauber.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's victory {{made him}} the fifth {{different}} driver in seven races to win a Grand Prix in 2010. The result meant Webber's advantage over {{second place in the}} Drivers' Championship, now occupied by Button, was extended by five points. Hamilton's victory meant he moved into third place, while Alonso went <b>from</b> <b>third</b> to fourth. Vettel's retirement resulted in him dropping from second to fifth. McLaren's 1–2 finish resulted in them reducing Red Bull's lead in the Constructors' Championship to one point. Ferrari's poor result meant they moved from second to third, with 12 races left of the season.|$|E
5|$|In mid-August, Yost moved Braun <b>from</b> <b>third</b> in {{the batting}} order to cleanup, {{switching}} him with Prince Fielder. The move {{was expected to}} allow Braun to steal more, as batting before Fielder was not conducive to him risking being thrown out on steal attempts. Additionally, successfully stealing a base would hypothetically allow opponents to intentionally walk Fielder and avoid pitching to him. At {{the end of the}} month, however, Yost reverted to his previous batting order.|$|E

Sergio Henao moved from eighth to fourth and Quintana from twelfth to fifth. Spain {{moved into the}} lead of the nations' ranking, having previously been fifth. Tinkoff retained their overall lead in the teams' ranking, ahead of Team Sky.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb {{with the bases loaded}} and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that Tony Gwynn was unable to see. Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, but was unable to prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home <b>from</b> <b>third</b> with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely game-winning RBI.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard. Barrichello began <b>from</b> <b>third,</b> alongside Coulthard's teammate Mika Häkkinen. The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled {{for first place}} until Coulthard served a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Just before half distance, Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello {{to take the lead}} until his own pit stop on lap 43. By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to make the switch to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0.1 seconds ahead of Barrichello.|$|E

5|$|Once again, the Red Sox {{took the}} lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan. Martínez was the {{starting}} pitcher for the Red Sox, and {{in the bottom of the}} first inning, he allowed the Cardinals to load the bases with one out. Edmonds then hit a fly ball towards Ramírez in left field, who caught it on the run and threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate. Varitek tagged out Walker, who was attempting to score <b>from</b> <b>third,</b> ending the inning.|$|E
5|$|Porte's third-place finish was {{his second}} {{consecutive}} podium {{place in the}} season-long UCI World Tour competition, following his second-place finish at the Tour Down Under. He moved up into first place overall, while Henao moved up <b>from</b> <b>third</b> to second, with the previous leader, Simon Gerrans (Orica–GreenEDGE) dropping to third. Thomas moved into fourth and Contador into fifth, with Zakarin and Izagirre also moving into the top ten. Australia remained top of the nations' ranking, while Sky moved {{to the top of}} the teams' ranking.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{engineering}} {{and a final}} tunnel design was completed by {{a joint venture between}} AECOM and Arup. The first phase was originally supposed to include a core tunneling section between 62nd and 92nd Streets, as well as a spur <b>from</b> <b>Third</b> Avenue/63rd Street to Second Avenue/65th Street. The 96th Street station cavern, as well as existing tunnels, would allow the first phase's trackage to run from 62nd to 105th Streets. Before construction started, the MTA revised their plans so that the construction of the section between 62nd and 65th Streets was postponed.|$|E

5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell <b>from</b> <b>third</b> to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E
