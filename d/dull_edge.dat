50|$|Thick, rigid, single-edged razors such as utility knives {{are used}} for various {{hand-held}} tasks. Applications include detailed carpentry work like sanding and scraping (in a specialized holder), paper cutting for technical drawing, plumbing and finish work such as grouting and cleaning, and removing paint from flat surfaces such as panes of glass. Unlike shaving razors, the industrial-grade blades used in these tools are usually made from a non-stainless steel like carbon steel, and have a tougher and <b>duller</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|R

60|$|Here {{the gentlemen}} who propose {{to be kept}} by their {{neighbours}} are our helpful allies. They have succeeded in making uneasy the class immediately above them, which is the English working class, as yet undebauched by the temptation of State-aided idleness or State-guaranteed irresponsibility. England has millions of such silent careful folk accustomed, even yet, {{to provide for their}} own offspring, to bring them up in a resolute fear of God, and to desire no more than the reward of their own labours. A few years ago this class would not have cared to shift; now they feel the general disquiet. They live close to it. Tea-and-sugar borrowing friends have told them jocularly, or with threats, of a good time coming when things will go hard with the uncheerful giver. The prospect appeals neither to their reason nor to their Savings Bank books. They hear--they do not need to read--the speeches delivered in their streets on a Sunday morning. It is one of their pre-occupations {{to send their children to}} Sunday School by roundabout roads, lest they should pick up abominable blasphemies. When the tills of the little shops are raided, or when the family ne'er-do-well levies on his women with more than usual brutality, they know, because they suffer, what principles are being put into practice. If these people could quietly be shown a quiet way out of it all, very many of them would call in their savings (they are richer than they look), and slip quietly away. In the English country, as well as in the towns, there is a feeling--not yet panic, but the <b>dull</b> <b>edge</b> of it--that the future will be none too rosy for such as are working, or are in the habit of working. This is all to our advantage.|$|E

50|$|Cyathea cincinnata is {{a species}} of tree fern native to eastern New Guinea, where it grows at an {{altitude}} of 1300 m or higher. It is known only from a few collections in the Sepik region (East Sepik and West Sepik). The trunk is erect and short. Fronds are bi- or tripinnate and 1-1.5 m long.

The stipe is dark and is covered with scales throughout. Where scales have fallen, small warts are present. The scales are glossy brown and have a thin, <b>dull</b> <b>edge.</b> Sori occur at the forks of veins and are covered by thin indusia, which range in shape from cup- to saucer-like.|$|E
50|$|In common usage, a {{butter knife}} may refer to any non-serrated table knife {{designed}} with a <b>dull</b> <b>edge</b> and rounded point; formal cutlery patterns {{make a distinction}} between such a place knife (or table knife) and a butter knife. In this usage, a butter knife (or master butter knife) is a sharp-pointed, dull-edged knife, often with a sabre shape, used only to serve out pats of butter from a central butter dish to individual diners' plates. Master butter knives are not used to spread the butter onto bread: this would contaminate the butter remaining in the butter dish when the next pat of butter was served. Rather, diners at the breakfast, the luncheon, and the informal dinner table use an individual butter knife to apply butter to their bread. Individual butter knives have a round point, so as not to tear the bread, and are sometimes termed butter spreaders. If no butter spreaders are provided, a dinner knife may be used as an alternative.|$|E
5000|$|A {{multi-tool}} is a {{hand tool}} that incorporates several tools into a single, portable device; the Swiss army knife {{represents one of}} the earliest examples. Other tools have a primary purpose but also incorporate other functionality - for example, lineman's pliers incorporate a gripper and cutter, and are often used as a hammer; and some hand saws incorporate a carpenter's square in the right-angle between the blade's <b>dull</b> <b>edge</b> and the saw's handle. This would also be the category in which the [...] "multi-purpose" [...] tools since they are also multiple tools in one (multi-use and multi-purpose can be used interchangeably). These types of tools were specifically made to catch the eye of many different craftsman who traveled to do their work. To these workers these types of tools were revolutionary because they were one tool or one device that could do several different things. With this new revolution of tools the traveling craftsman would not have to carry so many tools with them to job sites, being that their space would be limited to the vehicle they were driving. The problem of having to deal with so many different tools was solved with the overtaking of multi-use tools.|$|E

50|$|The blade is {{normally}} made in three distinct sections or zones. The first section, near the hilt, comprises the ricasso (unsharpened portion) which is flat-sided and slightly beveled {{at the edges}} {{with one or two}} small holes at its forward end. In some examples there are two arms running parallel to the sides of the ricasso with spaces inbetween, designed to catch the opponent's blade {{in a manner similar to}} the curved quillons of a dagger. On the side of the ricasso opposite the knuckleguard there is usually an oval depression for the thumb. The second section of the blade {{is normally}} single-edged with a flat triangular cross-section. The edge faces the wielder's left when the dagger is held in the ready position. The back of the blade (the <b>dull</b> <b>edge)</b> in this section is usually filed with a series of grooves or notches. The third and longest section of the blade extends to the point, and is double-edged with a diamond cross-section. It will occasionally have notches or serrations for a short distance along the edge which corresponds to the back of the previous zone. Although this form is typical, numerous variations can be found including those with curved quillons, rounded guards or blades with only two sections. These various forms reached their peak of development in the late 17th century and, despite a period of decline, the weapon continued to be used even into the 18th.|$|E

40|$|Peritoneoscopic {{findings}} of 39 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) {{were compared with}} those of 95 patients with non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis (NALC). They were selected from 245 patients with liver cirrhosis subjected to peritoneoscopy in the 7 year period from 1975 to 1981. Out of the 95 NALC patients, 24 had hepatitis B surface antigen. The ALC patients had nodules which varied in size (61 %), large depressions (69 %), and a markedly rounded edge of the liver (33 %) more often than NALC patients (18, 43 and 3 %, respectively). Nodularity differed between the right and left lobes in ALC (41 %) more often than in NALC (16 %). Interstitial reddish markings and patchy nodules were, however, more frequent in NALC (51 and 28 %, respectively) than in ALC (8 and 5 %, respectively). Lymphatic vesicles were observed both in ALC (85 %) and NALC (78 %). In conclusion, the peritoneoscopic features which suggested ALC were the coexistence of nodules of various sizes, large depressions and a markedly <b>dull</b> <b>edge</b> of the liver. Interstitial reddish markings and patchy nodules were more indicative of NALC than ALC. </p...|$|E
50|$|A typical Clovis {{point is}} a medium to large {{lanceolate}} point. Sides are parallel to convex, and exhibit careful pressure flaking along the blade edge.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{writers on}} Soviet law tended {{to treat it}} largely as one big 2 ̆ 2 current event 2 ̆ 2 or - at best as a discontinuous series of current events patched together in what one hoped made up a connected story. The primary data were scant, inaccessible, and unreliable. The monographic literature inside {{and to some extent}} outside the Soviet Union had in many cases been contributed by men who were, in the older as well as the contemporary sense of the term, interested; it was often hard to hear the voice of reason over the harsh rasp of axes being ground to a <b>dull</b> <b>edge.</b> The current events were sometimes assimilated, or contrasted, to pre-Soviet Russian law, but legal developments of the early period of Soviet power were relatively neglected. They seemed to have been isolated from the recent past by the Great Purges, the War, and the late-Stalinist Terror. In the past few years the study of the Soviet legal scene in the twenties has come into more favor. Simple lapse of time may lend enchantment, if not perspective. Besides, within the Soviet Union the legal reformers venturing out in the thaw of 1955 - 57 sought support and legitimate ancestry in evoking 2 ̆ 2 the noble, mythical past when the Revolution was young, the party was virtuous, life was simple, and laws were just. 2 ̆ 2 Comparative attention also has been drawn to the Soviet twenties by the roughly analogous events of the late forties and early fifties in the 2 ̆ 2 people 2 ̆ 7 s democracies. 2 ̆ 2 Professor Hazard 2 ̆ 7 s book examines the growth of legal institutions and procedures as they affected 2 ̆ 2 disputes between citizens 2 ̆ 2 in the interval from the second 1917 Revolution to roughly 1925. Substantive law, except for that which is necessarily secreted in the interstices of procedure, is not treated directly. By the end of the period covered in the book, most of the characteristic legal institutions of Soviet authority had made their appearance; most of the important codes had been enacted; many of the future tenets of Soviet legal theory had been stated or foreshadowed; the curve of the New Economic Policy had passed its peak; and Stalin had begun to win out over his political opponents by a number of weapons, among them ideological and theoretical arguments which he was later to abandon in favor of those supported by his victims...|$|E
