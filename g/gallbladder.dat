5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the <b>gallbladder,</b> but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} <b>gallbladder)</b> is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have an increased risk of recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, U.S. park rangers began finding bear {{carcasses}} missing only <b>gallbladders</b> and paws. Initially, {{it was considered}} that occasional hunters were the cause, but investigations uncovered evidence that large commercial organizations were dealing in poaching and smuggling. During a three-year operation (Operation SOUP) ending in 1999, 52 people were arrested and 300 <b>gallbladders</b> seized in Virginia. Another investigation in Oregon led police to bring racketeering charges against an organisation that poached an estimated 50 to 100 bears per year for a decade. It was estimated in 2008 that in North America, 40,000 American black bears are illegally poached for their <b>gallbladders</b> and paws each year.|$|R

5|$|On February 12, 2006, {{shortly after}} the {{beginning}} of the General Assembly's legislative session, Fletcher was hospitalized with abdominal pain. Doctors at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington found a gallstone in his common bile duct and also diagnosed him with an inflamed pancreas and <b>gallbladder</b> disease. After surgery to remove the <b>gallbladder,</b> Fletcher developed a blood infection that slowed his recovery, but was discharged from the hospital on March 1. Days later, he returned to St. Joseph's with a blood clot which had to be dissolved, resulting in another five-day stay in the hospital. Fletcher staffers insisted that his absence did not {{have a negative impact on}} his ability to get legislation passed during the session. A right-to-work law and a repeal of the state's prevailing wage law – both advocated by Fletcher – failed early in the session, but both had been considered unlikely to pass before the session started. Among the bills that did pass the session were a mandatory seat belt law, a law requiring children under 16 years old to wear a helmet when operating an all-terrain vehicle, and legislation allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted on Capitol grounds in a historical context.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the setting of bile duct obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually ultrasound, as this is the most easily available. Ultrasound may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones farther down the bile duct. Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and cholecystitis (inflammation of the <b>gallbladder),</b> which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound. A better test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970 NHL Expansion Draft, Sabres General Manager Punch Imlach drafted Tom Webster {{from the}} Boston Bruins and {{promptly}} dealt {{him to the}} Red Wings for Crozier. Crozier started the Sabres' first NHL game on October 10, 1970 against the Pittsburgh Penguins. He stopped 35 of 36 shots to earn the franchise's first victory, 2–1. On December 6, 1970, Crozier earned the franchise's first shutout in a 1–0 win over the Minnesota North Stars. By late December however, Crozier was deeply exhausted {{and the majority of}} the Sabres' goaltending duties were transferred to goalies Joe Daley and Dave Dryden. Crozier finished the season with a 9–20–7 record (win-loss-tie) and a 3.68 GAA. The Sabres also missed the playoffs, finishing fifth in the East Division. Adding to Crozier's continuing health problems, his <b>gallbladder</b> was removed during the off-season.|$|E

5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their <b>gallbladder</b> but the {{majority}} are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the <b>gallbladder</b> to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach.

40|$|Background: Harmonic Scalpel and PlasmaKinetic {{have become}} {{popular with the}} promise of quick and {{effective}} vascular control. Their excellent outcomes encouraged surgeons to use these instruments for closure of the bile ducts with little or no data, establishing their efficacy or safety. Aim: The aim of this experimental study was to compare the safety and feasibility of different cystic duct closure methods (suture ligation, clip application, Harmonic Scalpel and PlasmaKinetic). Methods: Sixty non-perforated <b>gallbladders</b> extracted during laparoscopic cholecystectomy were studied in this ex vivo study. <b>Gallbladders</b> were randomly divided into four groups and the distal end of cystic ducts remaining with sacs was reclosed by one of the four different methods. By means of a catheter, air insufflation was administered into <b>gallbladders</b> with a pressure-controlled pump. Bursting pressure and lateral thermal injury were measured for each group, and groups were compared with each other. Results: In the Harmonic Scalpel group, a 1. 4 mm lateral thermal injury was detected, while it was 1. 6 mm in the PlasmaKinetic group. But, in terms of bursting pressure, there was not a statistically significant difference between the groups. Conclusion: Cystic duct closure with the new devices may be an alternative to surgical clips. Further trials are needed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of PlasmaKinetic usage in the clinical setting. [Arch Clin Exp Surg 2012; 1 (3. 000) : 168 - 171...|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (<b>gallbladder</b> disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The <b>gallbladder</b> also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the <b>gallbladder</b> and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E

5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the <b>gallbladder,</b> are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E
25|$|Cancers of the <b>gallbladder</b> are {{typically}} adenocarcinomas, and {{are common in}} elderly women. <b>Gallbladder</b> cancer is strongly associated with gallstones, a porcelain <b>gallbladder</b> appearance on ultrasound, {{and the presence of}} polyps within the <b>gallbladder.</b> <b>Gallbladder</b> cancer may manifest with weight loss, jaundice, and pain in the upper right of.

40|$|Pioneering studies {{within the}} last few years have allowed the in vitro {{expansion}} of tissue-specific adult stem cells from a variety of endoderm-derived organs, including the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Expansion of these cells requires activation of the receptor Lgr 5 by its ligand R-spondin 1 and is likely facilitated by the fact that in healthy adults the stem cells in these organs are highly proliferative. In many other adult organs, such as the liver, proliferating cells are normally not abundant in adulthood. However, upon injury, the liver has a strong regenerative potential that is accompanied by the emergence of Lgr 5 -positive stem cells; these cells can be isolated and expanded in vitro as organoids. In an effort to isolate stem cells from non-regenerating mouse livers, we discovered that healthy <b>gallbladders</b> are a rich source of stem/progenitor cells that can be propagated in culture as organoids for more than a year. Growth of these organoids was stimulated by R-spondin 1 and noggin, whereas in the absence of these growth factors, the organoids differentiated partially toward the hepatocyte fate. When transplanted under the liver capsule, gallbladder-derived organoids maintained their architecture for 2 weeks. Furthermore, single cells prepared from dissociated organoids and injected into the mesenteric vein populated the liver parenchyma of carbon tetrachloride-treated mice. Human <b>gallbladders</b> were also a source of organoid-forming stem cells. Thus, under specific growth conditions, stem cells can be isolated from healthy <b>gallbladders,</b> expanded almost indefinitely in vitro, and induced to differentiate toward the hepatocyte lineage...|$|R
