Most of the country's {{export revenue}} {{is derived from}} the {{textiles}} industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other <b>foodstuffs.</b> France is Madagascar's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties to the country. The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets. Imports of such items as <b>foodstuffs,</b> fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52percent of GDP.

5|$|The basic {{staples of}} the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were {{supplemented}} {{with a wide}} variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At Joya de Cerén, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of <b>foodstuffs</b> stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and tomatoes. Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic <b>foodstuffs,</b> the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages. Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.|$|E

5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy <b>foodstuffs.</b> The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound <b>foodstuffs</b> specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E
40|$|The aimed of this {{research}} was (a) to study the backward linkage and forward linkage of <b>foodstuff</b> plants towards another economic sector in Pemalang Regency, (b) to study how value of material requistion and service from output of another economic sector used up for production process of <b>foodstuff</b> plants sector in Pemalang Regency and (c) to study how value of the USAge of goods and services from output of <b>foodstuff</b> plants used up for production process by another economic sector in Pemalang Regency. The research method used descriptive method, by using the data of I-O Table Pemalang Regency, The analysis used linkage analysis and descriptive analysis. The linkage analysis divided into the backward linkage and forward linkage. Descriptive analysis were Asses Input Ratio and Asses Request Ratio. The data employed are table data of input-output Central Java of year 2000, Domestic Product Regional Bruto of Pemalang Regency of year 2003, Pemalang in Number of year 2003. Result of the research was (a) indicates that food stuff plants have low backward linkage by looking at Spreading Index. Thus, It was low enough in using output of another economic sector in production process, (b) The output of <b>foodstuff</b> plants sector is highly needed by another economic sector in Pemalang Regency. It can be known by forward linkage value of <b>foodstuff</b> plant measuring with a high Index of Sensitivity Degree value, (c) According to descriptive analysis result, <b>foodstuff</b> plants sector have the lowest Asses Input Ratio. It means that <b>foodstuff</b> plants needs the lowest Asses input from output of production process. (d) Based on the analysis result of Asses Request Ratio, <b>foodstuff</b> plants sector have low Asses Request Ratio. Means that it has output used for input between another economic sectors was smaller than output used as the last consumption.

40|$|Abstract — Refrigeration is {{important}} to sustain high <b>foodstuff</b> quality and lifetime. Keeping the <b>foodstuff</b> within temperature thresholds in supermarkets is also important due to legisla-tive requirements. Failure to do so can result in discarded <b>foodstuff,</b> a penalty fine to the shop owner, and health issues. However, the refrigeration system might not be dimensioned to cope with hot summer days or performance degradation over time. Two learning-based algorithms are therefore proposed for thermostatically controlled loads, which precools the <b>foodstuff</b> in display cases in an anticipatory manner based on how saturated the system has been in recent days. A simulation model of a supermarket refrigeration system is provided and evaluation of the precool strategies shows that negative thermal energy {{can be stored in}} <b>foodstuff</b> to cope with saturation. A system model or additional hardware is not required, which makes the algorithms easy to implement in existing systems.
