5|$|There {{are many}} accents that are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} London accents. The most well known of the London accents long ago acquired the Cockney label, which is heard both in London itself, and across the wider South East England region more generally. The accent of a 21st-century Londoner varies widely; what <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled Multicultural London English (MLE). The other widely heard and spoken accent is RP (Received Pronunciation) in various forms, which can often {{be heard in the}} media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this accent is not limited to London and South East England, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings.|$|E

25|$|The {{city has}} {{continued}} to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then, however, {{there has been a}} dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by a heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995–1997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes. In December 2002 Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The Third Ring Road, intermediate between the early 19th-century Garden Ring and the Soviet-era outer ring road, was completed in 2004.

25|$|According to archeological finds, the Ancestral Pueblo people, {{also known}} as the Anasazi (although that term <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more disused), began {{settling}} in the area in approximately 1500 BC. Eventually, they would spread throughout the entire northern section of the Southwest. This culture would go through several different eras lasting from approximately 1500 BC through the middle of the 15th century AD: the Basketmaker I, II, and III phases followed by the Pueblo I, II, III, and IV. As the Puebloans transitioned from a nomadic lifestyle to one based on agriculture, their first domiciles were pithouses. The Mogollon culture developed later than the Puebloan, arising in the eastern area of the region at around 300 BC. Their range would eventually extend deep into what would become Mexico, and dominate the southeastern portion of the Southwest. Their settlements would evolve over time from pit-dwellings through pueblos and finally also incorporating cliff-dwellings. The Hohokam were the last of these ancestral cultures to develop, somewhere around 1 AD, but they would grow to be the most populous of the three by 1300 AD, despite being the smallest of the three in terms of area, covering most of the southwest portion. Beginning in approximately 600 AD, the Hohokam began to develop an extensive series of irrigation canals; of the three major cultures in the Southwest, only the Hohokam developed irrigation as a means of watering their agriculture.|$|E

Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the subplot with April and Chris demonstrated how Parks often succeeds in pairing two characters that often seem to have little connection to each other.

[...] Even when leaving reality behind, however, Richardson considers that Fleming, [...] "even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek, ... remains maniacally readable". Richardson picked up on two areas relating to the characters of the book, saying that Goldfinger [...] "is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming's museum of super fiends", whilst, referring to the novel's central character, observed that [...] "the real trouble with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more synthetic and zombie-ish. Perhaps it is just as well." [...] Writing in The Manchester Guardian, Roy Perrott observed that [...] "Goldfinger...will not let [...] close admirers down".

500|$|Sirhan Sirhan is a Palestinian Arab with Jordanian citizenship, born in Jerusalem, {{who held}} {{strongly}} anti-Zionist beliefs.

RFK must die. RFK must be killed. Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated..... Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated before 5 June 68." [...] It {{has been suggested that}} the date of the assassination is significant, {{because it was the first}} anniversary of the start of the Six Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors. When Sirhan was booked by police, they found in his pocket a newspaper article that discussed Kennedy's support for Israel, and at his trial, Sirhan testified that he began to hate Kennedy after learning of this support. In 1989, he told David Frost: [...] "My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians". Some scholars believe the assassination was one of the first major incidents of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab–Israeli conflict in the Middle East.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} three films in the Die Hard series were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, {{alternate}} profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying [...] "It was about three months into it , and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it {{was just trying to}} make the best Die Hard movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be." [...] Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, [...] "I really wanted this one {{to live up to the}} promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more common, because they’re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film." [...] Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: [...] "It's unbelievable. I just saw it last week. I personally think, it's better than the first one." ...|$|E

Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory.
