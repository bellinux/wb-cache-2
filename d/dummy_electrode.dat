40|$|Neuroimmunological {{research}} has indicated that hypothalamic structures {{play an important role in}} the modulation of immunoresponsivity. We report that electrical stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus decreases the concentration of Immunoglobulin G (lgG) in rat serum. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either an anterior or <b>dummy</b> <b>electrode</b> group. Following the determination of baseline IgG concentrations animals were placed in an operant chamber where electrical stimulation was delivered to animals in the anterior group. Animals in the <b>dummy</b> <b>electrode</b> group were placed in an operant chamber but received no brain stimulation through the attached cable. IgG concentrations were determined for each animal 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours following each session in the operant chamber. Poststimulation measurement periods were counterbalanced across animals to control for possible order effects. A significant decrease in IgG concentrations was found between animals in the anterior group and animals in the <b>dummy</b> <b>electrode</b> group. An analysis was also performed to assess the effects of repeated measurements on IgG concentrations. As compared to the <b>dummy</b> <b>electrode</b> group, the anterior group displayed significantly higher IgG concentrations as a function of the number of measurements. The results of the present study indicate that anterior hypothalamic activity can change IgG concentrations without antigenic challenge and the relevance of this finding as applied to current research in Health Psychology is discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{reviews the}} {{cochlear}} histology from four hearing preservation cochlear implantation experiments conducted on 73 guinea pigs from our institution, and relates histopathological findings to residual hearing. All guinea pigs had normal hearing prior to surgery and underwent cochlear implantation via a cochleostomy with a silastic-platinum <b>dummy</b> <b>electrode.</b> Pure tone auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds from 2 to 32  kHz were recorded prior to surgery, {{and at one}} and four weeks postoperatively. The cochleae were then fixed in paraformaldehyde, decalcified, paraffin embedded, and mid-modiolar sections were prepared. The treatment groups were as follows: 1) Systemic dexamethasone, 0. 2  mg/kg administered 1  h before implantation, 2) Local dexamethasone, 2 % applied topically to the round window for 30  min prior to cochlear implantation, 3) Local n-acetyl cysteine, 200  μg applied topically to the round window for 30  min prior to implantation, 4) inoculation to keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH) prior to implantation, and 5) untreated controls. There was a significant correlation between {{the extent of the}} tissue reaction in the cochlea and the presence of foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), new bone formation and injury to the osseous spiral lamina (OSL). The extent of the tissue response, {{as a percentage of the}} area of the scala tympani, limited the best hearing that was observed four weeks after cochlear implantation. Poorer hearing at four weeks correlated with a more extensive tissue response, lower outer hair cell (OHC) counts and OSL injury in the basal turn. Progressive hearing loss was also correlated with the extent of tissue response. Hearing at 2  kHz, which corresponds to the region of the second cochlear turn, did not correspond with loco-regional inner hair cell (IHC), OHC or SGC counts. We conclude that cochlear injury is associated with poorer hearing early after implantation. The tissue response is related to indices of cochlear inflammation and injury. An extensive tissue response limits hearing at four weeks, and correlates with progressive hearing loss. These latter effects may be due to inflammation, but would also be consistent with interference of cochlear mechanics...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} it has been {{demonstrated}} that adult neurogenesis in distinct brain areas like the Subventricular Zone (SVZ) and the Subgranular Zone (SGZ) is influenced by Dopamine (DA). In the SVZ the release of DA most likely derives from collaterals of nigro-striatal projections whose synaptic endings contact amplifying adult neuronal stem cells (aNSCs). Since high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) may increase striatal DA levels as shown previously we hypothesized that STN-HFS may facilitate cell proliferation in the SVZ of naïve (healthy) rats. Methods: Either a customized microstimulation system (STN-HFS group) or a dummy microstimulation system (STN-SHAM group) was implanted in the left STN of naïve rats. After a recovery period of 7 days chronic STN-HFS was started. During the stimulation period of 10 days animals were daily injected with BrdU (5 -Bromo- 2 -desoxyuridin). Immunocytochemistry of BrdU (as an exogen marker of proliferation), as well as PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and Ki- 67 (as endogenous markers of proliferation) was performed in defined striatal sections containing the SVZ. After microscopically assisted cell counting {{the ratio of the}} mean cell density of BrdU-, Ki- 67 - and PCNA-positive cells within a predefined area (10. 000 μm) inside the SVZ between treated and untreated side was assessed and compared between the groups. Results: As a result, the ratio (treated/untreated side) of BrdU-positive cells was significantly higher in animals of the STN-HFS group compared to controls. Although there were no significant changes in the number of Ki- 67 or PCNA positive cells following STN-HFS we could document a higher cell count in the ipsilateral SVZ of animals treated with STN-HFS compared to the untreated side. Furthermore we observed a repressive effect of <b>dummy</b> <b>electrode</b> implantation on BrdU-, Ki- 67 - and PCNA- positive cells in the SVZ of the affected compared to the unaffected side. Conclusions: These data provide first evidence that chronic STN-HFS may increase the absolute number of newly formed cells in the SVZ of naïve rats. The design of the present study did not allow differentiating whether this effect was due to an enhanced proliferation or a positive effect on cell survival. Nevertheless the increase of Ki- 67 - and PCNA-positive cells, two markers expressed by proliferating cells in the ipsilateral SVZ of animals treated with STN-HFS underlines the hypothesis of a proliferative capacity of STN-HFS in naïve rats. According to the current state of relevant studies we suppose a complexity of causal mechanisms for the cellproliferative effect of STN-HFS in the SVZ. Enhanced levels of DA and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the neighboring Striatum could be the most important mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} a non-destructive measurement method of various permittivity in the multi-medium. To establish this method, {{we have used}} a measurement method of a long distance small parallel-plate air capacitor with an additional electrode called 2 ̆ 2 dummy 2 ̆ 2 in which an electric potential is fixed equal to one of the respective measurement plates. It has been found experimentally that the capacitance of the long capacitor is influenced by the location of its shielding and the <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes.</b> However, this phenomenon has not been studied theoretically yet. In this paper we will discuss about the effects of the <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes</b> and the shielding of the permittivity measuring capacitive-device by calculating capacitance and drawing the electric lines of force using the scalar potentials with 2 D Finite Element Method(FEM). The simulated model with 10 mm X 10 mm measurement plates with the distance of 40 mm in between, the predicted results based on the FEM reveal us that the capacitance of the capacitive-device is measured stably when the length between the inner edge and {{the outer edge of the}} <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes</b> is amounted to about 40 mm...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop skills}} {{sufficient}} for hearing preservation cochlear implant surgery, surgeons need to perform several electrode insertion trials in ex vivo temporal bones, thereby consuming relatively expensive electrode carriers. The objectives {{of this study}} were to evaluate the insertion characteristics of cochlear electrodes in a plastic scala tympani model and to fabricate radio opaque polymer filament <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes</b> of equivalent mechanical properties. In addition, this study should aid the design and development of new cochlear electrodes. Automated insertion force measurement is a new technique to reproducibly analyze and evaluate the insertion dynamics and mechanical characteristics of an electrode. Mechanical properties of MED-EL’s FLEX 28, FLEX 24, and FLEX 20 electrodes were assessed {{with the help of an}} automated insertion tool. Statistical analysis of the overall mechanical behavior of the electrodes and factors influencing the insertion force are discussed. Radio opaque <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes</b> of comparable characteristics were fabricated based on insertion force measurements. The platinum-iridium wires were replaced by polymer filament to provide sufficient stiffness to the electrodes and to eradicate the metallic artifacts in X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. These low-cost <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes</b> are cheap alternatives for surgical training and for in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo research purposes...|$|R
40|$|National audienceWhole-body {{vibration}} (WBV) {{has been}} shown to result in augmented muscle activity during the exposure to the vibration, which has been assessed with surface electromyography (sEMG). While numerous studies have focused on the evaluation of the optimal training parameters using sEMG recordings during WBV, its validity is still debated. Briefly, excessive peaks at the vibration frequency and its multiple harmonics are displayed in the sEMG frequency spectrum. Unfortunately, only a few studies have addressed this issue, and to date {{it is not clear whether}} the spikes observed in the frequency domain during WBV arise from stretch reflexes (Ritzmann et al., 2010), motion artifacts (Fratini et al., 2009), or both (Sebik et al., 2012). Therefore, the aim of this study was to gain insight about the origin of these excessive peaks by analyzing sEMG signals from muscles and signals from <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes</b> placed on the patella. It was hypothesized that (1) motion artifacts are observed in the patella signal at the vibration frequency and its multiple harmonics during WBV, and that (2) the sEMG of the spikes is linearly related to the sEMG without the spikes...|$|R
40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an {{abstract}} of a paper from XVI World Congress of Otohinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery 1997, published by Monduzzi Editore. This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} the publisher. Insertion of the electrode array of multiple channel cochlear implants may be aided using Hyalurate. It is felt that this substance acts as a lubricant allowing the array to be inserted more deeply and less traumatically. This has potential advantages of improving pitch perception in cochlear implant patients. To investigate the biosafety of Hyaluronate an animal study was undertaken. <b>Dummy</b> <b>electrodes</b> were inserted into the cochleae of six normal hearing cats. Hyaluronate was used as a lubricant in one ear and the other ear served as a control. Measurement of hearing thresholds before and after surgery did not reveal hearing loss attributable to the Hyaluronate. The temporal bones from these cats were sectioned and the histological sections analysed for evidence of spiral ganglion cell or hair cell loss. Initial results have not demonstrated poorer spiral ganglion cell survival or greater hair cell loss in the group in which Hyaluronate was used. 2 - 7 MarchOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: A "soft surgery" {{technique}} was applied, using {{various types of}} specifically designed <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes,</b> to mimic cochlear implantation in a guinea pig model, {{and the degree of}} hearing-preservation/cochlear damage was assessed. METHODS: Tricolor guinea pigs were divided into 3 groups: group A were implanted with electrodes without any contacts or wires (soft electrode), group B were implanted with electrodes having a metallic wire inside (stiff electrode), and group C underwent a cochleostomy procedure without implantation. Compound action potentials, in the range of 4 to 32 kHz, were used to assess electrophysiologic changes in the hearing function presurgery and postsurgery. Data were collected before surgery, at times t = 0 (immediately after surgery) and at 3, 7, 14, and 30 days. RESULTS: At low frequencies (4 - 8 kHz), an immediate elevation of hearing threshold was observed in all 3 groups. Higher threshold shifts were more consistent for group B implanted with a stiff electrode, in comparison to the other 2 groups. Animals from group C presented a recovery from hearing loss, starting 3 days after surgery. At high frequencies (16 - 32 kHz), the elevation of hearing threshold was higher, as compared with the data from the low frequencies. Group C animals presented oscillatory threshold shifts twice, and the recovery to normal threshold values occurred approximately at t = 14 days. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that cochleostomy is minimally harmful to the inner ear and that a soft electrode might better preserve the inner ear integrity than a rigid electrode...|$|R
40|$|Penetrating {{microelectrode}} arrays have a {{great potential}} {{to be used as}} control and communication interfaces for neuroprosthetics. A persistent obstacle in the clinical implementation of microelectrode arrays is the chronic degradation of these devices, putatively due to the foreign body response. Though researchers have studied the progression of the foreign body response and the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs on the efficacy of the implant, the exact biological mechanisms of implant degradation are not fully understood. To more closely investigate the effect of the foreign body response on device degradation, neuroinflammation can be exacerbated by coating <b>dummy</b> <b>electrodes</b> implanted into mice brains with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) – a cell wall component of bacteria which induces inflammation. Quantifying the amount of LPS released from a coated electrode is crucial in performing such an experiment. Using a Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test – a test based on the extract of the blood from horseshoe crab which reacts with LPS – the concentration of LPS can be accurately quantified, allowing for a more careful characterization of the inflammatory response. In particular, the devices coated in 1 mg/ml concentration of LPS eluted a mean mass of 4. 55 EU with a standard deviation of. 51, where 1 endotoxin unit (EU) ≈ 1 ng. A linear regression of the standard concentrations resulted in an r 2 of. 9806, indicating a reliable model for calculating the concentration of LPS present in a sample. These results suggest that LPS elution can be accurately and precisely measured using the LAL assay...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a study aimed at developing an indigenous {{moisture measuring device}} from locally available materials for grains {{based on the principle}} of resistance change of the material with corresponding change in moisture during drying. The developed device has four copper electrode cups positions in which both gauging and <b>dummy</b> copper <b>electrode</b> cups were placed to form Wheatstone bridge circuits of full, half and quarter for four, two and one gauging copper electrode cups respectively, while the remaining positions were used as dummies. These circuits were used to measure the resistances and hence obtaining the moisture content of the grains used. Grains of paddy rice, guinea corn and millet were used to test the device and it was observed that for full bridge circuits of each of the grains, paddy rice have a negative coefficient of correlation of - 0. 95, - 0. 99 for guinea corn and - 0. 99 for millet. The results obtained from predictive empirical equations when compared with the direct oven method, showed that the device can be used to predict or measure moisture content once calibrated...|$|R
