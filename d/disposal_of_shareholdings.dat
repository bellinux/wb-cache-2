40|$|On 10 June 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘CJ’) {{delivered}} its {{judgment in}} X AB v. Skatteverket (C- 686 / 13). The CJ held the non-deductibility for Swedish corporate tax purposes of realised {{foreign exchange losses}} on shareholdings eligible for relief under the Swedish participation exemption regime compatible with the fundamental freedoms. The case concerned a Swedish company that held a 45 % shareholding in a UK subsidiary company whose shares were issued in US dollars. Due to a devaluation of the US dollar relative to the Swedish krona, the Swedish shareholder company would be confronted with a foreign exchange loss upon a <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> its UK <b>shareholding.</b> Such a loss, however, would not be tax-deductible under the applicable Swedish tax rules. The CJ held such a treatment not to infringe the freedom of establishment, amongst others, because the non-deductibility {{would have been in}} place irrespective <b>of</b> whether the <b>shareholding</b> investment involved had been made in a Swedish company or in a company in another EU Member State...|$|R
50|$|On 10 February 2014, non-executive {{director}} Datuk Seri Syed Ali Alhabshee {{has ceased to}} be a substantial shareholder of the company following the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> his entire <b>shareholding</b> in a direct business transaction to Wong. Wong currently holds a 32.81% stake in Bright Packaging. In October 2013, Wong emerged as a dominant shareholder in Bright Packaging Industry Berhad, a main board listed company on Bursa Malaysia. This is the second public-listed company in which the 31-year-old Wong has a controlling stake after Asia Media. Wong acquired a 22.73% equity stake in the packaging company which also owns two freehold sites with a combined area of 136,998 square feet in Prime Klang valley's Subang Hi-Tech Industrial Park where its headquarters and factories are located. As of 31 August 2013, debt-free Bright Packaging had cash of $19.94 million while net assets per share stood at 62 cents. The market reacted positively after news of Wong's investment was made public and the stock increased another 17% on news of its expansion plan through rights issue. News of Wong's interest in taking the company private were denied by the Board in its annual general meeting held on 24 February 2014. Wong has quietly built up his stake in the company and currently holds 32.81% which is just short of the 33% threshold required to trigger a mandatory general offer.|$|R
40|$|The {{corporate}} {{leadership in}} Kenya Dairy Board is dormant in ensuring linkages between the Government and Public Private Partnership benefits the farmer, small scale milk processors instead leaving big timers in dairy industry to dominate. The recent trend has been towards big processors embarking in buying-out small milk processors. Brookside is on record to have bought-out Ilara Dairy, Spin Knit Dairy, Buzeki Dairy and its tactical <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> 40 % <b>shareholding</b> in favour <b>of</b> Banone Company of France. The dairy industry {{is headed for}} a monopoly in milk processing if the current trend is anything to go by. This is taking root despite Kippra clearly stating that the sector is un- exploited hence the Government should take this advantage of the poverty- reducing potential of livestock sub-sector. Recommendations over years on ways to revitalize the dairy industry {{with a view to}} empower the producer have never been implemented fully including the lukewarm participation of the market regulator KDB and the Government. The Government has been keen to privatise KCC, which will give private milk processors a leverage to continue dictating the terms of trade in the industry. There is a lot of emphasis on marketing activities of milk products where the farmer has no say or input. This {{is due to the fact}} that farmers are not directly involved in what happens after they struggle to deliver milk to the buyer.

40|$|Does {{the class}} <b>of</b> <b>shareholdings</b> matter for {{corporate}} performance? To answer the question, the paper starts by classifying <b>shareholdings</b> <b>of</b> Chinese publicly listed {{companies on the}} basis of the principle of ultimate ownership. A state-dominant shareholding structure is found, in that 81. 6 per cent of companies are identified as ultimately controlled by the state. In contrast to our identified shareholdings, the Chinese official shareholding classification is ambiguous for the identification of ultimate controllers of public corporations, which in turn has misled many previous studies in assessing the impact <b>of</b> <b>shareholding</b> classes on performance. Based on our newly established shareholding classes, we undertake a nested performance comparison between these different classes and find significant evidence from the Chinese data that the class <b>of</b> <b>shareholdings</b> does matter for company performance. The least inefficient shareholding class is the holding companies that are wholly listed and have focused industrial business through the state indirect control of the downstream public corporations. This finding provides ground for us to think more about how the corporate control mechanism could be further improved in China's current corporate governance reform.
