40|$|Introduction: Obesity is a {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). In an era of rapidly growing prevalence of obesity, it is important to explore the current knowledge, attitude, and practices of primary care physicians. Materials and Methods: Study participants were medical officers (MOs) of primary health centers in three districts of North Karnataka. The questionnaire was developed by a review of literature in the field and validated with five participants <b>for</b> scope, <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity.</b> Results/Discussion: Of the 102 participants, only 15 % were aware about the burden of obesity in India. HTN, DM, and CVD were indicated as comorbidities by 73, 78, and 60 participants, respectively. Only 25 and 12 participants indicated appropriate body mass index (BMI) cut-off values for overweight and obesity diagnosis. Of the 102 participants, 54 were not aware of the guidelines for obesity management. Practices and attitudes of the participants were encouraging. Nearly all of them felt that the adults with BMI within the healthy range should be encouraged to maintain their weight and, three-fourth of them agreed that most overweight persons should be treated for weight loss and small weight loss can achieve major medical benefit. However, nearly half of the participants′ responses were stereotypical as they felt only obese and overweight with comorbidities should be treated for weight loss. Two-thirds of them use BMI to diagnose overweight/obese and nearly all of them advice their patients to increase physical activity and restrict fat. Most of the participants were advising their patients to restrict sugar intake, increase fruits and vegetable consumption, reduce red meat, and avoid alcohol consumption. Conclusion: Present study exposed the lack of knowledge regarding obesity. However, practices and attitudes of the participants were promising. There is a need of in-service training to MOs to further improve their knowledge and practices towards management of obesity...|$|R
40|$|Environmental education, as a {{component}} of the school curriculum, is unique. Some aspects of the content change rapidly with new research, and environmental education is a relative newcomer to the curriculum. Assessment of the status of environmental education, therefore, needs to be done at relatively short intervals in order to assure that the curriculum is relevant and current. No needs assessment instrument could be found which would not only collect information about {{the quantity and quality of}} environmental education in a school setting, but also would gather the opinions of both teachers and administrators. The assumption was that knowledge from both levels of staff could provide communication important to the process of developing or modifying an effective, consistent environmental education curriculum. The purpose of the thesis, then, was to determine whether a needs assessment instrument could be developed which would provide useful answers to several questions determined to be helpful to curriculum planners. The procedures included development of the instrument (a questionnaire was chosen due to the desire for anonymity and the number of individuals to be surveyed), pilot testing it <b>for</b> content, <b>length</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity,</b> administration of the final form of the instrument to a test school district, analysis of the findings, and presentation of the findings in formats which illustrated the ability of the questionnaire to provide information useful to the planning process. It was concluded the needs assessment instrument did gather information about current and desired amounts of environmental education in the curriculum and effectively answered specific questions about topics and methods incorporated in environmental education. Furthermore, the questionnaire collected information which would allow planners to compare responses of teachers who have had environmental education training with responses of teachers who have not had such training. Finally, the survey provided a basis for comparing the opinions of teachers and administrators. In summary, the findings indicate the needs assessment instrument is a useful tool for curriculum planners in collecting much of the information necessary for a thorough needs assessment process. Additionally, the questionnaire is adaptable to diverse circumstances, and can be readily modified. This needs assessment instrument could prove valuable in the continuous process of evaluating and updating the various aspects of an environmental education curriculum with the goal of maintaining relevant and effective content.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} of K- 12 education have become familiar to {{citizens of the}} metroscape, but they are usually viewed {{through the lens of}} urban and suburban schools, with their problems of multi-ethnic populations, crowded classrooms, strained budgets, and the like. Metroscape® was curious about the struggles and triumphs of the schools in the rural areas of the region, so we sent our interviewer, Susan Wilson, a Portland freelance writer, to Willamina to talk to a small town education leader in hopes of glimpsing the realities of schooling kids in that often overlooked setting. A small-town principal is a versatile member of a close-knit community. When Tim France rolls up his sleeves to get to work, he might be chairing a committee meeting to discuss fundraising efforts, or he might be in a huddle on the football field coaching his team through a winning season. He leads an entirely different kind of team in his full-time job as principal at Willamina High School, a job requires that energetic leadership and a game plan all its own.

The introduction of pure lines and hybrids with improved <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width into the cropping system, necessitate studies on the combining ability and genetic components <b>for</b> the <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pods. Seven parents and 21 F 1 generations were planted for evaluation in a randomized complete block design with two replications. The {{results indicated that the}} means squares due to GCA <b>and</b> SCA <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pods were significant. The estimated variance due to SCA was greater than GCA variance <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pods at edible stage <b>and</b> vice versa <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pod at maturity. The study identified Parents 7, 6, 4 and 5 as best combiners <b>for</b> edible pod <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width, mature pod <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width. Component analysis indicated that the dominant genetic action predominate other genetic effects in the inheritance of <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pods. The dominance components (H 1 and H 2) were found to be greater than the additive gene effects (D). The ratio VH/D revealed overdominance loci for characters evaluated. The estimate F were positive (edible pod <b>length</b> <b>and</b> mature pod <b>length)</b> <b>and</b> negative (edible pod width and mature pod width). The proportion V 4 (DH 1 +F) / V 4 (DH 1 -F) was unity. While the ratio 4 H 2 / 4 H 1 = 0. 25 for all characters evaluated. The non-additive genetic effects accounted for a low to moderate heritability estimate in narrow sense recorded in the study. Both Oligogenic and polygenic action were found in the study.
