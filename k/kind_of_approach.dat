This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach,</b> or similar, was already in use with image filters, for instance by Zobel, but {{the concept of a}} [...] "reference filter" [...] is due to Sidney Darlington. Darlington (1939), was also the first to tabulate values for network synthesis prototype filters, nevertheless it had to wait until the 1950s before the Cauer-Darlington elliptic filter first came into use.|$|E

[...] An unusual case is [...] "Peace", a ballad that prioritizes a calm mood over melodic or harmonic effects. Owens observed that [...] "Many of his compositions contain no folk blues or gospel music elements, but instead have highly chromatic melodies supported by richly dissonant harmonies".

And {{now that}} we have pointed out the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{approach}}</b> most peculiarly English, that approach will guide us to the only style of villa architecture which can be called English,--the Elizabethan, and its varieties,--a style fantastic in its details, and capable of being subjected to no rule, but, as we think, well adapted for the scenery in which it arose. We allude not only to the pure Elizabethan, but even to the strange mixtures of classical ornaments with Gothic forms, which we find prevailing in the sixteenth century. In the most simple form, we have a building extending round three sides of a court, and, in the larger halls, round several interior courts, terminating in sharply gabled fronts, with broad oriels, divided into very narrow lights by channeled mullions, without decoration of any kind; the roof relieved by projecting dormer windows, whose lights are generally divided into three, terminating in very flat arches without cusps, the intermediate edge of the roof being battlemented. Then we find wreaths of ornament introduced {{at the base of the}} oriels;[27] ranges of short columns, the base of one upon the capital of another, running up beside them; the bases being very tall, sometimes decorated with knots of flower-work; the columns usually fluted,--wreathed, in richer examples, with ornament. The entrance is frequently formed by double ranges of those short columns, with intermediate arches, with shell canopies, and rich crests above.[28] This portico is carried up to some height above the roof, which is charged with an infinite variety of decorated chimneys.|$|E
