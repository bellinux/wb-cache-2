5000|$|The Roman Empire {{is where}} {{the idea of the}} [...] "West" [...] began to emerge. Due to Rome's central {{location}} {{at the heart of the}} Empire, [...] "West" [...] and [...] "East" [...] were terms used to denote provinces West and east of the capital itself. Therefore, Iberia (Portugal and Spain), Gaul (<b>France),</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> coast of North Africa (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco) and Britannia were all part of the [...] "West", while Greece, Cyprus, Anatolia, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, and Libya were part of the [...] "East". Italy itself was considered central, until the reforms of Diocletian, with the idea of formally dividing the Empire into true two halves: Eastern and Western.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{detailed}} study of vegetative and reproductive phases of several populations of a common species of Ulva from Thau Lagoon (<b>France,</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea) showed that the material is in good agreement with Asiatic Ulva pertusa Kjellman. Since October 1994, the date of its first observation in Thau Lagoon, U. pertusa has developed abundant repro-ductive populations. It is highly probable that this species was introduced at Thau along with oyster transfers from the Pacific. Ulva pertusa is new to the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} {{and the distribution}} of two cryptic sedentary gobies, Pomatoschistus microps and Pomatoschistus marmoratus, were investigated in several lagoons stretching along the Golfe du Lion, southern <b>France</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> coast, and Corsica. Pomatoschistus microps is the only sedentary Pomatoschistus species in two shallow lagoons with large variations of salinity and temperature. In contrast, P. marmoratus, another sedentary species, can be found preferentially in a deep salty lagoon with small salinity variations. Both species occur sympatrically in the Rhone Delta and hybridise, producing fertile offspring. Using allozymes, competition, linked to fitness, is invoked to explain the distribution pattern of these sibling species...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of a common Western Pacific representative of the Dictyotales, Rugulopteryx okamurae (Dawson) I. K. Hwang et al., in european waters was demonstrated for the first time. The species was collected in the coastal lagoon of Thau (<b>France,</b> <b>Mediterranean)</b> in 2002. The specimens from Europe are described and compared with R. okamurae. Their conspecificity with northwest Pacific populations is confirmed based on morphological and comparative sequence analysis of the plastid-encoded psbA gene. Rugulopteryx okamurae is probably introduced in the Thau lagoon along with Japanese oysters, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793), imported into Europe for mariculture purposes. Since its introduction, although reproductive structures were not observed, R. okamurae has established self-sustaining populations without displaying an invasive behaviour. Rugulopteryx okainurae {{can be expected to}} turn up wherever C. gigas is reared...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{identified}} 9 polymorphic compound microsatellite markers in the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, which was isolated from Thau lagoon (<b>France,</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea), using the compound microsatellite marker technique. These new microsatellites {{were characterized by}} screening DNA templates from 43 A. catenella clonal strains, which were collected from a seawater sample from Inokushi Bay (Oita Prefecture, Japan). These loci provide one class of highly variable genetic marker: the number of alleles ranged from 3 to 8, and the estimate of gene diversity varied between 0. 285 and 0. 762. We also analyzed the same 43 DNA samples using microsatellite markers previously identified for A. catenella, comparing the PCR amplification success, the number of alleles and gene diversity. These three parameters were not significantly different, showing that the compound microsatellite markers have the same potential to reveal A. catenella genetic structure. This simple and efficient method reduces the costs for developing SSR markers and for analyzing the genetic structure of populations, therefore, suggesting the effectiveness of applying this method to other species...|$|E

30|$|The role of {{salinity}} {{also appeared}} as driving {{the differences between}} the three seasonal surveys as well as through positive correlations with A. tonsa and marine rotifers. The highest salinity occurred during the dry survey when the zooplankton community was characterized by organisms such as the copepods Acartia tonsa, P. aculeatus, E. acutifrons, the rotifer B. plicatilis, and polychaete larvae which are very common in coastal oceanic areas or in coastal lagoons (David et al. [2007]). Acartia and Paracalanus species as well as E. acutifrons generally constitute the bulk of the copepod community in most coastal lagoons (Carli and Crisafi [1983]). Populations of A. tonsa persist in both coastal marine waters as well as within estuaries having low salinity [e.g., 4 psu, Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea (Katajisto et al. [1998])]. They can be also abundant in coastal lagoons within a wide salinity range [e.g., 5 to 36 psu; Berre Lagoon, south of <b>France,</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> (Delpy et al. [2012])], despite that it was demonstrated that this species shows high mortalities responding to high changes of salinity [> 10 to 15 psu (Cervetto et al. [1999])]. The role of salinity in shaping rotifer communities has also been demonstrated (Malekzadeh Viayeh and Špoljar [2012]).|$|E
40|$|Effects of sediment-released {{contaminants}} {{and nitrogen}} were assessed on phytoplankton communities sampled from Thau lagoon (<b>France,</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea) and one close offshore marine station. Phytoplankton {{was exposed to}} sediment elutriate (seawater containing a mix of metals, organic chemicals, and nutrients) or to ammonium enrichment for four days using immersed microcosms exposed to natural conditions of light and temperature. Functional (production - respiration balance) and structural (taxonomy and cell densities) responses of the phytoplankton community were assessed. In the lagoon, both treatments stimulated phytoplankton growth, compare to controls. Conversely in the offshore station, the phytoplankton growth was stimulated only with the sediment elutriate addition. In offshore and lagoon stations, both treatments caused {{a shift in the}} taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton. Proliferation of potentially toxic diatoms and dinoflagellates resulted from the addition of elutriate. Correspondence analysis determined that phytoplankton from the offshore station was more sensitive to both treatments compared to the lagoon community. According to daily production and respiration balance, lagoon community metabolism remained heterotrophic (P R) were observed in the offshore community. Direct toxicity of contaminants released from sediment, if any, was therefore masked by nutrient enrichment effects, whereas indirect evidence of contaminant pressure was highlighted by changes in community composition and metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Zoothamnium niveum (Ciliophora, Oligohymenophora) is a giant, colonial marine ciliate from sulphide-rich, shallow-water habitats, obligatorily {{associated}} with the ectosymbiotic, chemoautotrophic, sulphide-oxidizing bacterium ‘Candidatus Thiobios zoothamnicoli’. The aims {{of this study were}} to characterize the natural habitat and investigate growth, reproduction, survival and maintenance of the symbiosis from Corsica, <b>France</b> (<b>Mediterranean</b> Sea) using a flow-through respirometer providing stable chemical conditions. We were able to successfully cultivate the Z. niveum symbiosis during its entire lifespan and document reproduction, whereby the optimum conditions were found to range from 3 to 33  μmol l− 1 ΣH 2 S in normoxic seawater. Starting with an inoculum of 13 specimens, we found up to 173 new specimens that were asexually produced after only 11 days. Observed mean lifespan of the Z. niveum colonies was approximately 11 days and mean colony size reached 51 branches, from which rapid host division rates of up to every 4. 1 hours were calculated. Comparing the ectosymbiotic population from Z. niveum colonies collected from their natural habitat with those cultivated under optimal conditions, we found significant differences in the bacterial morphology and the frequency of dividing cells on distinct host parts, which is most likely caused by behaviour of the host ciliate. Applying different sulphide concentrations we revealed that the symbiosis was not able to survive without sulphide and was harmed by high sulphide conditions. To our knowledge, this study reports the first successful cultivation of a thiotrophic ectosymbiosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{authorization}} of {{veterinary medicinal products}} requires that they be assessed for nontarget effects in the environment. Numerous field studies have assessed these effects on dung organisms. However, {{few studies have examined}} effects on soil-dwelling organisms, which might be exposed to veterinary medicinal product residues released during dung degradation. The authors compared the abundance of earthworms and springtails in soil beneath dung from untreated cattle and from cattle treated 0 [*]d, 3 [*]d, 7 [*]d, 14 [*]d, and 28 [*]d previously with ivermectin. Study sites were located in different ecoregions in Switzerland (Continental), The Netherlands (Atlantic), <b>France</b> (<b>Mediterranean),</b> and Canada (Northern Mixed Grassland). Samples were collected using standard methods from 1 mo to 12 [*]mo after pat deposition. Ivermectin concentrations in soil beneath dung pats ranged from 0. 02 [*]mg/kg dry weight (3 [*]mo) to typically < 0. 006 [*]mg/kg dry weight (5 – 7 [*]mo). Earthworms were abundant and species-rich at the Swiss and Dutch sites, less common with fewer species at the French site, and essentially absent at the Canadian site. Diverse but highly variable communities of springtails were present at all sites. Overall, results showed little effect of residues on either earthworms or springtails. The authors recommend that inclusion of soil organisms in field studies to assess the nontarget effects of veterinary medicinal products be required only if earthworms or springtails exhibit sensitivity to the product in laboratory tests. </p...|$|E

The high visibility of the protection made by local policies and the comforting effect of normative sharing provided a normalization of people's trust in the protection. Through interactions, statements are built to be acceptable. It is more comfortable to "de-dramatize" than to dramatize: statements of relativism circulate more than the ones that open on the horizon of danger. Moreover, the current development of a "logic of safety" for urban risks reduction contradicts the prevention of flooding.

Investiguer la possibilité d'une « culture du risque » : Ethnographie de l'habiter en milieu exposé… et prisé. Séverine DURAND Les politiques de gestion des risques appellent à favoriser la prévention et à développer une « culture du risque » dans les zones exposées afin d'éviter l'écueil de l'oubli, pointé du doigt après une catastrophe. L'objet de la thèse, dont les résultats sont présentés dans cet article, fut de questionner cette possibilité en investiguant comment on habite, au quotidien, un milieu exposé aux inondations. Forte d'un travail ethno-graphique sur le temps long la thèse questionne ce qui circule à propos des inondations, comment des habitants s'emparent de la question et organisent leurs pratiques en fonction du risque. Le terrain d'étude est une ville prisée du Sud-est de la France qui a connu une explosion démographique récente. Ce cas d'étude permet de comprendre les mécanismes collectivement construits de mise en invisibilité du danger. La mise en visibilité des mesures de protection et l'effet confortant du partage normatif encouragent la normalisation de la confiance en la protection. Dans l'interaction, les énoncés se formulant sans cesse dans le souci de leur acceptabilité, dédramatiser est plus confortable que de dramatiser : les énoncés de relativisation du risque circulent davantage que ceux ouvrant sur l'horizon du danger. Surtout, ni les liens entre les habitants ni les liens des habitants au milieu ne fournissent le socle suffisant à l'élaboration collective que nécessite le déploiement d'une « culture du risque ».
