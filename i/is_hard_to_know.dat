25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E
25|$|During {{certain parts}} of the Amidah said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, Ashkenazi Jews {{traditionally}} go down to the floor upon their knees and make their upper body bowed over like an arch, similar to Muslims, though not exactly in the same manner. There are some variations in Ashkenazi customs as to how long one remains in this position. Some Jews among the Dor Daim and Talmidhe haRambam understand both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmudic source texts concerning bowing in the Shemoneh Esreh to be teaching that one must always prostrate, lying flat on the ground, not only during the High Holy Days, but throughout the year during the four bows of the Amidah. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the percentage of those who hold by the latter view, the likelihood being that most who accept such a view usually only do so in private or when praying among like-minded people.|$|E
500|$|Richard Fox {{and others}} note that while Wooden Leg's version is corroborated by the oral {{tradition}} of other Cheyenne witnesses, notably that of Kate Big Head, {{a young woman who}} witnessed the battle, there is no corroboration in {{the oral tradition}} of the Sioux. Fox concludes that [...] "quite simply, the contention is nonsense. A few troopers undoubtedly took their own lives, but it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what factors fostered the idea of wholesale suicide". Fox in his turn has been criticized for selectively using Indian oral tradition when it suits him, but discarding it as nonsense when he finds it disagreeable.|$|E

500|$|Two {{days after}} Phips left the Boston area, Increase Mather gave a rousing {{speech to the}} deputies and freemen advising them not {{to submit to the}} crown and to resist the quo warranto. One {{historian}} calls this Increase Mather's [...] "first important entry into politics." [...] {Mather's [...] "Remarkable Providences" [...] was distributed this same month, with echoes to the New England government Increase Mather assembles in 1692.} It had been Phips' debut into colonial politics too, if clumsily and involuntarily. [...] To what extent he was swayed by the arguments of Randolph as they crossed the Atlantic, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> but Phips certainly played the role with bluster, and he seems to have spoken up as a royalist to the Boston government in the meetings he had with Bradstreet and Stoughton, at least as recorded by Knepp. [...] By 1688, Phips would cross over to Increase Mather's side and begin to consistently oppose Randolph and the Dominion government he helped to bring about, and with a vehemence that would seem to suggest some degree of shame and dismay for the role he played as captain of HMS Rose in 1683-4.|$|E

2500|$|Though the {{experiment}} did not isolate what exactly makes up gay male speech, {{it seemed to}} indicate that variations in intonation and pitch affect the judgment of men’s speech as “gay” or “straight.” [...] However, {{the difference was not}} statistically significant and did not occur in all speech contexts.

2500|$|There {{appears to}} have been no time for an {{organized}} evacuation. [...] Many people wore lifejackets, and two wooden lifeboats floated away (the 8 steel lifeboats sank).

[...] It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why, if the ship took half an hour to sink, why so many people were below decks, but there could be many reasons. [...] As seawater invaded the ship, the boiler exploded, buckling the deck and killing many people. [...] Oil fuel spilled into the water, choking people who were trying to swim away. [...] Sophia had been equipped with extra flotation devices, on the theory that people could cling to these in the water awaiting rescue. [...] These were worthless, as the cold seawater would kill a swimmer long before rescue could arrive.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Carnegie libraries the condition of libraries in small town Illinois can be described as poor, at least based on the descriptions in correspondence to Bertram regarding the grants. Littered among the glowing self-reviews of various communities are indications of the state of libraries in communities seeking Carnegie grants. For instance, in Oregon, Illinois, the Oregon Public Library was forced to occupy [...] "undesirable rented rooms," [...] first in a drug store and then later in a bank building. The 12,000 volume library in Havana was housed in a small room in city hall, cluttered among other municipal offices and departments. The accuracy of these statements <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> as the communities were vying for competitive grants for new libraries, but the correspondence can give some idea of the condition of libraries around the state prior to the influx of Carnegie's money.|$|E

2500|$|Delbanco {{argues that}} Melville anticipates Sigmund Freud’s {{assertion}} that the sexual behavior of each human being transgresses [...] "the standard of normality" [...] to some extent. The novel, Delbanco feels, is ambivalent {{in dealing with the}} [...] "rather too loving" [...] supervision of his mother and his [...] "ardent sentiment" [...] for Glen, the young man who is his cousin, with whom he explored [...] "the preliminary love-friendship of boys." [...] Yet, continues Delbanco, after an extended discussion, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether critics who now see Melville as a homosexual are simply making a long overdue acknowledgment or whether gay readers are projecting their own feelings onto Melville – or both. The novel is, after all, subtitled [...] "The Ambiguities."
