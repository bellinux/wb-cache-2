40|$|Hail strikes, {{possibly}} exceeding {{an energy}} level of 50 J, may cause damage to thin-gauged composite airplane {{structures in the}} form of an indentation or puncture of the top facesheet. If not repaired properly, they may trigger extensive damage to airplane structures and disruptions to airline operations, therefore posing a major maintenance and repair concern for the airlines. It is important that both the original equipment manufacturer and the airlines be able to classify the <b>hail</b> <b>strike</b> damage in order to establish appropriate repair procedures. This study presents a methodology to assist engineers in the classification of the repair type for <b>hail</b> <b>strike</b> damage through the determination of allowable damage size. The methodology involves an accurate prediction of stress and strain fields and residual strength prediction. The stress analysis is performed by utilizing a plate element based on a higher-order single-layer theory. The damage zone model, previously used for notched panels, has been employed to predict the residual strength of sandwich panels with indented facesheets subjected to tensile load. The failure load is established when crack propagation in the facesheet becomes unstable...|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{composite}} sandwich {{panels are}} being utilized increasingly as primary load-carrying components in aircraft and aerospace structures. Serving in this capacity, these structures {{are subjected to}} impacts such as tool drops, <b>hail,</b> bird <b>strikes,</b> and runway debris. Unlike for their solid metallic counterparts, predictions {{of the effects of}} low-velocity impact damage are difficult and are still relatively immature. Sandwich panels in particular are sensitive to localized impact. For making a systematic study of impact on composite sandwich panels under these conditions, suitable equipment was designed and fabricated. This article describes the salient features of indigenously developed test equipment for testing localized, penetrating impact on sandwich panels. The size of the sandwich panels in question are 150 X 150 mm 2 with a typical thickness of 16 - 25 mm. The impact velocities are in the region 2 - 6 m/s, with an impactor mass between 2. 5 and 12. 5 kg, and two types of impactors were used: hemispherical impactor with diameter of 12. 5 mm and flat impactor of 25 x 25 mm. Using this equipment laminated composites, sandwich panels and polymer sheets can be tested to assess the resistance to falling weight in the low velocity region. The piezeo - electric sensor of the tester facilitates evaluation of absorbed load and absorbed energy and thus the performance of sandwich structure subjected to single impact, which in turn is useful for the development of useful criteria for materials selection...|$|R

40|$|This {{preliminary}} report explains how severe weather moved through South Australia {{on the afternoon}} of Wednesday 28 September 2016, with high winds, thunderstorms, lightning <b>strikes,</b> <b>hail,</b> and heavy rainfall. The weather resulted in multiple transmission system faults including, in the space of 12 seconds, the loss of three major 275 kV transmission lines north of Adelaide. Generation initially rode through the faults, but at 16 : 18 hrs, following multiple faults in a short period, 315 MW of wind generation disconnected, affecting the region north of Adelaide. The uncontrolled reduction in generation increased the flow on the main Victorian interconnector (Heywood) to make up the deficit and resulted in the interconnector overloading. To avoid damage to the interconnector, the automatic-protection mechanism activated, tripping the interconnector and resulting in the remaining customer load and electricity generation in SA being lost. This automatic-protection operated in less than half a second at 16 : 18 hrs and the event resulted in the SA regional electricity market being suspended. While the event was triggered by extreme weather, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) will conduct a thorough investigation into how each component of the electricity system responded under these circumstances. In an ever-changing environment, AEMO’s ongoing responsibility continues to be to safely and securely manage the power system and wholesale electricity markets to deliver energy security for all Australians. AEMO will continue to analyse the events of last Wednesday and will provide a further update on Wednesday 19 October. AEMO expects that a detailed report on the SA region Black System, including recommendations, may take up to six months to complete...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{safety issue}} {{for the design of}} primary aircraft structures is vulnerability and damage tolerance due to foreign object impact from bird <b>strike,</b> <b>hail,</b> tyre rubber and metal fragments. The damage tolerance strategy for the aircraft industry is based on defining critical damage states for composites which are linked to damage visibility and hence damage detection during service. Currently impact tests on aircraft structures are carried out on test specimens supported in a test fixture in a stress-free condition. However aircraft fuselage and wing structures in flight are subjected to quasi-static loads up to design limit load, hence foreign object impacts usually occur on preloaded structures which may influence damage tolerance. This study commissioned by EASA under the project name LIBCOS focuses on a comprehensive test programme investigating the influence of pre-loads on the residual strength of composite generic panels after impact, representative of fuselage bay panels. To that aim, a total of 78 tests have been conducted: 57 on composite plates and 21 on aluminium plates for comparison. The test programme used representative composite fuselage bay panels situated between frames and stringers. Material selected is an aerospace UD carbon epoxy prepreg Cycom 977 - 2 - 35 - 12 KHTS- 134 - 300 from Cytec. Plates with impact area 500 mm x 170 mm are loaded in axial tension or compression in a new hydraulic pre-stressing frame designed to fit in the DLR gas gun target chamber and are then tested under impact. Impact tests are carried out with a 60 mm diameter gas gun at velocities in the range 64 – 136 m/s, and impact energies 36 – 125 J. Two main impact scenarios are considered: notch damage from a 12 mm steel cube projectile, representative of impact from engine fragments or metal objects, and blunt impact damage from glass balls (Ø 24 - 25 mm), which could represent hail or runway stone debris. Impact damage is detected by visual inspection and quantified with lock-in thermography, especially for delamination. Depending on the preload regime, corresponding residual strength tests are carried out on each plate. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{safety issue}} {{for the design of}} primary aircraft structures is vulnerability and damage tolerance due to foreign object impact from bird <b>strike,</b> <b>hail,</b> tyre rubber and metal fragments. The damage tolerance strategy for the aircraft industry is based on defining critical damage states for materials which are linked to damage visibility and hence damage detection during service. The paper describes an experimental damage tolerance study carried out for EASA on the ‘Significance of Load upon Impact Behaviour of Composite Structure’ (LIBCOS). Currently impact tests on aircraft structures are carried out on test specimens supported in a test fixture in a stress-free condition. However aircraft fuselage and wing structures in flight are subjected to quasi-static loads up to design limit load, hence foreign object impacts usually occur on preloaded structures which may influence damage tolerance. LIBCOS studied experimentally the effect of preloads on impact damage in carbon/epoxy and aluminium structures, and on subsequent residual strengths of damaged structures. The test programme used representative aluminium and composite fuselage bay panels situated between frames and stringers. The materials selected were alumiunum 2024 and an aerospace UD carbon fibre toughened epoxy prepreg. Plates with impact area 500 mm x 170 mm were loaded in axial tension or compression in a new hydraulic pre-stressing frame designed to fit in the DLR gas gun target chamber. Pre-load levels in tension were representative of design limit loads for fuselage panels of this size, and maximum compression preloads were in the post-buckle region. Impact tests were carried out with a 60 mm diameter gas gun at velocities in the range 64 – 136 m/s, and impact energies 36 – 125 J. Two main impact scenarios were considered: notch damage from a 12 mm steel cube projectile, representative of impact from engine fragments or metal objects; blunt impact damage from glass balls, which could represent hail or runway stone debris. Impact damage was detected by visual inspection and lock-in thermography. The influence of preload and impact damage on residual strengths were studied and test results analysed in the context of damage tolerance requirements and aircraft safety. The test programme showed no significant interaction between tension/compression preload and impact damage for the aluminium panels. Composite panels in tension and compression with visible impact damage (VID) from hard body notch impact tests with complete penetration showed very good structural integrity, with no significant reduction in strength due to preloading. However, blunt impact tests led to large delamination damage regions which had a strong influence on plate bending properties and caused lower compression strengths in buckling. Test results showed that compression pre-load intensified this trend. Aircraft damage tolerance for barely visible impact damage (BVID) in composite panels with and without preloads therefore requires more careful assessment, since the damaged structure has to sustain design limit load in flight up to the next inspection...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Masters of Engineering (MEng) - Aerospace thesis was to {{investigate}} the durability of Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors (PWAS) for the health monitoring of composite structures. One significant challenge faced by the aviation industry is the cost and time associated with maintaining aircrafts, in particular, aging airliners. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a possible approach to reduce the high cost of inspection and maintenance. However, before SHM systems can be fully utilised in aerospace structures several questions need to be answered, in particular, concerns about their long-term durability and survivabilityAfter a comprehensive literature review, three specific areas were identified as warranting further investigation, namely, static and fatigue loading, impact events and numerical modelling. For the experimental investigation, a carbon fibre/epoxy composite host was chosen with PWAS bonded to the surface and/or embedded in the mid-plane of specimens. A method for embedding the PWAS into the composite laminates was successfully developed. The performance of the sensors under different external loading was then monitored using the capacitance, output voltage and electro-mechanical impedance of the sensors [...] Static and fatigue four-point bending tests were performed to study the durability of PWAS under tensile and compression strain. Both the surface-bonded and embedded sensors were used in these experiments. Those sensors subjected to compression strain suffered from cohesive failure under both static and fatigue testing. Under static testing, those PWAS bonded to the tensile surface of the host composites exhibited an initial increase in the capacitance followed by almost no change at higher strain levels. Under fatigue loading, the PWAS subjected to tensile strain performed much better than those under compression loading. The effects of impact events on surface-bonded and embedded PWAS was also investigated. Due to their brittle nature, both composites and PWAS are extremely susceptible to impact loading, which for the case of aircrafts could be caused by events such as bird <b>strikes,</b> <b>hail</b> or tyre debris. Tests were conducted with the impact load directly over the PWAS and at a designated distance away, with different impact energy levels. Results showed that sensors bonded on the back face or embedded into the composite could survive impact energies up to 7 joules, after which significant changes in their performance, as well as physical cracking, was found to occur. The final part of this investigation was focused on numerical modelling, in particular, developing a methodology to distinguish between sensor degradation and structural damage. The numerical model consists of a 3 D representation of a free PWAS and a host composite laminate with a bonded sensor while the impedance for both cases was analysed. Findings were compared with the experimental results and good agreements attained for both instances. Using the bonded model as a base, three modes of damage were then investigated which included, debonding of the sensor, structural damage with delamination in the composite and a crack in the PWAS. The Master&# 039;s thesis concludes with a summary of the major finding from this investigation and provides several recommendations for future research into PWAS durability...|$|R
40|$|As {{global warming}} is a prime concern to the {{wellbeing}} of the planet, lighter planes are a requirement to reduce CO 2 emissions. Light structures made of carbon epoxy composite materials are of particular interest but are sensitive to impacts such as <b>hail</b> or bird <b>strikes.</b> Static and dynamic testing of composite specimens and structures (from aeronautical standard) through novel testing methods was the first aim of this PhD research. Subsequently it led to novel material characterisation and material parameters calibration for which numerical simulations of impact responses could be developed. In this research further investigation under static, dynamic and impact loading of two certified aeronautical materials occurred. Carbon non crimp fabric epoxy (tufted and untufted) response was investigated. Novel tests and testing methods were developed for in-plane and for delamination focussing {{on the use of}} optical analysis using digital image correlation (DIC) and high speed cameras. A novel damage detection method was proposed using DIC. The experimental data set was used to calibrate a damage model with imposed strain rate laws and added delamination Mode I and II interface prior to a punch validation study. A novel compression apparatus designed for DIC usage worked well in static and dynamic. A novel intermediate strain rate tensile test worked better on bias direction lay-up than on axial one. Dynamic DIC method proved of interest to record strains up to strain rate achieved with a Split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus. In quasi static tufting reduced axial properties considerably but had little effect in shear loading, in addition it increased significantly the resistance to delamination and reduced the crack speed in dynamic. The damage fields generated allowed for the detection of damage progression for various load cases. More damage occurred in compression and shear than in tension as the tufted laminate showed more pronounced damage than the untufted one. The dynamic effect of tufting on in-plane and impact response was reduced as it increased considerably delamination resistance in Mode I and II. For both tufted and untufted NCF composites, strong strain rate effects were detected from a low speed on the in–plane strength and failure strain as no or little effects were recorded on the material stiffness. Novel dynamic delamination Mode I and II tests combined with optical analysis provided possibilities to detect rate effects and crack speed propagation while loaded in pure mode I and II. No strain rate effects were recorded in delamination Mode I apart from a slight effect during crack initiation which was stronger for the tufted material. In Mode II a slight rate effect was detected for the tufted interface during crack propagation. During out-of-plane impact loading at intermediate speed, a minor negative loading rate effect was detected. The model calibrated in damage, delamination and strain rate prove useful for dynamic DCB representation and assessment of possible mix mode crack loading. Modelling tufts as P-link was of interest but requires further investigation. Damage and strain rate was well modelled in tension, compression and bias direction loading, even if the strain rate shear law would require some modification. A Meso-scale model was validated successfully by means that the model responses would follow the experimental trends in quasi static loading but with the modification of 4 parameters among ± 50. Further research could extend its use for impact modelling. This research showed the complexity of the failure mechanism occurring in composite materials, modelling them at high speed in the plane and in out of plane impact remains a difficult challenge. Carbon composites damage sensitivity is significant and invisible to the naked eye for some load cases and lay-ups necessitating regular non destructive testing on aging airframe...|$|R
