In our implementation students create models from atmospheric data and solve them to determine which weather conditions favour high levels of pollutants in the atmosphere of Monterrey metropolitan area in Mexico. To carry out the strategy we structure course topics around this single comprehensive and integrative project. Students follow a procedure consisting of 4 stages. In the first stage they do statistical analysis of the data. In the second stage, students interpolate missing data and project component data to a 2 D map of the metro area. In the third stage students create the mathematical models by carrying out curve fitting through least squares technique. In the third stage, students solve the models by finding roots, solving systems of equations, solving differential equations or integrating. The final deliverable is to determine under which weather conditions there can be an environmental situation that put people's health in <b>danger.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the strategy is presented as well as statistical results...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to show that risk-management {{behaviors}} of highway users in tunnel-fire situations are dependent on their knowledge of safety devices and their danger-handling behavior. We hypothesized that the unpredictability of the circumstances in which fires start, as well as drivers' lack of knowledge about safety devices, are likely to have an impact on their behavior. The present study is a detailed analysis of actual fires that have occurred in tunnels, with a close examination of users' evacuation strategies and procedures. In our analysis of 11 tunnel fires, we studied driver behaviors and the strategies they use to cope with a fire. The tunnel users in these fires encountered difficulties both in perceiving signs of danger and in receiving warnings of the <b>danger.</b> The <b>analysis</b> showed that they engaged in a variety of evacuation behaviors and implemented few collective strategies to protect themselves. The problems were related to poor design or equipment, difficulty using safety devices or processing information, or a lack of emergency signals.

40|$|Patterns of {{masculine}} and feminine portrayals can be found everywhere, yet one place sociologists tend not to look is in novels. Young adult novels have generated 27 million dollars in e-books alone in 2011, with paranormal romances and dystopian genres making {{up the majority of}} the sales (Scott, 2013).

The analysis of external event impact on the NPP safe operation, assessment of the event occurrence, sensitivity analysis, and recommendations for safety improvements are performed for investigated external hazards. Such events as aircraft crash, extreme rains and winds, forest fire and flying parts of the turbine are analysed. The models are developed and probabilities are calculated.

Even in case when the external events analysis show rather limited <b>danger,</b> the sensitivity <b>analysis</b> can determine the highest influence causes.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} of the Bachelor ofLaws degree, Strathmore university law schoolWhile it has become the object of humanity to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number, it is of central importance that this goal does not coincide with the violation of the very right that makes us human, the very right that ensures equality among all born within the species, and the very right that gives meaning to mutual and beneficial co-existence. This research paper deals with human embryonic stem cell research – a procedure that, in its roots, contains the element of destruction of a human embryo. The respect of the right to life is such that, as Kenyan law provides, life begins at conception. This is the single most significant occasion in a living being’s actuality. When this is taken away in the name of research or whatever it may be, the innate right to living is obliterated. And who knows what next. As it is a new field in the area of medicine and law, this research has been conducted using secondary sources. Accredited articles, journals, books and presentations have been used to bring out the issue of human embryonic stem cell research. This paper has brought to light the fact that both Kenyan municipal law and international law are very clear on the right to life, its essence and protection. I have found, within this research, that not only is the violation of the right to life unfair upon the unknowing being, but it is a burden, torture and a silent source of anguish and depression among those vulnerable groups of people close to the life that is lost. This is unjust and thoughtless. In an effort to forestall these <b>dangers,</b> this <b>analysis</b> therefore suggests a total ban of embryonic stem cell research in humans and urges states, especially developing ones, to focus on more pressing issues in which their funds will be better applied.

40|$|The {{question}} of how to optimally design judicial institutions is one of central importance to the scholarship focused on courts. Basic questions such as whether there should be mandatory retirement for judges, whether judges should be expected to write their own opinions and whether greater racial or gender diversity on the courts improves decision making are optimal design questions. Given the vast variation in the types of judicial system designs used around the world (and even within the United States), {{it should be possible to}} conduct a comparative analysis of the relative efficacy of the different designs. These comparisons cannot be evaluated, however, without first tackling the matter of how to measure justice or judicial performance. Although within the legal academy and the judiciary there is considerable skepticism and hostility to the measurement project, we argue that the project is worth attempting for both judges and academics. That said, the simple measures often used today, while necessary, cannot be relied on exclusively. To achieve a more reliable and useful measurement, judges must be involved in the process of arriving at the right characteristics to measure and the right ways to measure them.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of useful {{information}} about cal-cium metabolism in man has been obtained by balance technics. Balance studies give only net changes in total body calcium and do not indicate whether changes in balance result from alterations of rates of movement into or out of bone. For example, positive balance could result from in-creased bone deposition or decreased bone resorp-tion. Similarly, balance could be unchanged if increased resorption were matched by increased deposition. Rates of bone deposition have been measured in man using Ca 45 and Ca 47 as tracers (1 - 1 1). Isotopes of strontium have been similarly used (5, 6, 8, 11 - 16), since strontium is a bone-seeking element whose distribution in the body {{is similar to that}} of calcium. Accumulated experi-ence suggests that cautious use of these bone-seeking radionuclides in human subjects is without demonstrable risk. Nevertheless, this experience is still limited both in numbers of sub-jects and length of observation.

40|$|The Mediterranean Pyrenees, at {{the eastern}} end of the range, is a very popular area. Its highest peak is at 2900 m a. s. l. and there are {{numerous}} peaks above 2000 m, with rounded relief and sparse vegetation on the latter height. One of its significant winter climatic features is the sudden entrance of cold air with violent northern winds, drop in temperatures and very low wind chill values. Such advections are established after the passage of a snowy cold front and, consequently, there is abundant transport of both new and existing snow that reduces horizontal visibility. The post-frontal conditions at high altitudes represent a serious threat to humans. The review done shows that the hikers immersed in an environment of low visibility, strong winds and very low temperatures can quickly become disoriented, suffer frostbite and hypothermia and slip on the ice. The characterization of a series of accidents occurred in this geographical area, identified in the press, shows in this paper that the phenomena associated with northern winter advections is an element of danger to be considered in the evaluation of natural hazards in that area. In addition, the multiple character of many of the events suggests that there is high vulnerability to such <b>dangers.</b> The climatological <b>analysis</b> presented suggests that such weather conditions are not uncommon in the winter, although the most serious accidents have been registered under especially strong and cold flows.

Due the growing legislation related with food safety and due to the consumers growing needs the food industry is implementing systems to control food safety hazards, using, most of the times, the certification of their quality management and safety systems. The implementation of the ISO 22000 : 2005 Food safety management systems – Requirements for any organization in the food chain is based in interactive communication, in HACCP principles and in prerequisite programs. As a result the products are safe to the consumer when prepared and consumed according to their intended use. Although there are other references, unlike the others, ISO 22000 does not include an exhaustive list of good practices. In the case of ISO 22000 the good practices are defined by the organization. Among the several advantages of ISO 22000 : 2005 implementation, it can be mention the resources optimization, the improvement in documentation, a more efficient hazards control in food safety, the application focused in final results and the international recognition and trust created among the other actors in the food chain as a result of its ability to identify and control food safety hazards This paper is about the implementation of ISO 22000 : 2005 in Kilom, SA and its main purpose was to describe some phases with the focus on the prerequisite programs of suppliers and raw materials control, drinking water control, monitoring and measuring equipments control, validate the food safety control measures and hazard analysis of raw materials.. To validate food safety control measures, analyzes were done to the maintenance of temperature during the transport, to the elimination of microbial load in the heat treatments and to products cooling time after their processing. After the suppliers evaluation it can be concluded that 89 % of suppliers are reasonable and only 19 % can be classified as good. Regarding the monitoring of drinking water it was verified that the system is under control and only presents deviations when a breakdown occurs. The control of the monitoring and measuring equipments showed that each device is according to legal and internal requirements. Validate food safety control measures reveals that they fulfill their function of controlling the inherent <b>danger.</b> Finally the <b>analysis</b> to raw materials dangers allowed defining the control measures for each raw material. It was verified that the biological and physical dangers are controlled inside the unity, but the chemical and allergens dangers are controlled only by the selection and evaluation of the suppliers.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} Water Accounting Plus (WA+), {{which is}} a new framework designed to provide explicit spatial information on water depletion and net withdrawal processes in complex river basins. WA+ is a simple, yet comprehensive and understandable water accounting framework that provides a standardized way of data collection and a presentation system that describes the overall land and water management situation in complex river basins. WA+ tracks water depletions rather than withdrawals and it goes past flow and run-off accounting. Rainfall is a recognized key hydrological process in WA+, and {{only a portion of}} total rainfall translates to stream flows and ground water recharge. A significant portion of the rainfall is directly depleted by natural processes such as ET from natural vegetation or rainfed plantations and crops. These natural water depletions bring about economic benefits and provide many services. Hence, by accounting only for run-off these benefits and uses of water will be discounted and the full picture on water flows and the gains will be distorted. WA+ explicitly recognizes the influence of land use on the water cycle and provides the link between water balance, land use and water use as well as management options to modify it, by grouping land use classes with common management characteristics. Information on water supply, water depletion processes, beneficial and non-beneficial depletion, biomass production, water and land productivity, and water withdrawals and reuse are presented in WA+. Land use is also central in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other new approaches related to climate smart agriculture. In an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, many countries also study the carbon accounts of rural areas. The WA+ framework improves understanding of the current state of a basin, issues, future challenges, and improvement opportunities. It provides the information that will help managers to make the basin more climate secure and to adapt to periods of droughts and floods. It can be used to monitor changes in a basin’s water resources situation and to assess the impacts of future interventions such as large scale land use change and expanding irrigated agriculture. To ensure global applicability of WA+ the framework is designed to primarily use data from open access satellite measurements. To showcase WA+ application, this thesis presents a case study from the Indus Basin. This pilot study demonstrates how the WA+ framework can be implemented to provide much-needed explicit information on the water resources situation, depletion, and productivity, in a systematic way by using minimum ground measured data and how the accounting results can be used to identify weaknesses, strengths, and opportunities. The accounting results show that the Indus basin is nearly a closed basin in which more than 95 % of the available water is depleted while half of the water depletion is through processes that produce very little or no benefits, i. e. non-beneficial depletion. The majority of these non-beneficial depletion occurs via excessive soil evaporation of shallow water table areas. Hence, large amounts of valuable groundwater resources are vaporized non-beneficially into the atmosphere. The results also show that total annual water depletion in the basin plus outflows exceeds total precipitation. This situation has resulted in reduction in storage, especially groundwater storage. Such a fast decline in groundwater storage may have major implications for the sustainability of the basin. Not only it becomes an environmental crisis, also the food security is at <b>danger.</b> Scenario <b>analysis</b> show - based on a single year analysis - that through decreasing wasteful soil evaporation in agricultural areas, particularly in irrigated land an amount of 37. 8 km 3 can be saved. If interventions are not timely implemented, retirement of irrigated land seems unavoidable. The WA+ sheets were deemed useful to understand the impact of certain interventions. WA+ uses satellite measurements of land and water use data. All satellite data parameters have some level of uncertainty and error that needs {{to be taken into account}} because satellites are measuring hydrological processes indirectly. The errors in large water volumes (i. e. rainfall and ET) may result in large errors in river and aquifer flows. Thus the reliability of satellite measurements of land and water use data is investigated in this thesis. A comprehensive literature review on accuracy of the main satellite based estimates used in WA+, namely ET, rainfall, and land use land cover was conducted. For each parameter an error probability distribution function (PDF) is fitted from peer reviewed articles. The results show that the mean absolute error for satellite-based estimates of ET, rainfall, and land use classification are 5. 4 %, 18. 5 %, 14. 6 % respectively. The largest error is thus associated with rainfall. Bias correction and local calibration of global and regional rainfall products seem to improve the quality of the data layers. In contrast to rainfall, the error in satellite-based ET is relatively small. ET is a vital component of the hydrological cycle. Results show that remotely sensed ET is reliable enough to be used both as input into distributed hydrological models, and as a means to calibrate the simulations. Nonetheless, despite the existing potential and accuracy, satellite-based ET is under-utilized in hydrological studies. Contributing factors are presumably the difficulty to access and acquire reliable ET data through the public domain, and the difficulty to compare it with reliable field data. The land use classifications come with an overall error of 14. 6 %. This level of accuracy, although acceptable, calls for improvements given the wide use of these maps. Another important issue is the need for a new type of land use mapping dedicated to agricultural and river basin water management issues. Currently, most legends are meant to describe ecosystems, instead of classes with differences in water management. Furthermore this thesis explores the impact of the uncertainty of the satellite measurement on the reliability of WA+ outputs. Predictive uncertainty of WA+ outputs was studied for the Awash River basin in Ethiopia. The Monte Carlo (MC) technique that is based on selecting numbers randomly from a pre-defined probabilistic distribution was used for stochastic simulation of WA+ outputs. The simulation was repeated 1, 000 times for three years (2009, 2010, and 2011). The results of this exercise show that the stochastic mean of the majority of WA+ parameters and performance indicators are within 1 % deviation from the original value. This shows that stochastic simulation can be used as part of a standard procedure to produce water accounts with WA+. There are two main advantages pertaining to the MC technique. Firstly, incorporation and acknowledgement of input data errors in producing water accounts. Secondly, the possibility to estimate and report on the error band width that surrounds every WA+ output. The latter is of essential value to informed decision making, as it enables users to better understand the error margin that is associated with the generated information. The goal is to separate reliable information from those that have low reliability. In such a way, outputs with a high error margin, low reliability, will be identified and it is recommended that they should not be used to formulate policy decisions. WA+ has triggered a wider discussion on using the framework for analyzing complex river basins, especially when data is scarce. This holds true especially for developing countries where the required data collection and archiving processes are insufficient for creating clearly defined alterative solutions for decision makers. A simple WA+ system based on earth observation data is thus a good first step in the right direction. A multi-institutional water accounting data repository is under development that is endorsed by IWMI, UNESCO-IHE and FAO. This platform, WaterAccounting. org, will be based on routine satellite data, data from hydrological models, and other open access global and regional data sources. The platform will provide information by sectors (i. e. agriculture, environment) on the sources of water use (i. e. surface water and groundwater), geographical water scarcities (i. e. local demand and supply), utilizable water flows (i. e. local actual flows and reserved flows), and the sustainability of the water services to environment, food security, energy, economy and domestic use.
