Of course we do not mean the poisonous swamp-sumac, but that which grows along the fences and on the edges of the woods. Of late years the leaves of this bush have been greatly in demand for tanning purposes, and, in some States, especially in Virginia, sumac gathering has become a very important branch of industry, particularly with the negroes; many of whom, during the sumac season, prefer gathering these leaves to doing any other kind of work. The sumac-bush is quite low, and the leaves are <b>easily</b> <b>stripped</b> off. They are then carefully dried, and packed in bags, and carried to the nearest place of sale, generally a country store.|$|E

50|$|Birch bark is eminently {{suitable}} as a roof covering {{because it is}} strong, water-resistant and soil-resistant enough to last for generations, although 30 years was considered the normal lifespan of a sod roof in most places. Birch is common everywhere in Northern Europe, and its bark is <b>easily</b> <b>stripped</b> from the trunk in spring or early summer, while the sap is running. One incision with a knife lengthwise down the trunk between two branches will produce a correspondingly wide sheet, its length equal to the circumference. The outer, flaky (white) bark is pried loose from the inner (green or brown) layer, the phloem. Removing the phloem will cause the tree to die, but removing the outer bark will not harm the tree, although the scar will remain for many years.

50|$|In northwestern Texas, {{selection}} of foods by scaled quail {{was dependent on}} foraging techniques, availability, and seed size. Small seeds were selected when they {{were still on the}} plant and could be <b>easily</b> <b>stripped,</b> but were not eaten once they had fallen, presumably because they were too small and/or too hard to find. Broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) was a staple in winter diets; it was not highly selected but was consumed in proportion to its availability (and lack of availability of choice items). Generally, in Texas grass seeds (mainly tall dropseed Sporobolus asper and rough tridens Tridens muticus) were major constituents of scaled quail diets. This was attributed to a precipitation pattern that resulted in a relatively higher amount of grass seed available, and a lower amount of available forbs. In the same study green vegetation formed a higher proportion of the diet than reported for other areas.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} analytic calculation for the tidal radius of satellites and test our results against N-body simulations. The tidal radius in general depends upon four factors: {{the potential of}} the host galaxy, {{the potential of the}} satellite, the orbit of the satellite and the orbit of the star within the satellite. We demonstrate that this last point is critical and suggest using three tidal radii to cover the range of orbits of stars within the satellite. In this way we show explicitly that prograde star orbits will be more <b>easily</b> <b>stripped</b> than radial orbits; while radial orbits are more <b>easily</b> <b>stripped</b> than retrograde ones. This result has previously been established by several authors numerically, but can now be understood analytically. For point mass, power-law (which includes the isothermal sphere), and a restricted class of split power law potentials our solution is fully analytic. For more general potentials, we provide an equation which may be rapidly solved numerically. Over short times (1 - 2 Gyrs âˆ¼ 1 satellite orbit), we find excellent agreement between our analytic and numerical models. Over longer times, star orbits within the satellite are transformed by the tidal field of the host galaxy. In a Hubble time, this causes a convergence of the three limiting tidal radii towards the prograde stripping radius. Beyond the prograde stripping radius, the velocity dispersion will be tangentially anisotropic. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures. Final version accepted for publication in MNRAS. Some new fully analytic tidal radii have been added for power law density profiles (including the isothermal sphere) and some split power law...|$|E
