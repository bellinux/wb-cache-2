His team respected and liked him, and he did exactly what an amateur should: he declared boldly to give the opposition a chance and his bowlers time to take their wickets. The crowds returned to Old Trafford, and the team were slightly unlucky to finish only third.|$|E
25|$|The first crucial step in {{understanding}} {{the life cycle of}} the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides was demonstrated by Grassi in a grotesque self-experimentation. To solve a century-old puzzle of how infection of roundworm is transmitted from one host to another, he ingested the roundworm eggs on 30 August 1879. He had obtained the eggs from a human corpse, which was heavily infected, upon autopsy on 10 October 1878. After twenty-two days, he found <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs</b> in his faeces. Thus proving that the roundworm is transmitted through direct ingestion from contaminated source.|$|E

50|$|Albumen is {{a mixture}} of {{proteins}} found in egg whites, and is utilized for its capacity to create foams. In a commercialized setting, dried albumen is used as opposed to <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites. In addition to convenience, the advantages of using dried albumen are an increase in food safety, and the reduction of water content in the marshmallow. <b>Fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites carry a higher risk of Salmonella, and are approximately 90 percent water. This is undesirable for the shelf life and firmness of the product. For artisan-type marshmallows, prepared by a candy maker, <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites are usually used. Albumen is usually never used on its own when incorporated into marshmallows, and is used in conjunction with gelatin.|$|R

25|$|Century eggs can {{be eaten}} without further preparation, {{on their own}} or as a side dish. As an hors d'œuvre, the Cantonese wrap chunks of this egg with slices of pickled ginger root (sometimes sold on a stick as street food). A Shanghainese recipe mixes chopped century eggs with chilled tofu. In Taiwan, it is popular to eat century eggs by slicing them, and placed on top of cold tofu with katsuobushi, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a style similar to Japanese hiyayakko. A {{variation}} of this recipe common in northern China is to slice century eggs over chilled silken (soft) tofu, adding liberal quantities of shredded young ginger and chopped spring onions as a topping, and then drizzling light soy sauce and sesame oil over the dish, to taste. They are also used in a dish called old-and-fresh eggs, where chopped century eggs are combined with (or used to top) an omelet made with <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs.</b> The century eggs may also be cut into chunks and stir fried with vegetables, which is most commonly found in Taiwanese cuisine.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this level}} wheat {{semolina}} and water are mixed by {{the ratio of}} 3 to 1. Water should be pure, with no off-flavor and suitable for drinking.

If eggs are added to the mixture, the amount of water is modified. Adding egg improves the nutritional quality and richness of the pasta. Disodium phosphate is also added to reduce the cooking time.|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of thermo-physical data of foods and their constituents is of general importance to food industry. The thermal effusivity e is one among the relevant thermodynamical quantities. The latter is normally {{calculated from the}} relationship e = (¿¿c) ½, where c is specific heat, ¿ is the density, and ¿ is the thermal conductivity. The necessity for performing the time consuming independent measurements of these three quantities is the major reason that the existing database with effusivity of foods is not very wide. This paper describes {{the application of the}} inverse photopyroelectric (IPPE) technique that allows the determination of effusivity from a single measurement. This approach was used to directly measure thermal effusivity of <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> yolk, egg white, and white/yolk blends. In addition, thermal effusivity of rehydrated egg powders (white, yolk, and the whole egg powder) has been measured and compared to that of the <b>fresh</b> hen <b>egg.</b> In case of the egg white, effusivity of rehydrated egg powders was practically {{the same as that of}} the <b>fresh</b> <b>egg.</b> However, the difference in effusivity between <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> yolk and rehydrated egg yolk, and between the blend of <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> and the rehydrated whole egg power was significant. Finally, thermal effusivity of rehydrated egg yolk, egg white, and the whole egg powder was determined as a function of dilution factor...|$|R

Always guarded against the potential for interference by the British, General Stilwell did not coordinate his plans with Admiral Mountbatten, instead transmitting separate orders to his Chinese forces and the Marauders.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{algorithm}} for estimating shell {{surface area}} from measurements of length (L), breadth (B), and <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> weight (W) was compared with four algorithms {{based only on}} <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> weight. Eggs were obtained from 17 laying strains at 34, 46, 50, 58, and 66 weeks of age. A total of 1346 eggs was used. Estimates of surface area derived from the following algorithms. 9109 L-a 8 'B- 3164 W" 4882, 3. 9782 W 7086, and 4. 67 W" 67 were quite similar {{for a wide range}} of eggs from different strains of laying hens at various ages.
