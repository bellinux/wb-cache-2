5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be found}} <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the {{specific}} speed coefficient {{may be used in}} place of speed to define the y-axis of Figure 1.2, while at the same time, the specific diameter coefficient may be in place of diameter to define the z-axis.|$|E
25|$|The blossoming of {{literature}} in the Ardalan principality was accompanied by an intense cultivation of music.

The extension is the first segment of the system to be built above ground and not through a tunnel. This station is also <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> there are not reversing tracks and the train departs from the same track on which arrived.|$|E
25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the most}} bonding factors in Assyrian tribes and it's <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the tribes {{adjacent}} to the Nochiyaye; Urmijnaye to the east, Gawarnaye to the north, Jilwaye to the west and Barwarnayeh to the southwest, all have completely different accents, to the point that some are almost unintelligible to the Nochiyaye.|$|E

25|$|In Shakespeare's The Tempest, the masque that Prospero conjures to {{celebrate}} the troth-pledging of Miranda and Ferdinand echoes the Eleusinian Mysteries, although it uses the Roman names for the deities involved – Ceres, Iris, Dis and others – instead of the Greek. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> a play which is so steeped in esoteric imagery from alchemy and hermeticism should draw on the Mysteries for its central masque sequence.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the {{earliest}} known source to mention Rollo's early life is the French chronicler Richer of Reims, who claims (in the 10th century) that Rollo {{was the son of}} a Viking named Ketill. In terms of onomastics, it is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> Richer also names– without explicitly linking him to Rollo– a man named Ketill as being the leader of subsequent Viking raids (in 888), against areas on the coast of West Francia, between the Seine and the Loire.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> {{packaging}} {{for many}} of the promotional offerings was identical to that of other diecast manufacturers. For example, the Mercedes Unimog (shown here) had an identical silver black-lined box design to that of the NZG Mercedes Coupe. The only difference is the precise box size and the color of the lettering stating what vehicle came inside. This is evidence of the control of the client over many promotional companies and their offerings. Obviously, Mercedes wanted a particular appearance for its packaged products and required that across multiple providers.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the Court of Chancery was acting, here, in {{its most}} ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to {{the soul of the}} {{wrongdoer}} through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in this case) to look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also the explanation for specific performance, which compels the sinner to put matters right. The whole conception is mediæval in origin.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the {{distinction}} between the first two rules and the latter rule can also be found in early treatises on music, introducing the terms metrum and rhythmus. As it could also be demonstrated by Van Kampen that melodic peaks often coincide with the word accent (see also), the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences between the individual notes of a neume).|$|E
25|$|Turbomachinery analysts gain {{tremendous}} {{insight into}} performance by comparisons of these 5 parameters with efficiencies and loss coefficients {{which are also}} dimensionless. In general application, the flow coefficient and head coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for pumps, the Reynolds number becomes of secondary importance and the velocity coefficient almost irrelevant. It may be found <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the speed coefficient may be chosen to define the y-axis of Figure 1.1, {{while at the same}} time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the z-axis.|$|E

25|$|The {{diameter}} of the orifice and cavity is d, the distance between orifice and cavity is h, and the orifice pressure P was given in kilograms per meter squared. At the lower limit of h the second term disappears. In this case, the equation could have been reformatted {{in terms of the}} acoustical Strouhal number as shown in the second equation above. The characteristic speed U at the nozzle is the sound speed c0. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the number is very close to that found by Strouhal for flow over a cylinder. There are two characteristic length scales. Nozzle diameter d characterizes the sound power while the separation distance h characterizes the frequency.|$|E
25|$|A {{million people}} in our country and abroad like songs like Kalinka, Katyusha, Smuglyanka and the other songs of the {{military}} years as well as The Day of the Victory, Dark Eyes, Vecherny zvon and Podmoskovnye vechera. All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company and {{people want to hear}} these songs at every concert. They are not just part of our history; they are great masterpieces. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> Svyaschennaya Voyna, written by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov in 1941, helped Soviet soldiers to protect their Motherland and is still popular in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. Those audiences listen to it standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} Quaestiones is {{definitely}} after 8 July 1661, {{the date on}} which Newton arrived in Trinity College. It is also definitely before 9 December 1664, on which day (and the following) he made notes of his observations of a comet. Other datings of the first entries are based on his handwriting— which changed drastically between the early notes of 1661 and later notes which can be dated independently to 1665. The transitional handwriting which characterises the early parts of Quaestiones can only be independently dated to roughly 1664. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> this was written during a period when Newton was actively developing the notion of calculus, but mathematics made no real appearance in this notebook.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} Collins and David Scott were sent by NASA to the Paris Air Show in May 1967. There they met cosmonauts Pavel Belyayev and Konstantin Feoktistov, {{with whom they}} drank vodka on the Soviet's Tupolev Tu-134. Collins found it <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> some cosmonauts were doing {{helicopter}} training like their American counterparts, and Belyayev said that he hoped to make a circum-lunar flight soon. The astronauts' wives had accompanied them on the trip, and Collins and his wife Pat were somewhat forced by NASA and their friends to travel to Metz {{where they had been}} married ten years before. There, they found a third wedding ceremony had been arranged for them (ten years previously they had already had civil and religious ceremonies).|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} each show (starting July 8), Eric {{was asked}} to {{complete}} a task that America specified by voting on CBS.com or by text messaging. For every five tasks Eric completed, he was rewarded with $10,000 (USD). Viewers were able to vote on tasks from the end of an episode until midnight Pacific Time. The Thursday task involved pitching nominees to the Head of Household (HoH), the Sunday task was something <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> might not affect the strategic game play, and the Tuesday task was swaying the opinion of the other HouseGuests on who to evict (unless it is he who is nominated). Once Eric received the task, he had to make a meaningful effort to complete the task. However, he could have decided how to complete the task. In addition, Eric cast his eviction vote for whom America chose to evict. Eric was a jury member on finale night, and the viewers voted that Dick should receive Eric's vote to win the game.|$|E
