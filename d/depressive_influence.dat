40|$|BACKGROUND: People with {{schizophrenia}} have an impaired {{quality of}} life (QoL), and various QoL assessment scales are available. However {{it is not clear}} which scale should be used in different situations. We aimed to compare a patient-rated subjective QoL scale with an observer-rated QoL scale by measuring their degree of correlation and their respective associative profiles with outcome measures. METHOD: Patients of the UK Schizophrenia Care and Assessment Program completed a patient-rated QoL questionnaire (MANSA). Research staff completed the observer-rated QoL tool (QLS) as part of an assessment of symptomatology and functioning. RESULTS: The two QoL tools were moderately positively correlated (r = 0. 39). Both scales were negatively correlated with positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and depressive symptoms, and positively correlated with functioning scores. However the two scales were influenced by different factors. The patient-rated QoL was more significantly <b>influenced</b> by <b>depressive</b> symptoms, and the observer-rated QoL was more heavily influenced by negative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-rated and observer-rated QoL are moderately related, with a number of joint determinants, but the former is sensitive to <b>depressive</b> <b>influences,</b> whilst the latter is sensitive to the negative symptomatology of schizophrenia...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the many}} and varied fields of present day chemistry, that of optical {{activity}} occupies a not unimportant position. The rotatory {{powers of the}} alkali and ammonium salts of d-sec-βoctyl hydrogen phthalate have been studied in alcoholic and aqueous solution. The rotations of the salts {{were found to be}} in the order H > Li > NH 4 > Na > K > Rb. It has been concluded that the variation of the molecular rotation of the salts with concentration may be explained by assuming changes in the degree of dissociation of the electrolytes and a deforming influence of the cations on the optically active anions. The effect of the addition of inorganic salts of various valence types to 0. 2 M aqueous solutions of d-sec-β-octyl sodium phthalate has been investigated. The series for the <b>depressive</b> <b>influence</b> of the alkali and ammonium chlorides on the rotatory power of the optically active electrolyte is Cs+> Rb+> K+> Na+> NH 4 +> Li+.

40|$|Along with a {{proliferation}} of independent countries in the. Third World since World War II has come {{a proliferation}} of minimum wage regimes. Following {{the example of the}} industrialized countries and the Encouragement of the International Labour Organization, the less developed countries have created machinery for defining and administering legal minima. The justifications offered for such intervention in the wage determination process are the familiar ones advanced in the more developed countries. In the presence of great poverty, minimum wages are proposed as an ameliorative measure which can protect wage earners from the <b>depressive</b> <b>influences</b> of competitive or, even worse, monopsonistic labor market forces on wage levels. Implicit is a belief that the labor market cannot be relied upon to yield secularly increasing wage levels either because of the existence of perfectly elastic labor supply schedules or of unspecified "market imperfections". 2 That a shift in demand could maximize another professed goal, that of employment, in the presence of an elastic supply and wage stability seems to be overlooked. Therefore, aggressively administered minimum wages have been advocated as a means for raising the real incomes of the laboring poor, sharing widely the fruits of economic growth, and effecting a more egalitarian income distribution. In the eyes of many, the existence of legal minimum wage regimes and an active administration of these have become an important test of a government's concern for the welfare of its people, of its commitment to "social justice"...|$|R
40|$|Childhood {{depressive}} {{conditions have}} been explored from multiple theoretical approaches but with few empirical attempts {{to address the}} interrelationships among these different domains and their combined effects. In the present study, the authors examined different pathways through which social, cognitive, and genetic risk factors may be expressed to <b>influence</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms in 300 pairs of child twins from a longitudinal study. Path analysis supported several indirect routes. First, risks associated with living in a step- or single-parent family and punitive parenting did not directly <b>influence</b> <b>depressive</b> outcome but were instead mediated through maternal depressive symptoms and child negative attributional style. Second, the effects of negative attributional style on depressive outcome were greatly exacerbated {{in the presence of}} precipitating negative life events. Third, independent of these social and cognitive risk mechanisms, modest genetic effects were also implicated in symptoms, with some indication that these risks are expressed through exposure to negative stressors. Together, these routes accounted for approximately 13 % of total phenotypic variance in depressive symptoms. Theoretical and analytical implications of these results are discussed in the context of several design-related caveats...|$|R

In these, and in several character studies printed during his lifetime (such as Semblanzas Jurídicas in 1906 and articles in the Diario de Las Palmas on 12 May 1896 and in La Opinión de Tenerife on 23 May 1896), there is a consensus that Primitivo was extremely hardworking, adept at quickly grasping highly complex legal cases and at maintaining absolute impartiality. His courtroom speeches were enlightened, sober, convincing, inspired and naturally eloquent, and avoided artificial and obscure language. He also gave widely praised public lectures, such as those to the Ateneo de Cádiz http://www.ateneodecadiz.com/ in 1895 and 1896, to the Ateneo de Granada in 1900 and to the Ateneo de Madrid :es:Ateneo de Madrid in 1912.

That he had a sense of fun is suggested by his participation, aged 63, in the Madrid carnival parade in February 1912, his decorated float or carriage bearing the banner: “¡Hola! ¡Ya estamos aqui!” We’re here already! and its occupants being dressed up as ‘pierrots’.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Depression {{is common}} in the {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) population, yet little is known of {{its effect on the}} course of disease activity. The aim of our study was to determine if prevalent and incident <b>depressive</b> symptoms <b>influenced</b> longitudinal changes in RA disease activity. METHODS: RA patients with and without depressive symptoms were identified using single-item questions from an existing registry sample. Mixed-effects models were used to examine changes in disease activity over 2 years in those with and without prevalent and incident depressive symptoms. Outcome variables included composite disease activity, joint counts, global assessments, pain, function, and acute-phase reactants. Model-based outcome estimations at the index dates and corresponding 1 - and 2 -year changes were calculated. RESULTS: Rates of disease activity change were significantly different in patients with a lifetime prevalence of symptomology, but not incident depressive symptoms, when compared to controls. Prior symptoms were associated with slower rates of disease activity decline, evidenced by the estimated 1 -year Clinical Disease Activity Index changes: - 3. 0 (- 3. 3, - 2. 6) and - 4. 0 (- 4. 3, - 3. 6) in patients with and without lifetime prevalence, respectively. Analogous results were obtained for most of the other disease activity outcomes; although, there was no temporal effect of prevalent symptoms of depression on swollen joints and acute-phase reactants. CONCLUSION: <b>Depressive</b> symptoms temporally <b>influence</b> the evolution of RA disease activity, and the magnitude is dependent on the time of symptomatic onset. However, the effect is limited to patient-reported pain, global assessment, and function, as well as physician-reported global assessment and tender joints...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify factors predictive of recurrence and to examine whether previous <b>depressive</b> episodes <b>influence</b> vulnerability for subsequent depression in a sample of remitted recurrently depressed patients. METHOD: Recurrence was examined prospectively using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders in 172 euthymic patients with recurrent depression (DSM-IV) recruited from February 2000 through September 2000. Illness-related characteristics, coping, and stress (life events and daily hassles) were examined as predictors. RESULTS: Risk factors for recurrence were a high number of previous episodes, more residual depressive symptomatology and psychopathology, and more daily hassles. Factors with both an increasing and decreasing pathogenic effect with increasing episode number were detected. CONCLUSION: We found some support for dynamic vulnerability models that posit a change of vulnerability with consecutive episodes. Preventive interventions should be considered in patients with multiple recurrences, focusing on residual symptomatology and specific coping style...|$|R

Twenty-eight young adults (of mean age= 20. 7 years) and 28 older adults (68. 5 years) completed the metamemory in adulthood (MIA) scale for assessing various metamemory dimensions. Compared with young adults, older adults used more external strategy. They used more internal strategy but only those with high depressive symptoms or high routinization. Older adults also reported a less efficient memory than young adults, showing less capacity and more change. In addition, <b>depressive</b> symptoms <b>influenced</b> many MIA subscales: participants with high depressive symptoms reported more external strategy use, less capacity, more change and less locus than participants with low depressive symptoms. Finally, highly routinized participants reported more use of external strategy and experienced more anxiety about memory.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has shown that stressful life events (SLEs) influence the pattern of individual depressive symptoms. However, {{we do not know how}} these differences arise. Two theories about the nature of psychiatric disorders have different predictions about the source of these differences: (1) SLEs <b>influence</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms and correlations between them indirectly, via an underlying acute liability to develop a dysphoric episode (DE; common cause hypothesis); and (2) SLEs <b>influence</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms and correlations between them directly (network hypothesis). The present study investigates the predictions of these two theories. Method: We divided a population-based sample of 2096 Caucasian twins (49. 9 % female) who reported at least two aggregated depressive symptoms in the last year into four groups, based on the SLE they reported causing their symptoms. For these groups, we calculated tetrachoric correlations between the 14 disaggregated depressive symptoms and, subsequently, tested whether the resulting correlation patterns were significantly different and if those differences could be explained by underlying differences in a single acute liability to develop a DE. Results: The four SLE groups had markedly different correlation patterns between the depressive symptoms. These differences were significant and could not be explained by underlying differences in the acute liability to develop a DE. Conclusions: Our results are not compatible with the common cause perspective but are consistent with the predictions of the network hypothesis. We elaborate on the implications of a conceptual shift to the network perspective for our diagnostic and philosophical approach to the concept of what constitutes a psychiatric disorder...|$|R

This subjective-objective discrepancy is counter-intuitive when mounting {{evidence suggests that}} subjective concerns relate to future clinical progression to Alzheimer's disease, and so possess {{the potential to be}} a sensitive early behavioural marker of disease. In the current study, we aimed to determine whether individual variability in conscious awareness of errors in daily life might mediate this subjective-objective relationship. METHODS: 67 cognitively-normal older adults underwent cognitive, SCD and mood tests, and an error awareness task. RESULTS: Poorer error awareness was not found to mediate a relationship between SCD and objective performance. Furthermore, non-clinical levels of depressive symptomatology were a primary driving factor of SCD and error awareness, and significantly mediated a relationship between the two. DISCUSSION: We were unable to show that poorer error awareness mediates SCD and cognitive performance in older adults.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{investigating}} neurocognitive {{impairment in}} subjects with eating disorders (EDs) have reported heterogeneous patterns of impairment and, in some instances, no dysfunction. The present study aimed to define the pattern of neurocognitive impairment in a large sample of bulimia nervosa (BN) patients and to demonstrate that neuroendocrine, personality and clinical characteristics influence neurocognitive performance in BN. METHOD: Attention/immediate memory, set shifting, perseveration, conditional and implicit learning were evaluated in 83 untreated female patients with BN and 77 healthy controls (HC). Cortisol and 17 β-estradiol plasma levels were assessed. Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory - Revised (TCI-R), the Bulimic Investigation Test Edinburgh (BITE) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were administered. RESULTS: No impairment of cognitive performance was found {{in subjects with}} BN compared with HC. Cortisol and 'Self-directedness' were associated with better performance on conditional learning whereas 17 β-estradiol had a negative influence on this domain; 'Reward dependence' was associated with worse performance on implicit learning; and <b>depressive</b> symptomatology <b>influenced</b> performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) negatively.

A multi-method approach was imported to analyze self-collected quantitative survey data from two groups of 80 participants in Chicago and 41 in the suburbs, qualitative interview data from 4 focus groups, 2 in-depth interviews and GIS (Geographic Information Systems). In the survey, Suinn-Lew Asian Stress-Identity Acculturation Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale- 30, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, Health Perception Questionnaire- 36, 13 -item questions for respect, and ZIP codes were utilized. This study produced results by stepwise and hierarchical regression, ATLAS. ti, and GIS analysis. When their perceptions about health (r(191) =-. 417, p 3 ̆c. 001) and SES (r(191) =-. 335, p 3 ̆c. 001) were high, the participants experienced less depressive symptoms. SES and perceived health condition proved to be associated with each other (r(191) =. 264, p 3 ̆c. 001).

The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the health related quality of life in {{patients}} suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS) in association with clinical features, fatigue and depressive symptoms. Methods. The examined group consisted of 61 patients (45 women and 16 men) in the mean age of 38. 6 ± 11. 4. The mean duration of disease was 7. 1 ± 6. 1 years. The control group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers. The following questionnaires were used: EuroQol (EQ 5 D) with visual scale EuroQol-VAS, Modified Impact Fatigue Scale (MIFS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results. The quality of life in the examined group of MS patients was significantly lower in comparison to the control group. Results of EQ- 5 D and EQ-VAS were influenced by age, disease course, level of disability and carried treatment. Statistically significant association was also found between results of the questionnaires assessing quality of life and either fatigue or depressive symptoms. Conclusion. The used questionnaires confirmed that quality of life in patients with MS is significantly worse, especially in the older people with secondary progressive course of the disease, more disable and not treated.

It may be necessary for mental health practitioners to offer intervention strategies in accordance with individual temperament. Aims To investigate the relationship between job stress and temperament among nurses in a general hos-pital and to provide insight into personality traits influencing their mental or physical health. Methods A questionnaire survey of nurses in a general hospital. Work stress was measured using the Japanese version of the Effort–Reward Imbalance (ERI) scale. Temperament was assessed by a Japanese version of Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to determine the independent con-tribution of temperament to effort–reward ratio and over-commitment. Results Response rate was 48 % (326 / 685). Temperament predicted part of the variance of the four ERI ratios (effort–reward ratio 26 %; effort–esteem ratio 27 %; effort–promotion ratio 26 %; and effort–security ratio 18 %) and also of over-commitment (38 %). <b>Depressive</b> temperament <b>influenced</b> all four ERI ratios and over-commitment.

We use a mixed-methods approach to explore the importance of gender in shaping processes around depression within marriage. We approach this in two ways: First, using quan-titative longitudinal analysis of 2, 601 couples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we address whether depressive symptoms in one spouse shape the other spouse’s depressive symptoms and whether men or women are more influential in this process. We find that a wife’s <b>depressive</b> symptoms <b>influence</b> her husband’s future depressive symptoms, but a husband’s depressive symptoms do not influence his wife’s future symptoms. Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with 29 couples wherein one or both spouses experienced depression to provide additional insight into how gender impacts depression and reactions to depression within marriage. Our study points to the importance of cultural scripts of masculinity and femininity in shaping depression and emotional processes within mar-riage and highlights the importance of applying a gendered couple-level approach to better understand the mental health effects of marital processes.

Social support and social participation can <b>influence</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms in caregivers, with low levels linked to higher depression scores. Previous studies used small, non-Canadian samples. The present study used population-level data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging to investigate the relationships among social support, social participation, and depression in caregivers and non-caregivers. Analysis of variance assessed differences in the means of the social variables and depression. Path analysis examined the relationship between the social variables and depression. Caregivers reported significantly higher levels of social support and social participation versus non-caregivers. Higher levels of affectionate social support and social participation were associated with lower depression scores. The study identifies the type of social support beneficial for caregivers...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} whether pramipexole (PPX) can <b>influence</b> <b>depressive</b> {{scale in}} normal and mild depressive parkinsonian patients. In an open study of PPX as an add-on to L-dopa therapy or single administration, 36 nondemented outpatients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) were entered first. All {{were in the}} stage II or III of Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y). PPX were started at 0. 125 mg/day and daily doses were increased to 1. 5 mg/day. At 3 months after PPX treatment, patients were re-evaluated. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale III, H&Y stage, and freezing of gait questionnaire were compared in patients before and after PPX treatment. These scores were significantly improved after PPX administration. There were no correlations between HAM-D and those motor functions. We suggest that PPX treatment has antidepressant effects in depressive PD patients and also ameliorates HAM-D score in nondepressive PD patients in addition to motor function...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} tests the {{mediating}} role of daily hassles {{to explain the}} relation between social skills deficits and depression. This has been characterized as “the social skills deficit stress generation hypothesis” (Segrin, 2001). Two-hundred and seventy-seven adolescents participated in the study. Measures of social skills, daily hassles, and depression were obtained from standardized, self-administered questionnaires: the Social Skills Inventory (Riggio, 1986), the Problems Questionnaire (Seiffge-Krenke, 1995), and the Beck Depresion Inventory (Beck et al., 1961), respectively. Regression analyses were performed to test for the mediation models. The {{results show that the}} effect of several dimensions of social skills on depressive symptomatology is not significant when controlling hassles scores, whereas the latter predicted depressive symptoms. This result holds for the Emotional Sensitivity and the Social Sensitivity dimensions of the SSI scale. Findings suggest that daily hasless might represent a mechanism through which several social skills are able to <b>influence</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms...|$|R
40|$|NoThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether the presence of <b>depressive</b> symptoms <b>influences</b> the clinical expression of Alzheimer's pathology. We have analysed the relationships between the severity of Alzheimer's pathology and cognitive decline in two patient groups defined by the presence or absence of depressive symptoms. The study included 89 subjects who participated in a longitudinal research programme prior to death, underwent post-mortem examination and were found to have only Alzheimer-type pathology in their brains, ranging in severity from the entorhinal to neocortical stages. Our results indicate that depressive symptoms did not influence cognition in the early (entorhinal) stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD; where cognition was good regardless of whether or not there was evidence for depressive symptoms) or in the late (neocortical) stages (where cognition was poor regardless of whether or not there was evidence for depression). However, in the intermediate (limbic) stages, patients with depressive symptoms had significantly worse cognitive performance (mean CAMCOG of 32) than those who did not (mean CAMCOG of 73). We conclude that depressive symptoms may contribute to the cognitive decline of AD patients in that pathology, that would be otherwise silent, becomes clinically apparent. Therefore, a multiple diagnosis of early AD and depression should be more widely considered in elderly persons presenting with mild cognitive decline and depression. Treating the depressive symptoms would benefit the patient, but the cognitive improvement may not indicate that AD is absent...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{health has}} been {{commonly}} {{regarded as an}} outcome in caregiving research; however, it may act {{as a predictor of}} depressive symptoms of caregivers. This current study investigated the relationship between physical health and depression in family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease. Also, it examined caregiving self-efficacy as a possible mediator of the relationship. One hundred thirty-four family caregivers were interviewed. The caregivers self-reported their current physical health status, depressive symptoms, and perceived self-efficacy. Using a self-efficacy measure consisting of three subscales, path analyses were conducted to specifically assess these domains of caregiving self-efficacy. The results showed that poorer perceived physical health was directly and indirectly associated with increased depressive symptoms. The indirect path was mediated by the specific domain of caregivers' self-efficacy. These findings suggest that caregiving self-efficacy may function as a mechanism through which perceived physical health <b>influences</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms, and this mechanism can be domain-specific.
