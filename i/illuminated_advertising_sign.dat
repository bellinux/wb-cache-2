With an average consumption of 217. 64 kWh/m 2 ·year, the breakdown revealed that the lighting system dominates the energy consumption of the station followed by <b>illuminated</b> <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> and ventilation. The SEAM 4 US energy management system has been designed to provide smart autonomous control ofthe ventilation, lighting and vertical transportation trough the core, monitoring and control subsystems.

40|$|Underground {{transportation}} systems are big energy consumers and have significant impacts on energy consumption at a regional scale. The literature {{has revealed that}} the energy consumption for non-traction purposes may be of the same magnitude as the energy used to move rolling stock, {{and in some cases}} even greater. However, most of the research conducted so far has focused on the energy demand of rolling stock. This paper investigates the electricity consumption of an underground metro station using data from on-site surveys and measurements. With an average consumption of 217. 64 kWh/m(2) /year, the breakdown revealed that the lighting system dominated the underground station's energy consumption (37 %). <b>Illuminated</b> <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> were found to be responsible for 14 % of the total energy consumption, and ventilation accounted for another 14 %. The rest of the energy consumption was attributed to systems such as mobile phone signal antenna (12 %), the vertical transportation system (8 %) and small power devices (5 %). Accurate information on energy consumption for non-traction usage is useful for future implementation of energy conservation measures in underground stations, which could result in a reduction of operating costs in the long run.

2500|$|In 1880, {{a stretch}} of Broadway between Union Square and Madison Square was {{illuminated}} by Brush arc lamps, making it among the first electrically lighted streets in the United States. By the 1890s, the portion from 23rd Street to 34th Street was so brightly <b>illuminated</b> by electrical <b>advertising</b> <b>signs,</b> that people began calling it [...] "The Great White Way". When the theater district moved uptown, the name {{was transferred to the}} Times Square area.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{containing}} restaurants, {{bars and}} a palm garden (added in 1935), the completed building underwent {{a number of}} alterations and extensions in rapid succession, and the theatre had three different names {{in just a few}} years: opened as the Phoebus Palast in 1926, it became the Emelka Palast in 1932 and Europa Palast in 1935. The exterior was adorned by a large number of <b>illuminated</b> <b>advertising</b> <b>signs,</b> of which two in particular made it a major landmark on the Berlin skyline, day and night: one advertising Allianz insurance company, who also had office-space in the building when it first opened, and the other advertising Odol mouthwash. The latter was mounted on a tower, erected in 1935, which brought the total height of the building to 50 m.After 1933 the central office block was taken over by the Nazi government authorities, who had the neon signs removed and occupied it with numerous affiliated organisations, particularly the Reich Ministry of Labour. The building sustained much damage during the Allied bombing raids of World War II, but was not a complete write-off. Although the northernmost section containing the ballroom was subsequently demolished, the remainder was renovated, and spent the next few decades occupied by various offices. The postwar restoration converted the roof-garden facility into a more enclosed 12th storey, as well as altering other details of the structure, and did not recreate the famous illuminated signage.|$|R
50|$|This {{stretch of}} road {{included}} an <b>illuminated,</b> animated, <b>advertising</b> <b>sign</b> known to many drivers coming into London on the M4 motorway. The sign, showing a bottle of Lucozade emptying into a glass, was {{on the wall of}} what was the Lucozade factory, which opened in 1953 and was demolished in late 2004. The sign was removed to Gunnersbury Park Museum in September 2004 after a brief campaign to preserve it in situ. A replica was subsequently installed, then controversially removed at the end of 2015 and replaced with a digital billboard.Another memorable animated signage was of a female diver advertising Jantzen swimwear.One of the most beautiful single-storey deco buildings belonged to the Firestone Tyre Factory - painted entirely in white - which was controversially demolished one Sunday just a day before a preservation order was to be placed on it. Only the white railings at the front remain. It is now the site of the West Cross Business Centre.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} was largely rebuilt to an Art Deco design by company architect Albert Moore between 1928 and 1929. Much {{of the original}} power station was demolished, but the river facing facade was retained and extended. Liebig wanted to include a tower featuring <b>illuminated</b> <b>signs</b> <b>advertising</b> {{the name of their}} product. When permission for the advertisements was refused, the tower was built with four sets of three vertically-aligned windows, each of which [...] "coincidentally" [...] {{happened to be in the}} shapes of a circle, a cross and a circle. This was significant because Skyline advertising at the time was banned along Southbank. Despite these windows being the building’s architectural focal point, there is no general public access to the tower which is restricted to maintenance tradesmen.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{roadside}} advertising {{has become a major}} and rapidly expanding industry. Until the last decade, the extent of roadside <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> along rural roads has been strongly restricted in Scandinavian countries, mostly for safety reasons and aesthetic considerations. But growing pressure on road authorities caused by significant financial interests has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> along rural roads. The signs are placed at roadsides with the purpose of capturing and keeping driver attention. When the driver’s attention is captured, resulting in long eye glances in large horizontal angles away from the road, the time available for driver’s response to avoid a crash if something unexpected occurs is reduced. In this perspective, it is relevant to ask whether roadside <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> influence driver attention {{to such an extent that}} it affects road safety. With the purpose of investigating, if and how, roadside <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> affect road safety a literature study followed by empirical studies has been carried out. The empirical studies were made by using an instrumented car equipped with a camera system to track eye movements, GPS for registration of speed behaviour, and laser scanner for measurement of distances to other road users. Registration data verifies whether the driver is looking at the <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> and the number of glances, - including glance duration and glance angles. Those measurements are related to driving speed and distances to other road users and thereby critical situations are detected. The overall results of the empirical studies show that <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> do affect driver attention to the extent that road safety is compromised...|$|R
