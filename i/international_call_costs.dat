The system works by receiving {{a request for a}} call from the user, via Internet, Phone or SMS, and initiating a callback. This callback dials both the user's number and the person they wish to call, and connects the two calls together. This functionality allows users to avoid the high <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>costs</b> imposed by some telephone providers, and even reduce roaming costs. Call2 differs from many other online international call services in that the calls are routed over PSTN lines, not VoIP, and require no additional software or hardware, such as headsets.|$|E

Moreover, two types of clients are introduced namely ‘Thin’ & ‘Fat’ client. Due to the fact that the user is able to use one of the clients at one time, one of them must be chosen as a preferred client to be installed and used by the users. Owing to the pros & cons related to each client, comparison between two clients is addressed based on some test cases designed to experiment the usefulness of both clients in several conditions...|$|R
