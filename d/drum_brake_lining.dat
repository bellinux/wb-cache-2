50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{drum brake}} {{was first used}} in a car made by Maybach in 1900, although the principle was only later patented in 1902 by Louis Renault. He used woven asbestos lining for the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lining,</b> as no alternative dissipated heat like the asbestos lining, though Maybach had used a less sophisticated drum brake. In the first drum brakes, levers and rods or cables operated the shoes mechanically. From the mid-1930s, oil pressure in a small wheel cylinder and pistons (as in the picture) operated the brakes, though some vehicles continued with purely mechanical systems for decades. Some designs have two wheel cylinders.|$|E
50|$|Another type {{of power}} brake {{installed}} in automobiles {{is called the}} <b>drum</b> <b>brake.</b> This type of brake, in general, will create some friction that will slow down the wheel. How this works {{is there is a}} brake cylinder that connects master cylinder to the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> via <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> that transfer pressure from the master cylinder. When the driver pushes the brake pedal with his/her foot, the pistons inside the cylinder will activate. The activation of this piston will allow two brake shoes located within the <b>drum</b> of the <b>brake</b> to expand, thus generating friction to slow down and stop the wheel. Usually, this brake is located in the rear wheels of the vehicle, while the disk brake is located {{at the front of the}} vehicle. A car may also have only <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> or disc brakes both front and rear.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> thickness due to wear on <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> squeal. <b>Brake</b> <b>lining</b> will be worn out and subsequently its thickness will be reduced after a few number of braking applications. Hence dynamic properties of the lining, such as its natural frequency, might be changed. In this work, two different sets of <b>brake</b> <b>lining,</b> i. e., new and worn lining are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those brake linings at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over brake operating conditions to observe the influence of different lining thickness. In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|R

40|$|During vehicle {{deceleration}} due to {{friction between the}} <b>lining</b> and the <b>brake</b> <b>drum,</b> kinetic energy of the vehicle is turned into thermal energy that raises temperature of the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> components. This causesthermal elastic instability that affects braking performance and the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> <b>lining</b> failure. This work aimed to study the dynamic behaviors of the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> under various braking conditions. Three cases ofsevere braking are considered i. e., high wheel speed without carrying load, medium wheel speed without carrying load and medium wheel speed with full load. Moreover, a case of normal braking, having high wheelspeed without carrying load is also included for comparison purpose. Two dimensional finite element technique was adopted to simulate the dynamic interaction between temperature distribution, brake shoe movementand the declined of wheel speed. The coupled thermo-mechanical results reveal that severe braking {{is an important factor}} that causes high non-uniform temperature distributions and high-risk thermal elastic instability; whereas wheel speed and vehicle load have less effect on the braking behaviors...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> - a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> has two {{brake shoes}} that expand {{out into the}} inside of the hub shell. Rear-mounted <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> are often used on tandems to {{supplement}} the rear rim brake and give additional stopping power.|$|R
5000|$|The single-leading-shoe <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> (SLS), a.k.a. [...] "leading/trailing drum brake", is a {{basic type}} of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> design.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the <b>brake,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes on the <b>drum</b> allows <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes to last longer than disc brake pads used in a brake system of similar dimensions and <b>braking</b> force. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation of rear <b>brakes,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|R
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are best}} suited for slower, {{moderate}} use, rather than longer periods of hard downhill braking while carrying a load. Under such heavy <b>braking,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> are reported to sometimes fade, losing stopping power, while rim brakes can overheat the rim and cause a tire blowout. A common model of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> is the Shimano Rollerbrake, which includes a mechanism to prevent the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> from suddenly catching and grabbing more than intended.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{generally}} can {{be found}} on older car and truck models. However, because of their low production cost, <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> setups are also installed on the rear of some low-cost newer vehicles. Compared to modern disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> wear out faster due to their tendency to overheat.|$|R
2500|$|Bicycle <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> operate {{like those}} of a car, {{although}} the bicycle variety use cable rather than hydraulic actuation. [...] Two pads are pressed outward against the braking surface {{on the inside of the}} hub shell. [...] Shell inside diameters on a bicycle <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> are typically [...] [...] <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> have been used on front hubs and hubs with both internal and external freewheels. [...] Both cable- and rod-operated <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> systems have been widely produced.|$|R
50|$|Enclosed <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> or a rear {{coaster brake}} are used on most European city bikes, rather than rim brakes. A bike with <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> is {{optimized}} for stopping in wet weather: in wet weather, <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> provide more stopping power and reliability than rim brakes; but in dry weather, less.|$|R
50|$|At one time, {{passenger}} vehicles commonly employed <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{on all four}} wheels. Later, disc brakes {{were used for the}} front and <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> for the rear. However disc brakes have shown better heat dissipation and greater resistance to 'fading' and are therefore generally safer than <b>drum</b> <b>brakes.</b> So four-wheel disc brakes have become increasingly popular, replacing drums on all but the most basic vehicles. Many two-wheel vehicle designs, however, continue to employ a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> for the rear wheel.|$|R

40|$|In the vehicles, {{there are}} many {{components}} which has important role beside the major role as a transportation tool. And each of vehicles {{has one of the}} parts which important like brake. It is used to stop the vehicle when it runs or parks. According to the reason above, the researcher was interested in investigating about this brake system deeply. And the problems that was rised were: 1. The factors which affect the braking ability, 2. Doing the treatment of brake economically, 3. Knowing the pressure power of the types of disc <b>brake</b> and <b>drum</b> <b>brake,</b> 4. The power of braking and the amount of pressure, 5. The analysis of the comparation between the disc <b>brake</b> and <b>drum</b> <b>brake.</b> Furthermore, the quantitative was used in this research because it refered to the empiric data. And this research used some of the method such as: field observation, literature of the data and from the guidance. From the result of the study could be known that combination usage of the disc brake in front wheel and <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> in rear wheel was better because the vehicle load will rest on the front wheel of the vehicle when it was braking. Therefore, the front wheel needs types of brake which has great pressure and fast like disc brake. In addition, the treatment is needed once in month like cheking the oil <b>brake,</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> and the others...|$|R
5000|$|The {{brake shoe}} carries the <b>brake</b> <b>lining,</b> which is riveted or {{glued to the}} shoe. When the brake is applied, the shoe moves and presses the lining against {{the inside of the}} drum. The {{friction}} between lining and <b>drum</b> provides the <b>braking</b> effort. Energy is dissipated as heat.|$|R
50|$|The Healeys {{subsequently}} {{offered to}} equip customers' Sprites {{to a similar}} specification to the Sebring cars, though using a Girling braking system: 8-inch disc brakes for the front wheels and 8-inch <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> at the rear, with all <b>brake</b> <b>lines,</b> unions and flexibles being replaced with Girling equipment. One such car was tuned and raced by Beatrice Shilling, the aeronautical engineer who made a small but vital improvement to the Spitfires' Merlin engines during the war. These Healey Sebring Sprites were modified at The Cape Works, and from early 1960 also at the small workshop at the London showrooms in Grosvenor Street, where the Healey Speed Equipment Division was run by the then reigning British Rally Champion, John Sprinzel.|$|R
50|$|As {{the shoes}} in <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> wear, brakes {{required}} regular manual adjustment until {{the introduction of}} self-adjusting <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> in the 1950s. Drums are prone to brake fading with repeated use.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are used}} in most heavy duty trucks, some medium and light duty trucks, and few cars, dirt bikes, and ATVs. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> are often applied to the rear wheels {{since most of the}} {{stopping}} force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> allow simple incorporation of a parking brake.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{the dirt}} tracker, {{it came with}} brakes: a rear disc brake, and in front, a Fontana four leading shoe <b>drum</b> <b>brake,</b> which is two twin leading <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> paired {{side by side in}} two drums. The XRTT is the final example of a {{competition}} motorcycle with <b>drum</b> <b>brakes,</b> superseded by disc brakes on all other racing bikes due to the excessive unsprung weight added by the very large <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> assembly. The official horsepower was never published, but estimates for the early 1972 engines were in the high [...] range, increasing to an estimated [...] or more by 2008.|$|R
5000|$|As introduced, the Servi-Car had a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> on {{the front}} wheel and another <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> inside the rear axle housing, {{decelerating}} both rear wheels. [...] In 1937, the braking system was upgraded to have a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> on each wheel. [...] A hydraulic rear brake system was introduced in 1951. The very last Servi-Cars, built late in their last model year, would have disc brakes on all three wheels.|$|R
40|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{component}} of the braking system on a vehicle that serves to slow down, stop including maintaining vehicle speed on downhill road conditions though silent conditions. To obtain a good brake good used many ways to use the <b>brake</b> disc or <b>drum</b> <b>brakes,</b> but the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> <b>braking</b> system can generate great brake force to the brake size is small, the design is made that <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> by using two types of leading a double action, this type of wheels each equipped with two cylinders and each wheel cylinder two wheel wear piston. Result of braking with maximum speed is 6. 61 s 140 km/hour...|$|R
50|$|Power brakes are {{a system}} of {{hydraulics}} used to slow down or stop most motor vehicles. It uses a combination of mechanical components to multiply the force applied to the brake pedal by the driver into enough force to actuate the brakes and stop a vehicle that can weigh several tons. The brake pedal {{is connected to the}} vacuum booster which is the first step of the force multiplication. The booster passes the force to the master cylinder which compresses a liquid and forces it through the <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> to the <b>brakes</b> themselves. The liquid that is pushed into the brakes activates the brake calipers which in the case of disc brakes, push against the brake rotor causing friction that slows and eventually stops the rotation of the vehicles wheels. In <b>drum</b> <b>brakes,</b> pistons push two shoes against the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> accomplishing the same effect.|$|R
25|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are most}} common on utility {{bicycles}} in some countries, especially the Netherlands, {{and are also}} often found on freight bicycles and velomobiles. Older tandem bicycles often employed a rear <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> as a drag brake.|$|R
50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> is their relative complexity. A person {{must have a}} general understanding of how <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> work and take simple steps to ensure the brakes are reassembled correctly when doing work on <b>drum</b> <b>brakes.</b> And, {{as a result of}} this increased complexity (compared to disc <b>brakes),</b> maintenance of <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> is generally more time-consuming. Also, the greater number of parts results in a greater number of failure modes compared to disc brakes. Springs can break from fatigue if not replaced along with worn brake shoes. And the drum and shoes can become damaged from scoring if various components (such as broken springs or self-adjusters) break and become loose inside the drum.|$|R
