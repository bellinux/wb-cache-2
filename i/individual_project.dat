25|$|This {{conclusion}} was challenged by Robert Martin (after Jacob's death the leading {{proponent of the}} microcephaly hypothesis) and Alan Thorne. Martin noted that no {{research has been done}} on wrists of microcephalic people. Thorne maintained that the differences were small and that similar variation could occur with living modern humans. He also pointed out that the carpal bones had been found scattered in the cave and it was not certain that they all belonged to the same <b>individual.</b> <b>Project</b> leader Morwood countered that there were also other features, such as the stature, body proportions, brain size, shoulder, pelvis, jaw, and teeth which suggested that H.nbsp&floresiensis is a separate hominin species that evolved in isolation on the island.|$|E

500|$|The biggest <b>individual</b> <b>project</b> in this period, {{across all}} of rural Western Australia, was Stage1 of the Geraldton Southern Transport Corridor. The project, {{constructed}} between March 2004 and December 2005 {{at a cost}} of $92.5 million, involved the relocation of railway tracks, [...] worth of road works, and grade separation of roads. North West Coastal Highway's southern terminus at Brand Highway was upgraded from a roundabout to an interchange, and an overpass was built for Durlacher Street to cross North West Coastal Highway. The highway was also made into a dual carriageway {{in the vicinity of the}} interchange.

2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between developing open-source software and developing open-source hardware is that hardware results in tangible outputs, which cost money to prototype and manufacture. As a result, the phrase [...] "free as in speech, not as in beer", more formally known as Gratis versus Libre, distinguishes between the idea of zero cost {{and the freedom to}} use and modify information. While open-source hardware faces challenges in minimizing cost and reducing financial risks for <b>individual</b> <b>project</b> developers, some community members have proposed models to address these needs Given this, there are initiatives to develop sustainable community funding mechanisms, such as the Open Source Hardware Central Bank.|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted [...] "There is no Relapse2", thus {{announcing that}} the album has been {{scrapped}} {{in favor of}} his new project Recovery. While recording Relapse2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result {{did not seem to}} him as continuation of Relapse but more of an <b>individual</b> <b>project</b> that deserved its own name. Eminem said: [...] "I had originally planned for Relapse2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title." [...] The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.|$|E
