2500|$|Like many US universities, Duquesne University {{has faced}} {{criticism}} {{for what has}} been described as hire-and-fire treatment of academics not on tenure track. Adjunct faculty have complained that they are paid approximately $12,000 annually for full-time work without the right to receive or buy into benefits or healthcare, and with the risk of their anticipated work being terminated with as little as two weeks' notice. Following concern that any complaints to administrators could lead to adjunct professors being dismissed, adjunct faculty have sought to unionize by joining the United Steelworkers union. [...] Particular criticism was applied to the university after the death of Margaret Mary Vojtko, an adjunct who was removed by campus police <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>office,</b> where she had been sleeping as she could not afford to heat her house while paying for chemotherapy. On a contract that did not pay for insurance, her pay had recently been cut by approximately a third.|$|E
2500|$|Umbridge plays {{a smaller}} role in Deathly Hallows {{as the head}} of the Muggle-born Registration Commission, and appears to have written a leaflet called [...] "Mudbloods and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society", {{indicating}} her full support of Voldemort's regime, whether or not she knew the truth about who was running it. She has somehow obtained Mad-Eye Moody's magical eye after his death, and uses it to spy on the other Ministry workers <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>office.</b> She has also taken Slytherin's locket as a bribe from Mundungus Fletcher after he stole it from 12 Grimmauld Place but was selling without a license. She uses the trinket to solidify her pure-blood credentials, claiming the [...] "S" [...] on the locket stands for [...] "Selwyn", rather than [...] "Slytherin". Harry and his friends manage to penetrate the Ministry and steal the Horcrux back from Umbridge after stunning her during the trial of a Muggle-Born. Despite Harry being unable to conjure a Patronus while wearing the locket due to the malign presence of a piece of Voldemort's soul, Umbridge managed to do so. Rowling explains this is due to Dolores being a [...] "very nasty piece of work" [...] such that the evil object aids her instead of hindering her. Following Voldemort's demise, according to Rowling, Umbridge is arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned for crimes against Muggle-borns.|$|E

60|$|One {{morning in}} the late spring Janet crossed the Warren Street bridge, the upper of the two spider-like {{structures}} to be seen <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>office</b> window, spanning the river beside the great Hampton dam. The day, dedicated {{to the memory of}} heroes fallen in the Civil War, the thirtieth of May, was a legal holiday. Gradually Janet had acquired a dread of holidays as opportunities never realized, as intervals that should have been filled with unmitigated joys, and yet were invariably wasted, usually in walks with Eda Rawle. To-day, feeling an irresistible longing for freedom, for beauty, for adventure, for quest and discovery of she knew not what, she avoided Eda, and after gazing awhile at the sunlight dancing in the white mist below the falls, she walked on, southward, until she had left behind her the last straggling houses of the city and found herself on a wide, tarvia road that led, ultimately, to Boston. So read the sign.|$|E
60|$|Another {{circumstance}} {{occurred to}} alienate the King of France still more from Richard. There {{was a certain}} French lady, named De Courcy, who had come from France with the little queen, and had since occupied a high position in the queen's household. She was Isabella's governess and principal lady of honor. This lady, it seemed, lived in quite an expensive style, and by her influence and management greatly increased {{the expense of the}} queen's establishment, which was, of course, entirely independent of that of the king. This Lady De Courcy kept eighteen horses for her own personal use, and maintained a large train of attendants to accompany her in state whenever she appeared in public. She had two or three goldsmiths and jewelers, and two or three furriers, and a proportionate number of other artisans all the time at work, making her dresses and decorations. Richard, under pretense that he could not afford all this, dismissed the Lady De Courcy <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>office,</b> and sent her home to France. Of course she was very indignant at this treatment, and she set out on her return home, prepared to give the King of France a very unfavorable account of his son-in-law. It was some time after this, however, before she arrived at Paris.|$|E
