25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E
500|$|In December 1978, Genesis began {{a period}} of {{inactivity}} as Collins's marriage was at risk of collapse after touring had made him frequently absent from his wife and children. Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to try and rebuild the family. He explained: [...] "I {{was never going to}} leave the band. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, A Curious Feeling and Smallcreep's Day, at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on a new Genesis album, Collins performed with Brand X and started writing his first solo album, Face Value, at his home in Shalford, Surrey.|$|E

500|$|Ralph Abernathy {{stated in}} his 1989 {{autobiography}} And the Walls Came Tumbling Down that King had a [...] "weakness for women", although they [...] "all understood and {{believed in the}} biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation." [...] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term [...] "womanizing", {{that he did not}} specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated. In his original wording, Abernathy had claimed he saw King coming out of his room with a lady when he awoke the next morning and later claimed that [...] "he may have been in there discussing and debating and trying to get her {{to go along with the}} movement, I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.|$|E
500|$|Several years later, Dibnah and {{his family}} went on holiday, to Blackpool. The trip was filmed for {{television}} and showed Dibnah's preference for working rather than holidaying. He did however manage to undertake the removal of a small chimney stack from a business in the town, under a distinctly grey sky and aided by his wife, Alison. His payment for the job was a new front plate for the boiler of his traction engine. Dibnah, however, refused to take any more holidays and, after 18years of marriage, Alison booked and paid for a holiday to Greece, taking their three children (Jayne, Lorna and Caroline) with her. Dibnah remained at home and was surprised when, upon her return, she asked for a divorce. One day in October 1985, Dibnah attended a solid fuel exhibition in nearby Bury. Upon his return he discovered that Alison had left the house, taking with her their three children, the dog and some items of furniture. Short of money, {{he was forced to}} sell his antique AJS motorcycle. He found life without his family difficult but defended his wife: [...] "There is no doubt whatsoever, she were a good help to me and I'm going to miss her. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> all the pressure got too much for her." ...|$|E

500|$|According to McDougall, another {{director}} was originally hired {{to work on}} the episode but quit after learning casting would be a group decision. Filming took place over thirteen days in March 2004. During filming, McDougall suggested removing references to pop culture from the script to ensure the pilot had [...] "more of a timeless feel." [...] ABC picked up the series for 13 episodes on May 18, 2004. In June, ABC called for three starring cast members to be recast. Jesse Metcalfe replaced Searles as John Rowland, as producers wanted to add more sexual appeal to the role [...] "to justify why (Gabrielle) was having an affair." [...] Metcalfe had previously read for the role during the initial casting process. The role of Rex Van de Kamp was given to Steven Culp, who was Cherry's first choice for the part but was unavailable when the original pilot was filmed. Brenda Strong took over the role of Mary Alice, as producers thought that Lee was not right for the part. Strong commented on the casting change for her character, explaining, [...] "I think it was a conceptual shift... There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate." [...] Scenes featuring the original actors were refilmed with their replacements, however Burke and Searles are present in the background of some scenes in the final cut of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

2500|$|During the tournament, Kadri {{scored three}} goals and added five assists. During the tournament, Kadri {{attracted}} attention for {{his refusal to}} shake hands with Switzerland's Nino Niederreiter after their semi-final game. Kadri did not elaborate on the specifics of what caused his refusal, but did absolve Niederreiter of using an ethnic slur: [...] "Obviously, in big games like that, guys tend to lose their composure a bit, but I didn't take offence to anything he said. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> I felt like I didn't have to shake his hand." [...] Kadri later had second thoughts about his refusal, stating, [...] "I regret it a little bit." [...] During the gold medal game against the United States, Kadri had two assists including one on Jordan Eberle's game-tying goal with 1:35 left in the third period. Canada, however, lost the game in overtime, leaving Kadri and his teammates with the silver medal.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Lloyd Webber {{closed the}} London {{production}} {{for a few}} days to rework the show after a poor critical response. The musical was reviewed again (at Lloyd Webber's invitation), with critic Henry Hitchings noting that [...] "Some of the most obvious alterations stem from the recruitment of lyricist Charles Hart to adjust the cadences of the original clunky lines written by Glenn Slater." [...] He further pointed out that [...] "There are also lots of bracing directorial touches; the show is credited to Jack O’Brien, but it is new choreographer Bill Deamer and producer Bill Kenwright who have added the zest." [...] The London production closed on 27 August 2011 after a disappointing run of fewer than eighteen months. In 2012, Lloyd Webber stated that although he was, [...] "very, very proud" [...] of the London production, it did not completely work and also said, [...] "something just went slightly wrong; I had cancer just before the production, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> crucial 5% off-beam".|$|E
