After knocking out the Hawks in straight sets, the Wildcats faced historical rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the 2014 Grand Final.

But it wasn't to be, as the 36ers forced a deciding third game with an 89–84 win in Game 2. Returning to Perth Arena less than 48 hours later for Game 3, the Wildcats crushed the 36ers with a 93–59 win in front of 13,498 fans, as their 2–1 series victory saw them claim their sixth NBL Championship.

25|$|Troy Percival was {{activated}} {{from the}} disabled list on September 2. In Toronto for his second outing since his return, he allowed a walk-off grand slam with two outs when the Rays were ahead by a single run and in position {{to win the game}} in extra innings. Against Boston during another extra inning game, Percival came in to close with a three-run lead and allowed the first three batters to reach base. He was removed from the game in favor of Jason Hammel, who had never recorded a save at the MLB level, and was the only remaining reliever available for the Rays in the game due to its length. Hammel converted the save opportunity, but many questioned if Percival should remain as the team's closer. The reason for Percival's removal from the game against Boston was a stiff back, and not for the game's situation, or for any sort of leg injury that had plagued him throughout the year. Percival stated that because of warming up multiple times throughout the game, only to not come in until the Rays took a lead, was what pained his back. Percival acknowledged that he knew he didn't feel well, and that he should have called for his own removal, but decided that with the lead the Rays had, {{he would be able to}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> As a result of the game, the Rays decided to not use Percival too often on consecutive nights, and using him in a tie game if the situation of the game changes while he is warming up. He would still be listed as the team's closer.|$|E
500|$|Johns {{impressed}} Australian {{officers with}} his sensitive handling of inter-Allied issues, his co-operative nature, {{and his ability}} to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, who came to regard Johns as a close friend, later described Johns and Secombe as [...] "born co-operators." [...] One of Johns' most important decisions involved {{the construction of a new}} deep-water berth for Liberty ships at Tatana Island. This involved building a causeway out to the island. The project would double the capacity of the port of Port Moresby, but in order to build it Johns had to divert the African-American 96th Engineers from work on the airfields around Port Moresby, raising fears from airmen like Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead that the airfields would not be ready for all-weather operations by the time that the rainy season arrived. Rains in late October did indeed close three airfields but the causeway opened on 30 October and the wharf accepted its first ship on 3 November.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, {{winter was}} {{threatening}} {{and in order}} for the walls of the new church to be protected from potential damage, the roof had to be laid before any snow began to fall. This meant that more workers were needed to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done</b> faster. This was a problem because the church's account did not contain enough money to employ more men. As soon as the committee of 100 became aware of this, they began asking for help. They found 30 parishioners who were each willing to lend another $500 each. These parishioners had already given high contributions to the new church but were still willing to help. As a result, the church had an extra $15,000 to pay for the construction of the roof. Every day for about two months, over fifty parishioners worked on building the church roof. In December 1941, the roof was completed. [...] One of the men who helped complete the roof read about the attack on Pearl Harbor in the newspapers and decided to quit his work on the church and enlist in the United States Air Force. [...] James DiMuzio was the congregation's first casualty in the war. There is a plaque with his name and date of death on the pier.|$|E

500|$|Vlasic {{spent the}} 1989 {{off-season}} recovering form his injury, while the Chargers added another quarterback to the roster upon drafting Billy Joe Tolliver. After {{working out with}} the team during the preseason, he started the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list. With the Chargers having a reliable starter in Jim McMahon, who had been signed to the team, Vlasic was kept on the list for the season. In 1990, McMahon was released and John Friesz was drafted out of the University of Idaho, leaving Vlasic to compete with Friesz and David Archer for the backup quarterback job. As the preseason began for the 1990 San Diego Chargers season, the team released Archer, and the plan was for Friesz to split backup quarterback duties during the preseason. After an impressive preseason by Vlasic and only a pedestrian one by Tolliver, Chargers coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, citing that he was [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After losing the game 1714, the switch was made back to Tolliver as the starting quarterback, and was eventually named starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this, Vlasic remained optimistic, saying, [...] "I feel confident in my ability, and I always have. I know I can <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done</b> whatever the situation. I have to believe that." [...] Over the course of the 1990 season, Vlasic played in six games, completing 19 of 40 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 46.7.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1986 season, Weaver retired for good, and Ripken was named {{manager of the}} Orioles. The Orioles were coming off their first last-place finish in Baltimore, but Ripken expressed confidence in the team {{at the beginning of}} the 1987 season, saying, [...] "I know these guys can <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> I may be hardheaded, but that's what I believe. We'll be a competitive team." [...] The Orioles got off to a slow start in April 1987, going 9-12 while losing seven of nine games in ones stretch. However, the ballclub would improve in May, moving over [...]500 while setting a May record with 56 home runs. In June, the team fell out of contention, dropping to 28-36, their worst start since 1955. Pitching plagued the club; Harvey Rosenfeld wrote it was [...] "the root cause of the Orioles' problems. In 1987, Ripken became the first—and only—father to manage two sons simultaneously in the majors, as his son Billy was called up at the All-Star break. Ripken managed Cal Jr. and Billy for the first time on July 11, in a 21 loss to the Minnesota Twins. The Havre de Grace Record wrote, [...] "The Ripkens of Aberdeen became the first family of sports." [...] On September 14, during a 173 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, Ripken substituted Cal Jr. with Ron Washington after the eighth inning, ending Cal Jr.'s major-league record streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Senior said after the game, [...] "I've been thinking about it for a long time. I wanted to take the monkey off his back. It was my decision, not his." [...] The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East at 6795, setting a team record with 51 home losses.|$|E

[...] Griffiths went on to hail the character as [...] "our cartoon idol when it came to reaching for the stars and pulling it off flawlessly", concluding, [...] "at {{the end of the day}} Kim Possible could do anything.

Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff. They really want to see the boy in that role." [...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always just assumed that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim. At one point, fans of the character had sent her over one million e-mails via her interactive website.|$|E
