500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and {{directed}} by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought {{that they would be}} unable to write the episode because they didn't know very much about American football—so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, [...] "Rob just sort of handed [...] down. I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why." [...] The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks into the locker room.|$|E
500|$|Despite signing Johnston, several {{tenets of}} the {{original}} policy still officially remained in place as Rangers {{did not attempt to}} sign any further Catholic players {{for the next few years}} and because the media had branded Johnston as a [...] "card-carrying Catholic". The club did not make another major Scottish Catholic signing until Neil McCann in 1998. In the same year, Rangers lifted a ban on players making the sign of the cross at the behest of Gabriel Amato but warned them not to do it in front of supporters. In 1999, Lorenzo Amoruso became the first Catholic captain of Rangers. However, in 2002 defender Fernando Ricksen, who had been receiving sectarian phone calls from Celtic supporters, stated [...] "If you're Catholic and you play for Rangers, then you are a Protestant. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> for the Protestant people, you don't play for the Catholic people." ...|$|E

The game holds an aggregated score of 79.07% approval rating on Game Rankings based on seven reviews. IGN praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music.

500|$|In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon {{opened his}} first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players {{the finer points}} of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never {{expressed}} an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, [...] "For a big man who is just big, maybe. But not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, {{make it easier for the}} entire team." [...] He runs the camp for free. Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor, and center Yao Ming. In September, 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake. More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus. In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon. [...] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried.|$|E

When Peter Robinson of Popjustice compared the song to [...] "We Found Love" [...] during {{an interview with the}} singer, she responded, [...] "that's going to be natural because it's Calvin. They're both Calvin-produced songs. So naturally you're going to think that. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> them side by side they don't sound the same.

Evans greatly valued Bach's music, which influenced his playing style and which helped him gain good touch and finger independence. [...] "Bach changed my hand approach to playing the piano. I used to {{use a lot of}} finger technique when I was younger, and I changed over a weight technique. Actually, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> Bach and the voices sing at all, and sustain the way they should, you really can't play it with the wrong approach."

So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it with one finger, you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E

The camp, which lasted for four days, involved children from Bethlehem, Ramallah, East Jerusalem, Tulkarem, Jericho, and Jenin.

[...] Cox then went out and led the Carolina team to a 33–6 win against Clemson. [...] He returned to Clemson after the war and captained the 1947 team in a losing effort to Carolina, but Cox earned his place in history as the only player to captain both schools' football teams.|$|E

2500|$|Texas hold 'em (also {{known as}} Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a {{variation}} of the card game of poker. [...] Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" [...] or [...] "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" [...] or [...] "fifth street"). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards. (If a player's best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called [...] "playing the board". <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.) Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.|$|E
