Each such patient's stated number of visits to an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Room</b> during the previous year, including the present visit, was used as an indicator in assessing inappropriate <b>Emergency</b> <b>Room</b> use. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences when the variable was race; in contrast, significant differences were seen when the variables were type of medical insurance coverage and personal physician status. Based on these data, we suggest that the true problem is not one of how to control inappropriate <b>Emergency</b> <b>Room</b> use, but rather one of how to improve the health care delivery system for the urban poor...|$|R

Results: The first year of life age group was most affected by respiratory problems.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: This study {{compared}} {{different methods}} of assessing self-reported alcohol use among <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> patients {{in order to}} explain the variations in reported prevalence rates. Methods: Alcohol use prior to patient’s injury or illness was assessed in one hospital by a self-report questionnaire in three different ways: (i) administered by <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> staff, (ii) administered by research staff, or (iii) sent to the patient’s home by post. Results: Results show variations in self-reported alcohol use 6 h prior to the injury or illness ranging from 4. 6 to 9. 1 %; these variations {{may be explained by}} sample selection bias and characteristics of the included study populations. When self-report is combined with staff judgement the corresponding prevalence rates are 6. 8 % for research staff and 16. 2 % for <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> staff. This shows that the latter judge the patient’s alcohol use more efficiently than the research staff. Using research staff 24 h a day resulted in almost no sample bias. Data collection via <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> staff leads to the highest alcohol use prevalence rates and to the highest sample bias; this was influenced by the <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> characteristics. A retrospective mail survey results in an older sample with age-related (lower) alcohol use and <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> characteristics related to this age group. Conclusions: Future studies using patient self-report among <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> samples should consider carefully the influence of sample selection bias. The combination of the research staff handing out the questionnaire and the <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> staff giving their judgement on the patient’s alcohol use seems to be a useful method...|$|R

25|$|In the United States, {{and many}} other countries, {{hospitals}} are beginning to create areas in their <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> for people with minor injuries.

Urgent care clinics are another alternative, where patients can go to receive immediate care for non-life-threatening conditions. To reduce the strain on limited ED resources, American Medical Response created a checklist that allows EMTs to identify intoxicated individuals who can be safely sent to detoxification facilities instead.|$|E
