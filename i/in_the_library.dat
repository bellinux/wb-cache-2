5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> of Congress collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on January 31, 1911 and was met with generally favorable reviews.

5|$|After the war, Christie {{attempted}} to get command {{of operations for}} Atlantic submarines, but that job went to James Fife instead.

He sold life insurance and dabbled in other ventures for some time. In his final years, he lived on the west coast of the United States and in Hawaii.

5|$|Also, cinematographic {{improvements}} that modern viewers would find relatively minor were noted in their day.

Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect {{and the construction of}} a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
