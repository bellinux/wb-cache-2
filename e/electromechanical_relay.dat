2500|$|A {{fundamental}} {{pillar of}} Kurzweil's {{argument is that}} {{to get to the}} Singularity, computational capacity is as much of a bottleneck as other things like quality of algorithms and understanding of the human brain. Moore's Law predicts the capacity of integrated circuits grows exponentially, but not indefinitely. Kurzweil feels the increase in the capacity of integrated circuits will probably slow by the year 2020. He feels confident that a new paradigm will debut at that point to carry on the exponential growth predicted by his law of accelerating returns. Kurzweil describes four paradigms of computing that came before integrated circuits: <b>electromechanical,</b> <b>relay,</b> vacuum tube, and transistors. [...] What technology will follow integrated circuits, to serve as the sixth paradigm, is unknown, but Kurzweil believes nanotubes are the most likely alternative among a number of possibilities: ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Electromechanical</b> <b>relays</b> are the most-often-used type {{because they}} have the largest signal range {{capability}} of the three. They also have the slowest actuation time and the shortest useful life. <b>Electromechanical</b> <b>relays</b> are ideal for high-voltage, high-current, and RF applications. A latching feature makes the latching relay type very appropriate for low-voltage applications where contact potential can interfere with the measurement.|$|R
2500|$|... "Theseus", {{created in}} 1950, was a {{magnetic}} mouse controlled by an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>relay</b> circuit that enabled it {{to move around}} a labyrinth of 25 squares. Its dimensions {{were the same as}} those of an average mouse. The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions. The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior. Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.|$|E
