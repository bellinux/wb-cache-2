The rate of the shift of different PL bands of the structures under study is estimated in low and high magnetic fields. The causes of the shift rate increase under pass from low to high magnetic fields are interpreted. The peculiarities of the effect of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>barrier</b> on the luminescence properties of the structures are presented.
