40|$|Abstract: Objective: This study {{investigated}} {{the changes in the}} anterior pituitary hormones of patients who were admitted to an emergency service and diagnosed with acute meningitis. Methods: A total of 21 patients who were admitted to an emergency service between 01 January and 31 October 2012, and diagnosed with meningitis, were included. Blood samples were collected from the patients within an initial 24 hours of admission and at month 6, in order to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), growth hormone (GH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. The results were analyzed using SSPS- 18 software. Results: Of the patients, 47. 6 % were male, and 52. 4 % were female. At month 6, TSH, LH, and ACTH levels were higher than those measured on admission. This difference was meaningful for TSH, but insignificant for LH and ACTH. At month 6, mean GH, FSH, and PRL levels <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> than admission levels. At the time of admission, FSH <b>was</b> at <b>lower</b> than normal levels in seven patients, LH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in six patients, TSH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in four patients, GH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in four patients, and ACTH in <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in three patients. At month 6, FSH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in five patients, LH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in four patients, TSH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in one patient, GH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in six patients, and ACTH <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in five patients. Conclusion: The differences between hormone levels at admission and at month 6 show that meningitis causes changes in anterior pituitary hormones...|$|R

5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection.

Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
