He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|Chaitanya Krishna {{confirmed}} his {{inclusion in the}} cast {{by the end of}} March 2014. In late April 2014, Naresh was chosen {{to play an important role}} in the film, which he later described as one of the best roles of his career. Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is not often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E
5|$|In February 1950, Pontecorvo's Harwell {{colleague}} Klaus Fuchs {{was arrested}} for espionage, and the AERE began to take security more seriously, and Pontecorvo was interviewed by Henry Arnold, the security officer at AERE. While Arnold had no evidence that Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy, he did <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a security risk, and recommended that he be moved to {{a position where he}} did not have access to Top Secret material. Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position.|$|E

5|$|During {{a camping}} trip, O'Malley learns that Torres has slept with chief of plastic surgery Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and also discovers that Burke is {{experiencing}} tremors in his hand. When O'Malley's father is diagnosed with esophageal cancer and a leaking aortic valve, {{he refuses to}} allow Burke to operate on him, instead contacting Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), Burke's medical school rival. His relationship with Torres is strained when he confronts her about sleeping with Sloan, but he allows her to support him through his father's deteriorating health. Complications from his father's surgery leave him in multi-system organ failure, and his life support is turned off. In an attempt to overcome his grief, O'Malley elopes with Callie to Las Vegas. He later begins to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was mistaken to marry her, and sleeps with Stevens while intoxicated. Stevens confesses that she {{is in love with}} him, so O'Malley considers transferring to a different hospital so he can be faithful to his wife. However, he is ineligible to transfer after failing the intern exams. O'Malley decides to repeat his intern year, and confesses to Torres that he slept with Stevens, leading the two to separate. O'Malley and Stevens embark on a short-lived relationship, only to discover there is no real chemistry between them.|$|E

In response the LRA mutilated numerous Acholi whom they believed to be government supporters. While the government efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E

Although Allen was {{considered}} to be a better singer than anyone else who had tried out for the role up to that point, he had never auditioned for a film before and has said that he did not feel confident in his acting abilities. In an interview with OK Magazine, Allen said he does not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have been a good fit for role and currently does not have any further plans to pursue acting.|$|E
25|$|Born in Rutherglen, Bryson {{began his}} career with non-league side Westwood Rovers. He signed a {{professional}} contract with Scottish First Division club Clyde {{at the beginning of}} the 2003–04 season. He turned down the opportunity to sign for Scottish Premiership club Motherwell because he wanted to play regular first team football and he didn't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would get that at Motherwell. He didn't make a first team appearance that season, but was loaned out to junior outfit East Kilbride Thistle for the latter part of the season. He made a big impression in his time at East Kilbride, scoring two goals in eight league appearances and winning the club's Young Player of the Year award.|$|E
25|$|Several issues {{brought about}} this melancholic state and {{restricted}} his poetic inspiration {{during the last}} five years of his life. His work load was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century. His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realized that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused him to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had failed them both.|$|E

25|$|The Abbasids were {{concerned}} about the threat the Saffarids posed, especially after Ya`qub conquered Fars from Muhammad bin Wasil in 875. From Fars Ya`qub moved on to Khuzistan, taking possession of Ramhurmuz in December of 875. This move put the Saffarid army close to Iraq. It also put Ya`qub close to the Zanj revolt; the Abbasids feared that the Saffarids and Zanj would band together against the caliphate, although Ya`qub's later rejection of an offer by the Zanj to become allies casts doubt on this possibility. In any case it was an alarming development, as the caliph did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had the resources to stop Ya`qub. All of Ya`qub's supporters in Baghdad, who had been imprisoned in 873 following his conquest of Khurasan, were released, and al-Mu'tamid sent an embassy to Ya`qub to grant him the governorships of Khurasan, Tabaristan, Fars, Gurgan, and Ray, as appoint him as head of security in Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|After {{many years}} {{of service to the}} crown, Benavides began to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should leave governance, and {{desiring}} not to harm the interests of the colony, asked to be released from office, but Ferdinand VI refused. In 1745, he requested that the Crown create the new position of Teniente de Rey (King's Lieutenant) in Campeche, in the Captaincy General of Yucatán, to ensure a continuous military command in the main port of the province, which was a target of frequent attacks by English pirates and buccaneers who roamed the seas off its coast. Having someone occupy this position would ensure an automatic succession to the office of Governor and Captain General of Yucatán, until a final appointment could be made by the king or the viceroy. This decision was popular among the citizens of Campeche, but not with those of Mérida, whose alcalde in the city council had previously held the status of presumptive replacement of governors who vacated their office. The king welcomed this idea and appointed Romualdo de Herrera the first King's Lieutenant of Yucatán.|$|E
25|$|Abbas' first {{campaign}} with his reformed army {{was against the}} Uzbeks who had seized Khorasan and were ravaging the province. In April 1598 {{he went on the}} attack. One of the two main cities of the province, Mashhad, was easily recaptured but the Uzbek leader Din Mohammed Khan was safely behind the walls of the other chief city, Herat. Abbas managed to lure the Uzbek army out of the town by feigning a retreat. A bloody battle ensued on 9 August 1598, in the course of which the Uzbek khan was wounded and his troops retreated (the khan was murdered by his own men during the retreat). However, during the battle, Farhad Khan had fled after being wounded and was later accused of fleeing due to cowardice. He was nevertheless forgiven by Abbas, who wanted to appoint him as the governor of Herat, which Farhad Khan refused. According to Oruch Beg, Farhad Khan's refusal made Abbas <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been insulted. Due to Farhad Khan's arrogant behaviour and his suspected treason, he was seen as a threat to Abbas, so Abbas had him executed. Abbas then converted Gilan and Mazandaran into the crown domain (khasseh), and appointed Allahverdi Khan as the new commander-in-chief of the Safavid army.|$|E

25|$|Few, {{even in the}} Labour Party, gave Robinson {{much chance}} of winning the presidency, not least because of an {{internal}} party row over her nomination. With the Labour Party the first name for a possible candidate was an elderly former minister for Health, and hero to the left, Noel Browne. Browne was a household name for having done {{more than anybody else}} in Ireland for tackling Tuberculosis in the 1950s. However Browne's relationship with the Labour Party had been stormy. He was critical of its ties with Fine Gael and had co-founded the short lived Socialist Labour Party in 1977 after leaving the Labour Party. Although he was supported by left wing members within Labour such as Michael D. Higgins, he had little or no contact with Dick Spring and therefore had to live in hope of being nominated without the endorsement of the party leadership. The possibility that Browne might be nominated raised the possibility of an internal argument within the party. The fact that Browne was enthusiastic for candidacy, in a contest where Labour never before contested, now acted as pressure for Labour to find a candidate. Spring did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could control Browne {{for the duration of the}} election, given Browne's history of defying party policy to such a degree that Browne had to leave several political parties. In these circumstances the decision to propose Robinson proved to be politically inspired. Robinson had an advantage in being the first candidate nominated for the election (and the first female), in that she could cover more meetings, public addresses and interviews. However she refused to be drawn on specifics in case she would alienate possible support. Robinson also received the backing of the Irish Times newspaper, and this proved hugely advantageous.|$|E
