40|$|AbstractIntroductionMale {{circumcision}} {{is traditionally}} {{carried out by}} ascribed practitioners, so self-circumcision is very rare. It is intriguing why the victims should not seek available modern health care. This article highlights another case of self-circumcision, the related causes, complications and their management. The gradual increase in numbers is contributing to the surgical disease burden. Case presentationA 21 year old male circumcised himself using a razor-blade 13 days prior to presentation at the hospital. He attributes this to reluctance to have him circumcised. He sustained extensive penile skin denudation of 7 cm in length, severe bleeding and pain. He lives close to traditionally-circumcising communities and was once chided by peers for being uncircumcised. He had no evidence of psychosis. He did not use any medications during the procedure. He was managed with analgesics, antibiotics and surgical reconstruction. He was discharged on the second post-operative day and subsequently recovered fully. DiscussionSuch patients face a variety of complications, both the immediate and long term. Some are fatal especially those with systemic effects including <b>haemorrhagic</b> shock and <b>septicaemia</b> associated with gangrene. Timely referral to specialist surgeons is critical, as well as thorough review {{and control of the}} causes prompting this practice. ConclusionCases of self-circumcision continue to emerge. There is need to report all cases, explore and manage the possible causes. The stigma uncircumcised males face among circumcised peers may be an important cause. Public health education and improved access to voluntary medical male circumcision services may help to prevent this practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{outbreak}} of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> caused by Pasteurella multocida B: 2 in beef calves, a disease {{that has not been}} described in the Hungarian literature since 1943, and has not been reported to the World Organisation For Animal Health (OIE) since 1970. Acute <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> was confirmed in beef calves on one small farm, and was suspected on two further nearby holdings with concomitant unexplained losses. The source of the infection could not be determined. Apart from a short duration of depression and loss of appetite, the affected calves developed characteristic distal limb oedema. Gross findings in two calves submitted for laboratory examinations included subcutaneous oedema and haemorrhages on serous membranes, and in one case severe pharyngeal lymph node enlargement was observed. Histological examinations revealed lesions characteristic of septicaemia. Moderate to large amounts of Pasteurella antigens were detected in all organs tested by immunohistochemistry. Two isolates of P. multocida (Pm 240, Pm 241) were cultured from these cases and examined in detail. These were identified as P. multocida ssp. multocida biovar 3. Both were toxA negative and belonged to serotype B: 2.

For this purpose, 50 buffaloes suffering from <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> were randomly divided in two equal groups A and B. Group A served as control and was treated with ceftiofur HCl (IM) and ketoprofen (IV) @ 6 and 2 mg/Kg BW, respectively, for five days. Buffaloes of group B were administered with rapid intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline solution (7. 5 % NaCl) @ 4 ml/Kg BW once in combination with ceftiofur HCl and ketoprofen. Animals were monitored for 24 hours after initiation of treatment. Clinical parameters, serum electrolytes, plasma volume and survival index were recorded at different intervals after treatment. Survival rate (80 %) in group B was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than 48 % in group A. The heart rate and respiration rate recovered more effectively in the buffaloes administered with treatment protocol B. Plasma volume was 98 % which was almost normal within 24 hours after the infusion of hypertonic saline solution to the animals of group B.

40|$|Pasteurella multocida is {{associated}} with hemorrhagic septicaemia in cattle and buffaloes, pneumonic pasteurellosis in sheep and goats, fowl cholera in poultry, atrophic rhinitis in pigs and snuffles in rabbits. <b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> is caused by Pasteurella multocida type B: 2, B: 2, 5 and B: 5 in Asian countries and type E: 2 in African countries. Pasteurella multocida have five types of capsular serotype i. e. type A, B, D, E and F. Diagnosis of the disease is mainly based on the clinical sign and symptom, post mortem findings.

40|$|The {{history of}} Pasteurella multocida (sometimes called Pasteurella septica) as a {{pathogen}} of animals {{dates back to}} the mid-nineteenth century. It has long been held responsible for the disease known as <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> in a large variety of animals, both tame and wild. In the 1850 ’s, many workers {{in the course of their}} investigations found in varied sick or dead animals, an organism that is now called Pasteurella but was not known by any name at that time. These organisms, apparently pathogenic, were isolated from animals suffering from a disease of a haemorrhagic nature. Hueppe (1886) collected strains of these organisms from various sources. His study included organisms from fowl cholera, rabbit septicaemia, <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> of cattle, including wild deer, wild boar and swine plague. He was endeavouring to show that this organism was a soil bacterium, similar in behaviour in respect to infectivity, to the anthrax bacillus. In this he was not too successful, although there are still some workers in Europe today who hold tentatively to this view. What Hueppe did show was a relationship of the organisms isolated from various sources to one another. [ [...] . ...|$|E

From 11 hours infected fish showed paleness, lethargy, gasping, increased respiratory frequency and loss of swim axis. At hematological examination, infected animals showed severe lymphopenia, increased monocytes, hemolysis, increased blastic cells, karyorrhexis, hypochromia and anisocytosis, which is characteristic of a hypochromic anemia and erythroclasia described in fish bacterial infection.
