The objectives of this study were to compare the efficacy of <b>etofenamate</b> versus hyaluronic acid (HA) in reducing joint pain and functional improvement for mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. The patients were randomly divided into <b>etofenamate</b> (n= 29) and HA (n= 30) groups. Intramuscular <b>etofenamate</b> injection was administered as a series of seven intramuscular injections at intervals of 1 day. Intra-articular HA injection was administered as a series of three intra-articular injections at intervals of 1 week. Clinical evaluation was made before the first injection and again both 6 and 12  months after the last injection. The evaluation consisted of patient-assessed pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Statistical significance was found for the <b>etofenamate</b> group when comparing preinjection with 12 months postinjection VAS scores (P 0. 05). Results from this study indicated that, <b>etofenamate</b> treatment was not significantly more effective than HA treatment. However, both methods were effective and successful in treating knee osteoarthritis.

40|$|Nicolau syndrome, {{also known}} as embolia cutis medicomentosa, is a rare {{complication}} characterized by tissue necrosis that occurs after injection of drugs. The exact pathogenesis is uncertain, but there are several hypotheses, including direct damage to the end artery and cytotoxic effects of the drug. Severe pain in the immediate postinjection period and purplish discoloration of the skin with reticulate pigmentary pattern is characteristic of this syndrome. Diagnosis is mainly clinical {{and there is no}} standard treatment for the disease. <b>Etofenamate</b> is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Cutaneous adverse findings caused by <b>etofenamate</b> are uncommon. Herein, we present a case with diagnosis of Nicolau syndrome due to <b>etofenamate</b> injection, which is a rare occurrence...|$|E
40|$|The patch {{described}} in this paper combines the principles of wet adhesion, which is a widely adopted biological adhesion system in nature, with transdermal drug delivery. A biologically inspired micropillar patch was fabricated that is self-adhesive, reusable, and can sustain a controlled drug release. We successfully preloaded the commercial non-steroidal anti-inflammatory generic drug unguents indomethacin, ketoprofen, diclofenac sodium and <b>etofenamate</b> into a polydimethylsiloxane elastomeric matrix and fabricated drug-containing micropillar patches. When examining the drug release kinetics and friction of the patches, we observed that these drug unguents can be released calculably and regularly for several days. Additionally, the drug unguents released from the patch to its attached surface are critical to increase {{the strength of the}} patch's adhesion, which is based on capillary attractive forces and is inspired by beetle feet. Here, we create a novel system combining biomimetics and drug delivery that can be modified for use across the biomedical and engineering spectra. Motivation: the objective {{of the present study was}} to characterize a micropillar PDMS patch that was inspired by a beetle's wet adhesion as a platform for conducting in vitro release studies. Commercially available non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used as the model drugs for our delivery systems. An emphasis was put on quantitatively evaluating the drug release and friction manifestation of these patches...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{two most}} common agent groups {{currently}} responsible for photoallergic contact dermatitis (PACD) are organic ultraviolet (UV) absorbers in sunscreens and topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, {{availability of information}} on the photoallergenic potential of these agents is scarce. OBJECTIVES: To obtain current information on the frequency of PACD to 19 organic UV absorbers and five topical NSAIDs, including newer agents, in common usage in Europe. METHODS: A prospective, multicentre photopatch test study was conducted with 1031 patients attending for investigation of suspected PACD in 30 centres across 12 European countries. RESULTS: A total of 346 PACD reactions in 200 (19 · 4 %) subjects occurred. PACD was most commonly caused by the topical NSAIDs, ketoprofen (128 subjects) and <b>etofenamate</b> (59 subjects). Of the organic UV absorbers, octocrylene, benzophenone- 3 and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane most frequently elicited PACD. The 'newer' organic sunscreen absorbers rarely led to PACD. There appeared to be an association between the agents ketoprofen, octocrylene and benzophenone- 3, with several subjects developing PACD to two or all three agents concomitantly. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) was less commonly observed than PACD, comprising 55 reactions in 47 (5 %) subjects. Irritant reactions and photoaugmentation and photoinhibition of ACD occurred infrequently. CONCLUSIONS: The European multicentre photopatch test study has provided current information on the relative frequency of PACD to common photoallergens. Such data will be of value when deciding on which agents to include in a future European 'baseline' photopatch test ser...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTopical non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are recommended}} in international and national guidelines {{as an early}} treatment option for the symptomatic management of knee and hand osteoarthritis (OA), and may be used ahead of oral NSAIDs due to their superior safety profile. The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) treatment algorithm recommends topical NSAIDs for knee OA {{in addition to the}} pharmacological background of symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) and rescue analgesia with paracetamol and non-pharmacological treatment, if the patient is still symptomatic. Topical NSAIDs have a moderate effect on pain relief, with efficacy similar to that of oral NSAIDs, with the advantage of a better risk:benefit ratio. In real-life studies, topical and oral NSAIDs demonstrate an equivalent effect on knee pain over 1 year of treatment, with fewer adverse events due to lower systemic absorption of topical NSAIDs compared with oral NSAIDs. As a result, topical NSAIDs may be the preferred treatment option, especially in OA patients aged ≥ 75 years, and those with co-morbidities or at an increased risk of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal side effects. Furthermore, using topical NSAIDs in inflammatory rheumatic diseases leads to a 40 % reduction in the need for concomitant oral NSAIDs. When selecting a topical NSAID, absorption and bioavailability are important because of heterogeneity among topical drug formulations. Molecules like <b>etofenamate</b> have a bioavailability of > 20 % and evidence for accumulation in synovial tissues, with efficacy demonstrated as improvement in pain and function in real-life studies of OA patients. Diclofenac also shows good efficacy alongside evidence that diclofenac accumulates in the synovium...|$|E
40|$|The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) {{treatment}} algorithm for {{the management}} of knee osteoarthritis (OA), published in December 2014, provides practical guidance for the prioritization of interventions. This current paper represents an assessment and endorsement of the algorithm by Russian experts in OA for use in Russian clinical practice, {{with the aim of}} providing easy-to-follow advice on how to establish a treatment flow in patients with knee OA, in support of the clinicians’ individualized assessment of the patient.  Medications recommended by the ESCEO algorithm are available in Russia. In step 1, background maintenance therapy with symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) is advised, for which high-quality evidence is provided only for the formulations of patented crystalline glucosamine sulphate (pCGS) (Rottapharm/Meda) and prescription chondroitin sulfate. Paracetamol may be added for rescue analgesia only, due to limited efficacy and increasing safety signals. Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may provide additional symptomatic treatment with the same degree of efficacy as oral NSAIDs but without the systemic safety concerns. To be effective, topical NSAIDs must have high bioavailability, and among NSAIDs molecules like <b>etofenamate</b> have high absorption and bioavailability alongside evidence for accumulation in synovial tissues. Oral NSAIDs maintain a central role in step 2 advanced management of persistent symptoms. However, oral NSAIDs are highly heterogeneous in terms of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety profile, and patient stratification with careful treatment selection is advocated to maximize the risk: benefit ratio. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid as a next step provides sustained clinical benefit with effects lasting up to 6 months after a short-course of weekly injections. As a last step before surgery, the slow titration of sustained-release tramadol, a weak opioid, affords sustained analgesia with improved tolerability. </p...|$|E
40|$|Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and {{catalase}} (CAT) {{are active}} scavengers of {{reactive oxygen species}} and were incorporated into ultradeformable vesicles {{with the aim of}} increasing enzyme bioavailability (skin delivery). These special very adaptable vesicles have been formulated and optimized for enzyme transport in order to penetrate into or across the intact skin barrier. Anti-inflammatory activity of SOD-loaded, CAT-loaded and of SOD- and CAT-loaded ultradeformable vesicles applied epicutaneously was measured using different protein doses on the skin, on an arachidonic acid-induced mouse ear oedema. The biological anti-oedema activity is a measurement of drug-targeting potentiation in the organ. Delivery by means of deformable vesicles was compared to conventional vesicles or the absence of an enzyme carrier mediated transport. This was done at various times following prophylactic application of the test formulations. Positive reference groups were treated epicutaneously with several low molecular weight non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The latter included indomethacin (3 mg kg(- 1)), <b>etofenamate</b> (30 mg kg(- 1)) and piroxicam (11 mg kg(- 1)) and reduced the oedema by 94 +/- 4 %, 81 +/- 4 % and 42 +/- 5 %, respectively, if measured 30 min after ear treatment with a NSAID. Of the enzyme-loaded carriers tested, only the enzyme-loaded ultradeformable vesicles reduced the swelling of ears significantly: SOD (90 mu g kg(- 1)), CAT (250 mu g kg(- 1)) and SOD (90 mu g kg(- 1)) plus CAT (250 mu g kg(- 1)) reduced the oedema by 70 +/- 12 %, 65 +/- 10 % and 61 +/- 19 %, respectively, at t = 30 min. Aqueous enzyme solutions and empty carriers had no such effect. The combination of two enzymes resulted in no increased therapeutic effect, but the results are inconclusive since only two dose combinations were tested. The results presented in this study suggest that antioxidant enzymes delivered by means of ultradeformable lipid vesicles can serve as a novel region-specific treatment of inflammation [...] - Fundacao para a Ciencia e para a Tecnologia [POCTI/ 1999 /FCB/ 35787]. - Professor Gregor Cevc is acknowledged for the discussion of the results.

40|$|The high-affinity IgE {{receptor}} (Fcε RI) is a heterotetramer {{of three}} subunits: Fcε RIα, Fcε RIβ and Fcε RIγ (αβγ 2) encoded by three genes designated as FCER 1 A, FCER 1 B (MS 4 A 2) and FCER 1 G, respectively. Recent {{evidence points to}} FCERI gene variability as a relevant factor {{in the risk of}} developing allergic diseases. Because Fcε RI {{plays a key role in}} the events downstream of the triggering factors in immunological response, we hypothesized that FCERI gene variants might be related with the risk of, or with the clinical response to, selective (IgE mediated) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) hypersensitivity. From a cohort of 314 patients suffering from selective hypersensitivity to metamizole, ibuprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), propifenazone, naproxen, ketoprofen, dexketoprofen, <b>etofenamate,</b> aceclofenac, etoricoxib, dexibuprofen, indomethacin, oxyphenylbutazone or piroxicam, and 585 unrelated healthy controls that tolerated these NSAIDs, we analyzed the putative effects of the FCERI SNPs FCER 1 A rs 2494262, rs 2427837 and rs 2251746; FCER 1 B rs 1441586, rs 569108 and rs 512555; FCER 1 G rs 11587213, rs 2070901 and rs 11421. Furthermore, in order to identify additional genetic markers which might be associated with the risk of developing selective NSAID hypersensitivity, or which may modify the putative association of FCERI gene variations with risk, we analyzed polymorphisms known to affect histamine synthesis or metabolism, such as rs 17740607, rs 2073440, rs 1801105, rs 2052129, rs 10156191, rs 1049742 and rs 1049793 in the HDC, HNMT and DAO genes. No major genetic associations with risk or with clinical presentation, and no gene-gene interactions, or gene-phenotype interactions (including age, gender, IgE concentration, antecedents of atopy, culprit drug or clinical presentation) were identified in patients. However, logistic regression analyses indicated that the presence of antecedents of atopy and the DAO SNP rs 2052129 (GG) were strongly related (P< 0. 001 and P= 0. 005, respectively) with selective hypersensitivity to ibuprofen. With regard to patients with selective hypersensitivity to ASA, men were more prone to develop such a reaction than women (P= 0. 011), and the detrimental DAO SNP rs 10156191 in homozygosity increased the risk of developing such hypersensitivity (P= 0. 039) ...|$|E
