50|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} play a {{very important}} role in - pump-mediated signal transduction. For example, <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> interacts directly with Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, to form a signaling receptor complex. Src kinase is inhibited by <b>-</b> <b>pump,</b> while, upon ouabain binding, the Src kinase domain will be released and then activated. Based on this scenario, NaKtide, a peptide Src inhibitor derived from <b>-</b> <b>pump,</b> was developed as a functional ouabain-- pump-mediated signal transduction. <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> also interacts with ankyrin, IP3R, PI3K, PLC-gamma and cofilin.|$|R
2500|$|Misfunction of the {{sodium-potassium pump}} {{may be a}} factor in some dystonias. The <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> has been shown to control and set the {{intrinsic}} activity mode of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. This suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic, [...] "housekeeping" [...] molecule for ionic gradients; but could be a computational element in the cerebellum and the brain. Indeed, an ouabain block of <b>-</b> <b>pumps</b> in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia. Ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations, dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations. A mutation in the <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> (ATP1A3 gene) can cause rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism. The parkinsonism aspect of this disease is thought to be attributable to malfunctioning <b>-</b> <b>pumps</b> in the basal ganglia; the dystonia aspect is thought to be attributable to malfunctioning <b>-</b> <b>pumps</b> in the cerebellum (that act to corrupt its input to the basal ganglia) [...] possibly in Purkinje neurons.|$|R
5000|$|Failure of the <b>-</b> <b>pumps</b> {{can result}} in {{swelling}} of the cell. A cell's osmolarity {{is the sum of}} the concentrations of the various ion species and many proteins and other organic compounds inside the cell. When this is higher than the osmolarity outside of the cell, water flows into the cell through osmosis. This can cause the cell to swell up and lyse. The <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> helps to maintain the right concentrations of ions.Furthermore, when the cell begins to swell, this automatically activates the <b>-</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> {{has been}} shown to control and set the {{intrinsic}} activity mode of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. This suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic, [...] "housekeeping" [...] molecule for ionic gradients; but could be a computation element in the cerebellum and the brain. Indeed, a mutation in the <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> causes rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism, which has symptoms to indicate that it is a pathology of cerebellar computation. Furthermore, an ouabain block of <b>-</b> <b>pumps</b> in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia. Alcohol inhibits sodium-potassium pumps in the cerebellum and this is likely how it corrupts cerebellar computation and body co-ordination. The distribution of the <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> on myelinated axons, in human brain, was demonstrated to be along the internodal axolemma, and not within the nodal axolemma as previously thought.|$|R

5000|$|Findings have {{suggested}} that Purkinje cell dendrites release endocannabinoids that can transiently downregulate both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The intrinsic activity mode of Purkinje cells is set and controlled by the sodium-potassium pump. This suggests that the pump might not be simply a homeostatic, [...] "housekeeping" [...] molecule for ionic gradients. Instead, {{it could be a}} computation element in the cerebellum and the brain. Indeed, a mutation in the <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> causes rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism; its symptoms indicate that it is a pathology of cerebellar computation. Furthermore, using the poison ouabain to block <b>-</b> <b>pumps</b> in the cerebellum of a live mouse induces ataxia and dystonia. Numerical modeling of experimental data suggests that, in vivo, the <b>-</b> <b>pump</b> produces long quiescent punctuations (>> 1 s) to Purkinje neuron firing; these may have a computational role. Alcohol inhibits <b>-</b> <b>pumps</b> in the cerebellum and this is likely how it corrupts cerebellar computation and body co-ordination.|$|R
