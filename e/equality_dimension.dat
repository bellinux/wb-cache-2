40|$|This paper {{starts from}} two {{significant}} {{developments in the}} field of social and employment policies in the European Union (EU). First, the contents are increasingly informed by a strong activation discourse. Second, by inventing the European Employment Strategy (EES), the EU managed to significantly expand its activities into this realm. On the one hand, this turn towards activation has massive implications for gender norms and relations. On the other hand, the EU is a major proponent of gender equality and gender mainstreaming. Therefore, this paper focuses on the strategy’s specific gender <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> because the consequences in terms of potential exclusion and inequality will become particularly visible in this area. It scrutinises whether the EES is able to highlight and to promote equal opportunities within the general activation agenda. Comparing its reception in Germany, the United Kingdom and Hungary the paper argues that the EES is best understood as specific process of conceptual debate, which has dramatically failed in its gender <b>equality</b> <b>dimension.</b> Thereby, the Union is missing a crucial opportunity to tackle one key aspect of gendered exclusion from equal citizenship – inequalities between women and men in social policies and the labour market...|$|E
40|$|The Supreme Court {{is finally}} {{beginning}} to bring clarity {{to the law}} of regulatory takings and in the process is bringing to the fore a previously submerged theme in the jurisprudence: regulatory takings as a question of distributional justice and horizontal equity. This Article argues that this <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> is fundamentally problematic. On a theoretical level, privileging norms of equality engrafts political process rationales for heightened scrutiny onto groups defined solely by the differential burden of a regulation, an exercise in circularity. Equally troubling is the inverted political economy of regulatory takings claims that is likely to result: the greatest judicial protection is provided to those most able to navigate the political system. And from a doctrinal perspective, an overly robust equality inquiry housed in the Takings Clause is inherently indeterminate, warping not only the fabric of takings but also of equal protection jurisprudence. Accordingly, this Article argues that concerns about the uneven distribution of regulatory burdens should sound not under the Takings Clause but rather under the Equal Protection Clause, with its deferential standards for the review of ordinary economic and social regulation. Excising the <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> of regulatory takings would properly leave the Takings Clause as a guard against those rare regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the direct exercise of eminent domain. The result would be a simpler, clearer, and ultimately more egalitarian law of takings...|$|E

This generated an important debate about historic responsibility of developed countries and the need for sustainable growth pathways for developing countries. This conference contribution looks into the <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> of the Paris Climate Agreement and its (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions, (I) NDCs. We use the Gini index and the Lorenz curves to assess the carbon equity performance of the (I) NDCs. We compare the Gini index of annual and cumulative national average per capita GHG emissions for the time frame 2015 - 2030 of conditional and unconditional (I) NDCs and set this into perspective with the recent evolution of GHG emissions equality. Our results show that the (I) NDCs, while not meeting the Paris temperature goal, lead towards a more equitable future, though at a slower rate and mostly attributed to efforts by developing countries...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This paper raises {{questions}} about equality in partnerships, since imbalance in partnerships may effect collaboration outcomes in integrated care. We address aspects of equality in mandatory, public-public partnerships, {{from the perspective of}} municipal care. We have developed a questionnaire wherein the Norwegian Coordination Reform is an illustrative example. The following research question is addressed: What <b>equality</b> <b>dimensions</b> are important for municipals related to mandatory partnerships with hospitals? Theory/methods: Since we did not find any instrument to measure equality in partnerships, an explorative design was chosen. The development of the instrument was based on the theory on partnership and knowledge about the field and context. A national online survey was emitted to all 429 Norwegian municipalities in 2013. The response rate was in total 58 percent (n = 248). The data were mainly analysed using Principal component analysis. Results: It seems that the two dimensions “learning and expertise equality” and “contractual equality” collects reliable and valid data to measure aspects of equality in partnerships. Discussion: Partnerships are usually based on voluntarism. The results indicate that mandatory partnerships, within a public health care system, can be appropriate to equalize partnerships between health care providers at different care levels...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present a systematic, {{holistic}} evaluation of the South African education system, using international benchmarks as the yardstick. A theoretical model for the evaluation of a national education project is constructed. This consists of three dimensions, namely: a quantitative dimension, a qualitative dimension, and an <b>equality</b> <b>dimension.</b> International databases and the existing international taxonomies of national education systems are then used to evaluate the South African education system, along the three dimensions of the model. It is found that the weakest links are the facts that primary and secondary education enrolment ratios are not followed through to the higher education level; that input, particularly financial input, does not render a commensurate return in terms of the quality of teaching and learning, and learning outcomes; that the administrative component of the system and teacher input appear to be the two weak links in the system in this regard; and that stark inequalities exist in the education system. In conclusion, some recommendations for the improvement of practice and for further research are made...|$|E
40|$|The OMC and the European Employment Strategy: Broadening the {{possibilities}} for gender equality? Gender equality has long been identified as an objective of the European Union its first mention was in the Treaty of Rome {{and it has been}} the subject of several Directives since 1976. It has gained a renewed salience with the recognition that the employment growth central to EU progress is heavily dependent on increased female labour market participation. This has placed gender equality in the European Employment Strategy (EES) frame and as a result it is a relevant area of interest for examination of the open method of coordination (OMC). The OMC is the process through which the employment anchored social policy framework of the European Union, in particular the reforms stemming from the Lisbon Strategy, are formulated. It {{has been the subject of}} considerable analysis and commentary ranging from highly positive, at least in terms of its potential, to relatively negative and pointing to inherent limitations. This paper focuses on the potential and limitations of the OMC for enhancing social policy objectives in the EU, in particular the gender <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> as reflected in labour market participation and gender mainstreaming.

40|$|General {{remarks on}} {{references}} Rights {{on the individual}} <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> are mostly laid down in formal legislation and entailed the study of laws and other legal texts. Much of the information for the individual dimension could be derived from secondary literature (in particular Bauböck et al. 2006 a; 2006 b; Davy 2001). The data collection for the indicators of the cultural difference dimension was more difficult {{because it has been}} neglected in earlier cross-national research and because these rights are not always laid down in formal legislation and depend more strongly on jurisprudence, administrative decrees, and local implementation practices. We therefore relied, besides available secondary literature, on information directly requested from ministries, immigrant organizations, and national experts, as well as from websites and newspaper archives. General remarks on the scoring procedure We used the variation among countries as the standard of comparison for allocating scores for each country-year combination. These scores all range between- 1 and 1. Depending on how fine-grained the distinctions were that an indicator allowed, we distinguished two (- 1 and 1), three (- 1, 0, and 1), or five score levels (- 1,- 0. 5, 0, 0. 5, 1). The- 1 score was always given to the country-year combination or combinations that granted the least rights to immigrants or implied the most severe restrictions within our sample. Conversely, the + 1 score was given to the country-year combination or combinations that granted the most rights or implied the least restrictions within the sample...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, we {{investigate}} the descriptive premises involved in portrayals of a Nordic model of gender equality. Mainly, {{we focus on}} the <b>equality</b> <b>dimensions</b> that form the baseline in comparative welfare state research and research on political participation. We outline these dimensions as norms for economic equity and democratic parity. First, we examine whether and how descriptive statistics that assess these two dimensions currently rank Nordic countries compared with other European countries among the member states of the European Union. For this, we utilize the EU’s Gender Equality Index. We then search for comparable statistics on outcome and performance that include the Nordic non-EU members Norway and Iceland to explore similarities and differences within the Nordic region, as well as see how these countries compare to the Nordic EU members: Denmark, Finland and Sweden. Finally, we approach the question of policy models, discussing whether it is possible to identify a distinctive policy profile common to the Nordic countries for how to promote economic equity and democratic parity. We conclude this investigation with a set of what we regard as informed speculations regarding how policy might matter to gender equality in the Nordic countries today...|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court’s recent {{decision}} in United States v. Windsor, invalidating {{part of the}} federal Defense of Marriage Act, presents a significant interpretive challenge. Early commentators have criticized the majority opinion’s lack of analytical rigor, and expressed doubt that Windsor can serve as a meaningful precedent with respect to constitutional questions outside the area of same-sex marriage. This Article offers a more rehabilitative reading of Windsor and shows how the decision can be used to analyze a significant constitutional question concerning the use of state criminal procedure to regulate immigration. From Windsor’s holding, the Article distills two concrete doctrinal propositions concerning the Due Process Clause’s application in cases that have significant <b>equality</b> <b>dimensions.</b> It then shows how one can use these propositions to evaluate the constitutionality of state laws that categorically deny bail to undocumented immigrants. The Article thereby makes a significant practical contribution to the burgeoning constitutional “dignity” literature. Furthermore, it offers an interpretation of Windsor that will be welcomed by those who applaud the recent triumphs of gay rights advocates in the Supreme Court but lament the stagnation and regression of constitutional protections for other groups...|$|R

40|$|Background: Adolescents' {{health is}} greatly {{influenced}} by social determinants, including gender norms. Although {{research has shown that}} there is an association between gender attitudes and adolescents' sexual behaviour, few studies have assessed this relationship carefully. The Attitudes toward Women Scale for Adolescents (AWSA) is widely used to assess gender attitudes among adolescents; however, to our knowledge it has not been applied in Latin America. Objective: To apply AWSA in Latin America for the first time, to perform a factorial validation of this scale and to assess the relationship of gender attitudes and sexual behaviour in Bolivian and Ecuadorian adolescents. Design: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 2011 among 14 - 18 year olds in 20 high schools in Cochabamba (Bolivia) and six in Cuenca (Ecuador) {{as a part of a}} larger project. Schools were purposively selected. A Spanish version of the 12 -item AWSA was employed for this study. The assessed aspects of adolescent sexual behaviour were: reported sexual intercourse, reported positive experience during last sexual intercourse and reported current use of contraception. The psychometric properties of AWSA were investigated, and both explanatory and confirmatory factorial analyses were performed. Results: The number of questionnaires included in the analysis was 3, 518 in Bolivia and 2, 401 in Ecuador. A factorial analysis of AWSA resulted in three factors: power dimension (PD), <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> (ED) and behavioural dimension (BD). ED showed the highest correlates with adolescent sexual behaviour. Higher scores of this dimension were associated with a more positive experience of sexual relationships, a higher current use of modern contraception and greater sexual activity among girls. Conclusions: This study revealed a three-factorial structure of AWSA and demonstrated that by employing factors, the sensitivity of AWSA increases as compared to using the scale as a whole to assess sexual behaviour. This could have important implications for future research on gender and the sexual experiences of adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Cleavages {{have been}} central in {{understanding}} the relationship between political parties and voters but the credibility of cleavage approach has been increasingly debated. This is because of decreasing party loyalty, fewer ideological differences between the parties and general social structural change amongst other factors. By definition, cleavages arise when social structural groups recognize their clashing interests, which are reflected in common values and attitudes, and vote for parties that are dedicated to defend {{the interests of the}} groups concerned. This study assesses relevance of cleavage approach in the Finnish context. The research problem in this study is “what kind of a cleavage structure exists in Finland {{at the beginning of the}} 21 st century? Finland represents a case that has traditionally been characterized by a strong and diverse cleavage structure, notable ideological fragmentation in the electorate and an ideologically diverse party system. Nevertheless, the picture of the party-voter ties in Finland still remains incomplete with regard to a thorough analysis of cleavages. In addition, despite the vast amount of literature on cleavages in political science, studies that thoroughly analyze national cleavage structures by assessing the relationship between social structural position, values and attitudes and party choice have been rare. The research questions are approached by deploying statistical analyses, and using Finnish National Election Studies from 2003, 2007 and 2011 as data. In this study, seven different social structural cleavage bases are analyzed: native language, type of residential area, occupational class, education, denomination, gender and age cohorts. Four different value/attitudinal dimensions were identified in this study: economic right and authority, regional and socioeconomic equality, sociocultural and European Union dimensions. This study shows that despite the weak overall effect of social structural positions on values and attitudes, a few rather strong connections between them were identified. The overall impact of social structural position and values and attitudes on party choice varies significantly between parties. Cleavages still exist in Finland and the cleavage structure partly reflects the old basis in the Finnish party system. The cleavage that is based on the type of residential area and reflected in regional and socioeconomic equality dimensions concerns primarily the voters of the Centre Party and the Coalition Party. The linguistic cleavage concerns mostly the voters of the Swedish People’s Party. The classic class cleavage reflected in the regional and socioeconomic <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> concerns in turn first and foremost the blue-collar voters of the Left Alliance and the Social Democratic Party, the agricultural entrepreneur voters of the Centre Party and higher professional and manager voters of the Coalition Party. The conflict with the most potential as a cleavage is the one based on social status (occupational class and education) and it is reflected in sociocultural and EU dimensions. It sets the voters of the True Finns against the voters of the Green League and the Coalition Party. The study underlines the challenges the old parties have met after the volatile election in 2011, which shook the cleavage structure. It also describes the complexity involved in the Finnish conflict structure and the multidimensionality in the electoral competition between the parties...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliography. The {{majority}} {{of the countries in}} Latin America are currently undergoing processes of economic growth and poverty reduction. As part of that development, it is critical that they address the challenge of articulating and consolidating their digital economy, as ECLAC puts forth in this book. This will require exploring how to identify and exploit the new opportunities that arise from technological convergence in order to foster economic development and equality. First, new strategies are needed for maximizing the impact of the digital economy on growth, innovation, structural change and social inclusion. The main challenges are to ensure the minimum conditions necessary for investment in information and communication technologies (ICTs) to {{have a positive impact on}} economic growth; to promote and consolidate a broadband-based technological innovation and diffusion model, compatible with the objectives of social inclusion; and to foster a change in the production structure that, based on the specific economic and institutional characteristics of each country, articulates knowledge with production and strengthens the software sector. Second, a consolidated policy framework needs to focus on the key factors for the deployment of the digital economy. The main deficiencies that need to be addressed are investment in telecommunications infrastructure, the demand for broadband and the development of the application software industry. Public policy is crucial for ensuring equality of access and use of ICTs that facilitate the provision of social services (public administration, health and education) and public goods. Third, the region needs to move towards establishing an institutional framework for the digital economy that integrates policy initiatives on broadband, ICT industries and digital inclusion. In this area, the following chapters propose organized actions based on two pillars: ICT policies for structural change and ICTs for equality and social inclusion. The book has three parts. The first section, comprising chapters I and II, defines the digital economy, describes its dynamics in Latin America and discusses its share of GDP for four countries in the region (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico). It also examines the environment in which the digital economy is developing, mainly in terms of the implementation of digital agendas and the diffusion of internet and broadband, and analyses the impact of ICTs on economic growth and productivity. The second part (chapter III) lays out the vision held by ECLAC on structural change and equality and the role of ICTs as complementary assets that evolve in conjunction with the production structure. The interaction between ICTs, structural change and growth are analysed based on ICT diffusion indicators and an econometric exercise. In this chapter, the <b>equality</b> <b>dimension</b> is explored through an analysis of the relationship between ICTs and the distribution of income and between these and educational achievements. The third part of the book (chapters IV and V) examines ICT policies for structural change and the use of these technologies for social inclusion. Chapter IV describes the Latin American telecommunications services market and analyses the opportunities for the region of the applications and software industries. It also proposes strategic objectives for broadband policy and action areas for achieving them. Finally, the chapter explores the industrial policy challenges with regard to digital economy and its priority objectives, describes the current situation and progress in the software industry and discusses the incorporation of ICTs in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Chapter V analyses the role of ICTs in social inclusion in three areas: education, health and electronic government. It provides an overview of ICT diffusion in each of these areas and suggests public policy guidelines for taking full advantage of the potential of ICTs. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the book’s findings and highlights the proposals that emerge from the different chapters. Introduction. [...] I. The digital economy in Latin America. [...] II.

40|$|This article {{identifies}} a previously-ignored {{pattern of}} Supreme Court decisions that privilege one competing constitutional value, either speech or equality, and subordinate the other—with {{little or no}} reasoning explaining its choice. In adjudicating such cases, including two cases decided last term, the Supreme Court has steadfastly treated these disputes as either a basic equality case or a simple speech case. This dichotomy is a problem because once the Court places a case within either a speech or equality paradigm, it is constrained by certain rigid analytical presumptions. These presumptions threaten to stunt the analysis and to deprive the Court of the flexibility necessary to reconcile the competing constitutional commitments. Consequently, a string of Supreme Court cases have privileged First Amendment interests of speech or association over equality interests. At times, the Court has not even recognized the <b>equality</b> <b>dimensions</b> of these cases {{in part because the}} equality interests were embedded in state antidiscrimination laws. 	Analyzing a number of key cases including the Boy Scouts and burning cross cases, I show that, contrary to the Court’s reductive assumptions, these cases are fundamentally about speech and equality. Rather than artificially force a case into a speech or equality box, my approach would fuse speech and equality doctrine. After setting forth a general framework to speech-equality intersections, this Article reconstructs the analysis of Boy Scouts of America v. Dale and R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul to show how a more balanced approach would produce a finer-grained analysis reflective of a holistic conception of the Constitution...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{delivered}} {{as part of}} a panel entitled “The Justness of Criminal Justice: How has the Charter Changed the Problems We Face?” Participants were asked to “reflect on the social justice issues raised {{in the criminal justice system}} and how those issues have remained, changed or been redressed over the life of the Charter”. The author’s the sis is: (1) the criminal justice system is overflowing with social justice issues; (2) the most significant insight about the criminal justice system in the past 30 years is that criminal law raises equality values; (3) the Charter has had something (but not much) to do with raising that claim; (4) it would be naive to assume that Charter rights could singlehandedly ameliorate the multi-dimensional nature of the social injustice perpetrated by the criminal justice system; and (5) the Charter’s most important role in improving the system is in its potential to “unearth, render visible and potentiate criminal justice responses to systemic inequality”. The paper examines two areas in which the Charter has had a significant impact on how criminal justice issues are conceptualized. The first is in the construction of blame and the move away from a simplistic subjectivism. The second is in the overt recognition of the <b>equality</b> <b>dimensions</b> of many criminal law problems such as, for example, sexual assault, intoxication and the affirmative defences. The author concludes by examining three recent cases in which equality values have played a significant role: R. v. Tran, Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford and R. v. Ipeelee, along with two recent sentencing decisions where equality arguments were unsuccessful (R. v. Nur and R. v. Johnson).

40|$|Hoffman et al. (1) {{claimed to}} provide {{evidence}} that “nurture” (i. e., residing in a patrilineal vs. matrilineal tribe in India) critically affects sex differences in spatial abilities. Unfortunately, their conclusion is undermined by major problems with their measures of spatial ability and sex equality. The first and biggest problem is with their measure of spatial abilities. “Spatial abilities” are a complex cognitive domain, with facets ranging from location memory (favoring women) to navigation in 3 D virtual space (favoring men) (2). The puzzle used by Hoffman et al. (1) {{is similar to the}} Object Assembly subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (3); sex differences on this task are extremely small (d = 0. 10), at least 10 -fold smaller than those found for spatial measures showing the largest sex differences. It is odd that Hoffman et al. (1) chose to investigate sex differences with this kind of sex-insensitive task. The second problem is the lack of a control task. The insensitivity of the task used by Hoffman et al. (1) suggests that their finding that men outperform women in a patrilineal tribe but not a matrilineal tribe is not related to sex differences in spatial abilities per se but to other factors instead. Education, as they noted, is likely one of these. The use of a cognitive control task tapping nonspatial abilities would have allowed for an assessment of the specificity of the effect, but, unfortunately, such a task was not included. Third, defining sex equality as matrilineality is problematic, because cross-cultural studies generally show that equality (a multidimensional construct) is not systematically correlated with descent system (4). From the descriptions of Hoffman et al. (1), it appears that women in the matrilineal Khasi have more economic power and better education, but this ignores other sex <b>equality</b> <b>dimensions,</b> such as positions of political and religious leadership, domestic authority, and autonomy. Without such measures, it is unclear whether the Khasi are, in fact, more sexegalitarian than the Karbi. Furthermore, a recent 53 -nation cross-cultural study has shown that sex differences favoring men on validated, reliable, multi-item spatial measures are positively associated with United Nation indices of sex development and empowerment (5), a pattern opposite to that reported by Hoffman et al. (1). For all these reasons, the study by Hoffman et al. (1) failed to support their conclusions...|$|R

CAP argues for ‘planning as an inclusive process [...] . rooted in concerns for equity’ (CAP 2008). Gender <b>equality</b> is one <b>dimension</b> {{of this kind of}} inclusive planning. This position, which was endorsed by the UN-Habitat World Urban Forum in 2006, also reflects the Commonwealth’s strong commitment to gender equality. So why does gender matter in urban planning? And, what might ‘gendered planning practice’ hope to achieve?Commonwealth Secretaria...|$|R
40|$|Recently Bingbing Liang and Hanfeng Li {{computed}} {{the mean}} dimension and metric mean dimension for algebraic actions of amenable groups. We show how {{to extend their}} computation of metric mean dimension {{to the case of}} sofic groups, provided that the dual module is finitely generated. Additionally, we show that when the dual module is finitely presented that the mean dimension is the von Neumann rank. The proof also goes through introducing ℓ^p-analogues of metric mean dimension, which may be seen as an obstruction to the <b>equality</b> of mean <b>dimension</b> and metric mean dimension. Comment: 36 pages. Fixed numerous typographical errors. Additionally I fixed some issues related to left and right multiplication in the paper which confused matters in previous versions.

40|$|All animals {{live and}} move through {{three-dimensional}} environments, yet {{we do not}} understand how three-dimensional space is learned, remembered and used. Pelagic fish are ideal model organisms for studying three-dimensional spatial cognition as they move freely through volumes with six degrees of freedom. This is in contrast to surface-bound animals, such as rats, which are constrained to three degrees of freedom of movement. The type of movement that vertebrates display, whether freely moving through volumes (flying or swimming) or surface-bound, might shape their representation of space. We investigated true three-dimensional spatial cognition in an animal that moves freely within volumetric space. We interrogated the three-dimensional trajectories of freely swimming fish (banded tetras, Astyanax fasciatus) that were previously trained to navigate towards a reward inside a maze with horizontal and vertical components. The fish accurately encoded the rewarded three-dimensional direction. As predicted, free-swimming deviations from their original constrained trajectory were similar in both the horizontal and vertical axes, unlike in surface-bound rats. This <b>equality</b> between <b>dimensions</b> is the first direct evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the way animals move through their environment shapes how they learn and use spatial information, indicating a previously unknown adaptation in cognitive representations of space. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the Gerstenhaber-Schack cohomology of a Hopf algebra determines its Hochschild cohomology, and in {{particular}} its Gerstenhaber-Schack cohomological dimension bounds its Hochschild cohomological <b>dimension,</b> with <b>equality</b> of the <b>dimensions</b> when the Hopf algebra is cosemisimple of Kac type. Together with some general considerations on free Yetter-Drinfeld modules over adjoint Hopf subalgebras and the monoidal invariance of Gerstenhaber-Schack cohomology, this is used to show that both Gerstenhaber-Schack and Hochschild cohomological dimensions of the coordinate algebra of the quantum permutation group are 3. Comment: 21 pages. V 3 : title has changed, because the main theoretical results relating Hochschild and Gerstenhaber cohomologies are in fact valid for any Hopf algebra. However, because of a gap in part of Theorem 5. 2 of the previous version, the computations in Section 6 now only cover the cosemisimple example...|$|R
