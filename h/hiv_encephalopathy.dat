40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} proton MR spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) in detecting metabolic changes in diffuse or focal lesions in the brain of patients infected with HIV.  METHODS—Sixty HIV seropositive patients (25 with <b>HIV</b> related <b>encephalopathies,</b> 20 with toxoplasmosis, eight with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathies (PMLs), and seven with lymphomas) and 22 HIV seronegative neurological controls were examined with a combined MRI and 1 H-MRS technique using a Siemens 1. 5 Tesla Magnetom. Spectra (Spin Echo sequence, TE 135 ms) were acquired by single voxel, localised on focal lesions in toxoplasmosis, PML, lymphomas, and <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> and on the centrum semiovale of neurological controls. Choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), lactate, and lipids were evaluated in each spectrum and NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios were calculated.  RESULTS—A significant decrease in NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios were found in all HIV diagnostic groups in comparison with neurological controls (p< 0. 003), suggesting neuronal or axonal damage independent of brain lesion aetiology. However, the NAA/Cr ratio was significantly lower in PML and lymphomas than in <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (p< 0. 02) and toxoplasmosis (p< 0. 05). <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathies,</b> lymphomas, and toxoplasmosis showed {{a significant increase in}} the Cho/Cr ratio in comparison with neurological controls (p< 0. 03) without between group differences. The presence of a lipid signal was more frequent in lymphomas (71 %) than in other HIV groups (Fisher's test, p= 0. 00003). The presence of mobile lipid resonance together with a high Cho/Cr ratio in lymphomas may be related to an increased membrane synthesis and turnover in tumour cells. A lactate signal (marker of inflammatory reaction), was found in all but one patient with PML lesions (75 %), but had a lower incidence in the other HIV diagnostic groups (Fisher's test, p= 0. 00024).  CONCLUSION— 1 H-MRS shows a high sensitivity in detecting brain involvement in HIV related diseases, but a poor specificity in differential diagnosis of HIV brain lesions. Nevertheless, the homogeneous metabolic pattern that characterises PML suggests the usefulness of 1 H-MRS as an adjunct to MRI in differentiating CNS white matter lesions, such as <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathies,</b> from PML. ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesWe {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} neurological outcomes {{and determine the}} prevalence of <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> in a cohort of HIV-infected children in Jamaica. MethodsData for 287 HIV-infected children presenting between 2002 and 2008 were reviewed and neurological outcomes characterized. A nested case–control study was conducted between July and September 2009 used 15 randomly selected encephalopathic HIV-infected children aged 7 – 10 years and 15 matched controls (non-encephalopathic HIV-infected). Their neurocognitive functions were evaluated using clinical assessment and standardized tests for intelligence, short term memory (visuo-spatial and auditory), selective attention, and fine motor and coordination functions. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and the Mann–Whitney U-test. ResultsSixty-seven (23. 3 %) children were encephalopathic. The median age at diagnosis of <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> was 1. 6 years (interquartile range (IQR) 1. 1 – 3. 4 years). Predominant abnormalities were delayed milestones (59, 88. 1 %), hyperreflexia (59, 86. 5 %), spasticity (50, 74. 6 %), microcephaly (42, 61. 7 %), and quadriparesis (21, 31. 3 %). The median age of tested children was 8. 7 years (IQR 7. 6 – 10. 8 years) in the encephalopathic group and 9 years (IQR 7. 4 – 10. 7 years) in the non-encephalopathic group. Encephalopathic children performed worse in all domains of neurocognitive function (p< 0. 05).

40|$|It is {{important}} to recognise {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) imaging appearances of HIV, in particular those of <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> as this is an AIDS-defining illness. <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is a common manifestation of HIV, with distinct neuro-imaging features. With the use of images we aim to draw the clinician’s attention to the neuro-imaging modalities best suited to demonstrating these features. Neurological dysfunction in AIDS is common, occurring in as many as 80 % of children. 1 The spectrum of diseases includes <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> cerebrovascular disease, PML (progressive multifocal leuko-encephalopathy), infections and malignancies. Opportunistic CNS infections are extremely rare in paediatric AIDS patients compared with adults, 2 - 4 even in the presence of systemic infections by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, candida and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (CMV being the most common paediatric opportunistic infection). 3 Toxoplasmosis is almost never seen in young children. 3, 5, 6 Lymphoma (4 % of HIV-positive children) 6 is more common than toxoplasmosis, 3, 5, 6 but is also not commonly encountered in paediatric practice. The JC virus is considered an opportunistic infection and manifests as PML, which is still rare in children. 3, 5, 7, 8 The imaging manifestations of CNS infections, malignancies and vascular diseases fall outside the scope of this article. Up to 76 % of asymptomatic HIV-positive children are found to have at least one abnormality on computed tomography (CT). 3 Chamberlain et al. 1 found that 40 % of HIV-positive children have abnormal CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans by the age of 1 year.

Few studies of these problems have been conducted in low and middle income countries (LMIC) and even fewer in sub - Saharan Africa where the burden of the HIV epidemic remains heaviest. The aims of this study were to provide a quantitative description of emotional and behavioural problems in a group of children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV in South Africa compared to a group of well - matched HIV - negative controls and to identify demographic, biological, cognitive and contextual correlates of emotional and behavioural problems. A cross-sectional descriptive, analytical study was conducted. Participants were recruited from community and hospital based clinics. Wi thin the HIV - infected group, children were further divided into three subgroups: PHIV+ children who had never been on antiretroviral therapy (ART naÃ¯ve), PHIV+ children on ART and PHIV+ children on ART with a confirmed diagnosis of <b>HIV</b> - related <b>encephalopathy</b> (HIVE). Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Several measures were used to assess demographic, biological, cognitive and contextual correlates of problem behaviours: socio - demographic questionnaire, clinic records, neuropsychological test battery, Family Resource Scale, Family Support Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale. Children were compared by HIV status on demographic, cognitive and contextual variables as well as the total and subscale scores of the CBCL. Multivariate comparisons of the influence of contextual and cognitive variables on CBCL total problems was performed using a hierarchical step - wise linear regression analytic procedure. The final sample (N= 108) for data analysis included 78 PHIV+ children and 30 HIV - negative children. Groups were comparable with respect to demographic and contextual variables.

Previous in vitro studies have used fetal or adult brain tissue. Important differences may exist between brain tissues of different maturational ages with regard to HIV- 1 replication and other neuropathogenic effects. Infant microglia were infected with four different strains of HIV- 1 (JR-FL, JR-CSF, Ba-L, and IIIB). Productive infection was demonstrated by p 24 antigen production, immunocytochemistry, and recovery of replication-competent virus from the supernatants of the infected cultures. Multinucleated giant cells developed in culture mimicking the neuropathological changes seen in the brains of patients with <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> Productive infection was more readily established by monocyte-tropic strains (JR-FL and Ba-L) of HIV- 1 than by a lymphocyte-tropic strain (IIIB). p 24 antigen production in this system peaked at 47 to 51 days postinfection. Viral persistence in giant cells was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry for the gp 120 and gp 41 viral antigens as late as 70 days postinfection.

NAA to Cr ratio was found to be reduced in all the patients, and in fact the value was further reduced compared to the HIV positive group as a whole. Raised choline and myoInositol peaks were also found in all the patients. MR Spectroscopy showed lipid lactate peaks confirming the diagnosis. 2 patients had <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> on the imaging study.

40|$|AbstractIt may be {{postulated}} that the encephalopathy {{induced by the}} human immunodeficiency virus HIV- 1, in particular, the characteristic "myelin pallor," may result from binding of the envelope glycoprotein gp 120 to galactosylceramide and/or its metabolite sulfatide in the plasma membrane of oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. (1) gp 120 {{has been reported to}} have a high affinity for these molecules in vitro. (2) The binding of antibodies to these molecules increases intracellular free calcium levels, which may be cytotoxic. (3) The binding of gp 120 to the CD 4 receptor in the immune system has the same effect. We have investigated the binding of gp 120 to rat oligodendrocytes in vitro by indirect immunofluorescence and have monitored changes in intracellular free calcium with the calcium-sensitive dye INDO- 1, in individual oligodendrocytes exposed to the glycoprotein. Antibodies against galatosylceramide and sulfatide bound to the cell membrane, but gp 120 did not. The antibodies also increased intracellular free calcium levels in the oligodendrocytes, whereas gp 120 did not. It, therefore, seems highly improbable that the demyelination observed during <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is a direct cytotoxic effect of gp 120 on oligodendrocytes...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{aspergillosis}} is {{an extremely}} uncommon complication in HIV-infected patients. In general, prognosis is poor {{and the need for}} nephrectomy is emphasized. We report the case of a 37 -year-old patient with AIDS since April 2003 (CD 4 count 10 cells/mm(3), a high viral load, Candida esophagitis, bilateral pneumonia, <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy).</b> Treatment with zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, and lopinavir/ritonavir was started. Adherence to this medication proved to be a problem, but after 18 weeks of HAART the CD 4 count was 110 cells/mm(3) and viral load was undetectable. One year later, he presented with hematuria and flank pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lesions in both kidneys. Cultures of the abscess aspirates yielded Aspergillus fumigatus. Our review of 18 reported cases shows that prognosis of renal aspergillosis is poor if nephrectomy is not performed. However, in the present case a conservative approach was chosen to avoid life-long dialysis. The patient was treated successfully with a combination of voriconazole, percutaneous drainage, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Renal function was completely preserved. Reported cases from the literature of renal aspergillosis in HIV-infected patients are summarized in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{encephalopathy}} {{resulting from}} direct {{infection of the}} brain by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which correlates clinically with the AIDS dementia complex, has been reported as being localized to the white matter where it induces myelin loss, gliosis and perivascular infiltration by mononuclear macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Damage to the cortical grey matter in <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> was investigated in nine randomly selected HIV-positive cases with or without clinical or morphological evidence of encephalopathy and in five age-matched controls, using routine histology and immunohistochemical methods [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), microglia and HIV antibodies]. Increased numbers of GFAP-expressing astrocytes and Ricinus communis agglutinin 1 - 120 -expressing microglial cells were found in all the HIV-positive cases (including asymptomatic) and their severity could be correlated with {{the severity of the}} encephalopathy in the white matter; the increase in number of cells expressing GFAP was diffuse and the intensity of the staining higher than that of microglial cells. The subpial region was the most severely involved. It is suggested that involvement of the cortical grey matter is more common in HIV infection than previously suspected and that clinical evidence of a dementing process in AIDS is not necessarily due only to white matter lesions...|$|E

40|$|Background. Little {{representative}} information {{exists on}} the frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -related diseases among the overall AIDS population. The objective {{of this research is}} to assess the nature, frequency and characteristics of these diseases among AIDS patients during their last year of life and to analyse these frequencies according to the mode of transmission and other socio-demographk: and medical characteristics. Methods. To obtain comprehensive data, we conducted an investigation based on retrospective collection of clinical information on a representative sample (1203 deaths) of all AIDS deaths that occurred in France during 1992. Results. The frequency of the diseases was markedly higher than the one described in the AIDS surveillance registers and varied between homosexuals and intravenous drug users (IVDU). After controlling for other variables (age, CD 4 counts, survival times) by means of logistic regression, homosexuality remained a significant explaining factor for Kaposi' 8 sarcoma, cytomegalovirus infections, herpes simplex and cryptosporidiosls. In contrast, <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> hepatitis, mental disorders, invasive candidiasls and cachexla were more frequent in male IVDU. Few differences were observed by sex. Conclusions. Several factors may explain the differences: variation In exposure to infectious agents, general health status, use of medical care and direct influence of the mode of HIV transmission. These data are of particular value for medical services in planning the magnitude of health care needs among the AIDS population overall, for clinicians an...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{presence}} of brain antiganglioside antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with HIV infection was analysed. CSF samples were collected from 45 patients with AIDS and from 45 anti-HIV negative subjects, 15 of whom presented aseptic meningitis. Nineteen AIDS patients had clinically well-documented encephalopathy. Thirteen of these patients had white matter lesions shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both IgG and IgM antiganglioside antibodies were detected by immunostaining on thin layer chromatography plates in three CSF samples from AIDS patients with progressive encephalopathy with signs of a diffuse demyelination, as revealed by MRI. Two of these CSF samples reacted specifically with GM 3, GM 1 and GD 1 a and one with GD 1 a. In none of the HIV infected patients without demyelinating encephalopathy, but with opportunistic infections or cerebral lymphoma, nor in the anti-HIV negative control subjects were antiganglioside antibodies detected. No association with JCV DNA, CMV DNA, EBV DNA, detected by nested PCR, nor HIV antigen p 24 was found. These findings show {{the presence of}} brain antiganglioside antibodies in the CSF of AIDS patients for the first time. However, the findings do not suggest relating {{the presence of these}} antibodies to <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> or particular viral agents, but indicate that the antibodies are detectable in subjects with progressive encephalopathy with a diffuse demyelination...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{brain tissue}} from 39 patients {{for the presence}} of proviral HIV- 1 sequences, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of segments of the viral LTR and gag genes. A novel primer extension procedure allowed the detection of a single HIV- 1 copy in 1 micrograms DNA. We detected proviral HIV- 1 DNA in 16 of 25 brain samples from AIDS patients. Semiquantitative evaluation of the amplified DNAs indicated considerable variation in viral load. Highest levels of proviral DNA were present in brain samples from six patients with clinical evidence of HIV-associated cognitive/motor complex and the histopathologic correlate of HIV leukoencephalopathy or HIV encephalitis. An additional 11 brain samples contained smaller amounts of proviral DNA. In these patients, clinical data were inconclusive regarding the diagnosis of HIV- 1 encephalopathy and histopathologically {{there was no evidence of}} HIV- 1 -induced tissue lesions. In nine of 25 seropositive patients with AIDS (36 %), brain samples scored negative or did not contain an unequivocal signal indicating the presence of proviral DNA. HIV- 1 sequences were not detected in any of 14 control brain samples from HIV- 1 seronegative patients. Our data indicate that HIV- 1 is present in the central nervous system of the majority (two thirds) of AIDS patients and that the highest levels of proviral DNA in brain tissue are associated with <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Progressive {{encephalopathy}} (PE) {{in children}} is a heterogeneous group of diseases mainly composed of metabolic diseases, but it consists also of neurodegenerative disorders where neither metabolic nor other causes are found. We wanted to estimate the incidence rate and aetiology of PE, {{as well as the}} age of onset of the disease. Methods We included PE cases born between 1985 and 2003, living in Oslo, and registered the number presenting annually between 1985 and 2004. Person-years at risk between 0 and 15 years were {{based on the number of}} live births during the observation period which was divided into four 5 -year intervals. We calculated incidence rates according to age at onset which was classified as neonatal (0 – 4 weeks), infantile (1 – 12 months), late infantile (1 – 5 years), and juvenile (6 – 12 years). Results We found 84 PE cases representing 28 diagnoses among 1, 305, 997 person years, giving an incidence rate of 6. 43 per 100, 000 person years. The age-specific incidence rates per 100, 000 were: 79. 89 (5 years). 66 % (55 / 84) of the cases were metabolic, 32 % (27 / 54) were neurodegenerative, and 2 % (2 / 84) had <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> 71 % (60 / 84) of the cases presented at Conclusion The overall incidence rate of PE was 6. 43 per 100, 000 person years. There was a strong reduction in incidence rates with increasing age. Two-thirds of the cases were metabolic, of which almost half presented in the neonatal period. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{brain is}} a {{delicate}} organ, and evolution built very efficient ways to protect it. Unfortunately, the same mechanisms that protect it against intrusive chemicals can also frustrate therapeutic interventions. Many existing pharmaceuticals are rendered ineffective {{in the treatment of}} cerebral diseases due to our inability to effectively deliver and sustain them within the brain. General methods that can enhance drug delivery to the brain are, therefore, of great interest. Despite aggressive research, patients suffering from fatal and/ or debilitating central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as brain tumors, <b>HIV</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> epilepsy, cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, far outnumber those dying of all types of systemic cancer or heart disease. The clinical failure of much potentially effective therapeutics is often not {{due to a lack of}} drug potency but rather to shortcomings in the method by which the drug is delivered. Treating CNS diseases is particularly challenging because a variety of formidable obstacles often impede drug delivery to the brain and spinal cord. By localizing drugs at their desired site of action one can reduce toxicity and increase treatment efficiency. In response to the insufficiency in conventional delivery mechanisms, aggressive research efforts have recently focused on the development of new strategies to more effectively deliver drug molecules to the CNS. This review intends to detail the recent advances in the field of brain-targeting, rational drug design approach and drug delivery to CNS. To illustrate the complexity of the problems that have to be overcome for successful brain targeting, a brief intercellular characterization of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is also included...|$|E
