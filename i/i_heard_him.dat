[...] Some religious and social leaders criticized Sunday's exaggerated gestures as well as the slang and colloquialisms that filled his sermons, but audiences clearly enjoyed them.|$|E

She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> talk right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of cut and run {{and no one knew}} exactly why... Maybe he couldn't have withstood all the investigation that goes on now".|$|E
500|$|Sayers had {{the most}} {{productive}} rushing yardage game of his career on November 3, 1968, against the Green Bay Packers, during which he carried 24 times for 205 yards. His season ended prematurely the following week against the 49ers when he tore the ligaments in his right knee. Garry Lyle, the teammate nearest Sayers at the time, said, [...] "I saw his eyes sort of glass over. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> holler. I knew he was hurt." [...] Sayers had again been leading the league in rushing yards through the first nine games, and finished the year with 856 yards. After surgery, Sayers went through a physical rehabilitation program {{with the help of}} Piccolo, who had replaced him in the starting lineup. Despite missing the Bears' final five games, he earned first-team All-Pro recognition from several media outlets, including the AP, and UPI, and NEA.|$|E

They shot the song's music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas. Coyne said, [...] "Stephen [...] {{seems to be}} a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then." [...] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying [...] "I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween." [...] American band Wilco wrote and recorded [...] "Just a Kid".

2500|$|Hill {{remained}} as a committeeman {{and as a}} reporter on Somerset cricket for more than 40 years. He also contributed the notes on Somerset matches to Wisden for many years. His former school-friend and fellow reporter Alan Gibson wrote in 1983: [...] "He rules over the tatty old press-box at Taunton with what purports to be an iron glove, {{though there is a}} velvet hand within it. He will growl about 'you cowboys' to visitors, especially when they arrive late and want to borrow his scorecard, but having been suitably humbled they get their information and their telephone calls in the end... He rightly dislikes a stream of dirty stories in a press-box... but I have noticed he is becoming increasingly voluble himself. Last season <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> mutter 'Good shot' twice in one over." ...|$|E

[...] "It really is just compression," [...] he said. [...] "We didn't create new situations." [...] He further assured that he and his brother Ethan had never met McCarthy when they were writing the script, but first met him during the shooting of the film. He believed that the author liked the film, while his brother Ethan said, [...] "he didn't yell at us. We were actually sitting in a movie theater/screening room with him when he saw it... and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> chuckle a couple of times, so I took that as a seal of approval, I don't know, maybe presumptuously." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Slash {{decided to}} form a band with his friend Steven Adler. The band never materialized, but it {{prompted}} Slash to take up an instrument. Since Adler had designated himself the role of guitarist, Slash decided {{to learn how to}} play bass. Equipped with a one-string flamenco guitar given to him by his grandmother, he began taking classes with Robert Wolin, a teacher at Fairfax Music School. During his first lesson, Slash decided to switch from bass to guitar after hearing Wolin play [...] "Brown Sugar" [...] by The Rolling Stones. His decision to play guitar was further influenced by one of his school teachers, who would play songs by Cream and Led Zeppelin for his students. As a result, Slash stated, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> do that, I said, 'That's what I want to do." [...] A champion BMX rider, Slash put the bike aside to devote himself to playing guitar, practicing up to 12 hours a day.|$|E

2500|$|Over time, Qasimov's style had {{developed}} to {{include not only}} traditional Azerbaijani music and mugham, but also ashiq, a rural bardic tradition with roots in Turkey, Azerbaijan and the Azeri region of Iran. In addition, he was influenced by artists from other disciplines, placing particular importance on Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> in concert many doors were opened for me and many questions answered". His success {{was all the more}} impressive for he had broken from the traditional style of mugham and brought his own interpretation to the genre. He saw this as a way of showing mugham to a wider audience and making it relevant to contemporary society, saying: [...] "The {{world in which we live}} changes daily. Music has to lend emotional expression to this vitality. I accommodate that by seeking out new paths and interpretations". Similarly he revolutionised the strict mugham instrumentation, introducing his own improvisation and including new sounds such as the double-reeded balaban (also known as a duduk), the clarinet and the nagara, a metal-bodied drum. Additionally, he remained conscious of the need to modernise when choosing his ensemble; mixing older, experienced players with younger, more dynamic musicians.|$|E
2500|$|.....the Chancellor of the Exchequer shall boldly uphold {{economy in}} detail; {{and it is}} the mark ... of ... a chicken-hearted Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he shrinks from {{upholding}} economy in detail, when, because {{it is a question of}} only £2,000 or £3,000, he says that is no matter. He is ridiculed, no doubt, for what is called saving candle-ends and cheese-parings. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who is not ready to save what are meant by candle-ends and cheese-parings in the cause of his country. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who makes his own popularity either his first consideration, or any consideration at all, in administrating the public purse. You would not like to have a housekeeper or steward who made her or his popularity with the tradesmen the measure of the payments that were to be delivered to them. In my opinion the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the trusted and confidential steward of the public. He is under a sacred obligation with regard to all that he consents to spend.... I am bound to say hardly ever in the six years that Sir Stafford Northcote has been in office have <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak a resolute word on behalf of economy.|$|E
