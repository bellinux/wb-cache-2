5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, <b>eider</b> <b>duck</b> and numerous gulls.|$|E
25|$|Birds (tengmiaq sg tengmiak dual tengmiat pl or yaqulek sg yaqulgek dual yaqulget pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tengmiar sg tengmiag dual tengmiat pl in Cup'ig) {{are used}} mostly for garment as parka (<b>eider,</b> <b>duck,</b> murre, guillemot, auklet, puffin, kittiwake, cormorant, owl) or cap (puffin, eider, murre) and tool as needle (crane). Not only did people prize bird skins for parka material, but they used their {{feathers}} and bones for many {{things such as}} fire-bath hats, dance fans, dust brooms, needle cases, even peashooters.|$|E
25|$|Steambath cap or feather sweatbath cap, firebath hat (maqissuun in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, maqissun in Cup'ig) is a {{headgear}} worn in steambath (maqivik) {{or other}} gear used in sweatbath. While taking a sweat bath, men protected their heads with a crude cap of puffin, <b>eider</b> <b>duck,</b> or murre skins. The {{top of the}} cap was made from one whole skin split {{down the middle of}} the breast. The wings, with bones removed, were left on and stuck out at the sides. Half skins were sewn around each side.|$|E

2500|$|The island plays host to {{more than}} 150,000 gannets and is the world's largest colony of Northern gannets. Described famously by naturalists as [...] "one of the {{wildlife}} wonders of the world" [...] (often credited to Sir David Attenborough). [...] It was also awarded BBC Countryfile Magazine's Nature Reserve of the Year, following a nomination by Chris Packham, in 2014/15. When viewed from the mainland, large regions of the surface appear white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152,000kg of ammonia per year, equivalent to the achievements of 10 million broilers). In fact the scientific name for the Northern gannet, Sula bassana or Morus bassanus, [...] derives its name from the rock. It was known traditionally in Scots as a [...] "solan goose". In common with other gannetries, such as St Kilda, the birds were harvested for their eggs and the flesh of their young chicks, which were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2,000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species that frequent the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, <b>eider</b> <b>duck</b> and numerous gulls.|$|E
