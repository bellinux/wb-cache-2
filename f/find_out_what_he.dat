25|$|Sugihara {{died the}} {{following}} year {{at a hospital in}} Kamakura, on 31 July 1986. In spite of the publicity given him in Israel and other nations, he remained virtually unknown in his home country. Only when a large Jewish delegation from around the world, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, showed up at his funeral, did his neighbors <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done. He may have lost his diplomatic career but he received much posthumous acclaim.|$|E
25|$|Before the assassination, the British {{intelligence}} services identified Talaat in Stockholm {{where he had}} gone for a few days. The British intelligence first planned to apprehend him in Berlin where {{he was planning to}} return, but then changed its mind because it feared the complications this would create in Germany. Another view in British intelligence was that Talaat should be apprehended by the Royal Navy at sea while returning from Scandinavia by ship. In the end, it was decided to let him return to Berlin, <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was trying to accomplish with his activities abroad, and to establish direct contact with him before giving the final verdict. This was achieved with the help of Aubrey Herbert.|$|E
25|$|Fabrizio ruled for {{the state}} that News 12 had {{to turn over the}} complete, {{unedited}} interview. While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime off camera, the judge said that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore. Even the defense agreed the issue of the Section 8 applications was a central and relevant one in the case. The judge did not find that Bonie had been promised confidentiality by News 12, and there was no possible other way {{for the state}} to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might have said that was not broadcast. The judge's one concession to News 12 was that he would review the recorded interview in camera and release to the prosecution only those sections that discussed Bonie and Moore's landlord-tenant relationship and/or the Section 8 issue.|$|E

500|$|The plot of Silver Star Story Complete remains true to the {{original}} Sega CD version written by Kei Shigema. [...] Novelist Keisuke Shigematsu was recruited as the remake's scenario writer, and was tasked with expanding the previous script written by Shigema to make the game more current.

At the insistence of his fortune-hunting friend Ramus, Alex travels to the nearby Dragon's Cave with his cat-like companion Nall, and sweetheart Luna, to seek a precious gem. When the team reaches the cave's interior, they find Quark, an aged, wise dragon who sees hidden potential in Alex, and beckons him to travel the world and become its protector as the new Dragonmaster. Returning home, the group expresses mutual interest in Alex's quest; Ramus wishes to sell the dragon gem at a large city, Nall wants to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is, and Luna merely to protect Alex. The group sets off across the frontier to the port town of Saith to continue their journey.|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{like her}} {{character}} was wasting her college degree O'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha {{go to work}} for Lex during the second season. The producers agreed, but altered the concept so that Martha went to work for Lionel, and that she would use this new position to spy on Lionel and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knows about Clark. Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season, O'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in [...] "Ryan" [...] was that Martha was going to run for Mayor. In O'Toole's opinion, Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence. To the chagrin of O'Toole, Martha's next storyline—the expectation of a new child—tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with. O'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake—something mentally created by Clark's ship—but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant. Ultimately, that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage. Before season four began, O'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha {{go to work for}} Lex. O'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel, because it gave her character something more to do, and she wanted to do that again for season four. The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon, which was owned by Lex, and which O'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark's life.|$|E
