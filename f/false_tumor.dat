40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} the automated computation of hepatic tumor burden from abdominal computed tomography (CT) images of diseased populations with images with inconsistent enhancement. The automated segmentation of livers is addressed first. A novel 3 -D affine invariant shape parameterization is employed to compare local shape across organs. By generating a regular {{sampling of the}} organ’s surface, this parameterization can be effectively used to compare features {{of a set of}} closed 3 -D surfaces point-to-point, while avoiding common problems with the parameterization of concave surfaces. From an initial segmentation of the livers, the areas of atypical local shape are determined using training sets. A geodesic active contour corrects locally the segmentations of the livers in abnormal images. Graph cuts segment the hepatic tumors using shape and enhancement constraints. Liver segmentation errors are reduced significantly and all tumors are detected. Finally, support vector machines and feature selection are employed {{to reduce the number of}} <b>false</b> <b>tumor</b> detections. The tumor detection true position fraction of 100 % is achieved at 2. 3 false positives/case and the tumor burden is estimated with 0. 9 % error. Results from the test data demonstrate the method’s robustness to analyze livers from difficult clinical cases to allow the temporal monitoring of patients with hepatic cancer.

40|$|Parainfectous limbic {{encephalitis}} (PILE) {{associated with}} viruses of the Herpesviridae family {{is one of}} the forms of chronic herpes encephalitis characterized by limbic system dysfunction and a prolonged course with frequent exacerbations. There are two types of the course of the disease: latent autoimmune limbic encephalitis (LE) progressing to mesial temporal sclerosis and pseudotumorous granulomatous LE. The latter (inflammatory pseudotumor or granuloma) is characterized by the formation of a polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate with the elements of fibrosis, necrosis, and a granulomatous reaction and by myofibroblast cells. This is a slowly growing benign pseudotumor that contains much more plasma cells than inflammatory ones.  The diagnosis of pseudotumorous LE is difficult and requires the participation of a neurologist, an immunologist, an oncologist, and a neurosurgeon.  Perfusion computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy give proof to the adequacy of the term inflammatory pseudotumor because it is histologically difficult to characterize the lesion as a tumor or inflammation. When a chronic lesion in the central nervous system is lately diagnosed, the prognosis of the disease may be poor and complicated by the development of resistant symptomatic focal epilepsy and emotional, volitional, and cognitive impairments. It was differentially diagnosed from brain tumors (astrocytic, oligodendroglial, and mixed gliomas, ependymal, neuronal, neuroglial, and embryonal tumors, meningiomas, cholesteatomas, dermoid cysts, teratomas, and cysts), other reactive and inflammatory processes (leukemic infiltrations, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, encephalomyelitis), hypoparathyroidism, Addison's disease, vitamin A intoxication, and the long-term use of glucocorticoids and contraceptives. The authors describe a clinical case of the pseudotumorous course of chronic PILE in a 28 -year-old woman. They discuss difficulties in differential diagnosis and the specific features of the clinical course and treatment of the disease. Inflammatory pseudotumor is an indication for surgery, but realizing the fact that this <b>false</b> <b>tumor</b> may avoid an unnecessary radical operation in some cases, which demonstrates the given clinical observation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Gelatin sponge, {{oxidized}} cellulose and microfibrillar collagen {{are used}} to achieve hemostasis during neurosurgical procedures. Hemostatic agents may produce clinically symptomatic, radiologically apparent mass lesions. The differential diagnosis should include the foreign body along with recurrent tumor. We present a case of intracranial hemostatic agents found in a 56 -year-old male patient seven years after undergoing a craniotomy for a left posterior parietal convexity meningioma. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested {{the presence of a}} recurrent tumor.

40|$|BackgroundDifferential gene {{expression}} offers an attractive {{means by which}} to study genes that {{may be involved in}} disease development and/or progression. We performed quantitative {{gene expression}} in various stages of esophageal adenocarcinoma, treated exclusively by surgery with complete 2 -field lymphadenectomy, in an attempt to discern genes involved in disease progression as well as genes that may predict survival. MethodsGene expression profiling was accomplished by cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation (DASL) assay. RNA was extracted from 89 archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues. DASL assay was performed with the Sentrix Universal Array (Illumina Corp, San Diego, Calif) of 502 known cancer-related genes. Bioinformatics tools were used to determine significant differential gene expression in T 1 - 2 versus T 3 - 4 tumors and tumors without lymph node involvement (N 0) versus tumors with lymph node involvement (N+). Gene expression was also correlated with overall survival. ResultsTwenty-one genes were overexpressed in T 1 - 2 compared with T 3 - 4 <b>tumors</b> (<b>false</b> discovery rate of 0). Underexpression of 1 gene was seen in N+ compared with N 0 <b>tumors</b> (<b>false</b> discovery rate of 0). For overall survival, underexpression of 9 genes correlated with long survival. ConclusionsUsing differential gene expression of 502 known cancer genes, we identified genes that may be involved at various stages in the progression of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We also identified genes that may correlate with prolonged survival and, thus, may serve as prognostic markers. These findings may provide further insight into the mechanisms of development and/or progression of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Prospective studies are needed to verify the prognostic value of these genes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{diagnosis}} of lung tumors, CT scan of lungs {{is one of}} the most common imaging modalities. Manually identifying tumors from hundreds of CT image slices for any patient may prove to be a tedious and time consuming task for the radiologists. Therefore, to assist the physicians we propose an automatic lung tumor detection method based on textural features. The lung parenchyma region is segmented as a pre-processing because the tumors reside within the region. This reduces the search space over which we look for the tumors, thereby increasing com-putational speed. This also reduces the chance of <b>false</b> identification of <b>tumors.</b> For tumor classification, we used GLCM based textural features. A sliding window is used to search over the lung parenchyma region and extract the features. Chi-Square distance measure is used to classify the tumor. The performance of GLCM features for tumor classification is evaluated with the histogram features. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{elucidate}} whether Raman spectroscopy {{aided by}} extensive spectral database and neural network analysis {{can be a}} fast and confident biomarking tool for the diagnosis of various types of cancer. Methods Study included 27 patients with 11 different malignant tumors. Using Raman microscopy (RM) a total of 540 Raman spectra were recorded from histology specimens of both tumors and surrounding healthy tissues. Spectra were analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA) and results, along with histopathology data, were used to train the neural network (NN) learning algorithm. Independent sets of spectra were {{used to test the}} accuracy of PCA/NN tissue classification. Results The confident tumor identification for the purpose of medical diagnosis has to be performed by taking into account the whole spectral shape, and not only particular spectral bands. The use of PCA/NN analysis showed overall sensitivity of 96 % with 4 % <b>false</b> negative <b>tumor</b> classification. The specificity of distinguishing tumor types was 80 %. These results are comparable to previously published data where tumors of only one tissue type were examined and can be regarded satisfactorily for a relatively small database of Raman spectra used here. Conclusion In vitro RM combined with PCA/NN is an almost fully automated method for histopathology at the level of macromolecules. Supported by an extensive tumor spectra database, it could become a customary histological analysis tool for fast and reliable diagnosis of different types of cancer in clinical setting...|$|R
3000|$|... 99 mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT is a {{promising}} new means of characterizing indeterminate renal masses that are first identified with conventional cross-sectional imaging. This immunohistochemical evaluation of 50 surgically resected tumors {{found that the}} presumptive mechanism shown in Fig. 1 accounts for the 99 mTc-sestamibi uptake patterns seen {{in the vast majority}} of the imaged tumors. Given the apparent utility of this imaging modality (with a published sensitivity of 87.5 % and specificity of 95.2 % [11]), a unified mechanism that explains the clinically observed results is reassuring that the fundamental biology of the tumors is dictating the degree of 99 mTc-sestamibi uptake. As such, a thorough understanding of this mechanism of radiotracer localization is desirable for a number of reasons including potential prediction of the uptake characteristics of rare subtypes of RCC that have not previously been encountered in our published cohorts (e.g., medullary and collecting duct RCC) as well as for understanding the biology of falsely positive and <b>false</b> negative <b>tumors.</b> For example, we would predict that any subtype of RCC that demonstrates high levels of MDR expression and has relatively low mitochondrial content will demonstrate photopenia when imaged with 99 mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT, similar to our observations with clear cell and papillary RCC. As our knowledge in this field becomes more nuanced in regards to the patterns of uptake in different renal mass histologies, the role of other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as MRP 1 may also need to be investigated to provide a complete molecular-level understanding.|$|R
40|$|Size {{of breast}} cancer is {{essential}} in staging cancer to determine type and extent of patient management. This {{study was conducted to}} assess accuracy in estimating tumor size by MRI and gross using microscopy as gold standard. A retrospective study was done on 33 patients, 30 - 75 years, who underwent MRI of breasts with subsequent lumpectomy, 2002 - 2006, for invasive breast cancer. Size of lesion(s) on MRI and gross were compared with histological size. Of 37 lesions, 27 (73 %) were invasive ductal (IDC) and 10 (27 %) invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Tumor size by MRI matched histological size in 3 %, underestimated 27 %, and overestimated 70 % of cases. Tumor size by gross matched histological size in 22 %, underestimated 57 %, and overestimated 22 % of cases. MRI as an imaging modality and gross pathology both have significant limitations in measuring tumor size particularly in cases of invasive breast carcinoma. Random sectioning of lumpectomy specimen in invasive breast carcinoma may result in inaccurate staging of tumor by leading to <b>false</b> impression of <b>tumor</b> size and multi-focality and/or multi-centricity of tumor particularly in cases of ILC. Microscopic measurements of tumor size are necessary for accurate T-staging and recommended for appropriate patient management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{technique is}} a well known procedure in the diagnosis of various organ diseases. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the utility of FNA in the diagnosis of neck masses. Fine needle aspiration was performed upon 123 patients with palpable nonthyroidal lesions at neck during a five-year period. In ten cases, FNA findings were nondiagnostic. From the reminder 113 patients, histopathologic results of 55 patients were available. Histopathologic evaluation revealed that 71 % of cases had benign Lesions, and 29 % had malignant <b>tumors.</b> <b>False</b> negative and False positive rates were 1. 8 % and 5. 4 % respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of FNA in determining malignant lesions were 81. 2 % and 97. 4 % respectively. Predictive positive and negative values were 92. 8 % and 92. 7 % respectively. Sensitivity of FNA in determining malignancy in lymph nodes was 72 % (12. 5 % false negative). Based on our study findings, and those of other studies, we recommend performing fine needle aspiration in those patients who present with neck masses. It is worthwhile to mention that except those cases with negative results of lymph node origin, most FNA findings are reliable and in such cases, open surgical biopsy is unnecessary...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Thorough {{quality control}} (QC) study with {{systemic}} {{monitoring and evaluation}} is crucial to optimizing the effectiveness of EUS-FNA. Methods. Retrospective analysis was composed of investigating consecutive patient files that underwent EUS-FNA. QC specifically focused on diagnostic accuracy, impacts on preexisting diagnoses, and case management. Results. 268 patient files were evaluated. EUS-FNA cytology helped establish accurate diagnoses in 92. 54 % (248 / 268) of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 83 %, 100 %, 100 %, 91. 6 %, and 94 %, respectively. The most common biopsy site was the pancreas (68 %). The most accurate location for EUS-FNA was the esophagus, 13 / 13 (100 %), followed by the pancreas (89. 6 %). EUS-FNA was least informative for abdominal lymph nodes (70. 5 %). After FNA and followup, eight <b>false</b> negatives for <b>tumors</b> were found (3 %), while 7. 5 % of samples still lacked a definitive diagnosis. Discussion. QC suggests that the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA might be improved further by (1) taking more FNA passes from suspected lesions, (2) optimizing needle selection (3) having an experienced echo-endoscopist available during the learning curve, and (4) having a cytologist present during the procedure. QC also identified remediable reporting errors. In conclusion, QC study is valuable in identifying weaknesses and thereby augmenting the effectiveness of EUS-FNA...|$|R

(1) Evaluate audiometric protocols and recom-mend protocols with best {{sensitivity and specificity}} for mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) screening of acoustic tumors; (2) determine clinical risks (false negative) of missing acous-tic tumors and potential wastes in screening (<b>false</b> positive) nonacoustic <b>tumors</b> or radiologically “normal ” cases; and (3) identify the decibel difference and range of frequencies com-pared by the best-performing protocols. Study Design. Cross-sectional study with chart review. Setting. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT); audiology; and radiology departments in a tertiary-care hospital. Subjects and Methods. Three-year cohort (2006 - 2009) of 1751 ENT patients underwent MRI screening and pure-tone au-diometry indicating sensorineural hearing loss. Audiometric protocols were ranked by highest sensitivity to acoustic tumors, specificity A to nonacoustic tumors, and specificity B to “radio-logically normal ” cases. Results. No audiometric protocols achieved 100 % sensitivity or specificity rates. Only 2 protocols achieved ≥ 90 % sensitiv-ity: the AMCLASS-A-Urben protocol (93. 16 %) and the Mang-ham protocol (91. 58 %). Eleven of 15 protocols for specificity A and 12 of 15 protocols for specificity B achieved ≥ 50 %. Clinical risks ranged from 6. 84 % to 18. 95 %, whereas poten-tial wastes ranged from 33. 56 % to 68. 37 % for specificity A and 31. 76 % to 66. 86 % for specificity B. Interaural difference parameters indicating highest mean sensitivity were {{on the order of}} ≥ 10 dB, ≥ 15 dB, and ≥ 20 dB. For frequency compari-son parameters, “ 2 or more adjacent frequency ” and “single-frequency ” comparison indicated higher mean sensitivity than the “averaged multifrequency ” comparison. Mean specificity showed an opposite pattern. Conclusions. For optimum sensitivity, the Mangham protocol is preferred (sensitivity, 91. 58 %; specificity A, 44. 23 %; specific-ity B, 44. 91 %), which proposes a ≥ 10 -dB interaural difference, averaging 1 to 8 kHz.

40|$|AbstractMethods: Three hundred forty-two {{patients}} with lung cancer and 99 {{patients with}} nonneoplastic lung diseases (control group) underwent intraoperative pleural lavage with 300 ml physiologic saline solution before (lavage I) and after resection (lavage II). Results: Studies of the lavage fluid in all control patients were negative, that is, {{there were no}} <b>false</b> positive findings. <b>Tumor</b> cells were found in lavage I in 132 patients (38. 6 %) and also in lavage II in 99 of them. In stage I (pT 1 N 0, pT 2 N 0) lung cancer, tumor cell detection was possible in 47 patients (28. 6 %). The 4 -year survival of patients with resected non-small-cell lung cancer was 24 % (95 % confidence interval, 16 % to 32 %) if lavage I results were positive and 52 % (95 % confidence interval, 45 % to 59 %) if lavage I results were negative (all stages, p = 0. 007). For patients with stage I disease (n = 164) the 4 -year survival was 35 % (95 % confidence interval, 18 % to 52 %) if lavage I results were positive (n = 47), and 69 % (95 % confidence interval, 60 % to 78 %) if lavage I results were negative (n = 117) (p = 0. 037). On multivariate analysis the positive cytologic result in intraoperative pleural lavage was an additional prognostic factor for our patients. To prove how the tumor cells enter the pleural cavity, we performed tissue cultures of tumor-free parenchyma in 23 cases of lung cancer. Tumor cell detection by histology and immunohistology was possible in 16 cases (69. 6 %). Detection of tumor cells in pleural lavage fluid before resection proves that tumor cells have spread into the pleural cavity. Conclusion: The positive result in pleural lavage {{seems to be a}} prognostic predictor for patients with lung cancer. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 113 : 683 - 90...|$|R

The sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET in differentiating between lung cancer and benign disease are {{higher than those of}} CT, but previous studies have shown instances of <b>false</b> negative malignant <b>tumor</b> and <b>false</b> positive benign results. We report two cases of peripheral small pulmonary nodules in which preoperative FDG-PET was performed to identify the pathological characteristics of the lesions. Case 1 was a 58 -year-old man with an abnormal shadow 20 mm in size at left S^ 9. Chest CT demonstrated an irregularly shaped fibrous shadow with a small nodule around the bulla. We suspected inflammation based upon the CT. FDG-PET showed an accumulation with an SUV of 2. 6 corresponding to the lesion, indicating a possible malignancy. We initially performed a left upper wedge resection. Intraoperative diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma. We performed a left lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Case 2 was a 31 -year-old man with a small nodular shadow 15 mm in diameter with accompanying spicula and ground-glass opacity at the left S^. CT examination led us to suspect small adenocarcinoma. FDG-PET showed an accumulation with an SUV of 2. 3 corresponding to the lesion. We performed a left upper wedge resection. Pathological diagnosis was pulmonary tuberculoma. For case 1, FDG-PET provided useful information for the preoperative diagnosis of lung cancer.

40|$|Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is {{characterized}} by renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and aberrant vitamin D 3 metabolism and is caused by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF- 23) –producing mesenchymal tumors, which are often difficult to locate. We investigated the utility of selective venous sampling in tumor localization. The primary endpoint was identification of the FGF- 23 concentration ratio between the venous drainage of the tumor bed and the general circulation that was diagnostic of the location of an FGF- 23 -secreting tumor. Fourteen subjects underwent 15 sampling procedures after functional and anatomic imaging studies. Subjects fit into three imaging categories: no suspicious site, multiple sites, and single site (positive controls). FGF- 23 levels were measured by ELISA. Suspicious tumors were resected for diagnosis, confirmation, and cure. In subjects with a positive venous sampling study and subsequent cure, a minimum ratio of 1. 6 was diagnostic. In 7 of 14 subjects there was suggestive imaging, a diagnostic ratio, and an associated TIO tumor (true positive). Four of these required complicated resection procedures. In 4 of 14 subjects with no suspicious site on imaging studies, an FGF- 23 diagnostic ratio was not detected (true negative). Biopsy or resection of a single lesion in 2 of 14 subjects with a diagnostic ratio failed to identify a TIO <b>tumor</b> (<b>false</b> positive). A diagnostic FGF- 23 ratio was absent in 1 of 14 subjects whose tumor was a single highly suspicious lesion on imaging studies (false negative). These data yield a sensitivity of 0. 87 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 47 – 0. 99] and a specificity of 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 29 – 0. 96).
