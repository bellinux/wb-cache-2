5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I knew that I was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> you down… Usually the athletes who win {{are the ones who}} can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E

You don’t want children, so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy. As can happen, however, and on very, very rare {{occasions}} does happen, one of the screens is defective; and a seed drifts in and takes root.|$|E

Amphibious helicopters are used {{for a variety of}} specialized purposes including air-sea rescue, marine salvage and oceanography, in addition to other tasks that can be accomplished with any non-amphibious helicopter. An amphibious helicopter can be designed with a waterproof or water-resistant hull like a flying boat or it can be fitted with utility floats {{in the same manner as}} a floatplane.|$|E

Rachel is {{caught in the middle of}} the madness as she tries to sort things out, but is afraid that the clinic may be sued, or shut down, by the couple. The clinic's psychologist, Lydia (Alfre Woodard), finds that her job may be in jeopardy because she might not have done the proper background check on the {{surrogate mother}}.

However, the birth father is finally contacted and takes the baby home.|$|E
25|$|Maersk Air UK lost an {{accumulative}} DKK325 {{million from}} 2000 through 2002. By early 2003 the Maersk Group {{had given up}} on operating an airline in the UK and put Maersk Air UK up for sale. However, there were no interested buyers and it was speculated that British Airways would have to step <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> over the franchise. The company was therefore sold in a management buyout in 2003, with the airline becoming Duo Airways. At the time the airline had eight aircraft and 350 employees. Up till this point Maersk Air had lost DKK250 million on its UK operations. The new company folded in 2004, and Maersk Air was forced to bring home five CRJs from Birmingham. Maersk lost a further DKK65 million with the sale of these aircraft.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Holtz Jr. would {{note that}} high depth {{perception}} of Tyrannosaurus {{may have been}} due to the prey it had to hunt; noting that it had to hunt horned dinosaurs such as Triceratops, armored dinosaurs such as Ankylosaurus and the duck-billed dinosaurs may have had complex social behaviors. He would suggest that this made precision more crucial for Tyrannosaurus enabling it to, [...] "get in, get that blow <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> it down." [...] In contrast, Acrocanthosaurus had limited depth perception because they hunted large sauropods, which were relatively rare during the time of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Bono recounted another {{experience}} {{he had in}} El Salvador, where {{he had seen a}} body thrown from a van into the road. He remarked, [...] "People would just disappear. If you were part of the opposition, you might find an SUV with the windows blacked out parked outside your house.... If that didn't stop you, occasionally they would come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> you and murder you; there would be no trial." [...] Bono understood the cause of the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to it. His experiences in Central America inspired the lyrics of [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] and another track from The Joshua Tree, [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky".|$|E
500|$|In April 1965, McCain led the United States {{invasion}} of the Dominican Republic as commander of Task Force 124, which maintained a military occupation until civil unrest had ended.

People may not love you for being strong {{when you have to}} be, but they respect you for it and learn to behave themselves when you are." [...] He also worked closely with U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States Ellsworth Bunker, who was handling negotiations between local factions. [...] For this operation, McCain was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

Columnist Walter Lippmann called the wave of support for Nixon [...] "disturbing... with all the magnification of modern electronics, simply mob law"; discussing the speech with a dinner guest, he said, [...] "That must be the most demeaning experience my country has ever had to bear." [...] Columnist Thomas Stokes criticized Eisenhower for equivocating {{on the question of}} his running mate until [...] "the young man himself—the accused—had to step <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> over.

500|$|Call of Duty 2 {{was going}} to be more {{immersive}} than the original Call of Duty. Vince Zampella, creative director of Infinity Ward, said, [...] "We didn't want to take any of the parts out that made Call of Duty so good. But {{there were a couple of}} things that we admit could have been done better". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to see what is happening and add to the combat while enemies directly in front of the player will join <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> cover quickly.|$|E
500|$|When Taylor met Hương afterwards, {{he urged}} the prime {{minister}} to reject {{the dissolution of the}} HNC.

Taylor nevertheless asked Hương to publicly condemn the coup and call on the army to release those arrested. Hương also said {{he would be willing to}} reorganize his administration to meet the wishes of the military, and that retaining their support was essential in keeping a civilian government functional. Taylor said the US did not agree with military rule as a principle, and might reduce aid, but Hương was unmoved and said the Vietnamese people [...] "take a more sentimental than legalistic approach" [...] and that the existence of civilian procedure and the HNC was much less pressing than the [...] "moral prestige of the leaders". American military advisers and intelligence officers who liaised with senior junta members found they were unconcerned with any possible legal ramifications of their actions.|$|E

500|$|Following his audition, Jack (Sean Hayes) {{receives}} a call back and is informed {{that he has}} become a finalist for the Manhattan Gay Men's Chorus. At the final auditions for the chorus, Jack is informed by the choral director that he will have a solo, but before he can sing it, Owen (Matt Damon)originally intended for the solo partbarges in and sings his part. Jack sees Owen as competition and thinks of a {{way to get rid of}} him. He learns that Owen is posing as a gay man, after observing him gaze at a woman. Jack strikes a plan to get Owen to confess he is straight, in which he invites him to [...] "rehearse" [...] in Will and Grace's apartment. Jack's plan fails miserably, so he enlists the help of Grace (Debra Messing) to [...] "in" [...] Owen for him. Grace begins flirting with Owen, which ultimately leads to the two making out, prompting Jack to barge <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a picture. Owen, however, tricks him into pulling the film out of the camera, destroying the proof. At the chorus rehearsal, Jack and Owen begin bickering, which results in Jack revealing to everyone that Owen is straight, to which Owen admits. Despite the revelation, the chorus director (Patrick Kerr) tells Owen he has made it into the chorus.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cuts, McCall made a number of changes to his squad during the summer of 2009. His team started the 2009–10 season by going four games without scoring, until they {{recorded}} a 5–4 victory against Cheltenham Town. After the game, McCall said: [...] "That was the youngest, and certainly cheapest, team Bradford have put out {{for a long time and}} I’m really proud of them." [...] City continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy where they lost to Carlisle United, managed by McCall's friend Greg Abbott, but at the start of 2010 found themselves 16th in League Two and eight points off the play-offs after a run of five defeats in seven games. McCall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games, saying: [...] "The bottom line is that the players and me personally will get judged on results. And the results aren't good enough." [...] Despite the club's slide down the table, he denied he would resign, but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing Gareth Evans to give City a late 2–1 away at Torquay United saved McCall from being sacked. However, defeat to Bury in the club's following fixture was McCall's last game as manager, with McCall saying after the game: [...] "It's time for somebody else to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> up the reins and hopefully do well." [...] He won a little more than one-third of his 133games in charge of City. McCall left by mutual consent.|$|E
500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E
