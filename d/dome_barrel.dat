Conventional cyrotank manufacturing processes require fabrication of multiple pieces welded together to form a complete tank. A variety of near net shape manufacturing processes has demonstrated excellent potential for enabling single-piece construction of components such as <b>domes,</b> <b>barrels,</b> and ring frames. Utilization of such processes can dramatically reduce the extent of welding and joining needed to construct cryogenic tanks and other aerospace structures. The specific focus of this project is to successfully mature the integrally stiffened cylinder (ISC) process in which a single-piece cylinder with integral stiffeners is formed in one spin/flow forming process. Structural launch vehicle components, like cryogenic fuel tanks (e. g., space shuttle external tank), are currently fabricated via multipiece assembly of parts produced through subtractive manufacturing techniques. Stiffened structural panels are heavily machined from thick plate, which results in excessive scrap rates. Multipiece construction requires welds to assemble the structure, which increases the risk for defects and catastrophic failures...|$|R

Thin shell construction, an important and intriguing concept in contemporary architecture, has been used in many structures around the world. Famous architects such as Nervi, Toroja, Candela, Saarinen and Yamasaki have molded concrete into long spans of thin shell roofs. <b>Domes,</b> <b>barrel</b> vaults, conoids and free forms along with the newest form of shell roof construction, the hyperbolic paraboloid, constitute architectural concepts which have rapidly gained acceptance among architects and building owners. Thin shell construction began first in Italy and Spain, later spreading to the western hemisphere, notably Mexico. In the United States widespread application of thin shell roof construction has been hampered by the high cost of labor and materials required for the elaborate formwork. Building codes are also in need of revision to include provisions for thin shell construction. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the possible potential use of portland cement mortar modified with latex and fiber glass as a covering material for thin shell structures. Tests were conducted on various formulations to determine certain physical properties of the modified portland cement. Application techniques were investigated to determine the feasibility of using a pump or spray system to further reduce costs...|$|R

The second one results from a regular pattern of quadrangles unbraced by diagonal elements. A method is proposed to cover kagome gridshells with planar facets, which reduces considerably the cost of fabrication of the cladding. The sensitivity of kagome gridshells to geometrical imperfections is discussed. The linearised buckling load of kagome gridshells is then compared to the one of quadrilateral gridshells. The most relevant design variables are considered in the parametric study. Two building typologies are studied for symmetrical and non-symmetrical load cases: <b>dome</b> and <b>barrel</b> vault.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{behavior}} and pathologies of the masonry tile structures built by the R. Guastavino Company {{in order to provide}} recommendations on their analysis and assessment. Structural analyses of two specific geometries - <b>domes</b> and <b>barrel</b> vaults - are carried out with equilibrium and elastic methods to determine how well each assesses the safety of Guastavino shells. Results show that stresses are relatively low in these structures, so they are unlikely to fail due to inadequate material capacity. The safety, then, is dependent on the stability of the structure rather than its material strength. Analysis of a Guastavino structure should demonstrate its stability, and graphical equilibrium analysis is well-suited to this task. Case studies of three Guastavino projects - the Grace Universalist Church, the Saint Louis Art Museum, and the Army War College - provide examples of pathologies specific to masonry tile structures and demonstrate how they were successfully or unsuccessfully analyzed and rehabilitated in the past. Guastavino shells exhibit behavior similar to other masonry structures, but have an additional characteristic that sets them apart: soffit tiles can debond and fall as a result of cracking or water damage. Falling tiles pose a serious mortal danger but do not necessarily threaten a structure's safety. Nonetheless, they elicit dramatic structural repairs and retrofits. The case studies present an opportunity to critically evaluate structural interventions with an understanding of masonry tile vault behavior. By bringing both sensitive and unsuccessful rehabilitations to light, hopefully Guastavino shells will be protected from unnecessary retrofits in the future. by Megan L. Reese. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|Swahili {{architecture}} {{is a term}} used today to designate {{a whole range of}} diverse building traditions practiced or once practiced along the eastern and southeastern coasts of Africa. What is today seen as typically Swahili {{architecture is}} still very visible in the thriving urban centers of Mombasa, Lamu and Zanzibar. As archeological evidence has revealed, Swahili coast construction technologies are in many ways an extension of mainland African traditions, although structural elements, such as <b>domes</b> and <b>barrel</b> vaulting clearly connect to Persian Gulf area and South Asia building traditions as well. Exotic ornament and design elements also connected the architecture of the Swahili coast to other Islamic port cities. In fact, many of the classic mansions and palaces of the Swahili coast belonged to wealthy merchants and landowners, who {{played a key role in}} the mercantile economy of the Swahili coast. It was not the case, as British archeologists assumed during the colonial period (today some people still believe this outdated information, which is not corroborated by evidence), that Arab or Persian colonizers brought stone architecture and urban civilization to the Swahili coast. Local people--who of course also had overseas connections and relations--developed the Swahili coast built environment. Most importantly, even when a house was made to look like a house across the Indian Ocean it structured local experiences. Swahili architecture exhibits a range of influences and innovations and diverse forms and histories interlock and overlap to create densely layered structures that cannot be broken down into distinct stylistic parts. Many spectacular ruins of the so-called golden age of Swahili architecture may also still be observed near the southern Kenyan port of Malindi in the ruins of Gedi (the lost city of Gede/Gedi).|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} plenty of AutoCAD books {{available}} for architects, interior designers, and engineers, it has been difficult for the author to find an appropriate textbook for students who major in interior design while teaching AutoCAD, especially 3 -D AutoCAD at the sophomore level. Most existing 3 -D AutoCAD textbooks are more engineering oriented. Industrial machine components such as bolts and nuts are commonly used as tutorial examples. The author also found that existing 3 -D AutoCAD textbooks are lack of art and design subjects particularly subject matters of interior design and visual presentations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop course materials and to create tutorial examples that are relevant to interior design and architectural design with graphic images. Currently, limited generic procedures were found in the textbook to guide students to create 3 -D architectural components and interior space models with 3 -D AutoCAD. Therefore, creating appropriate tutorial examples is becoming more crucial in course materials. This article presents the tutorial examples and case studies with images in the newly developed course material, as well as how those 3 -D examples and case studies were created. The author received a faculty research grant during summer 2006 to explore innovative design methods by using 3 -D AutoCAD to achieve form transformation and space interlocking in design process. The goal of this research project is aimed specifically at the task of developing generic procedures for creating architectural components by using Boolean operations. This newly developed course material will be used in AutoCAD courses especially for 3 -D AutoCAD. It provides students with more systematic and comprehensive tutorials and case studies. The author integrated two case studies of reconstruction of the masterpiece architecture in this course material because it is a research topic that many researchers and scholars are exploring. It provides the three-dimensional visualizations for these scholars to explore the hidden treasures in the past and to get inspirations for today’s design. These two case studies also presented typical architectural components, such as, triangular pediments, <b>domes</b> and <b>barrel</b> vaults in the application of Boolean operations in 3 -D AutoCAD.

Particular attention was paid to the importance of religious heritage not usable in Naples, concrete example of great historical and architectural interest, conducted with laser scanner with integrated photogrammetric survey that has enabled us to provide extremely quickly and with high accuracy all the information and metrics qualitative for the subsequent operations of cataloging, preservation and use. It describes the case of example of the Church of s. Nicola dei Caserti in the road before that of Don Pietro, today San Nicola dei Caserti, which connects via dei Tribunali to the Vicaria Vecchia; This is a church closed to the public, a total State of disrepair and decay and completely stripped of all good and sacred furnishings. Currently the outside Church, the still shows clear signs of the bombing and subsequent recovery operations the unit wall, with a few original elements, within the original structure, a Greek cross with side chapels, the roofing system is featured in succession by a barrel vault with lunettes, an elliptical <b>dome</b> and a <b>barrel</b> vault to the aisle, a fairing on the main altar and apse interspersed with round arches, while the side chapels, are characterized by a barrel vault roof. The interior decoration with Corinthian columns and entablature, is very rich and almost completely preserved but with multiple injuries and aggression by pathogens and humidity, altars only the perimeter walls. The survey was performed with a laser scanner Faro Focus. This sensor has a measurement range of the nominal distance between 60 cm and 120 meters, with an accuracy in the measurement of the distance of the order of ± 2 mm to 25 meters and an angular resolution equal to 0. 009 °. It performs the measurement by analyzing the phase of the signal. The vertical field of view is equal to 305 °, the horizontal field of view is 360 ° and the acquisition speed of the points is equal to 976, 000 points/sec. While scanning the laser rotates around a vertical axis 360 ° while the mirror directs the beam vertically. The distance, the vertical angle and the horizontal angle generates a polar coordinate, which is then converted into a Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z). Equipped with an integrated digital camera with coaxial optical axis measuring radius of laser, which allows you to capture the information of each point colorimetric acquired. The instrument uses a removable memory for storage of the measured data, the scan parameters can be adjusted via a touch screen display integrated into the instrument, this allows you to work with the tool even without the aid of a computer, although you can through the supplied software, Faro Scene, create configuration files on PC to transfer to the SD and then load them from the scanner. Another interesting feature is the possibility of a connection with other wireless devices that makes the tool manageable distance. Compared to other types of scanner It is a particularly light and compact equipment, 5. 2 Kg to 240 x 200 x 100 mm which enables a fast employment in the field requiring for a photographic tripod rather than one topography; also has a compass, a height sensor and a Compensator that facilitates placement. It is equipped with batteries with a range of about 4. 5 hours and the laser beam is class 3. The experience led the Church of San Nicola dei Caserti has made it possible to highlight a number of benefits and potential of laser scanning survey such as the ability to obtain accurate, authentic and the global factory in extremely small, get a pad that allows readings resulting from different approaches, from the historic to the architect and archaeologist Restorer with its need for reading the artifact and to assess and analyze elements with character of originality than those of recent execution, stratifications that have largely characterized the factory, the analysis of the degradation and problems accurately and punctually.

40|$|The Columbus Community College is an {{educational}} institution that focuses its energy on providing life-long {{educational opportunities for}} all citizens of the community which it serves. The college consists of roughly 125, 000 gross square feet and consists of a theatre, library, bookstore, cafeteria, administration, three types of classrooms, two types of laboratories, faculty offices, and a physical plant. It has five main departments {{in the first phase}} which are secretarial administration, general business, agribusiness. industrial technology, and alternative energy. The first phase will serve approximately 2, 000 students and the second phase will increase the capacity by an additional 2, 000 students and 100, 000 square feet of classrooms and labs. The site is a near northeast site in the city of Columbus, Indiana. The most dominating issue of the site are the existing trees which are of a few basic varieties with their average total height of seventy-five feet. They cover the entire southern portion of the site, and the northern portion is relatively barren and open to the surrounding industrial context. The main access to the site is along the southern edge which is state road 46, or 25 th street as it runs through town. The project evolved through a rather intense period of alternate research and design concept thinking. It is a very unique project which {{is a result of the}} question which case out of the synthesis and compilation of all the research that was done. This question involves the search for a synergistic serendipity or perhaps the discovery of some way to have organized chaos. The plan is very irregular, though every exact angle designed with the "wind's eye" by a continuous placement in the space itself, mainly through model form and sheer imagination. The scheme is basically a series of smaller buildings which are maintained in a linear fashion along an Interior pedestrian street. This street "meanders" its way through the "building" and relies on the magnet approach used in many shopping malls to provide the everyday traffic generation along the street. Along this street there are four nodes which consist of two types and two orientations. The piazza at the "student center" serves as the major internal oriented node as it is nearest the least desirable Industrial context. The open plaza at the other end of the street serves as the major external oriented node as the buildings which frame it split apart to allow two of the existing trees to nestle between them. Between these' two major nodes are two minor nodes, one internal which occurs at the center of the street end bridges the two sides together, and one external oriented that serves as the main public "guest" entry. The facades of the building are based on a concept termed "dynamic syncopation" which essentially is an ever-increasing rythymic pattern of the ornament and often the window openings themselves. The "front" image is that of a loggia that is strung along the entire south facade of the classrooms. This facade borrows from the Creek image of frontal as public. The interior circulation facades separate the balcony walkways which link the entire classroom clusters from the street and their opening frequency and ornamentation increase as the plazas, or "student center" is approached. The buildings on the south side of the street are lowered below grade one level to allow the sun to penetrate the street space through an "arcade for the sun". The north exterior facade also deals with the increasing rythym of ornamentation and has window openings that are relatively small due to their northern orientation. The materials used consist of rectangular glass block,used in a running bond,on the south exterior facade and on the actual classroom facades. Limestone with brick masonry trim is used on the north exterior facades and the student center and the interior circulation facades are painted drywall on concrete block. Limestone panels are used extensively throughout the interior facades at the student center. The building's pedestrian street is roofed with two different materials. Over the classroom areas the roof is opaque as the light is provided by the sun arcade from the south. Over the most public spaces is glass, over the piazza is a glass <b>dome</b> and arch <b>barrel</b> vaults radiate from it down their respective streets. The basic structure is masonry unit bearing t. walls which support the balcony walkways as well as the roof trusses at the classrooms, and at the student center a column and slab construction is used. The systems which generate from the physical plant are distributed along the systems tunnel that runs beneath the interior street to all buildings in the college. The whole experience of the spaces, both interior and exterior, is meant to be a movement not only through space, but also through time, as the dynamic syncopation attempts to do. This atmosphere set forth by the informal character of the interior street is to be condusive to the interaction among the students, faculty. and staff, i. e. the community, to relax the formal social attitude normally created in such an institution.
