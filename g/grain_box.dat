40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the obtaining of {{value-added}} products from the dust resulted from chamois leather buffering, a solid waste that raises serious disposal problems, due to its physical state and complex chemical composition. Starting from leather waste, an alkaline hydrolysis was performed followed by the chemical modification of the polypeptyde hydrolysate by polycondensation with dispersions of copolymers of vinyl acetate with acrylic esters and reticulation with glutaraldehyde in order to improve its hydrophobicity. The resulted product can be used/was tested as an ingredient in leather finishing formulations, as binder or carrier agent. In this paper, new finishing mixtures were prepared using pigments and obtained polypeptide hydrolysates as a substitute for casein in pigment pastes. By this method, there were obtained two experimental variants of brown and black pigment pastes which were compared to the pigment pastes with casein binder. Natural <b>grain</b> <b>Box</b> bovine leather samples coated with such admixtures were subjected to physico-mechanical resistance tests, in accordance with the standardized methods. Specific tests carried on finished leather – tensile strength, tear resistance, resistance to grain cracking, dry and wet rubbing fastness, flexural fatigue strength test, etc – showed values of this characteristics comparable to those obtained with casein conventional finishing. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether feed trucks and feed could be sources of Salmonella contamination in swine operations. Materials: Five hundred forty-nine swab samples {{were taken from}} approximately 25 different places in the <b>grain</b> <b>box</b> on 22 different feed trucks and cultured for Salmonella spp. In addition, {{a sample of the}} feed components from 17 of those trucks was cultured for the presence of Salmonella. Results: Culture of both truck swab and feed samples indicate that Salmonella was present on five of the 22 (22. 7 %) trucks. A total of 549 swabs were cultured and the rate of isolation was 0. 7 % (four of 549 positive for Salmonella). Positive swabs were recovered from three trucks for a recovery rate of 13. 6 %. Feed was submitted for 17 of 22 trucks and Salmonella was recovered from four of 17 samples (23. 5 %). However, positive swabs and feed samples only matched for two trucks. No trucks had been used to transport livestock within the past 30 days nor were any trucks cleaned or disinfected between loads. Implications: While sample prevalence of Salmonella in feed trucks is low (0. 7 %), the overall contamination rate for feed trucks is much higher (22. 7 %). The presence of positive feed samples suggests that feed could be a source of Salmonella contamination for swine...|$|E

50|$|Imprinting {{reverses the}} {{desertification}} process by pressing V-shape imprints {{into the soil}} with steel angles on a heavy roller (Figures 3 and 4). Rainwater then funnels into the troughs of the imprints, where the water infiltrates into the indentation and air exhausts from the crests (Figure 5). Seedlings are protected from wind, and organic material is concentrated {{at the base of}} the troughs to provide nutrients to the seedling. Wind protection attenuates evaporation {{at the base of the}} seedling, maximizing water availability to the plant during the rainy season. The seedbed may remain dry for some time before water infiltrates and germination occurs. In the meantime, the stable imprint protects the seed from wind erosion and desiccation from exposure to the sun.Broadcast seeders can be attached to the frame assembly or <b>grain</b> <b>boxes</b> mounted in front of the imprinting roller, so that seed is dropped in front of the roller which presses the seed into the soil. The weight of the imprinter can be adjusted to be appropriate for various soils and planting conditions by filling the roller and ballast tanks with water.|$|R

50|$|Farms {{produced}} hay and potatoes. Industries {{included a}} <b>grain</b> mill, <b>box</b> factory and carding mill. But the island's economy was primarily {{directed at the}} sea. With tides of about 25 ft, Eastport's spacious harbor remained ice-free year round. The first sardine factory was built here about 1875. The population grew {{with the emergence of}} the sardine fishery and related canning businesses, which studded the shoreline {{by the end of the}} 19th century. By 1886, the town contained 13 sardine factories, which operated day and night during the season, and produced approximately 5,000 cases per week. About 800 men, women and children worked in the plants. But the industry would decline, and many people moved away. Indeed, the city went bankrupt in 1937. In 1976, the Groundhog Day Gale destroyed many structures along the waterfront. Today, catching fish remains the principal industry, although tourism has become important as well.|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} {{the results of an}} atomic resolution study of the structure and composition of both the interior of the grains, and the grain boundaries in polycrystalline MgB 2. We find that there is no oxygen within the bulk of the grains but significant oxygen enrichment at the grain boundaries. The majority of <b>grain</b> boundaries contain <b>BOx</b> phases smaller than the coherence length, while others contain larger areas of MgO sandwiched between BOx layers. Such results naturally explain the differences in connectivity between the grains observed by other techniques...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} full body restraint and rapid stimulus exposure (response prevention-flooding) on three Great Dane dogs, Canis familiaris, exhibiting high levels of aggression toward strangers or other dogs. We immobilized each dog in a restraint <b>box</b> by pouring <b>grain</b> in the <b>box</b> up {{to the level of}} the dog’s neck. Each dog was rapidly subjected to increasing intensity of the appropriate eliciting stimulus (adult, child, or dog) and responses were rated using a standardized numerical rating system. The dogs’ aggressive behavior diminished rapidly during restraint, and resulted in calm behavior during the highest stimulus intensity. Owners reported decreases in aggressive behavior for several months to years following the restraint sessions. Rapid stimulus exposure, when accompanied by complete response prevention, seems to result in large and long-lasting decrements in aggressive responses...|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Box trees growing on the hill is disputed: Several sources from the late 18th century suggest that the first Box Trees on the Hill were planted by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel {{during the reign of}} Charles I. [...] Older medieval {{documents}} however make reference to local individuals with surnames including Atteboxe, de la Boxe and Buxeto, suggesting that Box was already common in the local area by the 13th century, and it has also been observed that Thomas Howard never owned the Box Hill estate. The diarist John Evelyn records a visit to the hill in August 1655 to view [...] "those natural bowers, cabinets and shady walks in the box copses." [...] The close <b>grain</b> of the <b>Box</b> wood made it highly prized for its timber for carving and there are numerous accounts of the sale of trees from the hill throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|R
40|$|Minimum {{solid area}} (MSA) models are popular {{models for the}} {{calculation}} of the effective properties of porous materials and are frequently used to justify {{the use of a}} simple exponential relation for fitting purposes. In this contribution it is shown that MSA models, and the simple exponentials they support, are misleading and should be avoided. In particular, taking Young modulus and conductivity (thermal or electrical) as examples, it is shown that MSA models are based on the unjustified (and unjustifiable) hypothesis that the relative Young modulus and relative conductivity are identical, and moreover equal to the MSA fraction itself. This claim is generally false for isotropic materials, both random or periodic. Although indeed a very specific case exists in which this claim is true for the properties in one specific direction (viz., extremely anisotropic materials with translational invariance), in this specific case MSA models are redundant, because the relative properties are given exactly by the volume- or area-weighted arithmetic mean. It is shown that the mere existence of non-trivial cross-property relations is incompatible with the existence of MSA models. Finally, it is shown by numerical (finite-element) modeling that MSA models provide incorrect results even in the simplest of the cases for which they were originally designed, i. e. for simple cubic packings of partially sintered isometric (initially spherical) <b>grains.</b> Therefore, paraphrasing <b>Box,</b> MSA models are not only wrong, but also useless, and should be abandoned...|$|R
