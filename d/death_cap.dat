5|$|The genome of the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> {{has been}} sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Consumption of the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> is {{a medical}} {{emergency}} requiring hospitalization. The four main categories of therapy for poisoning are preliminary medical care, supportive measures, specific treatments, and liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
50|$|Poisonous {{mushrooms}} {{are known to}} grow in Braddon, including <b>death</b> <b>caps</b> which are commonly found near established oak trees.|$|R
5|$|The case of Claudius' {{poisoning}} is more complex. Claudius {{was known}} to have been very fond of eating Caesar's mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of <b>death</b> <b>caps</b> instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from <b>death</b> <b>caps,</b> with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of nightshade) being administered later during his illness.|$|R
25|$|Many EcM fungal fruiting {{bodies are}} well known. These include the {{economically}} important and edible truffle (Tuber) and the deadly <b>death</b> <b>caps</b> and destroying angels (Amanita). They also form on many common temperate forest trees, such as pines (Pinus), oaks (Quercus), willows (Salix), Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga), eucalypts (Eucalyptus), beeches (Fagus) and birches (Betula).|$|R
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is {{widespread}} in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a wood-rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood. An extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> (Amanita phalloides). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, and eventual death if not treated rapidly. About ten poisonings {{have been attributed to}} the species now grouped as G.marginata over the last century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> is {{native to}} Europe, where it is widespread. It is found from the {{southern}} coastal regions of Scandinavia in the north, to Ireland in the west, east to Poland and western Russia, and south throughout the Balkans, in Italy, Spain and Portugal, and in Morocco and Algeria in north Africa. In west Asia {{it has been reported}} from forests of northern Iran. There are records from further east in Asia but these have yet to be confirmed as A.phalloides.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, {{four people}} were accidentally {{poisoned}} when <b>death</b> <b>caps</b> (reportedly misidentified as straw fungi, which are popular in Chinese and other Asian dishes) were served at a New Year's Eve dinner party in Canberra, Australia. All the victims required hospital treatment {{and two of}} them died, with a third requiring a liver transplant.|$|R
5|$|A rarely appearing, all-white {{form was}} {{initially}} described A.phalloides f. alba by Max Britzelmayr, though its status has been unclear. It is often found growing amid normally colored <b>death</b> <b>caps.</b> It has been described, in 2004, {{as a distinct}} variety and includes what was termed A.verna var. tarda. The true Amanita verna fruits in spring and turns yellow with KOH solution, whereas A.phalloides never does.|$|R
5|$|Novices may mistake {{juvenile}} <b>death</b> <b>caps</b> for edible puffballs or mature specimens {{for other}} edible Amanita species, such as A.lanei, so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting of Amanita species {{for the table}} altogether. The white form of A.phalloides may be mistaken for edible species of Agaricus, especially the young fruitbodies whose unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of Agaricus have dark-colored gills.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{widespread in the}} Americas and Europe. It can grow either singly, scattered, or in groups. It prefers habitats like coniferous and mixed forests and alongside paths, where it fruits in summer and fall. It is a toxic mushroom that has muscarine, the same toxin as Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina {{as well as many}} species in the Clitocybe and Inocybe genera. It is often confused with various other European species. A.gemmata resembles the false <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> tawny grisette and panther cap mushrooms. Its cap is brighter in color than the former, and more yellow than the latter two.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{resemble}} several edible species commonly {{consumed by}} humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental poisoning. Mature fruiting bodies can {{be confused with the}} edible A. velosa, A. lanei or Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, while immature specimens may be difficult to distinguish from edible Agaricus mushrooms or puffballs. Similar in toxicity to the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> (A. phalloides) and destroying angels of Europe (A. virosa) and eastern North America (A. bisporigera), it is a potentially deadly fungus responsible for several poisonings in California. Its principal toxic constituent, α-amanitin, damages the liver and kidneys, often fatally, and has no known antidote, though silybin and N-acetylcysteine show promise. The initial symptoms are gastrointestinal and include abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. These subside temporarily after 2–3days, though ongoing damage to internal organs during this time is common; symptoms of jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma may follow with death from liver failure 6–16days post ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mushroom}} {{species are}} poisonous to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or allergic reactions {{as well as}} hallucinations to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the destroying angel (A.virosa) and the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> (A.phalloides), {{the most common cause}} of deadly mushroom poisoning. The false morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing rhabdomyolysis. Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of north-eastern Siberia.|$|E

5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
25|$|Phalloidin, is a toxin {{that has}} been {{isolated}} from the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> mushroom Amanita phalloides. It binds to the interface between adjacent actin monomers in the F-actin polymer, preventing its depolymerization.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} be peeled has been taken {{as a sign of}} edibility in mushrooming, which is a {{potentially}} lethal mistake in this species. It is unclear why this fungus, which more closely resembles edible species, has been implicated in fewer deaths than the <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> though its rarity may contribute to this.|$|E
5|$|The phallotoxins {{consist of}} at least seven compounds, {{all of which have}} seven similar peptide rings.

Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells, they have since been found to add little to the <b>death</b> <b>cap's</b> toxicity, as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, phalloidin is also found in the edible (and sought-after) Blusher (Amanita rubescens). Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar monocyclic heptapeptides. Like the phallotoxins, they do not induce any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans.|$|R

5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected <b>death</b> <b>caps</b> in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|R
25|$|Amanita virosa {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for severe mushroom poisonings. Like the closely related <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> (A. phalloides), it contains the highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins.

25|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> poisoning. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. N-acetylcysteine has shown promise in combination with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins that are returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E
500|$|Amanita phalloides , {{commonly}} known as the <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Widely distributed across Europe, A.phalloides forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of oak, chestnut, and pine. The large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in colour with a white stipe and gills. [...] Cap colour is variable, including white forms (see Taxonomy below) and thus not a reliable identifier.|$|E

5|$|<b>Death</b> <b>caps</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes it particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substance in the blood. Kidney failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial bleeding, pancreatic inflammation, acute kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|R
500|$|Mushroom {{poisoning}} is {{more common}} in Europe than in America.
