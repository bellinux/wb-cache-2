Introduction: All hog raisers who are {{abreast of}} the times know {{that there has been}} a very great change during the past few years in the class of hogs demanded by the market. This change has not come without cause, nor has it been sudden and sweeping. It has, however, made its appearance, and is still {{lingering}} among the backwoods farmers. A few years ago, the farmer kept his hogs until two and three and even four years old, fattened them out on corn at from four to six hundred pounds per head, and received the top of the market for them. The hog raiser now knows that his profitable hog is sold on the market at a weight of from 180 to 225 pounds, and the quicker he can get his hogs to that weight the more profitable it is for him. The farmer has been brought to a realization of this fact in several ways...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. hog industry, once {{primarily}} made up {{of small}} owner-operated crop-hog farms, has become dominated by large specialized operations characterized by low costs and improved technologies in livestock management. Such changes have triggered concerns over the dangers large <b>Hog</b> <b>Feeding</b> Operations (HFOs) are likely to pose to the environment. In 2007, the top ten states {{accounted for more than}} 85 percent of total U. S. hog production (Iowa (IA), North Carolina (NC), Minnesota (MN), Illinois (IL), Nebraska (NE), Indiana (IN), Missouri (MO), Oklahoma (OK), Ohio (OH), and Kansas (KS)). With such domination on production, these states are often the subject of environmental debate relating to hog production. When farmers are required to incorporate environmental measures in hog production, their costs of production increase. Metcalfe (2001) found that small HFOs have found it difficult to cope with such costs and many have exited the industry, while large operations have not been affected at the same level. Due to the variation of environmental regulations among states, other operations moved to states with lax regulations (e. g. NC prior to the late 1990 s). Such regulations appear to have {{played a major role in}} shaping the structure of the hog industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} in pig feeding {{conducted during the}} summer and fall of 1906, reported in Bulletin No. 91 of this Station, showed that with 40 -cent corn, the cost of producing 100 pounds gain on growing pigs, averaging 60 pounds in weight at the start, was lower with the ration of. corn alone on pasture than with any one of several mixed grain rations commonly fed in Iowa. There has so far been no definite experimental work reported to show the most profitable form in which em u should be fed to your-g pigs. While other stations have investigated some phases of the problem of preparing corn for <b>hog</b> <b>feeding,</b> the work has mostly been done with well grown hogs in short feeding periods of less than 100 days, and with only part of the feasible methods of preparation included in any one experiment.

40|$|Modern hog {{breeding}} has a {{long tradition}} in the Czech Republic it is the stable branch of livestock production. Its main task is to produce high quality pork meat, which must meet all requirements of the processors and the final consumer. Pork meat occupies for decades in Czech Republic first place in consumption per one inhabitant (per year) and it forms more than 50 % of the total annual meat consumption. This branch also plays an important role for producers of cereals, which largely contributes to the overall size and stability of the agricultural sector. The increasing imports were the main reason why many Czech hog breeding farms has been reduced or completely eliminated. Reducing numbers of pigs in the last decade is a reflection of supply and demand for pigs. The objecvive {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the changes in the cost structure for fattening of hogs and indicate how these changes are reflected in the competitiveness of Czech agriculture enterprises. Choice of optimal strategy of breeding and <b>hog</b> <b>feeding</b> already affects not only the requirements of food security, requirements of quality and affordability.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to attempt a {{sustainable}} eradication of Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis infection in a closed pig breeding farm. The piggery was situated north of Berlin and included 1200 sows and 700 young pigs without <b>hog</b> <b>feeding.</b> The whole livestock was treated either by two injections (intramuscular, two weeks interval) of IVOMEC®-S-Injektionslösung or by feeding IVOMEC® Prämix for two weeks treatment with a one week break after 7 days. There was no environmental treatment of the hog house. Naturally infected sows were examined before and after treatment for mange status as follows: investigation of typical dermatitis skin lesions, scratching index, detection of mites in ear cartilages and serologic investigation of Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis antibodies in blood and colostral samples. Observation period for treatment control lasted up to 12 months. Direct detection of mange mites was negative after 4 months following treatment. Scratching index decreased immediately after treatment. Skin lesions slowly decreased after treatment and remained at a low level until the end of the observation period. Regarding the serological results in blood and colostral samples individual differences among the sows were found. Positive samples were detectable within six months (blood) and nine months (colostrum) after treatment. After one year the whole livestock showed no symptoms of sarcoptic mange which indicates a successful eradication of Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis using ivermectin as injection and in the feed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the economic performance and statistical forecasting accuracy of some major agricultural futures markets relative to production and marketing decisions. The objectives were to: analyze the intertemporal price relationships between cash and futures markets; develop strategies associated with production and marketing decisions which incorporate both cash and futures prices; {{and evaluate the}} performance of alternative strategies to reduce unfavorable price fluctuations and increase realized profits. ^ To achieve these objectives, a forecasting model, one of the forecasting approaches, was developed. The profitability of selective hedging by producers and marketing firms depends upon their ability to accurately forecast prices, costs and basis. Two categories of production and marketing strategies [...] forecasting strategies and forecasting-futures strategies [...] were also considered for each commodity. The futures market performance of forecasting future cash prices was evaluated by single linear regressions with futures prices as the independent variable and cash price as the dependent variable. The economic performance of each decision strategy was evaluated with respect to additional profitability, commodity by commodity. ^ Historical data supported the conclusions that for grain and livestock, the futures market provides moderately reliable estimates of the cash prices for several months into the future. If one has a more accurate econometric model {{to be used for}} forecasting future cash prices than the direct use of the futures market prices, then profits can be increased for production and marketing of grain by adopting selective hedging strategies. Selective hedging also increased returns for <b>hog</b> <b>feeding.</b> However, selective hedging for cattle feeding resulted in lower returns than under the forecasting strategy during the study period. ^ Economic efficiency would suggest that producers and marketing firms may have the potential for increased profits from using the decision strategies to reduce price risk and increase profitability. Their performance may also be improved with inclusions of production decisions based on the potential expected revenues among competitive enterprises. Furthermore, the decision strategies could also be used as a public advisory service to each industry with model respecification and implementation. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{environmental regulation}} {{issues in the}} hog production industry as well as forces behind the reorganization of the industry {{during the past two}} decades. Federal and State-level environmental regulations imposed on U. S. hog production during the year 2003 are examined in Chapter 1. Based on the number of regulations passed by the Federal government and states, the 2003 regulatory index is constructed. The regulatory stringency index suggests that state-level regulations vary across states and have increased over the years. In addition, state-level regulations are more stringent than federal regulations. ^ Chapter 2 develops an empirically implementable theoretical model which allows us to investigate the long-run effects of environmental regulations on the U. S. hog industry. <b>Hog</b> <b>feeding</b> operations (HFOs) are divided into large feeding operations (LHFOs) and small feeding operations (SHFOs). The impact of the presence {{of a large number of}} LHFOs on the entry and exit of CHFOs is also examined. Results of this study suggest that: Increased state-level regulation stringency significantly lowers the output of SHFOs; increased state-level regulation stringency significantly lowers the output of LHFOs; increased state-level regulation stringency significantly lowers the number of SHFOs; SHFO output rises significantly in states that have a greater number of LHFOs; LHFO output rises significantly in states that have a greater number of LHFOs; the number of SHFOs significantly increases in states that have a greater numbers of LHFOs; regulation increases the average SHFO size; and regulation decreases the average LHFO size. ^ Chapter 3 examines the importance of input availability, market attractiveness, agglomeration economies and environmental regulations on the reorganization of U. S. hog production for a panel of 22 U. S. hog producing states which include, Northern states, Southern states and Midwest states for the period 1994 - 2006. Results from this study suggest that: Hog production in a state is positively affected by hog production in a nearby state, confirming the presence of agglomeration economies; Environmental regulations and high corn price have negative effects on state-level U. S. hog production; High hog prices, and favorable labor cost, and land values attract hog production; and transportation cost has no effect on hog production. ...|$|E
