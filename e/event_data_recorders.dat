5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} crash was the motorcoach driver’s mistaking the HOV-only left exit ramp to Northside Drive for the southbound Interstate 75 HOV through lane. Contributing to the crash driver’s route mistake was {{the failure of the}} Georgia Department of Transportation to install adequate traffic control devices to identify the separation and divergence of the Northside Drive HOV-only left exit ramp from the southbound Interstate 75 HOV through lane. Contributing to the severity of the crash was the motorcoach’s lack of an adequate occupant protection system.Major safety issues identified in this crash include inadequate HOV traffic control devices, inadequate motor carrier driver oversight, lack of <b>event</b> <b>data</b> <b>recorders</b> on motorcoaches, and lack of motorcoach occupant protection. As a result of its investigation, the Safety Board makes recommendations to the Federal Highway Administration and to the Georgia Department of Transportation.

40|$|Evaluations of crash {{protection}} {{safety features}} require measures for quantifying impact severity. Velocity change (delta-V) {{is the major}} descriptor of collision severity used in most real-world crash databases. One {{of the limitations of}} delta-V {{is that it does not}} account for the time over which the crash pulse occurs (delta-t). Late model GM vehicles equipped with <b>event</b> <b>data</b> <b>recorders</b> capture the cumulative delta-V in 10 ms intervals over the crash pulse. Deceleration can be readily calculated from these data and provides a complementary measure of severity that has not previously been available for real world crashes. The relationship between maximum delta-V and deceleration was examined for different vehicle platforms involved in real world frontal impacts and frontal crash tests. Maximum deceleration was observed to be closely correlated to the maximum delta-V...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{compares the}} ability of delta-V and the occupant impact velocity (OIV), a competing measure of crash severity, to predict occupant injury in real world collisions.

Cumulative probability of injury risk curves are generated using binary logistic regression for all data, a belted subset, and an unbelted subset.

40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} field {{performance}} of occupant restraint systems designed with advanced air bag features including those {{specified in the}} US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208 for advanced air bags, {{through the use of}} <b>Event</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> (EDRs). Although advanced restraint systems have been extensively tested in the laboratory, we are only beginning to understand the performance of these systems in the field. Because EDRs record many of the inputs to the advanced air bag control module, these devices can provide unique insights into the characteristics of field performance of air bags. The study was based on 164 advanced air bag cases extracted from NASS/CDS 2002 - 2006 with associated EDR data. In this dataset, advanced driver air bags were observed to deploy with a 50 % probability at a longitudinal delta-V of 9 mph for the first stage, and at 26 mph for both inflator stages. In general, advanced air bag performance was as expected, however, the study identified cases of air bag deployments at delta-Vs as low as 3 - 4 mph, non-deployments at delta-Vs over 26 mph, and possible delayed air bag deployments...|$|E
40|$|Passive safety {{testing has}} been based on {{accident}} research where objective physical evidence can be compiled and analysed when establishing technical test requirements. Active safety tests pose new challenges because objective data is more difficult to obtain. Until pre-crash variables became available in <b>Event</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> (EDR), the only sources of pre-crash vehicle motions were tire marks or witness statements. Both data sources have limitations since they may not always be available and require interpretation by the analyst. The pre-crash EDR data variables provide an objective source of data to active safety test development. However, the suitability of the data has not been thoroughly investigated in the published literature. The review of existing data shows that the variables identified in the new EDR requirement in FMVSS 563 are useful but incomplete for a comprehensive analysis of vehicle dynamics manoeuvres prior to a crash. In particular, the absence of vehicle yaw rate reduces the positioning accuracy of the vehicle in reconstructions. The objective data in the limited cases were used to compile the frequency of pre- crash braking and steering, and when possible, the magnitude of these driver inputs. Active Safety test development will benefit with more EDR analysis but the older data that does not conform to Part 563 has limited application...|$|E
