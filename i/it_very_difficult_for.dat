5|$|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally {{with the impact of}} religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant {{in the context of the}} advancement of the soul.|$|E
5|$|The {{defenders}} {{expected the}} German and Ottoman attack {{to be one}} of containment against their prepared line of defence, and an all-out attack on the right south of Katib Gannit. They also appreciated that such an attack would expose the German and Ottoman left flank. Murray's plan was to firstly delay the attackers and make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> them to gain ground south of Katib Gannit, and secondly, only when the German and Ottoman force was totally committed, to then disorganise their flank attack with an attack by Section Troops at Hill 70 and Dueidar, with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column operating more widely against the flank and rear.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third World countries. This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, the Army {{developed}} the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from {{experiences in the}} European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be {{as close to the}} fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals for the treatment of wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea, all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport, making <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea, being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Early {{operating}} systems generally supported a single type of disk drive {{and only one}} kind of file system.

25|$|The Government {{does not}} permit non-Muslim clergy to enter {{the country for the}} purpose of {{conducting}} religious services, although some come under other auspices and perform religious functions in secret. Such restrictions make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> most non-Muslims to maintain contact with clergymen and attend services. Catholics and Orthodox Christians, who require a priest on a regular basis to receive the sacraments required by their faith, particularly are affected.|$|E
25|$|Compressibility is an {{important}} factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to aircraft design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the speed of sound, a host of new aerodynamic effects become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> World War II era aircraft to reach speeds much beyond 800km/h (500mph).|$|E

25|$|In 1945, the Supreme Court of the United States held in Associated Press v.

25|$|The UK's {{reluctance}} {{to join the}} Schengen Area, through concerns over loss of independent border controls, is usually cited {{as the reason for}} not joining. Britain argued that, for an island, frontier controls are a better and less intrusive way to prevent illegal immigration than other measures, such as identity cards, residence permits, and registration with the police. Consequent difficulties for Ireland, given its location and shared border with the United Kingdom (at which border points would have to be set up), would then make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Ireland to join without the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|This {{compendium}} of biblical and classical history (original title: De aetatibus mundi et hominis libri XXIII) is told in fourteen books, each lacking a particular {{letter of the}} alphabet ('A' in book i, 'B' in book ii., etc.). The deliberate omission of each letter means that Fulgentius cannot use any word containing that letter for the entirety of that section. However, he varies this avoidance of words with his second technique of swapping omitted letters for other arbitrarily selected letters. These techniques obscure his language, making <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the reader to understand his meaning. Just as in the Content of Virgil, Fulgentius claims the work was completed {{as a result of}} the request of his unnamed patron.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Jupiter-sized {{bodies that}} orbit {{too close to}} the {{habitable}} zone but not in it (as in 47 Ursae Majoris), or have a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the habitable zone (like 16 Cygni B) make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. See the discussion of a stable habitable zone above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon. Even if such a planet is initially loosely bound and following a strongly inclined orbit, gravitational interactions with the star can stabilize the new moon into a close, circular orbit that is coplanar with the planet's orbit around the star.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} sharp {{criticism}} about the U.S. {{response to the}} Holocaust: That it failed to admit Jews fleeing persecution from Europe {{at the beginning of}} World War II, and that it did not act decisively enough to prevent or stop the Holocaust. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the President at the time, was well-informed about the Hitler regime and its anti-Jewish policies, but the U.S. State Department policies made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Jewish refugees to obtain entry visas. Roosevelt similarly took no action on the Wagner-Rogers Bill, which could have saved 20,000 Jewish refugee children, following the arrival of 936 Jewish refugees on the MS St. Louis, who were denied asylum and were not allowed into the United States because of strict laws passed by Congress.|$|E
