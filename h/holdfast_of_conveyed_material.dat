40|$|Pressure drop in {{pneumatic}} conveying {{is due to}} frictional interaction among gas, particle, and pipe wall. Fictional forces due to solids can be calculated using a solids friction factor. Many correlations have been proposed for predicting solids friction factor in dilute phase {{pneumatic conveying}}. These correlations are calculated based on value of the parameters calculated for a long pipeline or value of the parameter at the inlet of the pipeline. Pneumatic conveying in long pipelines suggests {{that some of the}} flow parameters are not constant {{along the length of the}} pipeline. This article presents a modeling technique for predicting solid friction factor taking into account of the local value of flow parameter. In this method, the solids friction factor is presented in terms of coefficient and exponents. The values of coefficient and exponents are predicted for fluidized dense phase conveying using different types <b>of</b> <b>conveying</b> <b>materials.</b> Values <b>of</b> coefficient and exponents are found to be different for different types <b>of</b> <b>conveying</b> <b>materials.</b> Variations <b>of</b> different parameters are studied using the calculated optimum values of coefficient and exponents.

With increasing production amount, the rate <b>of</b> <b>conveying</b> <b>material</b> through such entries increases. Therefore, it is required to design wider entries.

The coal seam has a strain softening property, and the analysis index of stress and deformation of ribsides and coal pillars at different loading levels are determined. Strain softening parameters is studied separately for each modeled coal pillar, and based on conventional formula the pillar strength are calculated. In a modeled longwall mine, the caving material at goaf zone are fully compact. The results shows that based on Mohr-Coulomb model, the strain softening occurs at maximum cohesion and friction, and at region of decreasing the strength of pillar in stress-strain curve. Because of 3 D nature of analyses, the effect of front and side abutment load on stability of pillar are studied simultaneously. Therefore, the results of this study could be suitable criteria for appraisal of pillar design method at deep longwall coal mines...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} great {{advantages}} to using pneumatic conveying systems for transport of materials, {{one of these}} being flexibility of routing – a pneumatic pipeline can incorporate multiple changes of direction {{without the need for}} transfer points and additional drives which are needed everywhere a mechanical conveying system changes direction. However, one of the disadvantages of using bends in pneumatic conveyors is the wear of the bends, if the <b>material</b> being <b>conveyed</b> is at all abrasive e. g. if the particles are hard and angular such as minerals, coal, ash etc. Wear also often occurs in long straight sections just after pipe joints. This wear problem is often very costly, resulting in many unplanned stoppages for repair on systems <b>conveying</b> these <b>materials,</b> as well as producing severe mess from leakage of the material after a puncture. There are many different means of providing wear protection for bends and straight pipe sections, but they too can be costly, with the best wear resistant materials costing as much as 5000 per bend or even more to apply; and the wrong choice can lead to much wasted money if it does not give the protection hoped for. Other wear resistant solutions can severely increase the energy consumption of the conveyor, or limit its throughput, if applied too liberally. Hence {{it is very important to}} choose carefully the right means of wear protection. This paper will review the common sites and causes <b>of</b> <b>conveying</b> pipeline wear, and show that with the latest technology for characterising the erosiveness <b>of</b> the <b>conveyed</b> <b>material,</b> it is possible to choose a wear protection solution that will give cost-effective protection...|$|R
