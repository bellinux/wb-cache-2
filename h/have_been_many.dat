5|$|Since {{the time}} of its {{discovery}} in 1905, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>many</b> attempts to estimate the population size of this species.

Humans frequently invade its habitat, though such disturbances have been greatly reduced by preventive measures. Recent efforts in conservation include perpetuating the extant population at a baseline size as well as maintaining captive populations.|$|E
