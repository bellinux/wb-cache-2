The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the risk and effect of balloon perforation by anchoring barbs and to assess whether these risks are different if the balloon is protected by a covered stent mounted upon it. MethodsA bench-top model was developed to mimic the penetration of anchoring barbs into the lumen of medium sized blood vessels. The model allowed variation of angle and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> penetration. Both bare balloons and those with covered stents mounted upon them were tested in the model to determine whether there was a risk of perforation and which factors increased or decreased this risk. ResultsAll combinations of barb angle and depth caused balloon perforation but this was most marked when the barb was placed perpendicular to the long axis of the balloon. When the deployment of covered stents was attempted balloon perforation occurred in some cases but full stent deployment was achieved in all cases where the perforation was in the portion of the balloon covered by the stent. The only situation in which stent deployment failed was where the barb was intentionally placed in the uncovered portion of the balloon. This resulted in only partial deployment of the stent. ConclusionsBalloon rupture is a distinct possibility when deploying balloon-expandable stents {{in close proximity to}} anchoring barbs. Care should be taken in this circumstance to ensure that the barb is well away from the uncovered portion of the balloon...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{knowledge}} of vascular structures of port wine stains (PWSs) {{may be useful}} to select treatment doses and improve therapeutic efficacy. Biopsies are impractical to implement, therefore, it is necessary to develop non-invasive techniques for morphological evaluation. This study aimed to evaluate the application of a novel optical coherence tomog-raphy (OCT) system to characterize the vascular structures of PWSs. First, OCT images were obtained from the skin of healthy rabbit ears and compared with the histopathological images. Second, OCT was used to document the differences between PWS lesions and contralateral normal skin; the size and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the vascular structures of two clinical types of PWSs were measured and statistically analyzed. The dermal blood <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> healthy rabbit ears were clearly distinguished from other tissue. There was no statistical difference between the vascular diameter or depth measured by OCT images and histopathological sections (P> 0. 05). The OCT images of the PWSs could be distinguished from normal skin. There was no statistical difference in the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> between the purple-type and the proliferative-type PWSs (P> 0. 05), while there was statistical difference in the diameter <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> between them (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare and {{investigate}} morphometric characteristics of limbal vasculature within the superior and inferior limbal regions using ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography. Method: Cross-sectional images of the human corneo-scleral limbus were acquired with a research grade ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomographer (UHR-OCT) from 14 healthy subjects after manual retraction of the upper and lower eyelid. The UHR-OCT provides an axial and lateral resolution in biological tissue of ~ 3 μm and ~ 18 μm, respectively. 3 D stacks of OCT images (1000 x 1024 x 256) were acquired of the transition from cornea to bulbar conjunctiva at the superior and inferior limbal region. All visible vessels within the limbal region were measured using an Image J circle or ellipse tool. Vessel depth and size measurements were repeated for the same vessel and the concordance correlation coefficient was computed. Quantitative differences in vessel size and depth in the limbal region were analyzed using repeated measured ANOVA. R and SPSS were used for all data analysis procedures. Results: The average vessel size for superior and inferior limbus were 29. 28 µm ± 17. 649 µm (SD) and 23. 68 µm ± 18. 118 µm (SD) respectively. The average vessel depth for superior and inferior limbus were 176. 76 µm ± 108. 698 µm (SD) and 205. 62 µm ± 131. 991 µm (SD) respectively. The concordance correlation coefficient for superior and inferior limbal vessel size were 0. 95 (95 % CI, 0. 935 to 0. 964) and 0. 994 (95 % CI, 0. 991 to 0. 995) respectively, while that <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>depth</b> were 0. 998 (95 % CI, 0. 997 to 0. 999) and 0. 998 (95 % CI, 0. 997 to 0. 998) respectively. The vessels within the superior limbus were larger than the vessels found in the inferior limbus (RM-ANOVA POS p = 0. 004), and the vessels within the inferior limbus were on average deeper than the vessels found within the superior limbus (RM-ANOVA POS p = 0. 042). There was a positive linear relationship between limbal vessel depth and size within the superior and inferior limbus with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 803 and 0. 754, respectively. There were on average 9 vessels per subject within the superior limbal region as compared to 13 vessels per subject with the inferior limbal region. Conclusion: This study provided evidence that the UHR-OCT was capable of imaging (and therefore measuring) morphometric characteristics such as the size and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> within the limbus in a repeatable manner. A positive linear association between vessel depth and size was identified in the superior and inferior limbal regions. The results of this study suggest a definite difference in the size and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> across different positions of the limbus, and this may be indicative of adaptations to chronic hypoxia caused by the constant covering of the superior limbus by the upper eyelid. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The role of annexin II in the {{development}} and progression of gastric cancer was explored. Methods Real-time PCR was conducted to detect annexin II and S 100 A 6 mRNA expression. Protein expressions of annexin II and S 100 A 6 were also examined by immunohistochemistry in 436 clinicopathologically characterized gastric cancer cases. Results The expression of annexin II and S 100 A 6 mRNA differ significantly among gastric tumor tissue and matched non-cancerous gastric mucosa. Protein levels of annexin II and S 100 A 6 were up-regulated in gastric cancer compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. High expression of annexin II correlated with age, location of tumor, size of tumor, differentiation, histological type, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> invasion, <b>vessel</b> invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) stage, and also with expression of S 100 A 6. Further multivariate analysis suggested that expression of annexin II and S 100 A 6 were independent prognostic indicators for gastric cancer. Cumulative five-year survival rates of patients with high expression of both annexin II and S 100 A 6 was significantly lower than those with low expression of both. Conclusion Expression of annexin II in gastric cancer was significantly associated with <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis, TNM stage, high S 100 A 6 expression, and poor prognosis.

Dickkopf- 1 mRNA and protein expression were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in specimens of primary cancer and their adjacent noncancerous tissues in gastric cancer patients. Results. Dickkopf- 1 mRNA and protein expression levels were both significantly upregulated in gastric cancer lesions compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. Its positive expression was correlated with <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> invasion, <b>vessel</b> invasion, lymph node and distant metastasis, and TNM stage of tumors.

As technical solutions to this conflict are limited {{and difficult to}} implement, this study aimed to identify fishing practices that could reduce odontocete depredation, {{with a focus on}} killer whales (Orcinus orca) interacting with Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longliners off the Crozet islands. Data collected by fishery observers from 6013 longline sets between 2003 and 2013 allowed us to statistically detect the significant influence of five operational variables using GLMMs. The probability <b>of</b> interactions between <b>vessels</b> and killer whales was decreased by (i) the number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> operating simultaneously in the area: the limited number of depredating killer whales may induce a dilution effect with increased fleet size, and (ii) <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> longline sets: <b>vessels</b> operating in shallow waters may be more accessible to whales that are initially distributed on peri-insular shelves. The cpue was negatively influenced by (iii) length of longlines: longer sets may provide killer whales access to a greater proportion of hooked fish per set, and positively influenced by (iv) hauling speed: increased speed may shorten the time during which toothfish are accessible to whales during hauling. The time it takes for killer whales to reach vessels was positively correlated to (v) the distance travelled between longline sets with an estimated threshold of 100 km beyond which whales seem to temporarily lose track <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> These findings provide insightful guidelines about what fishing strategy to adopt given these variables to reduce killer whale depredation here and in similar situations elsewhere.
