Radiographic contrast agents are highly effective at displacing blood however, may {{increase the risk of}} contrast-induced nephropathy. <b>Flushing</b> <b>media</b> viscosity, flow rate, and flush duration influence the efficiency of blood displacement necessary for obtaining diagnostic quality OFDI images. The aim of this work was to determine the optimal flushing parameters necessary to reliably perform intracoronary OFDI while reducing the volume of administered radiographic contrast, and assess the influence of <b>flushing</b> <b>media</b> choice on vessel wall measurements. 144 OFDI pullbacks were acquired together with synchronized EKG and intracoronary pressure wire recordings in three swine. OFDI images were graded on diagnostic quality and quantitative comparisons of flushing efficiency and intracoronary cross-sectional area with and without precise refractive index calibration were performed. <b>Flushing</b> <b>media</b> with higher viscosities resulted in rapid and efficient blood displacement. Media with lower viscosities resulted in increased blood-media transition zones, reducing the pullback length of diagnostic quality images obtained. Flushing efficiency was found to increase with increases in flow rate and duration. Calculations of lumen area using different <b>flushing</b> <b>media</b> were significantly different, varying up to 23 % (p < 0. 0001). This error was eliminated with careful refractive index calibration. <b>Flushing</b> <b>media</b> viscosity, flow rate, and flush duration influence the efficiency of blood displacement necessary for obtaining diagnostic quality OFDI images. For patients with sensitivity to contrast, {{to reduce the risk of}} contrast induced nephrotoxicity we recommend that intracoronary OFDI be conducted with flushing solutions containing little or no radiographic contrast. In addition, our findings show that careful refractive index compensation should be performed, taking into account the specific contrast agent used, in order to obtain accurate intravascular OFDI measurements.

40|$|An {{outgrowth}} of the recent “infrastructural turn” in the humanities, this dissertation explores ways in which emerging flushing infrastructures of the nineteenth century—specifically toilets, sewers, and wastewater treatment systems—rearranged the coordinates of human experience in the modern, developed world. The idea that flushing technologies and techniques contribute to a process of technogenesis—a process of technical exteriorization that is beyond human control but which nevertheless contributes {{to the evolution of}} human consciousness— offers a foundational perspective for this study. While flushing technologies and techniques have powerfully enhanced certain human capabilities, they have also affected humanity in a number of problematic ways. This project examines how an expansive <b>flushing</b> <b>media</b> complex emerged in the United States, and traces some of the cultural, environmental and psychical consequences of these developments. Central to this dissertation’s argument is the idea that specific technical circumstances have had the effect of diminishing people’s comfort with, and understanding of, waste processes. In the end, it argues that the ubiquitous flushing technologies that permeate the developed world have perpetuated a culture of forgetting. In the broadest sense, this dissertation is a media-theoretical exploration of the concept of flushing, and it adopts a theoretical lens that has been developed through cultural techniques scholarship of the past few decades. This body of research works to break down and rebuild conventional understandings of media and culture, and seeks to better understand the ways in which medial technologies shape social and cognitive orders. At the theoretical level, this dissertation works to extend the reach of media studies. In addition to conventional media like books, newspapers, TV, radio, film, and the internet, this view of media encompasses any substance or process that effectively mediates—that is, functions as a medium. At the stylistic level, this project answers the call for alternative and experimental modes of dissertorial expression. Blending academic, essayistic, and journalistic strategies, this work walks a precarious line between creative writing and scholarly discourse.

40|$|Sheep of five* breeds {{imported}} into New Zealand and {{held at a}} quarantine farm were increased in number {{through the use of}} embryo transplantation (ET) procedures. For this, donor ewes after superovulation treatment were inseminated with fresh semen of rams of their own breed and flushed to recover embryos 5 or 6 day after onset of oestrus. The embryos after classification and processing through ten washes of <b>flushing</b> <b>media</b> were transported to a secondary quarantine farm and transferred into synchronised recipient Coopworth and Romney ewes. Some of the surrogate ewes received intravaginal progesterone supplementation (CIDR) for 14 days after transfer. Details of lamb production were recorded. This thesis reports the results of some factors that can affect the success of a commercial ET programme. Among the donor ewes 87 - 89 % of the animals were in oestrus after synchronisation and gonadotrophin treatment. The ewes not in heat often had low or absent superovulatory responses. Superovulation was induced with either FSH-P or Folltropin given as 7 or 8 intramuscular injections at 12 h interval begining 72 h before withdrawal of the progesterone treatment (CIDR). The gonadotrophin dose levels were modified according to the breed and also as the programme progressed. Most of the data were examined within breed. The superovulatory response to either the type of gonadotrophin preparation or the dose levels did not differ significantly. The variation in recovery rate of embryos was not affected by the type of gonadotrophin used, whether the animals treated were flushed on one or two occasions, whether flushing was done 5 or 6 days after oestrus, or according to the ovulatory response (classed as 1 - 8, 9 - 16 and > 16 corpora lrttea counted). Overall 85 % of the ova were fertilised and had developed into embryos. There {{were no significant differences in}} fertility between inseminations done in the morning or the afternoon, or when flushed once or twice, or when AI was followed by natural mating, or relative to the ovulatory response. Moreover there was no significant difference within the six breeds in the fertility rate. The quality of the embryos, classified as "good" or "poor" on the basis of their appearance and stage of development consistent with the day of flushing (developmental age), was. significantly affected in several of the breeds by the type of gonadotrophin, the dose levels, the ovulatory response and the age of the embryos when recovered. The pregnancy rate after the transfer of two embryos was 59 %, 72 %, 60 %, 53 %, 53 %, 46 % for recipients carrying DT,FT,FINN,GOT,OXD,WHM embryos, respectively. The comparable ·values for embryo survival were 46 %, 57 %, 54 %, 42 %, 40 %, 34 %, respectively. In general among the factors studied involving breed of recipient, degree of synchronisation between donor and recipient, ovulation rate in the recipient, interval from flushing to transplantation and progesterone supplementation it was found that only the latter factor in the DT, FT and OXD breeds of embryos was significant. The results from this multiplication programme after considering 409 treatments with gonadotrophin gave an average of 6. 0 corpora lutea, 3. 9 eggs recovered, 3. 4 eggs fertilised and 1. 5 lambs born per treatment. It is concluded that the low recovery rate and poor survival rate of the embryos are important factors to be overcome if a significant increase in the number of lambs born is to be expected from embryo transplantation. Work to overcome these problems is necessary, but attempts should also be made to increase the OR through modification of the gonadotrophin treatments. Support for this idea is suggested because in some animals with a high OR satisfactory numbers of eggs were fertilised and an increase of good quality embryos was recorded. * Texel (from two sources, Danish (DT) and Finnish (FT) and considered as separate breeds), Finnish Landrace (Finn), Gotland Pelt (Got), Oxford Down (OXD), White Headed Marsh (WHM) breeds...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. A {{possible}} {{therapeutic effect}} of diagnostic tubal patency testing has been debated {{in the literature}} for half a century. Further debate surrounds whether oil-soluble or water-soluble contrast media might have the bigger fertility-enhancing effect. Historically a variety of agents {{have been used to}} “flush” the fallopian tubes, although tubal flushing does not currently form part of routine practice in the treatment of fertility delay. Target of the study. To evaluate the effect of flushing a woman's fallopian tubes with oil- or water-soluble contrast media on subsequent pregnancy outcomes in couples with infertility. Materials and methods. Eight randomised controlled trials were identified and included in this review. A further one randomised controlled trial is ongoing. All trials were assessed for quality criteria. The studied outcomes were pregnancy, live birth (and ongoing pregnancy), miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, treatment complications including pain, intravasation of contrast medium, infection and haemorrhage, and image quality. Results. Tubal <b>flushing</b> with oil-soluble <b>media</b> versus no intervention was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} odds of pregnancy (OR 3. 57, 95 %CI 1. 76 - 7. 23). There were no data from RCTs to assess tubal <b>flushing</b> with water-soluble <b>media</b> versus no intervention. Tubal <b>flushing</b> with oil-soluble <b>media</b> was associated with a significant increase in the odds of live birth versus tubal <b>flushing</b> with water-soluble <b>media</b> (OR 1. 49, 95 %CI 1. 05 - 2. 11) but the odds of pregnancy showed no significant difference (OR 1. 23, 95 %CI 0. 95 - 1. 60) and there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity for these two outcomes. The addition of oil-soluble <b>media</b> to <b>flushing</b> with water-soluble <b>media</b> (water-soluble plus oil-soluble media versus water- soluble media alone) showed no significant difference in the odds of pregnancy (OR 1. 16, 95 %CI 0. 78 - 1. 70) or live birth (OR 1. 06, 95 %CI 0. 64 - 1. 77). Conclusions. There is some evidence of effectiveness of tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast media in increasing the odds of pregnancy versus no intervention. The limited evidence of an increase in the odds of live birth from tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast media versus water-soluble contrast media must be interpreted cautiously. Further robust randomised trials, comparing oil-soluble versus water-soluble media and comparing each versus no intervention, are required to provide convincing evidence as to whether the technique should be accepted into widespread clinical practice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{possible}} {{therapeutic effect}} of diagnostic tubal patency testing has been debated {{in the literature}} for half a century. Further debate surrounds whether oil-soluble or water-soluble contrast media might have the bigger fertility-enhancing effect. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of flushing a woman's fallopian tubes with oil- or water-soluble contrast media on subsequent fertility outcomes in couples with infertility. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's specialised register of trials (searched 31 January 2007), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstract and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials comparing tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast <b>media</b> or tubal <b>flushing</b> with water-soluble <b>media</b> or with no treatment in women with subfertility. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials. MAIN RESULTS: Twelve trials involving 2079 participants were included. Tubal <b>flushing</b> with oil-soluble <b>media</b> versus no intervention {{was associated with a}} significant increase in the odds of live birth (Peto OR 2. 98, 95 % CI 1. 40 to 6. 37) and of pregnancy (Peto OR 3. 30, 95 % CI 2. 00 to 5. 43). For the comparison of tubal <b>flushing</b> with oil-soluble <b>media</b> versus tubal <b>flushing</b> with water-soluble <b>media,</b> the increase in the odds of live birth for tubal flushing with oil-soluble versus water-soluble media (Peto OR 1. 49, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 2. 11) was based on two trials where statistical heterogeneity was present and the higher quality trial showed no significant difference; there was no evidence of a significant difference in the odds of pregnancy (Peto OR 1. 21, 95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 54). The addition of oil-soluble <b>media</b> to <b>flushing</b> with water-soluble <b>media</b> showed no evidence of a significant difference in the odds of pregnancy (Peto OR 1. 28, 95 % CI 0. 92 to 1. 79) or live birth (Peto OR 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 77). There were no serious adverse event reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of effectiveness of tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast media in increasing the odds of pregnancy and live birth versus no intervention.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of endogenous ileal amino acid excretion under conditions of peptide alimentation was refined and evaluated with studies involving the laboratory rat. The refined method was used to investigate aspects of endogenous ileal amino acid flow in the pig. Five studies were conducted, three with rats and two involving the growing pig. 1. Preliminary investigations evaluated the filtration efficiency of ultrafiltration devices, and examined three pre-filtration treatments for rat ileal digesta: trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and perchloric acid (PCA) precipitation, and centrifugation (SPIN). The recovery of nitrogen following ultrafiltration (molecular weight exclusion limit 10, 000 Daltons) of fifteen purified protein, peptide and amino acid solutions indicated an effective filtration (> 90 %) on nominal molecular weight by the ultrafiltration devices. Determination of nitrogen and amino acids in the resulting fractions following TCA and PCA precipitation and centrifugation of rat ileal digesta indicated that PCA was the most effective precipitant. Endogenous ileal amino acid excretions in the growing rat fed an enzymically hydrolysed casein (EHC) based diet with subsequent treatment of the digesta using the ultrafiltration technology were then determined. Twelve 100 g male rats were fed either an EHC-based diet or a protein-free diet and samples of digesta were collected after slaughter. The digesta from the 6 EHC-fed rats were ultrafiltered after centrifugation and the high molecular weight fraction added to the precipitate. The protein-free fed rats had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower amino acid flows than those rats fed the EHC-based diet with subsequent treatment of the digesta. 2. The proportions of endogenous protein-, peptide- and free amino acid nitrogen (N) in digesta N from the distal ileum of the rat immediately after collection or following storage frozen (- 20 °C and - 196 °C) were compared. Eighteen growing rats were given a protein-free diet for 6 days, euthanased and samples of digesta were collected from the terminal 20 cm of ileum. The storage of digesta did not significantly affect the proportions of N-containing substances in the precipitate plus retentate or ultrafiltrate fractions. On average, 67 % of the total digesta N was in the precipitate plus retentate fraction and 33 % of total digesta N was in the ultrafiltrate fraction. Free amino acid N and peptide N were 10. 4 and 10. 6 % of total digesta N, respectively. 3. The effect of using different <b>flushing</b> <b>media</b> for the collection of ileal digesta on the composition of endogenous N was examined. Twelve growing rats were given a protein-free diet and samples of ileal digesta were collected from the euthanased animal using either distilled water or physiological saline as the flushing medium. There was no significant effect of collection method on the levels of N-containing substances in rat endogenous ileal digesta. 4. The effects of state of body nitrogen balance {{and the presence of}} dietary peptides and protein in the digestive tract on the excretion of endogenous amino acids from the ileum of the pig were investigated. Endogenous lysine excretion was determined for pigs given a protein-free diet, an EHC-, a zein- or a synthetic amino acid-based diet. Endogenous flows for amino acids other than lysine were determined for pigs on the protein-free and EHC-based diets. Six male pigs (15 kg liveweight) were allocated to each of the four diets and received the diet for 10 days. The mean endogenous ileal lysine flows for the zein and EHC fed pigs were not significantly different but were higher (P< 0. 05) than those for the protein-free and synthetic amino acid fed pigs whose mean flows were not significantly different from each other. The mean endogenous ileal flows for amino acids other than lysine were higher (P< 0. 05) for the EHC fed pigs compared to the animals on the protein-free diet, except for proline, glycine and arginine. 5. The effect of food dry matter intake on endogenous ileal amino acid excretion of the pig under peptide alimentation was determined. Sixteen male pigs (50 kg liveweight) each fitted with a T-cannula in the terminal ileum were fed at 8 levels of food dry matter intake for periods of 8 days. The experiment involved two trials of 8 pigs each, comprising a cross over design. Each trial involved 4 pairs of pigs with each pair receiving one of 4 sequences of treatment. Each sequence comprised 4 levels of food dry matter intake arranged in a Latin square. The food dry matter intakes were 0. 06, 0. 08, 0. 10 and 0. 12, and 0. 05, 0. 07, 0. 09 and 0. 11 metabolic liveweight (W 0. 75) day- 1 for the first and second trials, respectively. There was an increase in ileal excretion of amino acids, nitrogen and dry matter with increasing food dry matter. There were significant (P< 0. 05) linear relationships between endogenous ileal amino acid and nitrogen excretion and food dry matter intake except for lysine, glutamic acid and phenylalanine which increased in a curvilinear manner. These relationships, determined under physiologically more normal conditions than under protein-free alimentation, provide preliminary data on the magnitude of small intestinal amino acid losses in the pig...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{may cause}} venereal disease and {{infertility}} in horses. A Pseudomonas aeruginosa - carrier stallion, often unresponsive to artificial vagina collection, {{was used to}} naturally breed mares. Semen collected from the same stallion was also used to perform artificial inseminations. Pregnancy rates, embryo quality and incidence of uterine infection were compared between inseminated or naturally-bred mares. Methods P. aeruginosa was isolated from swabbing of the penis, prepuce and distal urethra of the stallion. Before being bred or inseminated, clitoral/vestibular samples were collected from all mares, and cultured for isolation of P. aeruginosa. At the first observed estrus, endometrial swabs were also collected. All mares subjected to natural mating (NS) were re-evaluated for P. aeruginosa by culture of clitoral and endometrial swabs. Artificial inseminations (AI) were performed either with fresh-extended semen (11 AI/ 7 mares) or frozen semen (10 AI/ 7 mares). The stallion was also used to breed 3 mares (4 services). For embryo collection, 2 mares were inseminated with fresh-extended semen (1 AI/mare), and 2 additional mares were inseminated with frozen semen (2 AI/mare). Two mares were naturally-bred {{with a total of}} 9 services, for embryo collection. All mares were examined after AI or natural service (NS), for uterine pathologies. Embryo recoveries were attempted passing a catheter with inflatable cuff connected to a sterile flexible 2 -way flushing catheter, through the cervix. <b>Flushed</b> <b>media</b> was recovered into an Em-Con filter, and embryos searched using a stereoscope. Embryos were graded from 1 (excellent) to 4 (degenerated/dead). Results Pregnancy rates obtained after NS was 50 % per cycle. However, {{more than half of the}} NS resulted in uterine disease, while uterine pathology was seen only in 22 % of the time following AI. Half of the mares bred by NS got positive to P. aeruginosa. Percentage of embryo recovery rates was identical after AI or NS (66. 7 %). The 4 embryos recovered after AI were classified as Grade 1, while after NS only 2 out of the 6 recovered embryos were Grade 1. Conclusion a) there was no evidence of reduced fertilization after AI or NS, b) a numerically higher incidence of uterine disease was noticed after NS, c) venereal transmission of P. aeruginosa after NS was confirmed, d) a lower percentage of G 1 embryos may be obtained after NS. Overall, the data supports the indication for P. aeruginosa -carrier stallions to be bred by AI rather than by NS, and raises the possibility that P. aeruginosa may affect embryo quality. </p...|$|R

The underlying mechanisms {{remain to}} be completely elucidated; however, variations in reproductive tract pH, and ammonium and urea concentrations have been implicated. Mouse embryos cultured {{in the presence of}} ammonium showed a shift in mitochondrial distribution away from the nucleus towards the cell cortex, suggestive of reduced mitochondrial activity, ATP production and embryo viability. In this study we determined the effect of dietary protein in vivo, on mitochondrial distribution in the 2 -cell mouse embryo. Five-week-old Swiss female mice (n = 10) were fed low (9 %), medium (14 %) or high (25 %) dietary protein for 3 weeks; feed intake and body weight were recorded weekly. At 8 weeks of age mice were primed with 5 IU of PMSG, then 5 IU hCG 48 h later, and mated overnight with males of proven fertility. Forty hours post-hCG females were sacrificed, their oviducts collected and <b>flushed</b> with <b>media.</b> The total number of 2 -cell embryos and oocytes retrieved were recorded. Active mitochondria were stained in the 2 -cell embryos using Mitotracker Green (Molecular Probes), and were visualised using confocal microscopy. Density of perinuclear and cortical staining was determined in Photoshop 7. 0, using an established method. Females fed the medium diet consumed significantly less and gained less weight than those fed the low or high diet (Table 1), despite similar final body weights (data not shown). Females fed the low diet tended to have a lower ovulation rate and fewer 2 -cell embryos than females consuming the other diets (Table 1, P > 0. 05). There was no significant effect of dietary protein on the distribution of mitochondria between the perinuclear and cortical region of the embryo, which may be reflective of lower in vivo ammonium levels compared to those described in culture.

Characterization of this tailing behaviour through the quantitative analysis of multiple coupled factors is necessary to enhance our understanding of contaminant transport. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the transport and elution behaviour of trichloroethene in a naturally heterogeneous (poorly sorted) aquifer material, with a specific focus on characterizing and quantifying the relative contributions of rate-limited immiscible-liquid dissolution and nonlinear, rate-limited sorption/desorption to low-concentration elution tailing. A comparison of trichloroethene elution behaviour for systems with and without immiscible-liquid phase present suggests that the low-concentration elution tailing observed in the former experiments is associated primarily with nonlinear, rate-limited sorption/desorption. The transport and elution of trichloroethene was successfully simulated using a mathematical model that combines independent, coupled descriptions of rate-limited dissolution and nonlinear, rate-limited sorption/desorption. Specifically, immiscible-liquid dissolution was described using a first-order mass transfer approach with a temporally variable dissolution rate coefficient, and sorption/desorption was described using an approach incorporating a continuous distribution of rate-limited domains. The results of this study indicate that multiple processes contributed to trichloroethene elution behaviour when immiscible-liquid phase was present and that a multiprocess model was required to accurately simulate the measured data. ...|$|R

Often, a drawback in these techniques {{is that they have}} to evaluate many paths in order to compute reasonably tight bounds on the exact solutions of the models. In this paper, we present a path composition algorithm to speed up path evaluation significantly. It works by quickly composing subpaths that are precomputed locally at the component level. The algorithm is computationally efficient since individual subpaths are precomputed only once, and the results are reused many times in the computation of all composed paths.

A practical implementation of the algorithm makes it feasible to solve even larger models, since it helps not only in evaluating more paths faster but also in computing long paths efficiently by composing them from short ones.

A compositional analysis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGS) in the reproductive tract of mares was performed. Uteri, ovaries and oviducts were obtained at a slaughter house, and stage of estrous cycle was estimated. Follicular fluid was aspirated from follicles of various sizes (1 - 5, 6 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30 or 31 - 40 n-d). Lumina of oviducts and uterine horns were flushed. In addition, oviductal epithelial cells were obtained for culture. Follicular fluid, oviductal and uterine horn <b>flushes,</b> and cell-conditioned <b>media</b> were analyzed for GAGS. Samples were also purified by chromatography. Quantity of total GAGs was estimated using a calorimetric assay. Compositional analysis of GAGs was performed using an electrophoretic assay in pyridine/fonnic acid or barium acetate. Total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantity and concentration in follicular fluid was affected by follicular size (P 0. 05). Chondroitin sulfate A and C (CSA-CSC) were the predominant GAGs found in follicular fluid (average of 73 %), followed by chondroitin sulfate B and hyaluronic acid (CSB- 1 h; average of 17 %), and heparin (BEP; average 10 %). The relationship between concentration of total GAGs and follicular size was represented by a quadratic regression model (r = - 0. 87, P = 0. 0001). In addition, concentration of CSA-CSC (r = - 0. 91, P = 0. 0001), CSB-HA (r = - 0. 61, P = 0. 0020), and HEP (r = - 0. 59, P = 0. 0030) were negatively correlated with follicular size. The electrophoretic procedure did not permit adequate separation among GAGs recovered from oviductal and uterine horn flushes. Production of GAGs by oviductal epithelial cells in vitro was insufficient for quantification or qualitative analysis. The predominant GAGs in the follicular fluid of mares may differ from previous studies in other species...|$|R
