5|$|Alice Howland, a {{linguistics}} {{professor at}} Columbia University, celebrates her 50th birthday with her physician husband John {{and their three}} adult children. After she forgets a word during a lecture and becomes lost during a jog on campus, Alice's doctor diagnoses her with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Alice's eldest daughter, Anna, and son, Tom, take a <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> {{to find out if}} they will develop the disease. Alice's younger daughter Lydia, an aspiring actress, decides not to be tested.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> is available.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the disease can be confirmed with a <b>genetic</b> <b>test.</b> In a study of 10 infants with clinical indications of NSML prior to their first birthday, 8 (80%) patients were confirmed to have the suspected mutation. An additional patient with the suspected mutation was subsequently found to have NF1, following evaluation of the mother.|$|E
50|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for CHARGE {{syndrome}} involves specific <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for the CHD7 gene.

Insurance companies sometimes do not pay for such <b>genetic</b> <b>tests,</b> though this is changing rapidly as <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> is becoming standard across all aspects of medicine. CHARGE syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, which means <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> is not {{required in order to}} make the diagnosis. Rather, the diagnosis can be made based on clinical features alone.|$|R

5|$|Until the {{discovery}} of a <b>genetic</b> <b>test,</b> statistics could only include clinical diagnosis based on physical symptoms and a family history of HD, excluding those who died of other causes before diagnosis. These cases can now be included in statistics; and, as the test becomes more widely available, estimates of the prevalence and incidence of the disorder are likely to increase.|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of out-of-hospital health-related <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> {{more than a decade}} ago, the landscape of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> services has grown in complexity. Although initially most <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> for health purposes were offered as direct-to-consumer services, that is, without the mediation of a medical professional, currently many commercial providers require that their tests be ordered by a licensed physician. At the same time, some commercially developed health-related <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> are gaining support from the professional medical community and are finding their way into clinical practice. Therefore, we differentiated between three types of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> offers: direct-to-consumer, physician-mediated, and clinic-based <b>genetic</b> <b>testing.</b> Expanded carrier screening tests for recessive disorders are currently available through all the three models of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing.</b> Herein, we review the present landscape of expanded carrier screening offers by highlighting the distinct issues associated with each of the three types of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|With {{traditional}} <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> doctors collect DNA samples, explain {{test results}} and advise patients on treatment options. With direct-to-consumer (DTC) <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> private companies provide <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> {{and results in}} commercial transactions. Consumers provide DNA samples directly to DTC <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> companies, with results provided back directly to consumers, typically online and usually without involving doctors. [1] Direct-to-consumer <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> range from health-related tests with significant healthcare implications (e. g. disease predisposition) to the so-called recreational genomics with no discernible implications (e. g. earwax consistency). [2] Of particular concern has been the offering of health-related tests outside the traditional medico-legal environment. Questions have been raised {{about the quality of}} health-related direct-to-consumer <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> and whether results are understandable by the average consumer. Concern has also been expressed about the appropriate regulation of the DTC <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> industry; at present DTC <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> purchases are normally governed by corporate contract and privacy policies. It is questionable whether consumers are giving valid consent for the tests and participation in DTC <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> research. Finally, there is a consensus that consumers often have insufficient understanding that the terms and conditions they agree to on DTC <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> websites (when they click "I agree") are legally binding agreements...|$|R

5|$|Occipital Atlanto-Axial Malformation (OAAM). This is a {{condition}} where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and {{at the base of}} the skull are fused or malformed. Symptoms range from mild incoordination to the paralysis of both front and rear legs. Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse, in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks. This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1month of age, and a radiograph can diagnose the condition. There is no <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for OAAM, and the hereditary component of this condition is not well researched at present.|$|E
5|$|The Dales pony is one {{of three}} breeds known to be a carrier of the fatal genetic disease foal {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (FIS). FIS is a recessive disease; affected foals are born when they inherit the gene from both parents. Foals with FIS appear normal when born, but have a compromised immune system and anemia, leading to untreatable infections and death within three months. Following the development of a <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> in 2010, 12% of Dales ponies tested in the UK were found to be carriers. The use of genetic testing has allowed breeders to avoid mating two carrier animals, so that the disease is avoided in foals.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its clinical application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a prenatal <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for Thalassemia that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes that cut DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of DNA strand depending on which allele (genetic variation) the fetus possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties Molecular Diagnostics.|$|E

40|$|The Human Genome Project {{unleashed}} {{a torrent of}} information about the human genome and the role of genetic variation in human health. As a result, <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> is now among the fastest growing areas of laboratory medicine. Today, <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> for about 1000 diseases are clinically available, with hundreds more available in a research setting. Making sure that laboratories can accurately and reliably perform <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> is a fundamental requirement for the success of genetic medicine, and the government has a key role to play in overseeing laboratory quality. Congress has provided federal agencies a broad mandate to ensure the accuracy and reliability of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> but inattention and delay have meant that this mandate has gone unheeded. This report describes the role of the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) in ensuring laboratory quality, and documents the repeated failure of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to implement this law with respect to <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> laboratories. It identifies the lack of transparency regarding laboratory quality as a key impediment to sound healthcare decision making by healthcare providers and patients. The report also summarizes data from the Genetics and Public Policy Center’s recent survey of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> laboratory directors. Survey findings indicate a clear correlation between participation in proficiency testing, which is not currently required under CLIA for <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> and test quality. The findings also show that nearly three-quarters of laboratory directors surveyed support more oversight of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> under CLIA, and more than 90 percent found proficiency testing to be useful in improving <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> quality. The report concludes that implementation of CLIA with respect to <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> laboratories through the creation of a <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> specialty is necessary to ensure the quality of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> to fulfill the promise of genetic medicine, and to protect the public’s health. ...|$|R

5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a <b>genetic</b> <b>test</b> for FLCN mutations.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of whole genome sequencing may have ethical implications. On one hand, <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> can potentially diagnose preventable diseases, {{both in the}} individual undergoing <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> and in their relatives. On the other hand, <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> has potential downsides such as genetic discrimination, loss of anonymity, and psychological impacts such as discovery of non-paternity.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Progress in {{deciphering}} the functionality of {{the human}} genome sequence in the wake of technological advances in the field of genomic medicine have dramatically reduced the overall costs of genetic analysis, thereby facilitating the incorporation of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> services into mainstream clinical practice. Although Greek <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> laboratories offer a variety of different <b>genetic</b> <b>tests,</b> relatively little is known about how either the general public or medical practitioners perceive <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> services. Materials & methods: We have therefore performed a nationwide survey of the views of 1717 members of the general public, divided into three age groups, from all over Greece, and residing in both large and small cities and villages, in order to acquire {{a better understanding of how}} they perceive <b>genetic</b> <b>testing.</b> We also canvassed the opinions of 496 medical practitioners with regard to <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> services in a separate survey that addressed similar issues. Results: Our subsequent analysis indicated that a large proportion of the general public is aware of the nature of DNA, genetic disorders and the potential benefits of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> although this proportion declines steadily with age. Furthermore, a large proportion of the interviewed individuals would be willing to undergo <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> even if the cost of analysis was not covered by healthcare insurance. However, a relatively small proportion of the general public has actually been advized to undergo <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> either by relatives or physicians. Most physicians believe that the regulatory and legal framework that governs <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> services in Greece is rather weak. Interestingly, the vast majority of the general public strongly opposes direct-access <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> and most would prefer referral from a physician than from a pharmacist. Conclusion: Overall, our results provide a critical evaluation of the views of the general public with regard to genetics and <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> services in Greece and should serve as a model for replication in other populations...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} {{considerable}} growth in basic {{knowledge and understanding}} of how genes are influencing response to exercise training and predisposition to injuries and chronic diseases. On the basis of this knowledge, clinical <b>genetic</b> <b>tests</b> may in the future allow the personalization and optimization of physical activity, thus providing an avenue for increased efficiency of exercise prescription for health and disease. Results: This review provides an overview of the current status of <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> for the purposes of exercise prescription and injury prevention. As such {{there are a variety of}} potential uses for <b>genetic</b> <b>testing,</b> including identification of risks associated with participation in sport and understanding individual response to particular types of exercise. However, there are many challenges remaining before <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> has evidence-based practical applications; including adoption of international standards for genomics research, as well as resistance against the agendas driven by direct to consumer <b>genetic</b> <b>testing</b> companies.
