40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} of waters from the main collector {{in the city of}} Zagreb show that the water is loaded with industrial and municipal wastes. For the purpose of protection of underground and surface waters in that region, these waters {{should not be allowed to}} flow into the receptor of the river Sava, without being purified beforehand. In addition to the great organic and inorganic load of the collector waters, there were 70 species of algae found, that had their origin probably in brook-waters of Zagrebačka gora. However, there was a smaller number of algae (5 — 15) that are otherwise relatively frequent in the collector water. The number of algae found in the water after the reception of the OKI — waste waters was considerably decreased too. It was established furthermore that the microflora in the collector water was very active in the process of mineralisation of waste organic matter, especially in the summer period. That property of microflora is used by OKI to obtain activated sludge in the tank for aeration and <b>dephenolisation.</b> These investigations will be continued, with a view to getting as reliable a test as possible, for establishing deleterious influence of industrial waste waters on algae and other organisms in receptors. At the same time, such and similar investigations point at the necessity of including biologists into the laboratory control of industrial cooling- and waste-waters, and the control of technological processes in biological purification of waste waters...|$|E
40|$|Waste-generating {{industrialisation}} {{is intrinsically}} associated with population and economic proliferation. This places considerable emphasis on South Africa's water shortage {{due to the}} integral relationship between population growth rate and infrastructure development. Of {{the various types of}} industry-generated effluents, those containing organic pollutants such as phenols are generally difficult to remediate. Much work has been reported in the literature on the use of enzymes for the removal of phenols from these waste-streams but little application of this bioremediation approach has reached practical fruition. This study focuses on integrating and synergistically combining the advantages of enzyme-mediated <b>dephenolisation</b> of synthetic and industrial effluent with that of membrane teclmology. The ability of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase to convert phenol and a number of its derivatives to chemically reactive o-quinones has been reported extensively in the literature. These o-quinones can then physically be removed from solution using various precipitation or adsorption techniques. The enzyme is, however, plagued by a product-induced phenomenon known as suicide inactivation, which renders it inactive and thus limits its application as a bioremediation tool. Integrating membrane technology with the enzyme's catalytic ability by immobilising polyphenol oxidase onto polysulphone and poly(ether sulphone) capillary membranes enabled the physical removal of these inhibitory products from the micro-environment of the immobilised enzyme which therefore increased the phenol conversion capability of the immobilised biocatalyst. Under non-immobilised conditions it was found that when exposed to a mixture of various phenols the substrate preference of the enzyme {{is a function of the}} R-group. Under immobilised conditions, however, the substrate preference of the enzyme becomes a function of certain transport constraints imposed by the capillary membrane itself. Furthermore, by integrating a quinone-removal process in the enzyme-immobilised bioreactor configuration, a 21 -fold increase in the amount of substrate converted per Unit enzyme was observed when compared to the conversion capacity of the inunobilised enzyme without the product removal step. Comparisons were also made using different membrane bioreactor configurations (orientating the capillaries transverse as opposed to parallel to the module axis) and different immobilisation matrices (poly(ether sulphone) and polysulphone capillary membranes). Conversion efficiencies as high as 77 % were maintained for several hours using the combination of transverse-flow modules and novel polysulphone capillary membranes. It was therefore concluded that immobilisation of polyphenol oxidase on capillary membranes does indeed show considerable potential for future development...|$|E
