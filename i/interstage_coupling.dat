25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, <b>interstage</b> <b>coupling</b> capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|Attached to the {{cylindrical}} ballistic {{case was}} a natural-uranium liner, the radiation case. The SHRIMP design used an approximately 2.5cm thick uranium radiation case. Its internal surface was lined with ~240 μm thick copper liner made from 0.08 μm thick copper foil, due to copper possessing excellent reflecting properties, increasing the overall albedo of the hohlraum. Hohlraum albedo {{is a very important}} design parameter for any inertial-confinement configuration. A relatively high albedo permits higher <b>interstage</b> <b>coupling</b> due to the more favorable azimuthal and latitudinal angles of reflected radiation. The limiting value of the albedo for high-Z materials is reached when the thickness is 5–10 g/cm, or 0.5–1.0 free paths. Thus, a hohlraum made of uranium much thicker than a free path of uranium would be disadvantageous in terms of bomb weight and use of raw materials. At the same time the angular anisotropy increases as the atomic number of the scatterer material is reduced. Thus the use of copper, or in other devices of gold or aluminium, as hohlraum liners is imperative as the greater the value of Z of the scatterer the greater this absorption probability will be. There are 2 sources of X-rays in the hohlraum; primary's irradiance which is dominant at the beginning and during the pulse rise and the wall which is important during the required radiation temperature's (T) plateau. The primary emits radiation {{in a manner similar to}} a flash bulb, and the secondary needs constant T to properly implode. This constant wall temperature is dictated by the ablation pressure requirements to drive compression which lay on average at about 0.4 keV (out of a range of 0.2 to 2 keV) corresponding to several thousand kelvins. Wall temperature depended on the temperature of the primary's core which peaked at about 5.4 keV during boosted-fission. The final wall-temperature, which corresponds to energy of the wall-reradiated X-rays to the secondary's pusher, also drops due to losses from the hohlraum material itself. Natural uranium nails, lined to the top of their head with copper, attached the radiation case to the ballistic case. The nails were bolted in vertical arrays in a double-shear configuration to better distribute the shear loads. This method of attaching the radiation case to the ballistic case was first used successfully in the Ivy Mike device. The radiation case had a parabolic end, which housed the COBRA primary that was employed to create the conditions needed to start the fusion reaction, and its other end was a cylinder, as also seen in Bravo's declassified film.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s, {{commercial}} IF filters {{looked very}} similar to 1920s audio <b>interstage</b> <b>coupling</b> transformers, had very similar construction and were wired up in an almost identical manner, {{and so they were}} referred to as [...] "IF transformers".

Modern receivers typically use a mixture of ceramic resonator or SAW (surface-acoustic wave) resonators as well as traditional tuned-inductor IF transformers.|$|E
50|$|Another {{consequence}} {{is that since}} the output of one stage is often at ~100 V offset from the input of the next stage, direct coupling is normally not possible and stages need to be coupled using a capacitor or transformer. Capacitors have {{little effect on the}} performance of amplifiers. <b>Interstage</b> transformer <b>coupling</b> is a source of distortion and phase shift, and was avoided from the 1940s for high-quality applications; transformers also add cost, bulk, and weight.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{types of}} {{parasitic}} oscillation {{are caused by}} small interelectrode capacitances (parasitic capacitance) or mutual inductance between adjacent wires or electronic components on the circuit board, which create an inadvertent feedback path. However these usually cause oscillations of high frequency, at {{the upper end of}} or above the passband of the equipment. This is because the phase shift of the small reactances in the feedback path, which increases with frequency, only become significant at high frequencies. Low frequency oscillations like motorboating indicate that some device or circuit with a large time constant is involved, such as the <b>interstage</b> <b>coupling</b> capacitors [...] or transformers, or the filter capacitors and supply transformer winding.|$|E
50|$|Several {{measures}} {{are used to}} prevent parasitic oscillation. Amplifier circuits are laid out so that input and output wiring are not adjacent, preventing capacitive or inductive coupling. A metal shield may be placed over sensitive portions of the circuit. Bypass capacitors may be put at power supply connections, to provide a low-impedance path for AC signals and prevent <b>interstage</b> <b>coupling</b> through the power supply. Where printed circuit boards are used, high- and low-power stages are separated and ground return traces are arranged so that heavy currents don't flow in mutually shared portions of the ground trace. In some cases the problem may only be solved by introduction of another feedback neutralization network, calculated and adjusted to eliminate the negative feedback within the passband of the amplifying device.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} original method for dynamical analysis of multistage cyclic structures such as turbomachinery compressors or turbines. Each stage is modeled cyclically by its elementary sector and the <b>interstage</b> <b>coupling</b> is achieved through a cyclic recombination of the interface degrees of freedom.

The method is first validated on a simple case study which shows good agreements with a complete 360 deg reference calculation. An industrial example involving two HP compressor stages is then presented. Then the forced response application is presented in which synchronous engine order type excitations are considered...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{completion}} of preliminary {{tests on the}} satisfactory operation of the Vibrating Reed Electrometer as a sensitive indication of alpha activity at the cathode of a plating cell, attention was directed toward {{the study of the}} detection of activity at the anode of the cell. Group 3 anticipates a lengthy study of cathodic and anodic deposition potentials of radioactive elements in solution. With the standard Research Plating Control, cathodic studies could be accomplished with relative ease, but the study of anodic deposition could only be done in an exploratory manner. This would provide meager information and lengthen the study considerably. To overcome the above objections, it was decided to modify the plating control so that it would provide linear control of the anode-solution potential. Study of the problem indicated that two simple changes were necessary; namely the reversal of current through the plating cell (since the anode instead of the cathode would be at ground potential) and the addition of a phase inverter in the amplifier circuit of the plating control to supply the control tube with a voltage change of the proper phase. Several tests made by Group 3 indicate that the use of the modified plating control will be satisfactory. Measurements of the three shielded rooms in the ``E`` Building have been completed. One scaler-multiplier EL- 251, has been completed. First tests indicated that most of the scaling stages were scaling through when operated by the output of an Instrument Development Laboratory Model 162 scaler, apparently due to <b>interstage</b> <b>coupling</b> by way of the leads to the ``scale selector`` switch of the scaler. Work continues on the mechanical portion of the motor-driven slide wire. The gear box, providing three changes of speed (approximately 103, 1 - 9, and 1 - 27) worked well on the dry run test, but when loaded, would not operate...|$|E
