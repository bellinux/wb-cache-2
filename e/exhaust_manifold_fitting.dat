The volumetric efficiency of the engine can be increased by reducing the backpressure in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold.</b> This work analyzes the flow through two different models of <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> using CFD. The design of <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> is modified to get optimal geometry. The analysis results of two models are compared for back pressure. By comparing the results of two models the decrease in back pressure is found which ensure improvement in volumetric efficiency of the engine...|$|R

40|$|In {{turbocharged}} engines with wastegate {{the exhaust}} pressure can change rapidly. Two methods {{to estimate the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure are compared for diagnosis of wastegate and turbocharger of a spark-ignited engine. One relies on the {{first law of thermodynamics}} and produces changes in <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure. The second uses a model of the mass of remaining exhaust gases in the cylinder and results in absolute estimations of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure. They does not require any extra sensors in the exhaust system after the calibration. Estimates of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure relies on information from an air-to-cylinder observer and a static map. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure estimators are compared using a series of wastegate steps on a turbocharged SAAB 2 : 3 dm 3 SI-engine. The comparison showed that the method based on the first law of thermodynamics was best suited for diagnosis purposes since it was least sensitive to model errors.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>Exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> in {{the engines}} is an {{important}} component which has a considerable effect on the performance of the I. C engine. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> operates under high temperature and pressure conditions. Their design usually has to be performed by trial and error through many experiments and analyses. Therefore, an automated design optimization would reduce technical, schedule, and cost risks for new engine developments. This paper deals with the various factors that are to be considered {{in the design of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold.</b> It tries to explain the effect of various factors during the Finite Element Analysis...|$|R

40|$|Copyright c ○ 2004 SAE International Mean value {{cylinder}} {{air charge}} (CAC) estimation models for control and diagnosis are investigated on turbocharged SI-engines. Two topics are studied; Firstly CAC changes due to fuel enrichment and secondly CAC sensitivity to <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure changes. The {{objective is to}} find a CAC model suitable for control and diagnosis. Measurements show that CAC models based on volumetric efficiency gives up to 10 % error during fuel enrichment. The error is caused by the cooling effect that the fuel has as it evaporates and thus increases the charge density. To better describe the CAC during fuel enrichment a simple one parameter model is proposed which reduces the CAC estimation error on experimental data from 10 % to 3 %. With active wastegate control, the pressure changes in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> influences the CAC. The magnitude of this influence is investigated using sensitivity analysis on an <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure dependent CACmodel. From the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded, that the CAC is most sensitive to <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure changes for low intake manifold pressures (part load). Without taking the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure into account the CAC error is approximately 5 % when the wastegate is opened at part load. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure dependent CAC model is then augmented with the charge cooling model and the total model gives precise agreement on experimental data. The resulting model is thus highly suitable for CAC estimation for control and diagnosis of turbocharged SI-engines...|$|R
