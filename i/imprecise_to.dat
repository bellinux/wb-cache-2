2500|$|The large {{majority}} of Mexicans have historically been classified as [...] "Mestizos". In modern Mexican usage, the term mestizo is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity {{it was during the}} colonial era, resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes being classified under the same identity, regardless of wheter they are of mixed ancestry or not. Since the term carries a variety of different socio-cultural, economic, racial and biological meanings, it was deemed too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> be used for ethnic classification, thus it was abandoned by the government and is not in wide use in Mexican society, although it's often used in literature about Mexican social identities and on intellectual circles. In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo has historically had a different meaning, being used to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the Caste War of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos. In Chiapas the word [...] "Ladino" [...] is used instead of mestizo. According to Encyclopædia Britannica racially Mestizo Mexicans make up 50% to 67% of the country's population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It is {{valuable}} in engineering design {{to distinguish between}} {{two different types of}} uncertainty: inherent variability and imprecision. While variability is naturally random behavior in a physical process or property, imprecision is uncertainty that is {{due to a lack of}} knowledge or information. There are many sources of imprecision in design. Sequential decision making introduces imprecision because the results of future decisions are unknown. Statistical data from finite samples of environmental factors are inherently imprecise. Bounded rationality leads <b>to</b> <b>imprecise</b> subjective probabilities. Expert opinions and judgments often are <b>imprecise</b> due <b>to</b> a lack of information or conflict. Behavioral simulations and analysis models are imprecise abstractions of reality. Knowledge of a decision maker’s preferences may be <b>imprecise</b> due <b>to</b> bounded rationality or other constraints. Consequently, the engineering design community needs efficient computational methods for interval data and imprecise probabilities in order to support decision making in the design process.

A southern boundary can be discerned by drawing a crude line from the southerly intersection of Bellona Avenue and Charles to the intersection of West Lake Avenue and Falls.|$|E

In practice, these are no longer the most accurate methods. The CODATA value quoted here is based on three watt-balance measurements of KJ2RK and one inter-laboratory determination of the molar volume of silicon, but is mostly determined by a 2007 watt-balance measurement made at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Five other measurements by three different methods were initially considered, but not included in the final refinement as they were too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> affect the result.|$|E

One German source reported that the assault stuck fast on the Wavre-Gembloux road with only one battalion at first reaching the railway, followed immediately by a French tank and infantry counterattack against which German anti-tank guns had little effect.

5000|$|All {{three models}} {{predicted}} {{an increase of}} the electron mass if their velocities are approaching the speed of light. The Bucherer-Langevin model was quickly abandoned, so some experimentalists tried to distinguish between Abraham's theory and the Lorentz-Einstein theory by experiment. This was done by Walter Kaufmann (1901-1905) who believed that his experiments confirmed Abraham's theory, and disproved the Lorentz-Einstein theory. But in 1908 Bucherer conducted some experiments as well, and obtained results which seem to confirm the Lorentz-Einstein theory and the principle of relativity. With exceptions like Adolf Bestelmeyer with whom Bucherer had a polemical dispute, Bucherer's experiments were regarded as decisive. But it was shown in 1938 that all those experiments of Kaufmann, Bucherer, Neumann etc. showed only a qualitative increase in mass, but were too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between the different models. This lasted until 1940, when similar experimental equipments were sufficiently accurate to confirm the Lorentz-Einstein formula, [...] see Kaufmann-Bucherer-Neumann experiments and Tests of relativistic energy and momentum.|$|E

However, references in this regard are too brief and <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> clearly identify the various ethnic groups or their specific characteristics. The names of locations and of the chiefs are also problematic, since they sometimes use two or more names for the same place or person, or the same name for a place and a chieftain.
