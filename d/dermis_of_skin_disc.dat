High levels of carbonyl residues were consistently detected in the dermis and never in the epidermis of sections <b>of</b> these <b>skin</b> biopsy samples. The <b>dermis</b> <b>of</b> psoriatic <b>skin</b> without lesions had a higher level of carbonylation than the <b>dermis</b> <b>of</b> normal <b>skin.</b> In this study, we found that there was more oxidative damage in cultured fibroblasts prepared from skin with and without lesions from psoriasis patients than in normal fibroblasts from the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> age-matched controls. The extent of protein carbonylation in cell extracts was determined by immunoblotting, using an antidinitrophenylhydrazone antibody, and in intact cells was determined by immunocytochemical analysis with the same antibody. The higher level of carbonylation detected was used here as a measure of oxidative stress, and showed that some oxidative damage occurred before the appearance of typical psoriatic plaques. These results suggest that fibroblasts are affected before the onset of psoriasis and that this damage is independent of any inflammatory infiltrate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor 3 -dimensional (3 D) imaging of a tissue, 3 methodological {{steps are}} {{essential}} and their successful application depends on specific {{characteristics of the}} type of tissue. The steps are 1 ° clearing of the opaque tissue to render it transparent for microscopy, 2 ° fluorescence labeling of the tissues and 3 ° 3 D imaging. In the past decades, new methodologies were introduced for the clearing steps with their specific advantages and disadvantages. Most clearing techniques have been applied to the central nervous system and other organs that contain relatively low amounts of connective tissue including extracellular matrix. However, tissues that contain large amounts of extracellular matrix such as dermis in skin or gingiva are difficult to clear. The present survey lists methodologies that are available for clearing of tissues for 3 D imaging. We report here that the BABB method using a mixture of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate and iDISCO using dibenzylether (DBE) are the most successful methods for clearing connective tissue-rich gingiva and <b>dermis</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> for 3 D histochemistry and imaging of fluorescence using light-sheet microscopy...|$|R

40|$|Our {{previous}} study demonstrated formation of T cell-dendritic cell (DC) clusters in inflamed <b>dermis</b> <b>of</b> intraorally autotransplanted <b>skin</b> flaps. Such T cell-DC clusters {{are supposed to}} be important for close interactions between T cells and DCs including the specific antigen presentation. Here we show the involvement of the macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL 22) and its specific receptor CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR 4) in the formation of T cell-DC clusters. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed high levels of mRNA expression for MDC and CCR 4 in inflamed skin and neck lymph nodes (LNs), but not in normal skin. Immunohistochemically, MDC+ cells and CCR 4 + cells were mainly located within the T cell-DC clusters both in the <b>dermis</b> <b>of</b> inflamed <b>skin</b> and the T cell area of LNs. MDC+ cells were identified to be DCs both in inflamed skin and LNs. The majority of CCR 4 + cells were CD 4 + T cells, accounting for approximately one-third of total CD 4 + T cells in the inflamed skin.

In this study, we investigated the expression and significance of S 100 A 4 in psoriasis. We found significant upregulation of S 100 A 4 in the <b>dermis</b> <b>of</b> psoriatic <b>skin</b> compared with normal <b>skin.</b> This pattern <b>of</b> S 100 A 4 expression differs considerably from that of other S 100 proteins, S 100 A 7 and S 100 A 8 / 9, with predominant expression in the epidermis of psoriasis. Furthermore, we revealed a massive release of the biologically active forms of S 100 A 4 from psoriatic skin. Interestingly, we found stabilization (increase) of p 53 in the basal layer of epidermis {{in close proximity to}} cells expressing S 100 A 4. To examine the possible implication of S 100 A 4 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we analyzed the effect of S 100 A 4 blocking antibodies in a human psoriasis xenograft SCID mouse model and observed a significant reduction of the epidermal thickness and impairment in cell proliferation and dermal vascularization.

40|$|Type VI {{collagen}} is a nonfibrillar collagen {{expressed in}} many connective tissues and implicated in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. We hypothesized that type VI collagen regulates matrix assembly and cell function within the <b>dermis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>skin.</b> In {{the present study}} we examined the expression pattern of type VI collagen in normal and wounded skin and investigated its specific function in new matrix deposition by human dermal fibroblasts. Type VI collagen was expressed throughout the <b>dermis</b> <b>of</b> intact human <b>skin,</b> at the expanding margins of human keloid samples, and in the granulation tissue of newly deposited ECM in a mouse model of wound healing. Generation of cell-derived matrices (CDMs) by human dermal fibroblasts with stable knockdown of COL 6 A 1 revealed that type VI collagen-deficient matrices were significantly thinner and contained more aligned, thicker, and widely spaced fibers than CDMs produced by normal fibroblasts. In addition, there was significantly less total collagen and sulfated proteoglycans present in the type VI collagen-depleted matrices. Normal fibroblasts cultured on de-cellularized CDMs lacking type VI collagen displayed increased cell spreading, migration speed, and persistence. Taken together, these findings indicate that type VI collagen is a key regulator of dermal matrix assembly, composition, and fibroblast behavior and may {{play an important role}} in wound healing and tissue regeneration...|$|R
