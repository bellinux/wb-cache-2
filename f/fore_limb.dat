500|$|With {{multiple}} well-preserved skeletons, S. stenops preserves {{all regions}} of the body, including the limbs. The scapula (shoulder blade) is sub-rectangular, with a robust blade. Though {{it is not always}} perfectly preserved, the acromion ridge is slightly larger than in Kentrosaurus. The blade is relatively straight, although it curves towards the back. There is a small bump {{on the back of the}} blade, that would have served as the base of the triceps muscle. Articulated with the scapula, the coracoid is sub-circular. The hind feet each had three short toes, while each fore foot had five toes; only the inner two toes had a blunt hoof. The phalangeal formula is 2-2-2-2-1, meaning the innermost finger of the <b>fore</b> <b>limb</b> has two bones, the next has two, etc. All four limbs were supported by pads behind the toes. The fore limbs were much shorter than the stocky hind limbs, which resulted in an unusual posture. The tail appears to have been held well clear of the ground, while the head of Stegosaurus was positioned relatively low down, probably no higher than [...] above the ground.|$|E

60|$|Section 133. There {{are eight}} {{cervical}} (spinal) nerves, {{one in front}} of the atlas, and one behind each of the cervical vertebrae. The last four and the first thoracic (spinal) contribute to a leash of nerves running out to the <b>fore</b> <b>limb,</b> the brachial plexus (plexus, literally network, but here meaning a plaited cord). The fourth cervical also sends down a phrenic nerve (p.n., Figure 1), along by the external jugular vein and the superior caval vein to the diaphragm.

60|$|The {{evidence}} of the descent of man from some lower form, collected and marshalled together by Darwin, consists chiefly of minute inferential proofs which hardly admit of deliberate condensation. In his bodily structure man is formed on the same underlying type or model as all the other mammals, bone answering throughout to bone, as, for example, in the <b>fore</b> <b>limb,</b> where homologous parts have been modified in the dog into toes, in the bat into wing-supports, in the seal into flippers, and in man himself into fingers and thumb, while still retaining in every case their essential fundamental likeness of construction. Even the brain of man resembles closely the brain of the higher monkeys; the differences which separate him in this respect from the orang or the gorilla are far slighter than the differences which separate those apes themselves from the inferior monkeys. Indeed, as Huxley conclusively showed, on anatomical grounds alone, man must be classed in the order Primates as only one among the many divergent forms which that order includes within its wide limits.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} species was the difference in size between the <b>fore</b> and hind <b>limbs.</b> Its <b>fore</b> <b>limbs</b> were quite delicate with bones weighing 1 gram, while its hind limbs are large with bones weighing 12 grams. This difference is related to saltation. Other characteristics related to hopping locomotion include a long, but rather thin tail.|$|R

60|$|Section 46. The {{distribution}} of the veins of the rabbit has only a superficial parallelism with arteries. The chief factors of vena cava inferior are the hepatic vein (h.v.), which receives the liver blood, the renal veins (r.v.), from the kidneys, the ilaeo-lumbar, from the abdominal wall, and the external (e.il.v.) and internal ilias (i.il.v.); {{with the exception of}} the renal veins none of these run side by side with arteries. The superior cavae (r. and l.v.c.s.) are formed by the union of internal (i.j.) and external jugular (e.j.) veins with a subclavian (s.cl.v.) from the <b>fore</b> <b>limb.</b> The term pre-caval vein is sometimes used for superior cava. The attention, of the student is called to the small azygos vein (az.) running into the right vena cava superior, and forming the only asymmetrical (not-balancing) feature of the veins in front of the heart; it brings blood back from the ribs of the thorax wall, and is of interest mainly because it answers to an enormous main vessel, the right post-cardinal sinus, in fishes. There are spermatic arteries and veins (s.v. and a.) to the genital organs. All these vessels should be patiently dissected out by the student, and drawn.|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} this desideratum is very nearly, if not quite, {{supplied}} by Plagiolophus, remains of which occur abundantly {{in some parts of}} the Upper and Middle Eocene formations. The patterns of the grinding-teeth of Plagiolophus are similar to those of Anchitherium, and their crowns are as thinly covered with cement; but the grinders diminish in size forwards, and the last lower molar has a large hind lobe, convex outwards and concave inwards, as in Palceotherium. The ulna is complete and much larger than in any of the Equidae, while it is more slender than in most of the true Palaeotheria; it is fixedly united, but not ankylosed, with the radius. There are three toes in the <b>fore</b> <b>limb,</b> the outer ones being slender, but less attenuated than in the Equidae. The femur is more like that of the Palaeotheria than that of the horse, and has only a small depression above its outer condyle in the place of the great fossa which is so obvious in the Equidae. The fibula is distinct, but very slender, and its distal end is ankylosed with the tibia. There are three toes on the hind foot having similar proportions to those on the fore foot. The principal metacarpal and metatarsal bones are flatter than they are in any of the Equidae; and the metacarpal bones are longer than the metatarsals, as in the Palaeotheria.|$|E
60|$|In some of {{the lower}} Quadrumana, in the Lemuridae and Carnivora, {{as well as in}} many marsupials, there is a passage near {{the lower end of the}} humerus, called the supra-condyloid foramen, through which the great nerve of the <b>fore</b> <b>limb</b> and often the great artery pass. Now in the humerus of man, there is {{generally}} a trace of this passage, which is sometimes fairly well developed, being formed by a depending hook-like process of bone, completed by a band of ligament. Dr. Struthers (49. With respect to inheritance, see Dr. Struthers in the 'Lancet,' Feb. 15, 1873, and another important paper, ibid. Jan. 24, 1863, p. 83. Dr. Knox, as I am informed, was the first anatomist who drew attention to this peculiar structure in man; see his 'Great Artists and Anatomists,' p. 63. See also an important memoir on this process by Dr. Gruber, in the 'Bulletin de l'Acad. Imp. de St. Petersbourg,' tom. xii. 1867, p. 448.), who has closely attended to the subject, has now shewn that this peculiarity is sometimes inherited, as it has occurred in a father, and in no less than four out of his seven children. When present, the great nerve invariably passes through it; and this clearly indicates that it is the homologue and rudiment of the supra-condyloid foramen of the lower animals. Prof. Turner estimates, as he informs me, that it occurs in about one per cent. of recent skeletons. But if the occasional development of this structure in man is, as seems probable, due to reversion, it is a return to a very ancient state of things, because in the higher Quadrumana it is absent.|$|E
50|$|With a few exceptions, salamandrids have {{patterns}} of bright and contrasting colours. They have four well-developed limbs, with four toes on the <b>fore</b> <b>limbs,</b> and (in most cases) five toes on the hind limbs. They vary from 7 to 30 cm in length.|$|R
5000|$|Commonly {{known as}} [...] "toe biter", L. americanus may deliver a painful bite if handled or disturbed. However, it prefers to avoid humans rather than engage them {{whenever}} possible. If disturbed in the water, {{the speed of}} L. americanus allows it to quickly break away while its natural camouflage easily conceals it. Even if agitated on dry land, L. americanus will first attempt to escape or play dead before raising its <b>fore</b> <b>limbs</b> and hind quarters in what resembles a fighting stance. If agitation continues, L. americanus will use its <b>fore</b> <b>limbs</b> to latch onto {{the source of the}} agitation and attempt to deliver a painful bite. Also known as the [...] "electric-light bug", it may be attracted by electric lights while flying at night.|$|R
50|$|In most respects, {{however, the}} potoroids {{are similar to}} small wallabies. Their hind feet are elongated, and they move by hopping, {{although}} the adaptations are not as extreme {{as they are in}} true wallabies, and, like rabbits, they often use their <b>fore</b> <b>limbs</b> to move about at slower speeds.|$|R
60|$|In the Quadrumana {{and some}} other orders of mammals, {{especially}} in the Carnivora, there is a passage near {{the lower end of}} the humerus, called the supra-condyloid foramen, through which the great nerve of the <b>fore</b> <b>limb</b> passes, and often the great artery. Now in the humerus of man, as Dr. Struthers[39] and others have shewn, there is generally a trace of this passage, and it is sometimes fairly well developed, being formed by a depending hook-like process of bone, completed by a band of ligament. When present the great nerve invariably passes through it, and this clearly indicates that it is the homologue and rudiment of the supra-condyloid foramen of the lower animals. Prof. Turner estimates, as he informs me, that it occurs in about one per cent. of recent skeletons; but during ancient times it appears to have been much more common. Mr. Busk[40] has collected the following evidence on this head: Prof. Broca “noticed the perforation in four and a half per cent. of the arm-bones collected in the ‘Cimetière du Sud’ at Paris; and in the Grotto of Orrony, the contents of which are referred to the Bronze period, as many as eight humeri out of thirty-two were perforated; but this extraordinary proportion, he thinks, might be due to the cavern having been a sort of ‘family vault.’ Again, M. Dupont found 30 per cent. of perforated bones in the caves of the Valley of the Lesse, belonging to the Reindeer period; whilst M. Leguay, in a sort of dolmen at Argenteuil, observed twenty-five per cent. to be perforated; and M. Pruner-Bey found twenty-six per cent. in the same condition in bones from Vauréal. Nor should it be left unnoticed that M. Pruner-Bey states that this condition is common in Guanche skeletons.” The fact that ancient races, in this and several other cases, more frequently present structures which resemble those of the lower animals than do the modern races, is interesting. One chief cause seems to be that ancient races stand somewhat nearer than modern races in the long line of descent to their remote animal-like progenitors.|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} of those animals which may be {{bisected}} or chopped into pieces, and of which every fragment will reproduce the whole, the power of regrowth must be diffused throughout the whole body. Nevertheless {{there seems to be}} much truth in the view maintained by Prof. Lessona (27/23. 'Atti della Soc. Ital. di Sc. Nat.' volume 11 1869 page 493.), that this capacity is generally a localised and special one, serving to replace parts which are eminently liable to be lost in each particular animal. The most striking case in favour of this view, is that the terrestrial salamander, according to Lessona, cannot reproduce lost parts, whilst another species of the same genus, the aquatic salamander, has extraordinary powers of regrowth, as we have just seen; and this animal is eminently liable to have its limbs, tail, eyes and jaws bitten off by other tritons. (27/24. Lessona states that this is so in the paper just referred to. See also 'The American Naturalist' September 1871 page 579.) Even with the aquatic salamander the capacity is to a certain extent localised, for when M. Philipeaux (27/25. 'Comptes Rendus' October 1, 1866 and June 1867.) extirpated the entire <b>fore</b> <b>limb</b> together with the scapula, the power of regrowth was completely lost. It is also a remarkable fact, standing in opposition to a very general rule, that the young of the aquatic salamander do not possess the power of repairing their limbs in an equal degree with the adults (27/26. Bonnet 'Oeuvres Hist. Nat.' volume 5 page 294, as quoted by Prof. Rolleston in his remarkable address to the 36th annual meeting of the British Medical Association.) but I do not know that they are more active, or can otherwise better escape the loss of their limbs, than the adults. The walking-stick insect, Diapheromera femorata, like other insects of the same order, can reproduce its legs in the mature state, and these from their great length must be liable to be lost: but the capacity is localised (as in {{the case of}} the salamander), for Dr. Scudder found (27/27. 'Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist.' volume 12 1868-69 page 1.), that if the limb was removed within the trochanto-femoral articulation, it was never renewed. When a crab is seized by one of its legs, this is thrown off at the basal joint, being afterwards replaced by a new leg; and it is generally admitted that this is a special provision for the safety of the animal. Lastly, with gasteropod molluscs, which are well known to have the power of reproducing their heads, Lessona shows that they are very liable to have their heads bitten off by fishes; the rest of the body being protected by the shell. Even with plants we see something of the same kind, for non-deciduous leaves and young stems have no power of regrowth, these parts being easily replaced by growth from new buds; whilst the bark and subjacent tissues of the trunks of trees have great power of regrowth, probably on account of their increase in diameter, and of their liability to injury from being gnawed by animals.|$|E
