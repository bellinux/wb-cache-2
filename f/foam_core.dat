25|$|The queen was {{designed}} by Cameron in collaboration with special effects artist Stan Winston, based upon an initial painting Cameron had done {{at the start of}} the project. The Winston Studio created a test <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> queen before constructing the full hydraulic puppet which was used for most of the scenes involving the large Alien. Two people were inside working the twin sets of arms, and puppeteers off-screen worked its jaws and head. Although at the end of the film, the queen was presented full-body fighting the power-loader, the audience never sees the legs of the queen, save those of the small-scale puppet that appears only briefly. In Aliens, Cameron used very selective camera-angles on the queen, using the '' style of photography. Subsequently, the movie won an Oscar for Visual Effects. An adult queen was to reappear in Alien Resurrection. The original mechanical head previously used in Aliens was provided by Bob Burns and was an altered design. It was repainted with a blend of green and brown, giving it a shimmering, insect-like quality. This color concept would be abandoned in Alien vs. Predator in favour of the original black color scheme.|$|E

The results are frequently uneven and unpredictable variations in the structure and properties of semi products and final products. This paper comprises all production processes for metal foams and the most commonly used processes are described. Production of metal foams is continuously developing and in parallel are being developed the utilization methods of metal foams due to their specific properties. All the positive characteristics of metal foams, which make them suitable for the use in a variety of designs and products, are described in this paper. Benefits of using metal foams as a casting core material are clarified. Technologies for producing metal <b>foam</b> <b>cores,</b> positioning of cores and mould designs are presented.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} structures for diverse applications have become {{of great interest}} for scientists and engineers thanks to the advantages that they may offer in comparison to conventional materials. In the case of sandwich {{composite structures}}, its mechanical properties can be tailored according to the necessities through the correct selection of a core and facesheets. In combination, this 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 material will have superior properties compared to traditional materials such as steel and aluminum.

This thesis describes the process of exposing two distinct types of <b>foam</b> <b>cores</b> under arctic conditioning (- 60 °C) and sea water exposure in order to analyze the impact that this type of environment may have in the mechanical response of the <b>foam</b> <b>cores.</b> Polyvinyl Chloride <b>foams</b> <b>cores</b> were condition under sea water, arctic temperatures, and in combination in order to analyze its compressive response. Epoxy/Cenosphere syntactic foams were subjected to arctic temperatures followed by compression and flexural tests.

50|$|For in-situ bonded face sheets {{the core}} is {{closed-cell}} foam. The goal of in-situ bonding {{is to create}} a metallic bonding between the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> and face sheets. This is achieved in three ways. A foamable precursor is expanded between two face sheets. When the liquid foam comes in contact with the solid face sheets a metallic bond is established. This is difficult to realize as the oxidation of both aluminium face sheets and foam prevent forming a sound bonding. There is also a risk of melting the face sheets. This procedure is successful when steel is used as face sheets instead of aluminium, while the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> is aluminium.|$|E

As far as the metal foam, Alporas, is concerned, multi-axial tension and compression data is required. This includes large scale crush and tensile rupture. An Arcan test fixture was developed, in which a sample of foam can be subject to tensile and shear deformation simultaneously. The data was also used to calibrate the crushable foam material model in LS-DYNA. For the skin, tensile and compression data was generated for a cross ply glass fibre thermoplastic laminate. The data was then used to calibrate the composite damage material model in LS-DYNA.
