Similar simulations of edge transport barriers, including the L-H transition have also been made. However, here only polodal momentum and the temperatures were simulated. The internal barrier included an anomalous spinup of poloidal momentum similar to that in the experiment. Also the edge barrier was accompanied by a spinup of poloidal momentum. The experimental density (with no barrier) was used and kept fixed for the internal barrier.

Two surface plasmon-polariton resonances are identified in the reflection spectrum of bare silver grooves, with the intensity of one resonance being localized {{near the bottom of}} the groove and that of the other resonance being distributed throughout the entire groove. The linear response of the hybrid silver-emitter system is thoroughly analyzed by considering the coupling between surface plasmon polaritons and emitters as the geometry of the grooves and the spatial distribution of emitters within the grooves are varied. The nonlinear response of the system is also considered by pumping the emitters with a short, high-intensity pulse.

By using an array of multiple sources, we hope to create a uniform plasma of arbitrary size for processing flat-panel displays. The dc magnetic field B that helicons require can hopefully be supplied by permanent magnets, thus avoiding the cost and complexity of large electromagnetic coils. The size, shape, and placement of each source will be optimized, as well as the antenna and rf frequency. 1. Source design: Previously [1] we have shown that an array of seven stubby tubes can cover a 400 -mm substrate uniformly with density up to 10 12 cm- 3. The shorttube effect has been explained by constructive interference from the wave reflected at the back. To optimize this effect at low B-fields we use the HELIC code developed by D. Arnush [2].

40|$|Arteriovenous access ischaemic steal (AVAIS) is {{a serious}} and not {{infrequent}} complication of vascular access. Pathophysiology is key to diagnosis, investigation and management. Ischaemia distal to an AV access is due to multiple factors.

Multiple treatment modalities have been described and their use should be directed by appropriate assessment, investigation and treatment of the underlying pathophysiology. Comparison of treatment options is difficult as published studies are heavily biased. Whilst no single technique is suitable for all cases of AVAIS there are some that suit particular scenarios and mild AVAIS may benefit from observation whilst more severe steal mandates surgical intervention...|$|E

The study includes PIV-measurements in the vicinity of the slat and the leading edge of the main-wing, surface pressure and far-field pressure measurements at the suction and pressure side of the model. A detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in [1]. The free stream velocity and angle of attack <b>is</b> <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> can be shown, that the intensity of the tonal components in the far field spectrum varies with both parameters. The study presented here is focused on the application of the so called âcausality correlationâ method.

Parts of the correlation results are presented in [1, 2], comparing the spatial and temporal distribution of the correlation coefficients for different angles of attack. In these papers significant correlation coefficients are observed between the far-field pressure signals and the flow structures in the slat region of the high-lift configuration. The temporal and spatial distribution of the coefficients depends strongly on the angle of attack.

40|$|The {{behavior}} and resistance of structural components subjected to impulsive type loads is investigated. An increased insight into dynamic buckling {{is achieved by}} performing a literature study, together with analyses on beam-columns and plates. The analyses are done in the programs USFOS and ABAQUS. The literature study defines two forms of dynamic buckling; vibration buckling and pulse buckling. The thesis' main focus is dynamic buckling of beam-columns and plates. This {{can be related to}} slamming loads on ships or collisions between ships and offshore rigs. To be able to describe dynamic buckling properly, a theoretic foundation is created. The basic equations established by (Lindberg and Florence, 1987) are derived, as well as a mathematical description of dynamic buckling. The derivation show some of the basic features of pulse buckling for an axially loaded bar. Different parameters effect on dynamic buckling loads are also investigated. These parameters are load duration, shape and magnitude of initial imperfections, material choice and reduced slenderness. The dynamic loading factor is also included in the study. It is shown that the dynamic loading factor may drop below unity for loading durations close to the natural period of the component. The parameters effect on the buckling loads is shown to be significant, and is therefore further investigated in the analysis. An axially loaded beam-column is analyzed in USFOS. Steel is the material of choice. The beam-column contains initial geometrical imperfections compatible with the three first buckling modes. By varying the loading rate, the transition from one buckling mode to a higher mode is investigated. The effect of changing the magnitude of imperfections is also considered, as well as the composition of the imperfections. The reduced slenderness of the beam-column <b>is</b> <b>varied,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is found that the effect of this change on dynamic buckling loads is significant. To investigate the beam-columns behavior in real life, there are performed analyses with using a realistic value for the yield strength. A plate loaded with an edge load is analyzed in ABAQUS. The plate's eigenmodes are found by performing an eigenvalue analysis. The eigenvalues are implemented as initial imperfections. The effect of using different combinations and scaling of the eigenmodes are investigated by considering the change in the dynamic buckling loads. The effect of varying the reduced slenderness is also found, and by varying the loading rate the transition from one buckling mode to a higher mode is investigated. It is found that parameters such as reduced slenderness and scaling of the imperfections have a major influence on the dynamic buckling load. To verify the results from the analysis performed in ABAQUS, analytical results are obtained from (Ekstrom, 1973) and by using MATLAB...|$|E

It is assumed that {{the frequency of the}} supply voltage can <b>be</b> <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> different from the system nominal frequency. The DVR is operated such that it holds the voltage across critical load bus terminals constant at system nominal frequency irrespective of the frequency of the source voltage. In case of a frequency mismatch, the total real power requirement of the critical load bus has to be supplied by the DVR. Proposed method used to compensate for frequency variation, the DC link of the DVR is supplied through an uncontrolled rectifier that provides a path for the real power required by the critical load to flow. A simple frequency estimation technique is discussed which are Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), Kalman Filter and ANN controller.

In {{the first part}} of this study, the chemical composition ratio S/(Cu+Zn+Sn) <b>was</b> <b>varied</b> keeping Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios constant to study the effect of sulfur variation. Detailed electrical and optical characterization has been carried out using UV-visible spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) techniques. The results of the present study confirm that near ideal stoichiometry could be achieved in CZTS by adding excess thiourea in a controlled manner which eliminated the need for an additional step of sulfurization.

The model is planar and incorporates the coupled dynamics of two independently braked wheels and the vehicle body, and {{takes into account}} the slip dynamics of each wheel. By using the wheel slip values and the vehicle speed as dynamic states, it is shown that the qualitative behavior of the system can be completely captured by studying a relatively simple phase plane problem described in terms of the slip values. A systematic bifurcation analysis is carried out in which the brake torques of the two wheels <b>are</b> <b>varied,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> shown how the system transitions from stable braking to the possibility of lockup in one or both wheels, to guaranteed lockup in both wheels.

This analysis provides new insights into the dynamics of vehicle braking, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> provides a correction to the standard result for the critical values of the brake torques at which the wheels undergo lockup.
