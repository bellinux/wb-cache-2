5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> Rules {{were adopted}} by the Committee of Ministers in 1973 (Resolution 73.5). The Prison Rules were reformulated in 1987 (R 87.3). In January 2006, the Committee of Ministers on the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> Rules {{recommended}} that the 1987 version needed “to be substantively revised and updated in order to reflect the developments which have occurred in penal policy, sentencing practice and the overall management of prisons in Europe”. Revisions {{can also be seen}} to reflect the expansion of Council of Europe membership: 15 member states in 1973, 21 in 1987, and 46 by 2005. A new version of the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> Rules was adopted in 2006, replacing all previous versions entirely. [...] The 2006 <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> Rules contain a significantly expanded section on health care in the prison setting. For the first time, they refer specifically to the prison authorities' obligation to safeguard the health of all prisoners (rule 39) and the need for prison medical services to be organized in close relationship with the general public health administration (rule 40).|$|R

Analysis of these studies reveals that the available data are scarce and patchy, with large variations in methodology. This diversity hampers comparison, and may, in part, account for {{the wide range of}} prevalence estimates for drug use and drug injecting, both prior to imprisonment and while in prison.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> Rules {{are based}} on the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. They are not legally binding for member states of the Council of Europe, but provide {{recognised}} standards on good principles and practices in the treatment of detainees and the management of detention facilities. One observer suggests that ‘almost all European countries aim to apply these standards but it is unlikely that a single one has succeeded in applying them fully.’ In 2006 the Quaker Council for European Affairs produced a gender critique of the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> Rules as part of its Women in Prison Project. In recent years the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> Rules have been reported to have formed the basis for complaints against penal services and institutions in Norway and Ireland, and have set officially acknowledged standards for prison reform in Armenia. There are 108 rules in nine parts. Part I (rules 1 to 13) sets out basic principles as well as the scope and application. Part II (rules 14 to 38) covers conditions of imprisonment, including: nutrition, hygiene, access to legal advice, education, contact with the outside world, freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Part III deals with health and health care in prisons. Part IV deals with order and security; Part V Management and staff; Part VI Inspection and monitoring; Part VII Untried prisoners; Part VIII Sentenced prisoners; and Part IX the requirements for updating the Rules.|$|R

Nevertheless it is worth mentioning the legislator main concern regarding the taking care of prisoners, namely with the Prison Reform of 1979 pioneer in the building of the new <b>European</b> <b>prison</b> law. The Law no. 115 / 2009 of 12 th of October currently in force ensures the prisoners’ rights towards the administration by reformulating their legal status and by reinforcing their privileges when serving prison sentence.

There {{is no such thing as}} a single European justice system, let alone a European prosecutor who could enforce European Union law in European trial courts independent of the courts of individual member states. There are no European trial judges who have sworn loyalty to Europe over loyalty to their home countries, and no <b>European</b> <b>prisons.</b> Without its own independent courts and <b>prisons,</b> the <b>European</b> Union's ability to curb corruption in member states is severely limited (especially in contrast to the federal government of the United States).|$|R

The goal of the changes is obvious and contrary to the rule # 8 of the <b>European</b> <b>prison</b> rules, which stipulates that “although obtaining financial profit from {{the operation of the}} enterprises in the correctional facilities can be useful {{from the point of view}} of enhancing standards and quality and expediency of the professional training, the interests of the prisoners should not be subject to this goal”.|$|R

40|$|It must be {{regarded}} as a peculiarity that the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights makes no specific mention of prisoners’ rights and that these rights have to be inferred from overall reading of the Charter, and in particular Articles 4 - 6.

This article assesses the relationship between the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the South African prison reform debate with reference, first, to the prevention and eradication of torture and other ill-treatment in South Africa and the Robben Island Guidelines, and secondly, to the right to liberty and the recently announced guidelines from the Commission on police and pre-trial detention.

This article examines existing legislation on this question in the member States of the Council of Europe and the administrative instructions for putting this legislation into practice. The results of prisoner participation in practice in 26 prisons in England and Wales are described. The contribution of prisoner councils to a prison climate that helps prisoners to address their criminal behaviour is considered.

On the basis of an initial data set of 165 judgments, which we have compiled, the second part of the chapter provides an overview of the relevant ECtHR’s judgments and the issues that they raise, the states most frequently implicated, and the nature and range of measures that national authorities institute in response to the Strasbourg Court’s judgments that find violations of the Convention. The third part describes and discusses the kind of reforms and measures that national authorities undertake by way of implementing the general measures that are called for by the relevant ECtHR judgments...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} prison {{architecture}} concerns {{the development of}} various design formats. In contemporary terms, punishment and re-socialization are the two equally important purposes of a prison institution. Rightfully, the contemporary model of prison architecture may be viewed, inter alia, as a spatial response to the re-socialization programme. Based on a comprehensive literature review, critical discussion, and scientific description, this paper defines the main qualitative elements of prison architecture, which responds to the requirements for re-socialization of inmates, and further explains {{the way in which}} each response is provided. From these architectural and design attributes, a list of 30 indicators of the spatial response to re-socialization was established. Furthermore, by using the derived indicators, a comparative analysis of four contemporary <b>European</b> <b>prisons</b> was conducted. The results showed both similarities and differences in the spatial response to the re-socialization programme, indicating that the spatial potential for re-socialization of inmates may be developed by using various approaches to prison design...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{intensive}} mobility and migration over the last 25 years, multiculturalism and multilingualism have become a reality in <b>European</b> <b>prisons.</b> This “superdiversity” (Arnaut et al., 2016) poses a serious challenge to the various stakeholders who need (efficient and reliable) communication. Yet, this topic has been under-researched (Baixauli-Olmos, 2013, Martinez-Gomez, 2014, 2015, 2016). According to statistics for the year 2014 issued by the Council of Europe, Belgium has {{a high rate of}} foreign inmates (41 %). Against this background, the aim of this exploratory research is to describe how the Flemish penitentiary system tackles this linguistic challenge. Data were gathered through qualitative research methods such as desktop research and in-depth interviews with 8 stakeholders (prison directors, prison staff, social workers, and interpreters). Due to the scarcity of financial resources and organizational hurdles, the Ministry of Justice rarely assigns jobs in prison to interpreters; instead they are replaced by cheaper and immediately available alternatives. The results suggest that linguistic isolation of foreign detainees leads to social isolation and may jeopardize their release and social reintegration. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Drugs are an {{increasingly}} salient concern in many <b>European</b> <b>prisons.</b> Drug policies are made, drugs are controlled, used and prescribed {{and drug use}} is treated and sanctioned. In light of the growing significance of drugs in prison life, we analyse the different ways of drugs that are enacted in Danish drug treatment programmes, based on insights derived from Science and Technology Studies. We ground our analysis with data from two qualitative research projects conducted between 2007 and 2010 and between 2011 and 2014. In all, eight prisons {{were involved in the}} two studies. Our analysis reveals three distinctive drug enactments characterised by rather different practises, discourses and narratives: drugs as illegal substances, as medicine and as constrainers. Furthermore, we examine how policy makers, prison officers, health personnel, counsellors and prisoners contribute to the construction and organisation of these three enactments, along with the practical and discursive domains in which this work takes place. We conclude by assessing some of the implications of these different enactments of drugs for prisoners&# 039; subjectivities...|$|R

The results of our survey are pursuant to official statistics data for Serbia, the European countries, USA and Australia, since 80 % of our convicts in prisons have misused psychologically active substances {{during the period of}} 30 days, the previous period before coming to these institutions. More than a half of our examinees (60 %), misuses narcotics and alcohol occasionally or permanently, the alcohol users only 12. 7 %, and only narcotics 7. 3 % of the ones, meaning that a treatment of addiction disease should have a significant role in prevention of recidivism...|$|R
