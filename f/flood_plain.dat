5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Fobney Lock and the {{associated}} water treatment works, the Kennet <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames <b>flood</b> <b>plain.</b> At County Lock the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. Because of poor visibility {{and the difficulty of}} boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime traffic lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's The Oracle shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} creeks, {{including}} Jerrabomberra and Yarralumla Creeks, {{flow into the}} Molonglo and Murrumbidgee. Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form Lakes Ginninderra and Tuggeranong. Until recently the Molonglo River {{had a history of}} sometimes calamitous floods; the area was a <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> prior to the filling of Lake Burley Griffin.|$|E
40|$|In {{a curved}} channel there are spiral motions {{occurred}} by centrifugal force. And in an openchannel {{that consists of}} a main channel and <b>flood</b> <b>plains,</b> the flow has a complex turbulent structurebecause of interaction between flow in a main channel and it in <b>flood</b> <b>plains.</b> So {{it is difficult to}} clarifycharacteristics of an open channel flow in bend with <b>flood</b> <b>plains.</b> In this paper it is the objective to elucidate the turbulent structure of this flow by measurementsof velocity and flow visualization. From experimental results it is comfirmed that three independentspiral motions exist in bend with two <b>flood</b> <b>plains...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1911, a {{competition}} {{for the design of}} Canberra was launched, and Scrivener's detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing architects. The Molonglo River flowed through the site, which was a <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> and Scrivener's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an artificial lake—similar to the lake later created—and four possible locations for a dam to create it. Most of the proposals took the hint and included artificial bodies of water.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, moorhen and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread as are the meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, sandpiper and godwit.|$|E
5|$|The area {{gradually}} declined as {{the affluent}} moved to newer streetcar suburbs, such as Cherokee Triangle, or built estates in areas east of Louisville recently connected by railroad, such as Anchorage and Glenview. Accelerated by the Great Depression, {{many of the}} large homes in Old Louisville were converted to boarding houses during the 1930s. The Ohio River flood of 1937 caused {{a great number of}} the remaining wealthy households to move above the <b>flood</b> <b>plain.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kristen Gremillion {{has worked}} on {{research}} surrounding when and where the domestication of plants may {{have taken place in}} Eastern North America, focusing on the forager-farmers of the eastern Kentucky uplands. Her research suggests that experimentation in plant domestication may have started in the uplands, instead of the rich soiled <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> as former theories have suggested. Gremillion suggests that domesticating plants in the uplands would have been more cost-effective than the <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> because these people lived in the uplands and would be able to experiment with domestication without having to travel great distances to get to the fertile <b>flood</b> <b>plains.</b>|$|R
50|$|The land scape of {{the town}} has varied {{topography}} comprising undulating plan, the <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> of the Ravi and the Beas and the up land plain. It is traversed {{by a number of}} chaos and has an undulating topography. The <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> of the Ravi and the Beas are separated from the up land plain by sharp river cut bluffs. They are low lying, with slightly uneven topography. Sand dominates in the soil structure of the <b>flood</b> <b>plains,</b> but it diminishes in both quantity and coarseness in the upland plain. The up land plain covers a large part {{of the town}} particularly.|$|R
5|$|The {{ballpark}} {{was built}} to withstand a 100-year flood because it is located on a <b>flood</b> <b>plain.</b> Before its redevelopment, the area, including the original Sulphur Dell ballpark, was prone to regular flooding from the nearby Cumberland River and it flooded during the 2010 Tennessee floods. To prevent water damage, the grandstand has an acrylic floor covering and the field-level suites are equipped with detachable floor boards, food-service tables mounted on casters, and raised floor outlets and electrical switches.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. <b>Flood</b> <b>plain</b> mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding. Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided by telephone or the internet.|$|E
5|$|Northern Bloomsburg and Scott Township {{include a}} small oxbow lake of Fishing Creek; {{the area around}} this lake {{is known as the}} Turkey Hill Oxbow. The lake is located between Interstate 80 and the forests on the side of Turkey Hill. The oxbow is on a <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> and {{includes}} grasses, forested wetlands, and areas of open water. In wet periods of the year, the Turkey Hill Oxbow lake receives overflow from the waters of Fishing Creek while during dry periods it contains water in only a few places.|$|E

5|$|Settlement {{continued}} {{to follow the}} river down the valley. At the confluence with Castle Creek, the valley widened and offered a <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> conducive {{to the development of}} a town. The slopes of the surrounding mountains proved to have the silver deposits the prospectors had anticipated, and very soon the mining camp became a small city, named Aspen after the trees that filled the surrounding forests. It grew rapidly, becoming the seat of the newly created Pitkin County, named after the governor its earliest settlers had disobeyed by coming there.|$|E
5|$|Strategic losses {{seemed far}} greater. The French army's ability {{to cross the}} Rhine at will gave them an advantage. Charles could not move much of his army away from Mannheim or Karlsruhe, where the French had also formed across the river; loss of the {{crossings}} at Hüningen, near the Swiss city of Basel, and the crossing at Kehl, near the Alsatian city of Strasbourg, guaranteed the French ready-access to most of southwestern Germany. From there, Moreau's troops could fan out over the <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> around Kehl to prevent any approach from Rastadt or Offenburg.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Green Corridor is {{a linear}} park {{alongside}} {{the two main}} rivers through the town, which is protected from development by lying on the main <b>flood</b> <b>plain.</b> Most of the area covered by the park {{has been marked by}} Ashford Borough Council as a nature reserve. This area includes Victoria Park, which lies to the immediate south of the town centre and the railway. It includes an ornate fountain first shown at the 2nd International Exhibition in London in 1862, and presented to the park by George Harper on 24 July 1912. The Coningbrook Lakes Country Park opened on a former quarry site to the northeast of town in 2015.|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic {{characteristics}} of unsteady flows were investigated experimentally in compound channels with vegetated <b>flood</b> <b>plains.</b> Some noticeable differences between unsteady flow structure in compound channels {{with and without}} vegetation were revealed. The vegetation in the <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> increases the unsteadiness of the main-channel velocity and its double peek property is changed by the effects of vegetation arrangement. During the rising stage, the velocity in the vegetation does not reach the value in the steady flow case so that the lateral velocity gradient and the turbulence intensity increase near the vegetation interface. Lastly, 1 -D numerical calculation technique for unsteady flow with vegetation in <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> was investigated...|$|R
5|$|The Saw Mill River and its {{adjacent}} terrain conferred some tactical {{advantages to}} those who knew it. One skirmish began when a Patriot militiaman, Jake Acker, was hunting in a bushy area of the eastern <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> at Elmsford. Spying {{a large group of}} British soldiers and Loyalist supporters on the road to Storm's tavern, Acker began sniping at them from his concealment. He fatally wounded one, changed his position amid the distraction, reloaded his musket, and killed another. Hearing the shots, other local Patriots came to Acker's aid, and eventually {{all but one of the}} larger force were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury's built {{environment}} has developed around {{the areas of}} East Didsbury, West Didsbury, and Didsbury Village, which separates the two. The Albert Park conservation area, covering much of West Didsbury, places planning restrictions on development, alterations to buildings, and pruning of trees. The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river's <b>flood</b> <b>plain,</b> and so have historically been prone to flooding after heavy rainfall. The last major flooding was in the late 1960s. In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester has helped {{to speed up the}} passage of floodwater. Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden also acts as an emergency flood basin, storing floodwater until it can be safely released back into the river.|$|E
40|$|Transformation {{process of}} flood waves and {{hydraulic}} characteristics of unsteady flows were investigated experimentally in compound channels with locally vegetated <b>flood</b> <b>plains.</b> Some noticeable differences between unsteady flow structure in compound channels {{with and without}} vegetation were revealed. The shortly vegetated zone in the <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> causes the sharp decrease of the flow depth {{in front of that}} and increases the upstream stage extremely. 2 -D depth-averaged numerical calculation technique for unsteady flow with vegetation in <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> was developed. The calculated results reproduce well the characteristic tendency of the experiments. This calculation method is useful for the flood routing passing such a complex flow field...|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s {{the defence}} bases in Wagga Wagga again became an {{important}} part of the city. The Army camp at Kapooka was reopened as a recruit training centre from 1951, a role it maintains to this day. RAAF Base Wagga at Forest Hill also expanded, with training of defence force aircraft technicians there from 1969. After a series of major floods in the early 1950s, the City Council protected the city area on the south <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> through construction of a levee, completed in 1962. The levee was designed to provide protection from floods at levels expected once every one hundred years. North Wagga Wagga was initially excluded from protection however by 1982 another levee was constructed to protect the village, although at a lower standard.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{also caused}} severe {{agricultural}} damage in southeastern Florida totalling to $338million Floodwaters killed 30cattle at one farm, though the owners protected {{the rest of}} their 1700cattle by raising the feeding areas above the <b>flood</b> <b>plain.</b> According to an initial estimate, the flooding destroyed between 5% and 15% of fruit groves along its path. The flooding delayed the winter planting of corn and bell peppers and damaged tomato plants, forcing Miami-Dade County growers to replant damaged crops. The hurricane also damaged sugar cane, vegetables, and citrus crops, with citrus canker spreading after the storm passed through the area. Due to the crop damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared Broward, Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties as disaster areas. This qualified eligible farmers for low-interest emergency loans.|$|E
5|$|The A. sp. is {{from the}} latest Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco region in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation.

The study showed that Lo Hueco was near {{the coast of the}} Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to be inside the flood-plain.
