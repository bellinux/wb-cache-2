25|$|The {{rigorous}} {{calculations of}} Lee et al. require knowing the drag coefficient and frontal {{area of the}} penetrating projectile at every instant of the penetration. Since this is not <b>generally</b> <b>possible</b> with expanding handgun bullets, Courtney and Courtney developed a model for estimating the peak pressure waves of handgun bullets from the impact energy and penetration depth in ballistic gelatin. This model agrees with the more rigorous approach of Lee et al. for projectiles where they can both be applied. For expanding handgun bullets, the peak pressure wave magnitude {{is proportional to the}} bullet’s kinetic energy divided by the penetration depth.|$|E

25|$|Each {{method has}} {{noteworthy}} limitations. The method of {{mechanics of materials}} is limited to very simple structural elements under relatively simple loading conditions. The structural elements and loading conditions allowed, however, are sufficient to solve many useful engineering problems. The theory of elasticity allows the solution of structural elements of general geometry under general loading conditions, in principle. Analytical solution, however, is limited to relatively simple cases. The solution of elasticity problems also requires the solution {{of a system of}} partial differential equations, which is considerably more mathematically demanding than the solution of mechanics of materials problems, which require at most the solution of an ordinary differential equation. The finite element method is perhaps the most restrictive and most useful at the same time. This method itself relies upon other structural theories (such as the other two discussed here) for equations to solve. It does, however, make it <b>generally</b> <b>possible</b> to solve these equations, even with highly complex geometry and loading conditions, with the restriction that there is always some numerical error. Effective and reliable use of this method requires a solid understanding of its limitations.|$|E

Such units arise from one of the many quantities in a real Clifford algebra that square to −1, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.

2500|$|The spherical Earth is navigated using flat maps or charts, {{collected}} in an atlas. Similarly, a differentiable manifold {{can be described}} using mathematical maps, called coordinate charts, {{collected in}} a mathematical atlas. It is not <b>generally</b> <b>possible</b> to describe a manifold with just one chart, because the global structure of the manifold {{is different from the}} simple structure of the charts. [...] For example, no single flat map can represent the entire Earth without separation of adjacent features across the map's boundaries or duplication of coverage. When a manifold is constructed from multiple overlapping charts, the regions where they overlap carry information essential to understanding the global structure.|$|E
2500|$|Direct {{microwave}} {{exposure is}} not <b>generally</b> <b>possible,</b> as microwaves emitted by the source {{in a microwave}} oven are confined in the oven by the material out of which the oven is constructed. Furthermore, ovens are equipped with redundant safety interlocks, which remove power from the magnetron if the door is opened. This safety mechanism is required by United States federal regulations. Tests have shown confinement of the microwaves in commercially available ovens to be so nearly universal as to make routine testing unnecessary. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a U.S. Federal Standard limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately [...] (2 in) {{from the surface of}} the oven. This is far below the exposure level currently considered to be harmful to human health.|$|E
2500|$|In {{legal systems}} based on English tradition, {{findings}} of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury {{findings of fact}} even if the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known, are entitled to great deference on appeal. [...] In other legal systems, it is <b>generally</b> <b>possible</b> for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems evidence may be presented to appellate courts in {{what amounts to a}} trial de novo (new trial) of appealed findings of fact. [...] The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has major impact on court procedure in these systems. [...] This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition. [...] The higher the stakes, the more this is true. [...] Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems.|$|E

A typical canaller would know the canal by the names of the levels and the locks. Most list of points of the canal's points of interest do not contain a list of the levels with their names like we have here. Also note that most lists of locks do not include Guard Locks 4 and 5, which a boat would have to pass through, if navigating the entire canal (It was <b>generally</b> <b>possible</b> for boats to pass through the other guard locks also, but that is {{if they were going to}} other destinations, usually on the Virginia/West Virginia side of the river). Also note sometimes there are often slight discrepancies in mileages, for instance NPS and Hahn reports Lock 75 at 175.60 miles, Davies lists [...] "175.35 (175.50)", and Hahn also reports the NPS mile markers are in the wrong place from Milepost 117 to Lock 51, further adding to the confusion. Also note that Some streets in Georgetown were renamed, mostly as numbered streets, pursuant to an 1895 law. See Georgetown street renaming.|$|E
2500|$|Tourism {{from outside}} the Eastern Bloc was neglected, while tourism from other Stalinist {{countries}} grew within the Eastern Bloc. Tourism drew investment, relying upon tourism and recreation opportunities existing before World War II. [...] By 1945, most hotels were run-down, while many which escaped conversion to other uses by central planners were slated to meet domestic demands. [...] Authorities created state companies to arrange travel and accommodation. [...] In the 1970s, investments were made to attempt to attract western travelers, though momentum for this waned in the 1980s when no long-term plan arose to procure improvements in the tourist environment, such as an assurance of freedom of movement, free and efficient money exchange {{and the provision of}} higher quality products with which these tourists were familiar. [...] However, western tourists were generally free to move about in Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia and go where they wished. [...] It was more difficult or even impossible to go as an individual tourist to East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania. [...] It was <b>generally</b> <b>possible</b> in all cases, save Albania, for relatives from the west to visit and stay with family in the Eastern Bloc countries, except for Albania.
