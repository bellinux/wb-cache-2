In his publication, Benoit showed that all synthetic polymers elutes on the same curve when the log of the intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molar mass was plotted against the <b>elution</b> <b>volume.</b> This is the basis of universal calibration which requires a viscometer to measure the intrinsic viscosity of the polymers.

5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of displacement chromatography is that non-idealities always {{give rise to}} an overlap zone between each pair of components; this mixed zone must be collected separately for recycle or discard to preserve {{the purity of the}} separated materials. The strategy of adding spacer molecules to form zones between the components (sometimes termed [...] "carrier displacement chromatography") has been investigated and can be useful when suitable, readily removable spacers are found. Another disadvantage is that the raw chromatogram, for instance a plot of absorbance or refractive index vs <b>elution</b> <b>volume,</b> can be difficult to interpret for contiguous zones, especially if the displacement train is not fully developed. Documentation and troubleshooting may require additional chemical analysis to establish the distribution of a given component. Another disadvantage is that the time required for regeneration limits throughput.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Strontium-specific {{extraction}} columns from Eichrom Technologies {{have been}} used for the determination of 90 Sr in wet deposition and in soil in our laboratory. For these determinations, the prepacked 2 -mL columns were tested for the breakthrough of strontium with 20 mg of calcium and 2 mg of strontium carrier as well as 40 mg of calcium and 2 mg of stron-tium carrier. The column was suitable for this method with the <b>elution</b> <b>volumes</b> we used for soil and wet deposition and with 20 mg of calcium, but a breakthrough was observed with 40 mg of calcium. Due to the low calcium concentration in wet dep-osition and soil, the 90 Sr analysis was possible with 2 -mL columns and specific <b>elution</b> <b>volumes.</b> For 90 Sr determination in milk samples, the calcium content of the milk is too high. Thus, the method was optimized by reducing the <b>elution</b> <b>volumes</b> to double the calcium concentration, which could be loaded onto the column without breakthrough. With these modifications, a lower limit of detection (LLD) of 0. 12 Bq/L could be obtained. A monitoring program of raw cow milk in Austria is con-ducted with regard to the commission recommendation on the application of Article 36 of the Euratom Treaty concerning the monitoring of the levels of radioactivity in the environment for the purpose of assessing the exposure of the population as a whole (2000 / 473 /Euratom).

5000|$|As a {{separation}} technique GPC has many advantages. First of all, {{it has a}} well-defined separation time {{due to the fact}} that there is a final <b>elution</b> <b>volume</b> for all unretained analytes. Additionally, GPC can provide narrow bands, although this aspect of GPC is more difficult for polymer samples that have broad ranges of molecular weights present. Finally, since the analytes do not interact chemically or physically with the column, there is a lower chance for analyte loss to occur. [...] For investigating the properties of polymer samples in particular, GPC can be very advantageous. GPC provides a more convenient method of determining the molecular weights of polymers. In fact most samples can be thoroughly analyzed in an hour or less. Other methods used in the past were fractional extraction and fractional precipitation. As these processes were quite labor-intensive molecular weights and mass distributions typically were not analyzed. [...] Therefore, GPC has allowed for the quick and relatively easy estimation of molecular weights and distribution for polymer samples ...|$|E
50|$|Gel {{permeation}} chromatography (GPC) {{has become}} the most widely used technique for analyzing polymer samples in order to determine their molecular weights and weight distributions. Examples of GPC chromatograms of polystyrene samples with their molecular weights and PDIs are shown on the left. Benoit and co-workers proposed that the hydrodynamic volume, Vη, which is proportional to the product of η and M, where η is the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer in the SEC eluent, may be used as the universal calibration parameter. If the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada constants K and α are known (see Mark-Houwink equation), a plot of log ηM versus <b>elution</b> <b>volume</b> (or elution time) for a particular solvent, column and instrument provides a universal calibration curve which can be used for any polymer in that solvent. By determining the retention volumes (or times) of monodisperse polymer standards (e.g. solutions of monodispersed polystyrene in THF), a calibration curve can be obtained by plotting the logarithm of the molecular weight versus the retention time or volume. Once the calibration curve is obtained, the gel permeation chromatogram of any other polymer can be obtained in the same solvent and the molecular weights (usually Mn and Mw) and the complete molecular weight distribution for the polymer can be determined. A typical calibration curve is shown to the right and the molecular weight from an unknown sample can be obtained from the calibration curve.|$|E

In the root, a low activity of SS was detectable only in the tillering but not in other stages. Immunoblotting of SS protein extracted from different parts of rice showed two bands.

Bradyrhizobium japonicum 61 A 68, a bacterium which nodulates soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.), was grown in defined medium. Cytokinins were purified from the culture medium by Amberlite XAD- 2 chromatography and fractionated by column chromatography on Sephadex LH- 20 in 35 % ethanol. Pooled fractions from the Sephadex column were analyzed for cytokinin activity with the tobacco callus bioassay. Cytokinin activity was observed in fractions corresponding to the <b>elution</b> <b>volumes</b> of zeatin, ribosylzeatin, and methylthiozeatin. No activity corresponding to the <b>elution</b> <b>volumes</b> of isopentenyladenine or its riboside was found.

Transfer RNA was isolated from B. japonicum cells by phenol extraction, followed by potassium acetate extraction, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide precipitation, and DEAE cellulose chromatography. Transfer RNA was enzymically hydrolyzed to nucleosides. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of cytokinin nucleosides showed peaks corresponding to the retention times of trans-ribosylzeatin, methylthioribosylzeatin, isopentenyladenosine, and methylthioisopentenyladenosine. Analysis of the tRNA hydrolysate by Sephadex LH- 20 chromatography and tobacco bioassay showed cytokinin activity in fractions corresponding to ribosylzeatin, methylthioribosylzeatin, and isopentenyladenosine.
