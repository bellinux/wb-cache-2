"But let us for {{a moment}} take so much for granted, and now {{consider}} this: fortifications are unquestionably building {{in the region of}} Torres Vedras, and Wellington guards the secret so jealously that not even the British--either here or in England--are aware of their nature. That is why the Cabinet in London takes for granted an embarkation in September. Wellington has not even taken his Government into his confidence. That is the sort of man he is. Now these fortifications have been building since last October. Best part of eight months have already gone in their construction. It may be another two or three months before the French army reaches them. I do not say that the French cannot pass them, given time. But <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>will</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> the French to pull down what it will have taken ten or eleven months to construct? And if they are unable to draw sustenance from a desolate, wasted country, what time will they have at their disposal? It will be with them a matter of life or death. Having come so far they must reach Lisbon or perish; and if the fortifications can delay them by a single month, then, granted that all Lord Wellington's other dispositions have been duly carried out, perish they must. It remains, Monsieur le Major, for you to determine whether, with all their energy, with all their genius and all their valour, the French can--in an ill-nourished condition--destroy in a few weeks the considered labour of nearly a year." ...|$|E
