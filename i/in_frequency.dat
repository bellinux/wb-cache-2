Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E

A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 resulted in nearly 1300 deaths. Based on observations, heat wave related mortality has increased in India prior to 2005. The 2015 Indian heat wave killed more than 2,500 people.|$|E
5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004.

5|$|George Trice {{retired in}} 1948 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Derek, who sold Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route {{numbering}} was introduced {{for the first time}} to the three routes then operated. The company made an operating loss in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a local service in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut <b>in</b> <b>frequency.</b> As the Chilworth garage was still owned by Trice, operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> and severity as the dog ages.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain.

The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nights into Dreams with the working title Air Nights was {{originally}} outlined for the Sega Saturn and subsequently {{developed for the}} Dreamcast with motion control being a central element of gameplay. In an August 1999 interview, Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 {{that he would be}} interested in using the licence of Nights into Dreams to reinforce Sega's identity as a video game developer. Discussion concerning a new game in the series had increased <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> by 2006. Rumours regarding a Wii version continued to appear when a list of upcoming games was published by Japanese developer G.rev, which included an unspecified Nights title.

5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E
5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, {{the brain and}} auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat calls {{are some of the}} most intense, airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from between 60 and 140 decibels. Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E

40|$|Control of {{blackleg}} (phoma stem canker) disease {{relies on}} crop management, fungicides and breeding for disease resistance. Proteins encoded by these resistance genes recognize avirulence (Avr) gene {{products in the}} fungus during invasion of the plant. However, these Avr genes can mutate resulting in fungal isolates becoming virulent, thus avoiding recognition by the plant. Widespread use of cultivars containing resistance genes provides strong selection for isolates that have mutated forms of Avr genes.

For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes <b>in</b> <b>frequency.</b> Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E
5|$|Following George Trice's {{death in}} 1933, {{control of the}} {{business}} passed to his son, also called George. A coach hire and excursion business had been introduced in July 1931; this was split out into a new company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently until 1955. From the early 1930s, until 1964, the service to Peaslake was run jointly with the London Passenger Transport Board; operation of the entire route was taken over in August 1964, but falling passenger numbers meant that the route was cut back <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> a year later. A new livery of maroon and grey was introduced in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} came in April 1985, following {{over a year}} {{of consultation}} with county council members, regulators, when two new routes were introduced. One operated in competition with Alder Valley, while the other took the place of services withdrawn by other operators. Following these changes Tillingbourne became the only operator to serve Chilworth, Albury and Shere. Two new vehicles were purchased for the routes. At the same time, all of Tillingbourne's services were renumbered into a new two-digit sequence, to avoid confusion with London Country routes. A year later, {{the second of the}} new services, circular route 23/25, was reduced <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> from hourly to two-hourly, although much of the route was covered by extending another route. Another new service, linking Cranleigh and Godalming, was also introduced. In August 1986, operation of a number of council-contracted services, including a route from Redhill to Reigate and a local route in Horsham, were taken over from other companies.|$|E
