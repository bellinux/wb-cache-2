25|$|Still, {{it may be}} doubted {{whether this}} {{multiplication}} of fast-days can {{be taken as a}} sign of an increased tendency to Asceticism. Probably the theory of Robertson Smith (The Religion of the Semites, p.413) still holds good to a large extent in explanation of many of the fast-observances of later Judaism, as undoubtedly <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>for</b> the voluntary and occasional fast-days mentioned in the historical books of the Bible; namely, that Oriental fasting is merely a preparation for the eating of the sacrificial meal. The rabbinical injunction, not to eat too late a meal {{on the eve of the}} Sabbath-day, so as to enjoy all the more that of the Sabbath, tends to corroborate the theory. Perhaps this also underlies the rabbinical report that some examples of rabbinical piety fasted every Friday (in preparation for the Sabbath).|$|E

25|$|However, when {{power output}} from the nuclear {{reaction}} increases rapidly, {{it may take}} longer for the water to heat up and boil than <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>for</b> the voids to cause the nuclear reactions to decrease. In such an event, reactor power can grow rapidly without any negative feedback from the expansion or boiling of the water, {{even if it is}} in a channel just 1cm away. Dramatic heating will occur to the nuclear fuel, leading to melting and vaporization of the metals within the core. Rapid expansion, increases in pressure, and failure of core components may lead to the destruction of the nuclear reactor, {{as was the case with}} SL-1. As the energy of expansion and heat travel from the nuclear fuel to the water and the vessel, it becomes likely that the nuclear reaction will shut down, either from the lack of sufficient moderator or from the fuel expanding beyond the realm of a critical mass. In the post-accident analysis of SL-1, scientists determined that the two shutdown mechanisms were almost equally matched (see below).|$|E
500|$|Journalist Alissa Stickler {{describes}} Flagg as a [...] "contemporary medievalist interpretation on {{the themes}} of evil, magic and the (d)evil figure". She likens Flagg to Merlin, whispering in the ear of Arthur. Stickler notes that Flagg is politically powerful in The Stand and The Eyes of the Dragon; he uses his power differently in each novel, challenging depictions of evil and witchcraft common in medieval times. She explains that there {{does not appear to}} be a higher power to which Flagg [...] "must appeal to his abilities" [...] as there is with traditional evil. Flagg is more of a [...] "humanesque evil", which works against him as much as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>for</b> him. His supernatural knowledge is fallible, and the customary black-and-white depiction is replaced with an [...] "acceptance of a shadowy gray area". Stickler says that although Flagg appears [...] "terrifying and supernatural" [...] as depicted by King, there are no absolutes. She concludes that Flagg represents the medieval monster both past and future, which challenges and yet supports the literary Middle Ages.|$|E

Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s {{been going on for a}} long time now, right under our noses." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{hypothetical}} case of Smith v. Jones in which Congress enacted a statute that says [...] "Smith wins", the majority {{would find it}} unconstitutional because it [...] "would create no new substantive law." [...] In the Chief Justice's view, it would: before the passage of {{the hypothetical}} statute, the law did not provide that Smith wins; after passage of the hypothetical statute, <b>it</b> <b>does.</b> <b>For</b> the Chief Justice, [...] "the question is whether its action constitutes an exercise of judicial power." [...] Both the hypothetical [...] "Smith wins" [...] statute and §8772 both have the same effect, which is essentially the legislature's [...] "'policy judgment'" [...] that one side in the case wins. He compared the majority's opinion, which found that §8772 left plenty of issues for the District Court to adjudicate, to [...] "a constitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented by the simplest maneuver of taking away every defense against Smith's victory, without saying 'Smith wins.'" [...] Section8772 only required the courts to make two decisions—that Bank Markazi had an equitable interest in the assets and no one else did—that were both already clear before §8772 was enacted. By the majority's view of [...] "plenty", [...] the Chief Justice contended that, in the hypothetical case Smith v. Jones, the majority would uphold a judgment for Smith if the court finds that Jones was served notice of the lawsuit and the case was within the statute of limitations. Strongly criticizing the majority, the Chief Justice, quoting Federalist No. 48, concluded that the majority's [...] "failure to enforce [...] in a case as clear as this reduces Article III to a mere 'parchment barrier against the encroaching spirit' of legislative power." ...|$|E
