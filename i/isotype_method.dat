40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the <b>Isotype</b> <b>method</b> of pictorial statistics, invented in 1920 s Vienna by the Vienna Circle philosopher and sociologist Otto Neurath, and compares it to Neurath’s own signature drawings of a cartoon elephant. Isotype {{was among the}} first standardised systems for representing social facts in pictures. Neurath presented it as a picture language, an artificial language like Esperanto. Although he did not draw the symbols, he exerted a strong influence on their visual appearance and established the basic principles and conventions of Isotype. In his correspondence he did draw, signing his letters with a distinctive cartoon of an elephant. This chapter uses these two different practices to consider what a picture language might entail. In particular it addresses the differences between the standardized and geometric appearance and systematic method of Isotype, and the diverse, playful, improvised and amateurish signatures. It shows how the signature drawings came closer to natural language by becoming dialogic or “scriptible”, as Neurath’s correspondents began to draw in response. This quality is absent in the methodical, impersonal Isotype, but Isotype has been a lasting influence on contemporary visual icon systems, road and airport signage and visual instructions, while the elephant died with its author...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{attempts}} {{to set the}} world scene and fit this research within a framework of museum education, science museums and the Indian science museum situation. A way forward for Indian science museums is sought by identifying the challenges currently faced by them. The thesis, it is hoped, will contribute toward meeting some of those challenges.;After defining and classifying the exhibition and describing {{the changing nature of}} museums, particularly science museum exhibitions, Chapter II looks at the exhibition development process from the historical perspective. Four approaches are identified in the developmental process of museum exhibition. They are the 'open storage' approach, the Bauhaus's contribution of design elements to exhibitions, Neurath's contribution of the <b>ISOTYPE</b> <b>method</b> of presenting information, and finally the contemporary approach. Having traced the traditional and project-team approaches to exhibition development in museums across {{the world in terms of}} their advantages and disadvantages, I will compare and contrast them with the exhibition development approaches in Indian science museums. After having identified the missing inputs of visitors and educators to the exhibition development in Indian science museums, the thesis sets out to shed light on the nature of museum learning, the museum visitor and the museum visit.;In Chapter III, learning theories from behaviouristic, cognitive, and humanistic traditions are presented and discussed in relation to museum learning. Some comprehensive models of learning that integrate principles from these three schools are also discussed in terms of their usefulness to describe museum learning. Finally, a 'spiral' approach to museum learning is synthesised to explicate what is going on inside the museum.;Chapter IV weaves together Jung's psychological types, Gardner's multiple intelligences, and one-, two- and multi-dimensional learning styles into a framework to explain the fabric of the museum visitor.;A survey and an observation of museum visitors to an Indian science centre were conducted to explore the nature of the museum visitor and the museum visit. An interview was conducted with Indian museum directors to shed light on four learning-related issues. The four issues are learning in museums, evaluation and visitor studies, criteria in exhibition development, and finally interest in science and the nature of the scientific temper. The analyses and results of the survey, the observation and the interview are presented in Chapter V, VI and VII respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{studies have}} noted the {{significance}} of measuring anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) as an important indicator for destructive disease, {{as is the case}} in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While the role of anti-CCP antibodies in RA and JIA has become better understood, the identity of the target proteins of this modification has remained elusive. In this study, we evaluated serum from patients with various subtypes of JIA to investigate the presence of anti-deiminated (citrullinated) fibrinogen and anti-citrullinated α-enolase antibodies, and their association with RF and anti-CCP antibody <b>isotypes.</b> <b>Methods</b> Sera were obtained from 96 JIA patients, 19 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and 10 healthy children. All sera were measured for antibodies against citrullinated and native fibrinogen and α-enolase by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, all sera were assayed for anti-CCP antibody isotypes and rheumatoid factor (RF) isotypes by ELISA. The relationship between anti-citrullinated fibrinogen and anti-α-enolase antibodies and disease activity and joint damage were also investigated. All results were correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters using Spearman's rho correlation coefficient. Multiple logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify which variables were associated with joint erosions and diagnosis of JIA. Results Thirty-one JIA patients (32 %) demonstrated reactivity to citrullinated fibrinogen and 9 (9 %) to citrullinated α-enolase. Reactivity to citrullinated fibrinogen and α-enolase was predominantly found in IgM RF-positive polyarthritis patients. Fourteen JIA patients reacted with native α-enolase and a higher percentage of SLE patients reacted with citrullinated α-enolase when compared to JIA patients. Anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies correlated with the presence of IgG anti-CCP antibodies and IgA and IgM RF. The presence of anti-citrullinated α-enolase antibodies correlated with IgA anti-CCP antibodies. IgG anti-CCP antibodies were significantly associated with joint damage and anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies were strongly associated with JIA when compared to control groups. Anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies demonstrated high sensitivity (81 %) for IgM RF-positive polyarticular JIA. IgG anti-CCP antibodies had the highest specificity (95 %) for JIA, with anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies, IgA anti-CCP antibodies and IgA RF all following at 84 %. Conclusions JIA patient sera exhibited strong reactivity to anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies and demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for JIA, primarily in IgM RF-positive polyarthritis patients. Fibrinogen is one of several protein targets for citrullination in JIA. </p...|$|R

40|$|The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene {{in humans}} {{contains}} two single-base polymorphisms in exon 4, which result in three common alleles, conventionally named ´ 2, ´ 3 and ´ 4. Numerous {{studies have shown}} an important association between the ´ 4 variant and {{an increased risk of}} Alzheimer’s disease; other data suggest a possible linkage of APOE genetic heterogeneity with lipid profile and an increased risk of atherothrombotic stroke and coronary heart disease. APOE genotyping is therefore an increasingly common assay in laboratory medicine. The most widely used technique for APOE genotyping is based upon restriction isotyping, i. e., amplification of the fragment of exon 4 containing the most common sequence variations, followed by enzymatic digestion of the amplicon and fragments analysis by gel electrophoresis. We developed a novel, reliable and fast method that exploits the sensitivity and specificity of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography in detecting single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We show that, in most cases, with a single chromatographic separation it is possible to correctly identify the six different APOE allelic patterns, without any manipulation after the polymerase chain reaction amplification. When compared to restriction <b>isotyping,</b> our <b>method</b> is much faster, less labor intensive and similarly inexpensive...|$|R
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} capture-mark-recapture {{study was}} conducted to determine the temporal dynamics of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in a European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population of low to moderate density on sand-hill country in the lower North Island of New Zealand. A combination of sampling (trapping and radio-tracking) and diagnostic (cELISA, PCR and <b>isotype</b> ELISA) <b>methods</b> was employed to obtain data weekly from May 1998 until June 2001. Although rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) infection was detected in the study population in all 3 years, disease epidemics were evident only in the late summer or autumn months in 1999 and 2001. Overall, 20 % of 385 samples obtained from adult animals older than 11 weeks were seropositive. An RHD outbreak in 1999 contributed to an estimated population decline of 26 %. A second RHD epidemic in February 2001 was associated with a population decline of 52 % over the subsequent month. Following the outbreaks, the seroprevalence in adult survivors was between 40 % and 50 %. During 2000, no deaths from RHDV were confirmed and mortalities were predominantly attributed to predation. Influx of seronegative immigrants was greatest in the 1999 and 2001 breeding seasons, and preceded the RHD epidemics in those years. Our data suggest that RHD epidemics require the population immunity level to fall below a threshold where propagation of infection can be maintained through the population...|$|R
40|$|A {{source for}} {{founding}} of ISOTYPE (International System of Typographic Education) {{we found in}} twenties in the 20 th century, when Otto Neurath came out with Vienna method of picture statistics. There were many conditions influencing formation of this method which could be divided in three areas: politic and social beliefs, family and education. His politic and social believes could be a reason for focusing on wold wide understanding and comprehension. Through his type of marxism Otto Neurath struggle for achievement of main, social goal – better standard of living and better life mood. This was achieved by community and education activity of the Museum of Economy and Society, which Otto Neurath was in 1925 founder and manager. ISOTYPE was basic communication technique. Because statistical data were hard understandable for workers and Neurath considered them to main power of decision making, he strove for creating of easy, visual way.

40|$|Abstract. Rabbit {{haemorrhagic}} disease (RHD) {{is a disease}} of Oryctolagus cuniculus produced by a calicivirus (RHDV), that is highly contagious with acute evolution, high morbidity and mortality. The absence of “gold standard ” method for the international trade with rabbits, strenghten veterinary laboratories to use different methods and protocols with variable values of confidence. This paper aim to evaluate the results of three serological methods designed to detect RHDV antibodies in rabbit sera: competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA), Isotype ELISA and {{agar gel immunodiffusion test}} (AGID). They were used 10 blood samples from rabbits, from different geographical area, without history of immunisation and 10 blood samples from rabbits previously immunised. Competitive ELISA (identifying the total anti-RHDV antibodies) and Isotype ELISA (identifying the IgA, IgM and IgG anti-RHDV) have been performed according with Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals recomandations. AGID (identifying the total anti-RHDV antibodies, but mainly IgG isotype) assay has been originaly developed during this study and has been done with two different antigen concentrations. The results were similar for all three methods, but the sensitivity of AGID was lower than both ELISA <b>methods.</b> <b>Isotype</b> ELISA allowed simultaneous differentiation and titration of IgA, IgG and IgG. For AGID, still need works in order to balance the assay...|$|R
40|$|Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) is a {{clinical}} manifestation of coronary atherothrombosis {{and is the}} important causes of death. Many factors {{play a role in}} AMI. Anti-Phospholipid (aPL) antibodies may act in the induction of immunological response leading to the development of AMI. Anti-Phosphatidylethanolamine (aPEA) antibody has been detected in various autoimmune diseases and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. The study of aPEA antibody in AMI might shed light on etiologic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of coronary atherothrombosis and AMI. This study was aimed to evaluate whether prevalence of aPEA antibodies, in patients with AMI and to analyze their relationship with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The prevalence of aPEA IgG and IgM in a well characterized group of patients with AMI as a case group and in age and sex matched healthy subjects as a control group. Sera from two groups were tested to evaluate the presence of aPEA IgG and IgM <b>isotypes</b> by ELISA <b>method.</b> The frequencies of positive test for aPEA IgG were 12. 22 and 2. 22 % among patients and controls respectively with significant difference (p = 0. 007).
