50|$|Melian and Thingol courted {{one another}} in Nan Elmoth before they founded the realm of Doriath. It was an enchanted wood at {{the east end of}} the east-west valley that ran between the {{northern}} edge of the forests of Doriath and the mountains of Ered Gorgoroth. During the time Thingol and Melian were there the trees grew to be the tallest and darkest in Beleriand, blocking the sun entirely from the forest floor. Eöl the Dark Elf and famed elven smith dwelt there. Nan Elmoth was held to be part of Doriath, therefore Eöl paid Thingol with the sentient, magic, black sword Anglachel as a fee for keeping it as his fief and holding it free of the enemy. Eöl had, for most of the First Age, a nearly <b>exclusive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Dwarves of East Beleriand. Eöl kept his dwelling and smithy {{in the midst of the}} wood near the pool of Gladuial. In a darker echo of Melian's enchantment of Thingol, Eöl also enchants Aredhel when she enters the wood. This enchantment is described as an ensnarement. Eöl and Aredhel have a son, Maeglin, who is much involved in the tales of great city of Gondolin.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a computable general {{equilibrium}} {{approach to}} simulate two opposing views describing regional <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> either as building blocks for or stumbling blocks to multilateral trade liberalization. This study focuses on the free <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> (FTA) between the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and the European Union (EU). Results show that although a regional <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> may slightly raise welfare {{among the members of}} the agreement, the cost to nonmembers can be high. In this paper we argue that multilateral liberalization and a regional free <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> between the EU and CEMAC are not mutually <b>exclusive.</b> Regional <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> should be complementary and consistent with a multilateral agreement, not an attempt to replace it. The regional breakdown in our design considers 14 regions, allowing for country-specific analysis for one least-developed country (Democratic Republic of Congo) and one non-least-developed country (Cameroon). Multilateral liberalization amplifies welfare gain for Cameroon. The Democratic Republic of Congo, with its weaker institutional capacity, is affected negatively. An EU-CEMAC FTA without multilateralism produces gains for both Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The gain for Cameroon is, however, moderate compared with that achieved when the EU-CEMAC FTA is accompanied with a multilateral agreement.

40|$|This paper uses a {{model of}} {{horizontal}} multinational enterprises to explore the relationship between transportation costs and trade policy cooperation. Tariffs {{have the effect of}} attracting foreign direct investment to the benefit of consumers in the host country. As transport costs fall, the incentive to impose tariffs falls and the benefits to cooperation rise. Thus, in a repeated game in which cooperation is limited by a selfenforcement constraint, a reduction in transport costs facilitates free trade. This logic is applied to a three-country model to examine cross-sectional relationships. It is found that if any country is too distant from the others, then global free trade is not attainable. Rather, if two of the countries are within a critical distance of each other and distant from the third country, then the unique outcome is an <b>exclusive</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> between the two adjacent countries. Thus, the model predicts a strong regional bias in preferential <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> Key words: regionalism, <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> multinational enterprises, economic geography.

First {{in the town of}} Matsumae and later Hakodate, he attempted to establish a Russian <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> with Japan in order to break the <b>exclusive</b> <b>trade</b> rights of the Dutch. The Japanese suggested that Laxman leave, but Laxman had one demand: he would only leave with a <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> for Russia. After a long time and annoyed by the stubborn Laxman, the Japanese finally handed over a document stipulating Russia's right to send one Russian vessel of commerce to the harbor of Nagasaki. Secondly, it also restricted Russian commerce to Nagasaki. Trade elsewhere in Japan was prohibited. A final note in the document clearly stated that the practice of Christianity inside Japan was prohibited. Laxman returned to Russia. Eventually, the Russians sent their vessel of commerce to Nagasaki, but they were not allowed to enter the harbor. The document was of no value.|$|R
