5|$|The {{relationship}} with szlachta had only <b>gotten</b> <b>worse</b> {{during the early}} years of the reign of Sigismund II Augustus and remained bad until 1562. Sigismund Augustus' secret marriage with Barbara Radziwiłł in 1547, before his accession to the throne, was strongly opposed by his mother Bona and by the magnates of the Crown. Sigismund, who took over the reign after his father's death in 1548, overcame the resistance and had Barbara crowned in 1550; a few months later the new queen died. Bona, estranged from her son returned to Italy in 1556, where she died soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2014, Beckett {{landed on}} the {{disabled}} list with a left hip impingement, an injury he said had <b>gotten</b> <b>worse</b> as the season went on. He returned to the rotation on July 22, but struggled when he returned. In a start on August 3, he was only able to pitch four innings against the Cubs. Afterward, Beckett told the team that he had experienced renewed discomfort in his injured hip. An MRI revealed that his hip impingement had resulted in a torn labrum and two cysts, possibly requiring season ending surgery. He was placed back on the 15-day disabled list on August 8. On September 3, 2014, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly told reporters that Beckett's season was likely over due to his injury. A couple of days later, Beckett confirmed that he would not pitch again in 2014 and added that he was also considering retirement. Beckett officially announced his retirement on October 7, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Peace of Thorn of 1466 {{reduced the}} Teutonic Knights, but brought no lasting {{solution}} to the problem they presented for Poland and their state avoided paying the prescribed tribute. The chronically difficult relations had <b>gotten</b> <b>worse</b> after the 1511 election of Albrecht as Grand Master of the Order. Faced with Albrecht's rearmament and hostile alliances, Poland waged a war in 1519; the war ended in 1521, when mediation by Charles V resulted in a truce. As a compromise move Albrecht, persuaded by Martin Luther, initiated a process of secularization of the Order and the establishment of a lay duchy of Prussia, as Poland's dependency, ruled by Albrecht and afterwards by his descendants. The terms of the proposed pact immediately improved Poland's Baltic region situation, and at that time also appeared to protect the country's long-term interests. The treaty was concluded in 1525 in Kraków; the remaining state of the Teutonic Knights (East Prussia centered on Königsberg) was converted into the Protestant (Lutheran) Duchy of Prussia under the King of Poland and the homage act of the new Prussian duke in Kraków followed.|$|E

5|$|Weaver and {{his wife}} moved their {{household}} in 1890 from Bloomfield to Colfax, near Des Moines, as the former Congressman took up more active management of the Iowa Tribune. The Greenback and Union Labor parties were defunct, but he still proselytized for their ideals. In August 1890, Weaver addressed a convention in Des Moines where former Greenbackers and Laborites gathered, although he declined their nomination for Congress. The economic conditions that had created the Greenback party had not gone away; many farmers and laborers believed their situation had <b>gotten</b> <b>worse</b> since the Long Depression began in 1873. Many farmers had joined the Farmers' Alliance, which sought to promote soft-money ideas on a non-partisan basis; rather than create a third party, they endorsed major party candidates who supported their ideas and hired speakers to educate the public. Alliance-backed candidates did well in the 1890 elections, especially in the South, where Democrats endorsed by the Alliance won 44 seats.|$|E

500|$|Back in the tunnels, Doggett {{notices a}} green glow on Bianco in {{a dimly lit}} former subway station. As such, he refuses to allow the {{lieutenant}} to leave. Bianco runs away, forcing Doggett to give chase. He learns from Scully that Karras has gone ahead of plan and allowed the passengers onto the platforms and the subway will start back up, despite the danger. After analyzing various water samples found at the scene, Scully meets with Dr. Kai Bowe, a marine biologist, who explains that the sample contains a unique microscopic sea creature called a medusa which are made out of calcium and are bioluminescent. However, Bowe does not know why the electrical reaction happens. When Doggett finds the wounded Bianco, he finds that his condition has <b>gotten</b> <b>worse.</b> Doggett then carries Bianco {{on his back and}} helps him continue through the tunnels. They soon encounter a boy with no signs of the luminous green substance on him. Scully realizes that sweat is causing the chemical electrical reaction since it is conductive to calcium ions. The boy does not have well developed sweat glands yet so the medusas are not affecting him. Doggett follows the boy to a major leak from the bay with the green glow on all the walls. Suddenly, an oncoming subway approaches the group—Karras has allowed the subway to resume schedule. Doggett uses Bianco’s gun as a electrical conductor between the third rail and the water, hence the electric current generated from friction between the subway wheels and the rail passes through Bianco’s gun into the water, killing [...] the medusas and preventing further exposure.|$|E

Bogan was by this time going by the name Bill Gatlin, and he registered two brands in his own name. The ranchers and county officials commissioned former Lincoln County, New Mexico sheriff Pat Garrett to stop the cowboys, and in doing so it was insinuated he either [...] "should" [...] or [...] "could" [...] kill the main ring leaders, which included Bogan.|$|E

2500|$|The National Economic and Development Authority {{as well as}} then President Arroyo herself {{have said}} that the MRT3-LRT1 link at North Avenue is a {{national}} priority, since it would not only provide seamless service between the LRT-1 and the MRT-3, but would also help decongest Metro Manila. [...] It is estimated that by 2010, when the extension is completed, some 684,000 commuters would use the MRT-3 everyday from the present 400,000, and traffic congestion on EDSA would be cut by as much as fifty percent. [...] However, this LRT-1 extension was shown as a poor decision as the LRT-1 extension carries a negligible load and traffic in Metro Manila has <b>gotten</b> <b>worse.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Berthold's victory tally gained {{half a dozen}} {{victories}} during June. Meantime, on 18 June, Berthold again advised {{his sister}} of his ongoing medical problems. [...] "My arm has <b>gotten</b> <b>worse.</b> It is rather swollen and infected underneath the open wound. I believe the bone splinters are forcibly pushing themselves out, because the swollen area is very hard. The pain is terrific. During my air battle yesterday…I screamed loudly in pain." [...] He took a break until 28 June, when he scored his 37th victory. That night, he wrote his sister, [...] "The arm is still not good. Since the lower wound has opened up again, the pain has subsided a bit and the swelling has gone down. I have screamed in pain, sometimes frantically. It {{seems to have been}} only a bone splinter…" [...] "...it got stuck in the old, scarred wound, then the fun began for me....as the scar popped open...the pus sprayed out in a high arc...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other journalistic {{media are}} satirized as well. [...] "Homer Badman" [...] is a satire of shows like Hard Copy.

The talk show [...] "Ben" [...] reflects the writers' feeling that anyone could host a talk show because all they need is a microphone and an audience. This leads to Homer using public access TV to try to clear his name. The character Birch Barlow, who hosts a conservative radio talk show in Springfield, is a take-off of American talk show host and political commentator Rush Limbaugh.|$|E
