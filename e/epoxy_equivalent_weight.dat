40|$|A {{series of}} {{advanced}} epoxy resins (2) were {{prepared by the}} nucleophilic addition of cresol novolac epoxy (CNE) with a benzoxazine monomer (1), which is prepared by a one-pot procedure using 2 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4 -aminophenol and 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene 10 -oxide (DOPO) as starting materials. The nucleophilic addition was monitored by <b>epoxy</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>weight</b> titration and NMR analysis. Based on this approach, {{the overall number of}} functionality of the resulting epoxy resins was retained because a curable benzoxazine linkage was also incorporated after the nucleophilic addition. As a result, high-Tg thermosets qualified for the UL- 94 V- 0 rating can be achieved after curing. When an UL- 94 V- 0 rating was achieved, Tg as high as 245 degrees C (DMA data) was obtained for 4, 4 '-diaminediphenyl sulfone (DDS) -cured systems. The corresponding phosphorus content for the UL- 94 V- 0 rating was as low as 0. 61 wt%. The flame-retardant nature of oxazine linkage and nitrogen-phosphorus synergistic effect might be responsible for the low phosphorus content required for flame retardancy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However; epoxy coatings absorbs moisture easily, and the diffusion of absorbed water into the epoxy. steel interface weakens the interfacial adhesion strength between epoxy and steel in corrosive enviroment, due to the presence of hydrophilic hydroxy group in the cured network (epoxy/amine reaction). In this study, commercial epoxy polymer was chemically modified by γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane monomer under the catalysis organotin compound via the reaction between hydroxyl group in epoxy polymer and alkoxy group in silanes, aiming to enhance the corrosion performans of epoxy polymer. Commercial epoxy polymer and silane modifed epoxy polymer were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, <b>epoxy</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>weight</b> measurement, contact angle measurement, surface energy measurement, hardness test and MEK double-rub test.

40|$|International audienceThe {{synthesis}} of functionalized fluorocooligomers based on chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) and {{allyl glycidyl ether}} (AGE) under radical copolymerization is presented. The compositions of comonomers in the cooligomers were determined by three different analyses viz: from 1 H and 19 F NMR spectroscopy by using 1, 3 -bis(trifluoromethyl) benzene as the external standard, <b>epoxy</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>weight</b> value, and elemental analyses. The compositions determined by three methods were matching reasonably well and showed that the esulting poly(CTFE-co- AGE) cooligomers exhibit a tendency for alternation. The distribution of the monomers in the cooligomers was proposed based on {{the assessment of the}} reactivity ratios, ri, of both comonomers. These values were determined from the kinetics of radical copolymerization of CTFE with AGE from Fineman- Ross, Kelen-Tudos, and extended Kelen-Tudos methods which led to the assessment of the average reactivity ratios as: rCTFE ¼ 0. 20 6 0. 03 and rAGE ¼ 0. 15 6 0. 08 at 74 C. The lower Mn values substantiated the formation of cooligomers rather than copolymers. The formation of cooligomers was attributed to the chain transfer to AGE (by hydrogen abstraction from AGE) from the allylic transfer. The poly(CTFE-co-AGE) cooligomers were soluble in most of the common organic polar solvents. An optimization of cooligomer yields was investigated by using ethyl vinyl ether as a third comonomer and from different initiators. The thermal stabilities of the cooligomers, obtained by thermal gravimetric analysis, showed a 5 % weight loss at temperatures over 225 C under air...|$|E
