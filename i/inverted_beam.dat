The principles of our design are to tune the beam spectrum to the resonance energy for the matter effect, {{and to have the}} spectrum cut off rapidly above this energy. The matter effect amplifies the signal, and the cut-off suppresses backgrounds which feed-down from higher energy. The signal-to-noise ratio is potentially better than for any other conventional nu_mu beam experiment.

40|$|In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} passive {{vibration isolator}} {{based on a}} post-buckled beam is proposed and its characteristics and effectiveness are investigated by FE analysis. The intended application of the isolator is specifically isolation in the vertical direction where the isolator is required to be sufficiently stiff statically to bear {{the weight of the}} isolated mass and to be soft dynamically to achieve a low natural frequency. One approach to reconcile such a conflicting requirement is to make use of a post-buckled element that maintains much of its static stiffness in its buckled state but whose dynamic stiffness dramatically reduces. In this paper, we investigate the design of a simple, compact configuration of practical isolator using a post-buckled element – an <b>inverted</b> L-shaped <b>beam.</b> The weight of the isolated mass is taken to act at the vertex causing the vertical member to buckle when the weight is sufficiently large.

The research proposes a composite structural steel and {{prestressed concrete}} beam that is shallow, light, easy to produce and erect, and able to achieve a span-to-depth ratio of 24. The proposed beam {{is designed to be}} used with precast columns, hollow-core planks, and a cast-in-place topping to create a moment-resisting floor system that minimizes the need for shear walls. The goal of this system is to eliminate as many of the limitations of precast concrete buildings as possible while remaining economically competitive. The developed beams consists of one half of a standard steel W-section, embedded into the top of a shallow rectangular prestressed concrete bottom flange, to create a composite section that supports hollow-core planks. Cast-in-place concrete is then used to fill the voids between the hollow-cores and composite beam and provide a leveled topping.

40|$|In the {{secondary}} microseism period band (3 - 10 sec) and in absence of earthquakes, P-waves generated by storms can be investigated by beamforming techniques. We analyze several storms {{recorded by the}} Southern California Seismic Network and we show that P-waves are detected only in narrow frequency bands, which depend on the storm intensity. Back projecting the beam maximum enables to follow the storm track and the beam amplitude {{can be used to}} monitor the corresponding seismic source. We first model the P-wave amplitude generated by storms. The sources are generated by the interaction of ocean gravity waves {{in the vicinity of the}} storms. We model them as the power spectral density of the pressure derived from the ocean wave model. We then compute the source site effect of the ocean layer. Both pressure and site effect are frequency dependent. Finally we compute the propagation from the source area to the network. We then compute the synthetic beam corresponding to the modeled P-waves and compare them with the measured beams. We show that the model enables to retrieve the beam amplitude with an error of about 10 %, well located in slowness.

This study describes a new configuration for {{the method of}} light scattering and its corroboration by measurements of cell height (as a measure of cell volume). Corneal endothelial cells cultured on glass cover-slips were mounted in a perfusion chamber {{on the stage of}} an <b>inverted</b> microscope. A <b>beam</b> of light was focused on the cells from above the stage at an angle of 40 degrees to the plane of the stage. The scattered light intensity (SLI), captured by the objective and referred to as forward light scatter (FLS), increased and decreased in response to hyposmotic and hyperosmotic shocks, respectively. The rapid increase and decrease in SLI corresponded to cell swelling and shrinkage, respectively. Subsequently, SLI decreased and increased as expected for a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) and increase (RVI), respectively. These data are in agreement with measurements of cell height, demonstrating that the method of light scatter in FLS mode is useful for monitoring rapid changes in cell volume of cultured cells. Changes in SLI caused by gramicidin were consistent with cell volume changes induced by equilibration of NaCl and KCl concentrations across the cell membrane. Similarly, an additional decrease in SLI was recorded during RVD upon increasing K+ conductance by valinomycin. Decreasing K+ conductance of the cell membrane with Ba 2 + changed the time course of SLI consistent with the effect of the K+ channel blocker on RVD. Bumetanide and dihydro-ouabain inhibited increases in SLI during RVI. In conclusion, FLS is a valid method for qualitative analysis of cell volume changes with a high time resolution. status: publishe...|$|R

STIP VI was conducted in SINQ Target 9 during 2011 / 2012 receiving a total proton charge of 13. 16 Ah. The Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended code (MCNPX) is used for implementing the model and performing the simulation to obtain the proton and neutron fluences {{as well as the}} energy deposition in the different points of interest. Afterwards, this information is used for calculating the displacement per atom (dpa) plus the Helium and Hydrogen production in atomic parts per million (appm). The results will contribute to understand the irradiation effect in different structural materials. It will also be useful for comparing it with the real radiation damage measurements of the irradiated materials after its cool down period.

There is also the Safety Hull Tube (SHT), made of AlMg 3, which consists of a double cylinder walls surrounding the RCB and linked to the inverted BEW at the bottom. The source definition is implemented in the MCNPX input file from the gamma mapping performed at the irradiated Target 9. The material specification of the specimen rods is implemented by taking its average composition, assuming a uniform distribution.

The maximum neutron fluence is obtained in Row 8 with a value of 1. 99 x 1026 n/m 2, which in flux units stands for 4. 19 x 1014 n/(cm 2 ·s·mA). Regarding the SHT, the maximum proton flux escaping from the target is obtained above Row 36 with a value of 5. 99 x 1011 p/(cm 2 ·s·mA) and the maximum neutron flux is escaping around the middle part of the target with a value of 1. 39 x 1014 n/(cm 2 ·s·mA).

40|$|The {{controlled}} {{shaping of}} ultrashort laser pulses {{is a powerful}} technology and applied in many laser laboratories today. Most of the used pulse shapers are only able to produce linearly polarized pulses shaped in amplitude and phase. Some devices are also capable of producing limited time-varying polarization profiles, {{but they are not}} able to control the amplitude. However, for some state-of-the-art non-linear time-resolved methods, such as polarization-enhanced two-dimensional spectroscopy, the possibility of controlling the amplitude and the polarization simultaneously is desirable. Over the last years, different concepts have been developed to overcome these restrictions and to manipulate the complete vector-field of an ultrashort laser pulse with independent control over all four degrees of freedom - phase, amplitude, orientation, and ellipticity. The aim of this work was to build such a vector-field shaper. While the basic concept used for our setup is based on previous designs reported in the literature, the goal was to develop an optimized optical design that minimizes artifacts, allowing for the generation of predefined polarization pulse sequences with the highest achievable accuracy. In Chapter 3, different approaches reported in the literature for extended and unrestricted vector-field control were examined and compared in detail. Based on this analysis, we decided to follow the approach of modulating the spectral phase and amplitude of two perpendicularly polarized pulses independently from each other in two arms of an interferometer and recombining them to a single laser pulse to gain control over the complete vector field. As described in Chapter 4, the setup consists of three functional groups: i) an optical component to generate and recombine the two polarized beams, ii) a 4 f setup, and iii) a refracting telescope to direct the two beams under two different angles of incidence onto the grating of the 4 f setup in a common-path geometry. This geometry was chosen to overcome potential phase instabilities of an interferometric vector-field shaper. Manipulating the two perpendicularly polarized pulses simultaneously within one 4 f setup and using adjacent pixel groups of the same liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (LC SLM) for the two polarizations has the advantages that only a single dual-layer LC SLM is required and that a robust and compact setup was achieved. The shaping capabilities of the presented design were optimized by finding the best parameters for the setup through numerical calculations to adjust the frequency distributions for a broad spectrum of 740 – 880 nm. Instead of using a Wollaston prism as in previous designs, a thin-film polarizer (TFP) is utilized to generate and recombine the two orthogonally polarized beams. Artifacts such as angular dispersion and phase distortions along the beam profile which arise when a Wollaston prism is used were discussed. Furthermore, it was shown by ray-tracing simulations that in combination with a telescope and the 4 f setup, a significant deformation of the beam profile would be present when using a Wollaston prism since a separation of the incoming and outgoing beam in height is needed. The ray-tracing simulations also showed that most optical aberrations of the setup are canceled out when the incoming and outgoing beams propagate in the exact same plane by <b>inverting</b> the <b>beam</b> paths. This was realized by employing a TFP in the so-called crossed-polarizer arrangement which has also the advantage that the polarization-dependent efficiencies of the TFP and the other optics are automatically compensated and that a high extinction ratio in the order of 15000 : 1 is reached. Chromatic aberrations are, however, not compensated by the crossed-polarizer arrangement. The ray-tracing simulations confirmed that these chromatic aberrations are mainly caused by the telescope and not by the cylindrical lens of the 4 f setup. Nevertheless, in the experimentally used wavelength range of 780 – 816 nm, only minor distortions of the beam profile were observed, which were thus considered to be negligible in the presented setup. The software implementation of the pulse shaper was reviewed in Chapter 5 of this thesis. In order to perform various experiments, five different parameterizations, accounting for the extended shaping capabilities of a vector-field shaper, were developed. The Pixel Basis, the Spectral Basis, and the Spectral Taylor Basis can generally be used in combination with an optimization algorithm and are therefore well suited for quantum control experiments. For multidimensional spectroscopy, the Polarized Four-Pulse Basis was established. With this parameterization pulse sequences with up to four subpulses can be created. The polarization state of each subpulse can be specified and the relative intensity, phase, and temporal delay between consecutive subpulses can be controlled. In addition, different software programs were introduced in Chapter 5 which are required to perform the experiments conducted in this work. The experimental results were presented in Chapter 6. The frequency distribution across the LC SLM was measured proving that the optimal frequency distribution was realized experimentally. Furthermore, the excellent performance of the TFP was verified. In general, satellite pulses are emitted from the TFP due to multiple internal reflections. Various measurements demonstrated that these pulses are temporally separated by at least 4. 05 ps from the main pulse and that they have vanishing intensity. The phase stability between the two arms of the presented common-path setup σ = 28. 3 mrad (λ/ 222) over 60 minutes. To further improve this stability over very long measurement times, an on-the-fly phase reduction and stabilization (OPRAS) routine utilizing the pulse shaper itself was developed. This routine automatically produces a compressed pulse with a minimized relative phase between the two polarization components. A phase stability of σ = 31. 9 mrad (λ/ 197) over nearly 24 hours was measured by employing OPRAS. Various pulse sequences exceeding the capabilities of conventional pulse shapers were generated and characterized. The experimental results proved that shaped pulses with arbitrary phase, amplitude, and polarization states can be created. In all cases very high agreement between the target parameters and the experimental data was achieved. For the future use of the setup also possible modifications were suggested. These are not strictly required, but all of them could further improve the performance and flexibility of the setup. Firstly, it was illustrated how a “dual-output” of the setup can be realized. With this modification {{it would be possible to}} use the main intensity of the shaped pulse for an experiment while using a small fraction to characterize the pulse or to perform OPRAS simultaneously. Secondly, the basic idea of replacing the telescope by focusing mirrors in order to eliminate the chromatic aberrations was presented. Regarding the different parameterizations for vector-field shaping, some modifications increasing the flexibility of the implemented bases and the realization of a von Neumann Basis for the presented setup were proposed. In future experiments, the vector-field shaper will be used in conjunction with a photoemission electron microscope (PEEM). This approach combines the temporal resolution provided by ultrashort laser pulses with the high spatial resolution gained by electron microscopy in order to perform two-dimensional spectroscopy and coherent control on nanostructures with polarization-shaped femtosecond laser pulses. In combination with other chiral-sensitive experimental setups implemented earlier in our group, the vector-field shaper opens up new perspectives for chiral femtochemistry and chiral control. The designed vector-field shaper meets all requirements to generate high-precision polarization-shaped multipulse sequences. These can be used to perform numerous polarization-sensitive experiments. Employing the OPRAS routine, a quasi-infinitely long phase stability is achieved and complex and elaborated long-term measurements can be carried out. The fact that OPRAS demands no additional hardware and that only a single dual-layer LC SLM and inexpensive optics are required allows the building of a vector-field shaper at comparatively low costs. We hope that with the detailed insights into the optical design process as well as into the software implementation given in this thesis, vector-field shaping will become a standard technique just as conventional pulse shaping in the upcoming years. Die gezielte Formung ultrakurzer Laserpulse ist eine leistungsstarke Technik, die heutzutage in vielen Laserlaboren eingesetzt wird. Die meisten Pulsformer können jedoch nur linear polarisierte, in Phase und Amplitude geformte Laserpulse erzeugen. Einige Pulsformer können auch sich zeitlich verändernde Polarisationszustände generieren. Die möglichen Polarisationszustände sind allerdings beschränkt und eine gleichzeitige Formung der Amplitude ist dann nicht mehr möglich. Für einige moderne, nicht-lineare, zeitaufgelöste, spektroskopische Methoden, wie z. B. die polarisationsunterstützte zweidimensionale Spektroskopie, ist aber die gleichzeitige Kontrolle über die Polarisation und die Amplitude erstrebenswert. In den letzten Jahren wurden verschiedene Konzepte entwickelt, um diese Beschränkungen zu überwinden und eine vollständige Kontrolle des Vektorfeldes über die vier Freiheitsgrade Phase, Amplitude, Orientierung und Elliptizität eines ultrakurzen Laserpulses zu erlangen. Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, einen solchen Vektorfeldformer zu konstruieren. Die Grundidee für das Design unseres Aufbaus basiert auf verschiedenen literaturbekannten Konzepten.
