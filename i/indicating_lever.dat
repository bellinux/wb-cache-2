5000|$|In a {{jurisdiction}} using {{a mechanical}} voting system, often called a [...] "voting machine", voters choose by pulling a lever {{next to their}} choice. There is a printed list of candidates, parties and referenda next to the <b>levers</b> <b>indicating</b> which <b>lever</b> is assigned to which choice. When the voter pulls a lever, it turns a connected gear in the machine, which turns a counter wheel. Each counter wheel shows a number, which {{is the number of}} votes cast using that lever. After the polls close, election officials check the wheels' positions and record the totals. No physical ballot is used in this system, except when the voter chooses to write-in a candidate. Other systems are replacing mechanical voting systems because they are inaccessible to disabled voters, do not have a physical ballot and are getting old.|$|R

40|$|Four rats {{obtained}} food pellets by lever pressing. A variable-interval reinforcement schedule assigned reinforcers {{on average}} every 2 min during one block of 20 sessions and on average every 8 min during another block. Also, at each variable-interval duration, {{a block of}} sessions was conducted with a schedule that imposed a variable-ratio 4 response requirement after each variable interval (i. e., a tandem variable-time variable-ratio 4 schedule). The total rate of lever pressing increased {{as a function of}} the rate of reinforcement and as a result of imposing the variable-ratio requirement. Analysis of log survivor plots of interresponse times <b>indicated</b> that <b>lever</b> pressing occurred in bouts that were separated by pauses. Increasing the rate of reinforcement increased total response rate by increasing the rate of initiating bouts and, less reliably, by lengthening bouts. Imposing the variable-ratio component increased response rate mainly by lengthening bouts. This pattern of results is similar to that reported previously with key poking as the response. Also, response rates within bouts were relatively insensitive to either variable...|$|R

From the analysis known the failures of the APTB PPD bus are malfunctions of the fuel engine, power transfer systems, difficulty to move the gear lever, and lubricating system for the rough engine noise.

40|$|Alcohol abuse {{has been}} linked to visceral obesity, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Recent {{evidence}} suggests that rats are more motivated to binge drink when the delivery of alcohol is variable. Our goal was to explore this finding further by varying the flavor of alcohol within a drinking session. Ten Long-Evans rats were trained to lever press for orally delivered alcohol (10 % volume/volume) in a standard operant conditioning apparatus. During base-line conditions, the same flavor of alcohol (cherry or grape) was used throughout the 20 -minute session. During experimental condi-tions, the reinforcer was changed to a different flavor (cherry or grape) half way through the session. The results <b>indicated</b> that more <b>lever</b> pressing (ie, more motivation) occurred in the experimental conditions than in the baseline conditions.

2500|$|After {{entering}} the 2017 season out of contract, {{much of the}} season was spent speculating about whether he would stay at Adelaide or return to Victoria {{at the end of}} the season with the speculation beginning in January with an article in The Advertiser by Warren Partland. <b>Lever</b> <b>indicated</b> early in the season he planned on signing another contract with Adelaide, but was waiting until the collective bargaining agreement was finalised between the AFL and AFLPA.

40|$|Policy {{evaluation}} practice, as an applied {{policy analysis}} tool, has in general gained considerable terrain {{in the public}} arena, in Europe and abroad. Notwithstanding this trend, {{it does not seem}} appropriate to talk in terms of “a” European evaluation tradition, or “a” European evaluation culture. Mapping different countries’ evaluation traditions, would reveal an ‘evaluation tree with different trunks and branches’. Both the trajectories (‘roots’) of its development, as well as its resulting evaluation discourse, practices and institutions, largely differ throughout Europe. In explaining the similarities/differences in evaluation traditions an almost general consensus exists on the importance of societal, legal, institutional and historical contexts. Yet, systematic research evidence on this phenomenon is generally lacking. The only certainty remaining is the apparent highly contingent nature of evaluation practices. Yet, its inherent contingency might not discourage more systematic research to understand “why evaluation practices look like they do in the public sector”, and to get more grips on the role of various contextual factors herein. Remarkably, this is an area in which systematic research about evaluation is almost non-existent. Moreover, it is striking to notice that the majority of available analytical schemes concentrate at a single level of analysis (biased towards the country level) without taking into account possible interaction with other levels (e. g. sectoral; organisational). Conducting systematic multilevel research in search of possible combinations of contextual factors clarifying evaluation practices would be of high relevance. Not only for mere theoretical purposes, but also to <b>indicate</b> possible <b>levers</b> for evaluation capacity building. The paper presents a (PhD) research design, set up to tackle (part of) this research agenda. It approaches the general label ‘evaluation practices’ from two angles: first, from a developmental perspective. The ambition here is to explain the maturity of the evaluation capacity of a public sector organisation on a “plan-do-check-act” management scale. Secondly, evaluation practices are studied from an evaluation cycle outlook. We focus on explaining the loci of evaluation initiation, implementation and the number of evaluations undertaken by public sector organisations. Variables are inductively generated and ordered by an actor centered institutionalist framework into actor; institution; policy issue related conditions and evaluation policy legacies. 32 organisations of the Flemish administration constitute the area of investigation. In accordance with the contextual nature of evaluation practices and the theoretical framework applied, the methodology considered most suitable for the analysis is quali-quantitative comparative analysis (QCA). This involves a particular understanding of causality, known as “multiple conjunctural causation”. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In this paper, we {{describe}} the skulls of Magnificent Frigatebird Fregata magnificens (Fregatidae) and Brown Booby (Sulidae) Sula leucogaster, with focus on the structures associated with the Musculi mandibulae. We discuss the results {{in the context of}} the feeding biology of the two species, which feed mainly on flying fish and squids. Frigatebirds capture prey from just above, or just below, the water surface in flight. The hook-shaped Apex maxillae in F. magnificens can be viewed as an adaptation for grasping prey from near the water surface. Boobies catch prey by plunging; thus, the dorsoventrally flattened skull and conical bill of S. leucogaster may reduce water resistance when it dives, or swims underwater. The bill is long in both species, such that it is on average 70 % of the whole skull length in F. magnificens and 60 % in S. leucogaster. Consequently, the Mm. mandibulae in the two species are more posteriorly positioned relative to the Apex rostri. This results in low mechanical advantage for the mandible opening-closing <b>lever,</b> <b>indicating</b> adaptations for a fast, rather than a strong, bite. Fast-moving mandibles would be advantageous for ‘mandibulating’ prey while swallowing. The Fossa musculorum temporalium and the Palatum osseum in both species provide a broad area for origins of the Musculus adductor mandibulae externus (all parts) and the Musculus pterygoideus. The Processus orbitalis quadrati is longer and thicker in F. magnificens than in S. leucogaster, and so is the Musculus pseudotemporalis profundus. We suggest that Mm. adductores mandibulae are relatively well developed in the two species; therefore, their mandibulae are still probably capable of a powerful adduction. In both species there is a mechanisms that contribute to protect the jaws from disarticulation and damage. Such mechanism involves the incorporation of a ‘flange-like’ Crista intercotylare on the Margo medialis cotylae medialis fossae articularis quadratica that grips the Condylus medialis quadrati. In S. leucogaster, the retractor-stop ‘notch’ formed by Ossa lacrimale et nasale also serves to protect the jaws against sudden external forces when birds are diving or swimming underwater for prey. A more detailed hypothesis for the jaw movements and strength in F. magnificens and in S. leucogaster and their relation with feeding habits should necessarily incorporate data on the jaw and anterior neck musculatures...|$|R
40|$|Students' initial {{academic}} major choice can {{expose them}} to socializing factors and resources that can facilitate or impede success {{in their first year}} of college. When discussing progress, retention, persistence, attainment, and completion, policy makers, administrators, and scholars very rarely discuss how students settle on a chosen major in the first place. An understanding of the levers that influence initial academic major choice allows for interventions that may lead to choices which fit students' academic interests, expectations, goals, and abilities. This study employs binary logistic regression (LR) to examine initial academic major choice as a dichotomous outcome - declared or undecided. The conceptual model for this study is an interpretation of Azjen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) where the decision-making process under study includes students' predisposition towards, deference to others about, volition over, and intentions related to the fundamental decision whether to start college with a declared major or none at all. The incorporation of behavioral, normative, and control beliefs into these constructs allows for an examination of determinants of behavior that underlie students' perceptions related to their initial academic major choice. In examining factors that induce one student to make one decision and another student to make another decision, {{the findings of this study}} <b>indicate</b> the specific <b>levers</b> found to be significant in the initial academic major decision-making process are: 1) positive attitudes about starting college with a declared major; 2) family members who believe in starting college with a declared major and the importance of those family members to the student; and 3) how difficult it was for the student to make the decision. Additional sub-sample analyses and tests for equality of B coefficients reveal that the sources and influence of some factors are different for different groups of students based on sex and race/ethnicity. Implications for practice and research include institutions of higher education honing the content and audiences of messaging related to initial academic major choice; strengthened partnerships between K- 12 and institutions of higher education; and the use of more sophisticated statistical techniques, as well as sub-group data analyses...|$|R
40|$|Leadership Policy and Organizations Department {{capstone}} projectThe following project {{responds to}} a request by Kentucky Wesleyan College (KWC) to examine their student departure problem. Specifically, the KWC first-year retention rate is 54. 8 % (2006 freshman cohort, n= 323), well below the overall state average for independent colleges and university of 69. 5 % (AIKCU, 2006) and the national average 73. 6 % (NCHEMS, 2002). This is a challenge faced by many colleges and universities, and thus, there is extant literature available {{to assist in the}} analysis of the complicated puzzle of college student departure. We have reviewed and applied this literature in a systematic method to gain insight into the issues associated with student departure at Kentucky Wesleyan College. The ill-structured problem of college student departure is defined as the interaction between the individual student and the university or college attended (Braxton, Hirschy & McClendon, 2004). For the purpose of this project, all first-year Kentucky Wesleyan students are at-risk of college student departure, both residential and commuter students. Plus, the goals and objectives of the project include: assessment of the institutional retention levers [...] - KW 1101, the PLUS Center, and the Academic Alert system, to determine efficacy and provide recommendations for improvement; exploration of reasons for early student departure through qualitative and quantitative analyses; and, recommendation of programs to improve retention. The project's guiding question is "What are the primary factors attributable to the significant attrition rate of first-year student at Kentucky Wesleyan College?" The examination of retention <b>levers</b> <b>indicates</b> that KWC has room for improvement in making these levers more efficacious in aiding student persistence. The positive aspect of this project {{is that most of the}} levers, when functioning effectively, will indeed perform as designed. The project team concludes that there is only one compelling component of this examination that truly answers the guiding question. The JV football program is attributable to the significant increase in first-year departure at Kentucky Wesleyan College; and therefore, the program should be retrenched, so as not to continue the investment with both negative student and institutional implications. In addition, the project team made fifteen additional recommendations based upon the assessment of the institutional policy levers identified to impact retention, as well as the quantitative analyses from the University Students' Experiences Survey. Moreover, the project team recommends that through a purposeful campaign, Kentucky Wesleyan College can renew policies, practices and interactions with students, undergirded by the theoretical foundation of a commitment of the institution to student welfare and institutional integrity, to help reduce the significant attrition rate among first-year students.

40|$|Similar ao procedimento de Iversen (1993), este estudo buscou compreender o funcionamento da resposta de andar na roda como reforço, em esquema de reforçamento em FR e explorou o impacto da restrição do tempo de alimento disponível sobre o valor reforçador de andar na roda. Seis ratas foram submetidas à linha de base de peso corporal, consumo de alimento e água. Destas, cinco foram designadas às seguintes fases tendo a possibilidade de andar na roda: sessões de linha de base, redução gradual do tempo de possibilidade de andar na roda; modelagem da resposta de pressão à barra; reforçamento intermitente em FR com aumento automático do valor da FR, aumento do valor da FR determinado pela análise das respostas emitidas pelos sujeitos e extinção da resposta de pressão à barra. Sobre o alimento, destacam-se as seguintes condições: alimento disponível por tempo integral, 90 de alimento disponível por dia e alimento por tempo integral. Tais condições acompanharam as manipulações das variáveis relativas a andar na roda. Os resultados apontaram que quatro de cinco sujeitos adquiriram com muito treino e mantiveram com taxas baixas a resposta de pressão à barra tendo a possibilidade de andar na roda como conseqüência, diferente do obtido por Iversen (1993). Para um sujeito, {{inclusive}} a resposta de pressão à barra só foi instalada usando alimento como reforço, e depois mantida com a resposta de andar na roda. Observou-se também que as taxas de respostas de pressão à barra e o número de voltas na roda diminuíram com o aumento do valor da FR, e que a perda de peso dos sujeitos não dependeu da quantidade de voltas na roda e sim da restrição do tempo de alimento disponível. Pode-se dizer que a restrição do tempo de alimento foi uma operação estabelecedora que alterou a efetividade reforçadora do andar na roda para quatro dos sujeitosReplicating Iversen s (1993) procedure, {{this study}} s {{goal was to}} increase the comprehension of the running response of rats on an activity wheel when running was a consequence of responding on a fixed-ratio schedule. The study also explored {{the impact of a}} restricted period of food availability on the reinforcing value of wheel running. Body weight, food and water consumption of six female rats were systematically measured. Five subjects were also submitted to a procedure designed to install wheel-running as a consequence for lever pressing. After baseline measures of wheel running, a gradual restriction of the session time when wheel-running was possible was implemented, followed by the shaping of a lever pressing response reinforced by wheel-running, and a phase when lever pressing was maintained by intermittent reinforcement on a FR. The FR values initially were increased automatically and later the FR values were increased based on the analysis of the subject s responses. One subject was finally submitted to an extinction procedure of the lever pressing response. The availability of food also varied during experimental phases concomitantly with the manipulation of lever pressing and wheel running: food was initially available all the time, later food was available for 90 minutes daily, and, finally, it was available all the time again for some subjects [...] Results <b>indicated</b> that the <b>lever</b> pressing that produced wheel running as a consequence was acquired and maintained for 4 of 5 subjects. Nevertheless these responses were emitted at low rates, and were acquired only after a long training. For one subject, the lever pressing response was acquired only when food was its consequence and was, then maintained when the consequence became wheel-running. Results also showed that rate of lever pressing and the number of wheel turns decreased as the value of fixed ratio increased, and that weight loss did not depend on the number of wheel turns, but seemed to depend on the time restriction of food availability. It is discussed that for 3 subjects the time restriction of food availability was an establishing operation for wheel-runnin...|$|R
