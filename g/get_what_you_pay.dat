500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E

"Yes, that is true," [...] said Mrs. Horn, with no {{more sense}} of wrong in the fact than the {{political}} economist has {{in the fact that}} wages are the measure of necessity and not of merit. [...] "You <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for. It's a matter of business." [...] She satisfied herself with this formula, which she did not invent, as fully {{as if it were a}} reason; but she did not dislike her niece's revolt against it. That was part of Margaret's originality, which pleased her aunt in proportion to her own conventionality; she was really a timid person, and she liked the show of courage which Margaret's magnanimity often reflected upon her. She had through her a repute, with people who did not know her well, for intellectual and moral qualities; she was supposed to be literary and charitable; she almost had opinions and ideals, but really fell short of their possession. She thought that she set bounds to the girl's originality because she recognized them. Margaret understood this better than her aunt, and knew that she had consulted her about going to see the Dryfooses out of deference, and with no expectation of luminous instruction. She was used to being a law to herself, but she knew what she might and might not do, so that she was rather a by-law. She was the kind of girl that might have fancies for artists and poets, but might end by marrying a prosperous broker, and leavening a vast lump of moneyed and fashionable life with her culture, generosity, and good-will. The intellectual interests were first with her, but she might be equal to sacrificing them; she had the best heart, but she might know how to harden it; if she was eccentric, her social orbit was defined; comets themselves traverse space on fixed lines. She was like every one else, a congeries of contradictions and inconsistencies, but obedient to the general expectation of what a girl of her position must and must not finally be. Provisionally, she was very much what she liked to be.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. “Are <b>you</b> <b>getting</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for? ” This Total Cost of Ownership model calculates the {{multiple}} variables that determine total cost. By using the tool when sourcing a requirement, the supply professional takes steps to mitigate risks that translate into increased cost. The tool applies weighted values to such elements as price, logistics, quality, risk, maintenance and repairs, and administrative and financing factors {{to determine a}} “total cost ” for the requirement. The tool provides a format to calculate the factors used in a Total Cost of Ownership decision. The weighted cost factors consider the importance and degree of risk involved in the purchase. Individuals should understand their own organization’s needs to define the amount of weight (risk) assigned to each variable. This model is also intended to inspire thought on how your organization can add/subtract elements to determine your own Total Cost of Ownership model. Introduction. For the Supply Chain profession, today’s roles and expectations are different when compared to past years. In the past, Purchasing personnel performed a relatively clerical role in an organization. Sourcing decisions were made by comparing {{not much more than}} the “unit price ” of the required product or service. As long as the lowest price was chosen...|$|R

5000|$|Cupid’s Mistake had its {{theatrical}} {{release on}} August 24, 2001 in New York City, and critical reaction was mixed. David Sterritt, writing for The Christian Science Monitor, noted the film’s “acting is uneven {{and most of}} the romancing seems so mismatched that it's not surprising when things fall apart time after time. But there are appealing moments along the way, and the director gets impressive mileage with a budget that can only be called minuscule.” However, Dave Kehr, writing for The New York Times, complained: “Mr. Kang has discovered the effects button on his camcorder, and he relies upon it to provide what style his work has: a pixilated movement here, a fade to monochrome there. At 70 minutes, [...] "Cupid's Mistake" [...] is short, but then, so is our time on this planet.” And Ken Fox, writing for TV Guide Online, noted: “Wearing its $980 price tag as a badge of honor, writer-director Young Man Kang's no-budget video feature proves two things: You don't need a multimillion dollar budget to make a film, and sometimes <b>you</b> <b>get</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for.” Cupid’s Mistake was released on DVD on July 21, 2009 by Vanguard Cinema ...|$|R

50|$|The rugs tend to {{be based}} on a cotton warp and have a thin, tightly knotted pile. Most Abadeh rugs are closely cut making them very flat. Although some of the older Abadehs vary in style, many of the new designs are easily recognisable. These new designs, known as Heybatlu consist of a single diamond shaped {{medallion}} in the centre with smaller medallions on each corner. The pattern is typically geometrical flowers or animals and the main colours are light reds or burnt orange on top of a dark blue background with strong green details. The corners or borders are generally ivory in colour. Although some Abadeh and Shiraz rugs appear similar Abadeh can normally be differentiated by their higher knot counts as well as the fact that the warp is invariably cotton. The rugs are almost always exclusively medium in size and the KPSI of an average Abadeh is around 90. As always in the rug-world you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for however in general Abadeh are well made and fairly popular items, particularly in modern interiors or those with a Mediterranean or North African style.|$|E
