She bore the wrongs which she suffered as a wife with a very patient and unrepining spirit, and loved her husband with the most devoted attachment to the end. Nothing can be more affecting than the proofs of her tender and anxious regard on the night immediately preceding the assassination. There were certain slight and obscure <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> which her watchful devotion to her husband led her to observe, though they eluded the notice of all Caesar's other friends, and they filled her with apprehension and anxiety; and when at length the bloody body was brought home to her from the senate-house, she was overwhelmed with grief and despair.|$|E

That {{there might be an}} awkward affair with Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but the ease was serious enough to make him dismiss that consideration: he was convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever, and that he had taken just the wrong medicines. He must go to bed immediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and precautions must be used, about which Lydgate was particular.

40|$|This {{research}} {{draws on}} the experiences of eight women who are survivors of domestic violence and have graduated from or are currently living in long-term housing programs. Recently, research has highlighted {{a strong correlation between}} domestic violence and intimate partner homicide (Campbell et al., 2003). Existing efforts to assess this threat involves quantifying the problem by asking women to complete "objective" risk assessment tools. What is lacking is a qualitative understanding of battered women's perceptions and conceptualizations of danger that holds women's meanings, perceptions, and experiences central to understanding this problem. Findings from this study reveal that women engage in their own danger assessment practices by socially constructing and identifying indicators of danger, such as the ongoing secrecy and shame of the abuse and efforts to preserve their relationships. These <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> furthermore, shaped women's responses to the violence. For instance, since very few individuals knew about the abuse, women had limited resources and ways of protecting themselves. In their attempts to the control the violence, women often physically fought back when in the presence of danger. Moreover, this study uncovers that as women moved forward in healing from the abuse, they socially reconstruct understandings of danger by reframing and characterizing their perceptions of danger within the context of potentially reentering abusive relationships in the future. This research not only renders women's experiences and difficulties as significant, but it also allows programs to understand how to better strengthen the safety net for victims by improving danger assessment and safety planning practices in the future.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot project is to {{investigate}} {{the relationship between the}} implementation of classification and labelling of chemical substances and their use. The system that has been examined is the EU legislation for classification and labelling of chemical substances and mixtures. The focus lies on substances with harmonised classification at European Union (EU) Community level as dangerous for the environment which by themselves or in a mixture above a certain concentration limit lead to classification and labelling with the symbol “Fish and tree” and the <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> Dangerous for the environment (N). Other effects were also included to some extent. EU Environmental hazard classification has been conducted since the mid 1990 s and from the early first decade of the 21 st century for chemical substances and mixtures. Now, almost 20 years after the first criteria were implemented it is interesting to look back and see whether this classification has {{had an impact on the}} use of these substances...|$|R
30|$|Our {{investigation}} into the climatic conditions prior to fires within the interior western US identified clear and distinct patterns associated with fire, including wet and dry antecedent conditions. Five clusters of antecedent climate conditions were further discriminated by land cover composition and elevation. These distinctions appear related to fuel vs. climate-limited fire regimes with unique interactions with climate. Models built using these relationships provide a good <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>danger</b> within our study region, but their predictive ability declines when these antecedent conditions are markedly different from those used in model calibration. As more data become available to describe these novel conditions, we expect the model performance to improve. The current results do, however, illustrate the models’ utility for predicting and characterizing fire danger.|$|R

60|$|Agrippina, therefore, supposing {{that her}} son was now far enough {{advanced}} in public consideration {{to make it in}} some degree certain that he would be the emperor's successor, was ready at any time for her husband to die. His sickness therefore filled her mind with excitement and hope. There was another motive too, besides her ambitious desires for the advancement of her son, that made her desirous that Claudius should not live. She had been now for several months somewhat solicitous and anxious about her own safety. Her influence over Claudius, which was at first so absolute and supreme, had afterward greatly declined, and within a few months she had begun to fear that she might be losing it entirely. In fact she had some reason for believing that Claudius regarded her with concealed hostility and hate, and was secretly revolving plans for deposing both her and her son from the high ascendency to which they had raised themselves, and for bringing back his own son to his proper prominence, in Nero's place. Agrippina, too, in the midst of her ambitious projects and plans, led a life of secret vice and crime, and feeling guilty and self-condemned, every trivial <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> excited her fears. Some one informed her that Claudius one day when speaking of a woman who had been convicted of crime, said that it had always been his misfortune to have profligate wives, but that he always brought them in the end to the punishment that they deserved. Agrippina was greatly terrified at this report. She considered it a warning that Claudius was meditating some fatal proceedings in respect to her.|$|R
25|$|The {{fighting}} was tactically inconclusive. Although Jackson's turning movement was foiled {{and he was}} unable to block the Union retreat or destroy Pope's army, National Park Service historians count Chantilly as a strategic Confederate victory because it neutralized any threat from Pope's army and cleared the way for Lee to begin his Maryland Campaign. The Confederates claimed a tactical victory as well because they held the field after the battle. Two Union generals were killed, while one Confederate brigade commander was killed. Pope, recognizing the attack as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> continued <b>danger</b> to his army, continued his retreat to the fortifications around Washington, D.C. Lee began the Maryland Campaign, which culminated in the Battle of Antietam, after Pope retreated out of Virginia. The Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B.

60|$|One evening, {{leaning over}} the taffrail, I {{observed}} a very singular, isolated cloud, to the N.W. It was remarkable, as well for its color, as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia. I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor, and looking like {{a long line of}} low beach. My notice was soon afterwards attracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the peculiar character of the sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change, and the water seemed more than usually transparent. Although I could distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in fifteen fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron. As night came on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration. However, as the captain said he could perceive no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go. No watch was set, and the crew, consisting principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon deck. I went below--not without a full presentiment of evil. Indeed, every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. I told the captain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me without deigning to give a reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.--As I placed my foot upon the upper step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship quivering to its centre. In the next instant, a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from stem to stern.|$|R
40|$|Coles {{asks what}} geographies are {{consumed}} when social actors ingest specialist coffee and he explores {{the ways in}} which places of coffee production are reproduced materially as well as discursively and semiotically, in addition to examining how these places are literally and figuratively ingested. Based on ethnographic research in a London-based coffee importer and retailer, Coles’ chapter examines how the intimate and distant places of production are fashioned and (re) produced by the material and social rituals of eating and drinking. The author reflects on the paradox that in an era of seemingly nameless and placeless commodities, the relationship between place and food is becoming increasingly important to some consumers, and he explores how the act of eating mobilises and stakes claims to particular (kinds of) geographies while dismissing others. Coles’ chapter thereby draws attention to the scales of consumption, as drinking coffee draws together a range of places from the intimate and embodied to the global – and everywhere in between. He further shows how place moves through the food system not only as a marker of quality, safety and distinction, but also as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> suspicion, <b>danger,</b> and banality, and he argues that, as we eat, we reproduce these demarcations. This leads Coles to ask, when we eat what is it that we are ingesting: a food or a place, proximity or distance?Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

50|$|Additionally, the Court {{found that}} Georgia failed to show, in {{justification}} of Ga. Code Ann. § 21-2-140, a special need of that kind.

The statute was not needed and could not work to ferret out lawbreakers, and officials barely attempted to support the statute on that ground. However well meant, the candidate drug test Georgia devised diminished personal privacy for a symbol's sake; state action that is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. In addition to Georgia's failure to provide evidence of a drug problem among its state officials, the Court concluded that even if such a problem did exist, the affected officials would likely not perform the kind of high-risk, safety-sensitive tasks which might justify the statute's proposed incursion on their individual privacy rights. Where, as in this case, public safety was not genuinely jeopardized, the Fourth Amendment precluded a suspicionless search, no matter how conveniently arranged.|$|R
