50|$|The {{emissions}} of CO and organically bound carbon during the clinker burning process {{are caused by}} the small quantities of organic constituents input via the natural raw materials (remnants of organisms and plants incorporated in the rock {{in the course of}} geological history). These are converted during kiln feed preheating and become oxidized to <b>form</b> <b>CO</b> and CO2. In this process, small portions of organic trace gases (total organic carbon) are formed as well. In case of the clinker burning process, the content of CO and organic trace gases in the clean gas therefore may not be directly related to combustion conditions.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the catalytic reduction of SO? by CO and COS over lanthanum oxysulfide was studied {{using a combination of}} temperature-programmed reaction coupled with mass spectrometry (TPR/MS) and feed-perturbation step-analysis techniques. The results showed that COS interacts more readily with lanthanum oxysulfide than CO does. The interaction of COS with the lanthanum catalyst was different from that of CO. In addition, COS preferentially reacted with SO 2 to <b>form</b> <b>CO</b> 2 and sulfur instead of following the disproportionation (to <b>form</b> <b>CO</b> 2 and COS) and decomposition (to <b>form</b> <b>CO</b> and sulfur) reactions. The redox mechanism is not the main reaction route for the reduction of SO? by CO and COS over lanthanum oxysulfide. SO 2 was strongly adsorbed by the oxysulfide and was retained in the oxysulfide even when heated in an inert gas stream, while COS was very reactive and did not remain long in the oxysulfide. These results suggest that COS has access to certain specific active sites in the oxysulfide and the catalytic reduction of SO? by COS possibly proceeds via adsorbed COS reacting with pools of SO 2 adspecies to <b>form</b> <b>CO</b> 2 and sulfur.

40|$|Preferential {{decomposition}} of CO 2 gas to CO gas was examined {{by using a}} combination of CaCl 2 -CaO melt as a reaction media and ZrO 2 - 8 mol% Y 2 O 3 solid-state electrolyte as anode. The conversion ratio of CO 2 to CO became larger at the higher temperature, and approached the maximum (88. 2 %) at 1273 K. The highest CO concentration was generated at cell voltage of 2. 55 V, which is close to theoretical decomposition voltage of CaO. Therefore, in addition to calciothermic reaction between precipitated Ca and CO 2 gas bubbles, CO 2 decomposes preferentially via the decomposition reaction of carbonate ions. Namely CO 2 gas dissolves to <b>form</b> <b>CO</b> 3 2 - under coexistence of CaO in the melt, CO 3 2 - precipitates carbon or CO gas bubbles on the cathode, and a part of carbon reacts with the blown CO 2 gas to <b>form</b> <b>CO.</b> CO gas is used as an effective fuel with easy handling in steel plants...|$|E
