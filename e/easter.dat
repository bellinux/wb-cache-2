5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, <b>Easter,</b> the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King. Most {{of these}} festivals {{are tied to}} the {{moveable}} feast of <b>Easter.</b> Festivals take precedence over all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas is considered to be twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and <b>Easter</b> is fifty days in length (from <b>Easter</b> Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost). For <b>Easter,</b> Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of <b>Easter,</b> will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of <b>Easter</b> in addition to or in place of the normal part of the <b>Easter</b> festival for that day.|$|E

5|$|<b>Easter</b> Road {{was briefly}} the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a {{professional}} rugby union team, {{in the late}} 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998–99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest in using <b>Easter</b> Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included <b>Easter</b> Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at <b>Easter</b> Road {{with a view to}} Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a longer term. It has since been announced that the team will move to Myreside from January 2017.|$|E

5|$|Kirkcaldy club Raith Rovers used <b>Easter</b> Road {{as a home}} venue once, for {{the home}} leg of a UEFA Cup tie against Bayern Munich in 1995. The match was moved from Rovers' normal home ground of Stark's Park due to <b>Easter</b> Road's greater capacity. <b>Easter</b> Road has {{sometimes}} played host to Scottish League Cup semi-final matches, {{such as in the}} 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013 and 2014 competitions. Team managers Terry Butcher and Gus MacPherson have objected to playing semi-finals at <b>Easter</b> Road, on the grounds that their players should have the chance to play at Hampden Park, or that playing against Hearts in Edinburgh gives them a form of home advantage. The 2014 Scottish Challenge Cup Final between Raith Rovers and Rangers was hosted at <b>Easter</b> Road.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{volcanism}} also {{occurs in}} Chile.

5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the <b>Easter</b> protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and <b>Easter</b> proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning. <b>Easter</b> functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E

5|$|Adventure was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game <b>Easter</b> egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's <b>Easter</b> egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E

5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the <b>Easter</b> Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from <b>Easter</b> Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at <b>Easter</b> Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E

Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that {{at about the same time}} (a little after <b>Easter),</b> they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.|$|E
