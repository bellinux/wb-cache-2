5|$|The {{church has}} six weekly services, {{one of them}} located in the Rue Battant {{especially}} <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Each meeting is devoted to a particular Christian practice: evangelization, prayer, Bible reading, singing, and weekly worship. Meetings are composed of biblical sermons and studies, testimonies of religious experiences, hymns, meditation, worship, and prayers. Services are dynamic, charismatic and emotional, often evolving into ecstasy and trance; glossolalia results when the pastor calls the Holy Spirit to come upon the congregation, and usually lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Women must have their heads covered during worship.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This {{paper is}} {{informed}} by a study that aimed to understand the difficulties in implementing models of housing, and to help address the lack of accessible and affordable private housing <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in Australia. In responding to this aim, the study formulated an ecological map of housing models, which are examined in this paper {{in terms of their}} underlying assumptions of vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach The study involved explanation building, using a multiple case study approach, informed theoretically by an ecological framework. It included organisations, families and individuals <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> Findings For the purpose of this paper, the study revealed a direct relationship between the nature of the housing models proposed, and assumptions of vulnerability. In the context of the study findings, the paper suggests that attempts to address individual housing needs are more likely to achieve a positive outcome when they are person driven, from a premise of ability rather than disability. Overall, it invites a ‘universalistic’ way of conceptualising housing issues <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> that has international relevance. Practical implications This paper highlights how assumptions of vulnerability shape environmental responses, such as housing, <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> Originality/value This paper is based on a study that reconciled a person-centred philosophy with an ecological appreciation of the external and internal factors impacting housing choice <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability...</b>|$|R

5|$|Congress sanctioned the {{economic}} emergency {{law and the}} state reform law. The first allowed the president to reduce or remove subsidies, and the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, and the money from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} hyperinflation. The first measure of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but hyperinflation was reduced. He also reduces social spending, including those <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities, authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the {{supervision}} of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the Magic Wand in sexual activity <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E
5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> has also been recognized {{with the addition of}} equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E

5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.|$|E

40|$|After {{fifteen years}} of {{economic}} growth, Australia still has the seventh lowest employment rate <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> including mental illness, in the OECD. Attempts by previous governments to encourage <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> into employment, including via Welfare to Work, have failed. This paper, developed {{as a result of}} consultations with more than 700 interested people and around 300 submissions, sets the direction for a new National Mental Health and Disability Employment Strategy to be released in 2009. The directions are intended to closely reflect the priorities of the community. The proposed directions for the Strategy recognise that work connects people to the wider world, raises living standards and provides opportunities for a happier and more fulfilling life. It recognises that the best thing we can do for a person is to include them in the economy and society. This paper outlines the approach the Australian government will take to increase employment <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> including: improving disability employment services; providing greater encouragement, assistance and support <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> wishing to re-enter the workforce; innovation; tackling employer misconceptions; increasing Australian Public Service employment of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> disability; and improving access to education and training...|$|R
