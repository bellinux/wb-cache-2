25|$|The {{advantages}} that Europe had {{developed by the}} mid-18th century were two: an <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>culture,</b> and the wealth generated by the Atlantic trade (including the African slave trade). By the late 16th century, silver from the Americas accounted for the Spanish empire's wealth. The profits {{of the slave trade}} and of West Indian plantations amounted to 5% of the British economy {{at the time of the}} Industrial Revolution. While some historians conclude that, in 1750, labour productivity in the most developed regions of China was still on a par with that of Europe's Atlantic economy, other historians like Angus Maddison hold that the per-capita productivity of western Europe had by the late Middle Ages surpassed that of all other regions.|$|E
40|$|This study {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} about <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>cultures</b> in family businesses. Previous family business literature highlights that <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>cultures</b> reside within a founding or incumbent generation. The identification and pursuit of opportunities leading to establishing or acquiring ventures revolves around a founder-centered culture. This view overlooks the way opportunity identification and pursuit {{become part of the}} culture in family firms. Interpretive methods were used to analyze six family business groups in Honduras. The unit of analysis is the family entrepreneurial team (FET), members of the family behind entrepreneurial processes. By focusing on the family entrepreneurial team this study shows that <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>cultures</b> are transmitted via long intergenerational interaction and continued via involvement of junior generations in the identification and pursuit of opportunities. We argue that further attention to the family unit and alternative contexts extends our understanding of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>cultures</b> in family businesses...|$|R

This paper challenges this expectation by drawing attention to the relationship between entrepreneurs and the cultures they build, with a particular emphasis on the potential challenges that may inhibit entrepreneurs from forming and maintaining innovation oriented cultures as intended.

[...] O'Connor had been looking to partner with a larger financial institution and in 1989 entered into a currency joint venture with SBC that proved to be the first step towards a sale of O'Connor to SBC. [...] Following the merger, O'Connor was combined with SBC's money market, capital market and currency market activities to form a globally integrated capital markets and treasury operation.

The entrepreneurship orientation, such as innovativeness, pro-activeness and risk-taking, contributes to the performance, defined as a compound measure dimension of growth as well as financial achievement. The case of the Mao Lixiang implies that economies with stronger <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>cultures</b> from his family’s business tradition, are more tolerant and understanding of business failure and do not perceive this as a barrier to entry, but as an opportunity to learn. The ambition to change the present situation urges him to have the adaptability to political institutions and the regulation of entry, and find the business opportunities as well.

40|$|The {{indispensable}} role of {{entrepreneurial spirit}} of individuals, firms and regions in building strong <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>cultures,</b> sustaining global competitive advantage and promoting economic {{growth has been}} widely acknowledged, and researchers have identified some distinguishing characteristics of entrepreneurial spirit in individuals, firms and regions.

30|$|Theoretically, {{the present}} study builds on {{a growing body of}} {{knowledge}} about the role of <b>culture</b> in <b>entrepreneurial</b> success to reaffirm that the so-called less <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>cultures</b> are not necessarily bad for entrepreneurship. Their usefulness depends on the context. Cultural orientations such as interdependence and social inequality facilitate the development of cultural and social competencies that are for example useful in accumulating social and relational capitals, in turn, increase the likelihood of entrepreneurial success. In addition, the findings of {{the present study}} highlight the need to focus beyond financial dimensions of entrepreneurial success, especially in the discourse of entrepreneurial success in less developed countries. Many entrepreneurs in such countries are likely to be motivated by the need to generate adequate funds to finance their families’ day-to-day basic needs, rather than amassing wealth.|$|R

2500|$|These {{policies}} {{had a major}} structural {{effect on}} the city's economy. While government policy had limited success in preventing the growth of Birmingham's existing industries, {{it was much more}} successful in preventing new industries establishing themselves in the city. Birmingham's economic success over the previous two centuries had been built on its economic diversity and its ongoing ability to adapt and innovate – attracting new businesses and developing new industries with its large supply of skilled labour and dynamic <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>culture</b> – but this was exactly the process that government industrial location policy sought to prevent. Birmingham's existing industries grew strongly and kept the economy buoyant, but growing local fears that the city's economy was becoming over-specialised were dismissed by central government, even though danger signs were growing by the early 1970s. In 1950 Birmingham's economy could still be described as [...] "more broadly based than that of any city of equivalent size in the world", but by 1973 the West Midlands had an above-average reliance on large firms for employment, and the small firms that remained were increasingly dependent as suppliers and sub-contractors to the few larger firms. The [...] "City of [...] Thousand Trades" [...] had become over-specialised on one industry – the motor trade – much of which by the 1970s had itself consolidated into a single company – British Leyland. Trade union organisation grew and the motor industry in particular saw industrial disputes from the 1950s onwards. A city that for most of its history had a reputation for weak trade unionism and strong cooperation between workers and management, developed a reputation for trade union militancy and industrial conflict.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{government}} of Malaysia has established several agencies within the Ministry of Agriculture and agri-based Industry {{such as the}} Farmers Organization Authority to provide technical and motivational training to individual members involved in farming practices to become agri-entrepreneurs. Approach: The objectives of the study are to identify and determine the <b>entrepreneurial</b> work <b>culture</b> as perceived by Farmers Organization Authority members. Members of Farmers Organization Authority were interviewed via a structured questionnaire. The factor analysis determines 6 latent factors that were realized by the Farmers Organization Authority members as being important for promoting an <b>entrepreneurial</b> work <b>culture</b> and therefore should be enhanced and re-inculcated among the Farmers Organization Authority farming community. Results: These factors translate into the community having to become more innovative, responsible and accountable, profit oriented, visionary, better at performing their study practices in a more systematic way and finally to become more self confident. Conclusion/Recommendation: Efforts should be intensified to encourage Farmers Organization Authority members with training to focus not on modern technologies only, but on enhancing the <b>entrepreneurial</b> work <b>culture</b> and fundamental changes in attitude towards treating farming as a business. Formal entrepreneurship training should be instituted to all Farmers Organization Authority members {{who are interested in}} taking a loan in enhancing their farming activities.
