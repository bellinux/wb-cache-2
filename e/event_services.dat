40|$|Distributed object {{computing}} middleware such as CORBA, RMI, and DCOM {{have gained}} wide acceptance and has shielded programmers from many tedious and error-prone aspects of distributed programming. In particular, CORBA <b>Event</b> <b>Service</b> {{has been used}} extensively in embedded systems. In this paper, we propose an aspect oriented approach to develop synchronization code for distributed systems that use <b>event</b> <b>service</b> as the underlying communication middleware. Our approach is to factor out synchronization as a separate aspect, synthesize synchronization code and then compose it with the functional code. We use high-level "global invariants" to specify the synchronization policies which are then automatically translated into synchronization code for the underlying <b>event</b> <b>service.</b> To implement synchronization efficiently using the <b>event</b> <b>service,</b> we propose enhancements to the semantics of the <b>event</b> <b>service.</b> Specifically, we define the notion of condition events and exactly k semantics. Given these enhancements, we describe a synthesis procedure to translate global invariants into synchronization code based on events. We describe {{the implementation of the}} enhancements on the Tao's Real-Time <b>Event</b> <b>Service.</b> We present experimental results to demonstrate that the enhanced <b>event</b> <b>service</b> leads to more efficient implementation of synchronization. We feel that our methodology and the enhanced Real-Time <b>Event</b> <b>Service</b> will lead to more confident use of sophisticated synchronization policies in distributed object oriented systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the {{suitability}} of the CORBA <b>Event</b> <b>Service</b> as a reliable message delivery mechanism. We first show that products built to the CORBA <b>Event</b> <b>Service</b> specification will not guarantee against loss of messages or guarantee order. This is not surprising, as the CORBA <b>Event</b> <b>Service</b> specification does not deal with Quality of Service (QoS) and monitoring issues. The CORBA Notification Service, although it provides much of the QoS features, {{may not be an}} option. Therefore, we examine application-level reliability schemes to build a reliable communication means over the existing CORBA <b>Event</b> <b>Service.</b> Our end-to-end reliability schemes are applicable to management applications where state resynchronization is possible and sufficient. The reliability schemes proposed provide resilience in the face of failures of the supplier, consumer, and the <b>Event</b> <b>Service</b> processes. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the Real-Time <b>Event</b> Detection <b>Service</b> using Data Service Middleware (DSWare). DSWare provides data-centric and group-based services for sensor networks. The real-time <b>event</b> <b>service</b> handles unreliability of individual sensor reports, correlation among different sensor observations, and inherent real-time characteristics of <b>events.</b> The <b>event</b> <b>service</b> supports confidence functions which are designed {{based on data}} semantics, including relative importance of subevents and historical patterns. When the failure rate is high, the <b>event</b> <b>service</b> enables partial detection of critical events to be reported in a timely manner. It can also be applied to differentiate between the occurrences of events and false alarms...|$|R

40|$|The <b>event</b> <b>service</b> of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) {{is useful}} in {{supporting}} decoupled and asynchronous communication between distributed object components. However, the specification of the <b>event</b> <b>service</b> standard does not require implementation to provide facilities to guarantee efficient event/data delivery. Consequently, applications in which {{a large number of}} objects need to communicate via an <b>event</b> <b>service</b> channel may suffer from poor performance. In this paper, a generic CORBA-based framework is proposed to tackle this scalability problem. Two techniques are applied; namely, event channel federation and load balancing. The solution is transparent {{in the sense that it}} exports the same IDL interface as the original <b>event</b> <b>service.</b> We explore three critical dimensions underlying the design of the load-balancing algorithm and conduct experiments to evaluate their impact on the overall performance of the framework. The results provide some useful insights into the improvement of the scalability of the <b>event</b> <b>service.</b> Department of Computin...|$|R

40|$|Next-generation {{distributed}} interactive simulations have stringent {{quality of}} service (QoS) requirements for throughput, latency, and scalability, as well as requirements for a flexible communication infrastructure to reduce software lifecycle costs. The CORBA <b>Events</b> <b>Service</b> provides a flexible model for asynchronous communication among distributed and collocated objects. However, the standard CORBA <b>Events</b> <b>Service</b> specification lacks important features and QoS optimizations required by distributed interactive simulation systems. This paper makes five contributions to the design, implementation and performance measurement of distributed interactive simulation systems. First, it describes how the CORBA <b>Events</b> <b>Service</b> can be implemented to support key QoS features.
