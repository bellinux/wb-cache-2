40|$|This Msc {{graduation}} study {{covers the}} installation of topsides on a jacket by an offshore <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> <b>crane</b> vessel, and its related problems. One of the problems take place after the topside is hoisted on the jacket, during the weight shift from the hoist cable onto the jacket. The topside then exerts large horizontal forces upon the crane and vessel. The {{problem is that the}} DP system is not designed to cope with the changed force characteristics. Due to the changing force characteristics the DP system may build up oscillations and even instable behavior. The ultimate consequence may inflict great (economic) damage, human injury or even loss of lives. The current industry solution to this problem is found to be unsatisfying. The goal of this thesis is to propose one final conceptual solution to this problem. This final conceptual solution is selected from four candidate solutions after simulation performance tests. All candidate solutions use the same basic idea of estimating the large horizontal force and feed this into the DP controller. The performance of the candidate solutions is tested on a simulated model of a crane vessel hoisting a topside on a jacket. This simulation model is based on the Imtech Marine DP and vessel model which is extended with a <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> <b>crane.</b> With the use of this simulation model the problem of instable behavior is reproduced in a simulation environment using realistic parameters. One of the candidate solutions, denoted the Feed Forward solution candidate, translates the estimated force into compensation thrust by the vessel's own actuators. As a result, the horizontal forces are eliminated, whereby the DP controller will not be disturbed by the changed force characteristics anymore. In literature, this feed forward control law performed very well during scale model tests. In this study however, the performance proved to be very poor. It is shown that the performance is mainly poor because of the acceleration and deceleration rates of the thrusters are too low. The second candidate solution, denoted the Kalman solution candidate, is a more simple candidate and only feed the estimated forces to the Kalman filter. This candidate is performing good, but DP stability is not guaranteed under all conditions. To determine the stability, with or without the Kalman solution candidate, an theoretical analysis method is explained. It is concluded that of all candidate solutions the Kalman solution candidate proved the best performance. Consequently, it is recommended to develop the conceptual candidate to an industrial solution. During this development it is recommended to take extra measures to increase the robustness against differences between the heavy lift vessel model and the true heavy lift vessel.

40|$|For {{offshore}} installation projects Jumbo uses her J-class <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> <b>crane</b> vessels. The objects {{that need to}} be installed offshore are carried at deck or in the ship's hull. At location the object is lifted by the on-board <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> <b>crane</b> and slewed {{to the side of the}} ship. From the final overboard position the object can be lowered to the seabed. When the load is displaces by the slewing crane, the equilibrium of moments is disrupted and the ship will roll or heel. To reduce this moment change the ship pumps ballast water from one side to the other and causes a counter moment. This simple system has limited capacities and it was assumed that an improvement could reduce the duration of the lifting phase. This thesis is about a research to decrease the duration of the lifting phase for the Jumbo J-class, focussing on anti-heeling. To understand the context of the problem, research has been done on the company and the market she is operating in. Then the phenomenon of anti-heeling, the current ballast system and the operational limits were analysed. With the information obtained from this research a list of requirements and the load cases were selected. The analysis showed that the current system capacity is based on three manual controlled centrifugal pumps that can either been switch on or off. This system cannot easily vary the moment change and was believed to be limiting for lift operations. To find a new solution design methods are used to generate a variety of concepts. For five concept calculation has been done to predict their capacity and dimensions. The analysis showed that a new solution is unlikely to be financially attractive for the market Jumbo is operating in. Therefore the decision has been made to research the effects of the most economical potential solution. Variably frequency drives were applied to the pump system to see if the variations of the rotational speed of the pumps and therefore varying the flow rate would make easier to control the roll motions. Or even shorten the lift phase. To examine the ballast system and the sensitivities a model has been made. As this research focused on roll and heeling motions only, a 2 D model is used to predict heave, sway and roll motions. The model is based on the equilibrium of moments where the ship is exposed to wave induced moments and the moments caused by the crane and ballast system. The crane and ballast system are effected by the ship motions and therefore coupled to these motions. The model allows to automate the control of the crane motions and the pump rotations. This allowed the model to test different lift scenarios under different wave conditions. The results showed that the variable frequency drivers can result in smaller differences of the heeling angles. But the results also showed that the ballast system was not the most important limiting factor. It was the moment change caused by the crane. When the crane tip with hanging load was displaced with a certain speed, it caused an impulse making the ship oscillate around the static heeling angle. The amplitudes of these oscillations and the static heeling angle could be reduced by the ballast system. But the best results were shown when the stability properties of the vessel were improved. Increasing the effective metacentric height from 2. 25 to 3. 25 showed significantly reduce roll excitations. Other conclusions are that previously very conservative roll angles of 1 o were used, while the mast crane proved to handle roll angles of 4 o and larger depending on the load. Also the lay out of the current pump system leaves a lot of room of improvement. These improvements can be found in the recommendations as well as suggestions how to discover potential time savings during offshore operations.

40|$|Installation of {{offshore}} equipment {{is a huge}} branch of business in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Almost every offshore project requires heavy-weighted equipment, which should be installed on the seabed. Recently, oil and gas companies instead of producing from platforms prefer to develop fields as subsea factories. Mentioned changes result in growing opportunities for offshore service companies, working in the field of transportation and installation, as the workload constantly increases. Currently, several techniques are used to carry out the full installation activities. The most used one is to transport the equipment by a subsea construction vessel (SSCV) and then transmit the equipment from the deck of the vessel to the seabed by a vessel’s crane. Such approach requires to hire a costly vessel – SSCV and have some limitations due to weather restrictions. Moreover, the most up to date SSCV’s are not able to operate with cargo’s weights more than 500 tons. To carry out the installation of heavy-weighted equipment, such as templates with integrated manifold, two vessels – barge and <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> <b>crane</b> vessel should be used. This leads to {{a significant increase in the}} installation cost. However, service companies such as Subsea 7, Aker, etc. have their own technologies, which could be classified as “wet” transportation and installation methods. Some of them already have practical applications. These methods have several pros and cons that will be reviewed in the paper. The main aim of this work is to develop technical concept of a new wet transportation and installation approach, taking into account pros and cons of existing methods, make some approximate estimations of the processes from technical and economical points of view. Briefly, the idea is to implement adjustable bouncy compensators (BC) in the process {{of offshore}} transportation and installation of oil and gas equipment. Different equipment like subsea production ii systems, manifolds, templates and PLETs can be tooled up with a BC. This idea will help to eliminate use of offshore cranes during the process of installation, thus an enhanced operability and safety will be achieved due to elimination of the connection between vessel and equipment. The described technology allows one to carry out operations in harsh conditions with large wave height (with given level of safety) and heavy weighted equipment as well. Suggested innovation can be used in combination with other wet installation methods...|$|E

The purpose of this report is to find the limiting wave height for the Versatruss system based on the limiting acceleration and velocity. The structural limitations has not been investigated. In order to do time domain analysis a conceptual model of the Standard Viking barge is made in GeniE and a hydrodynamic analysis is done to get the correct input (added mass, stiffness etc.) in SIMA. In addition hand calculations are done to verify the results from the hydrodynamic analysis. In SIMA the system is coupled in a Versatruss configuration and non-linear time domain analysis of the system is done with different wave heights, periods and directions. In SIMA the model is coupled with fenders and wires to satisfy the assumption that the barges are free to move relative to each other. Since the Versatruss lifting system is allocated along the centreline of the barge individual roll motion of the barges does not influence the motion of the topside. To assure that the results are correct a small time integration interval of 2, 5 e- 3 s is chosen. The most probable maximum (MPM) is taken from several analysis and the value with 10 % probability of exceedance (P 90) is taken as the maximum value.

In order to reduce computational time, only 50 simulations per wave condition of interest are done, from which an insight is gained into which wave combinations should be handled with extra care. Those with a wave period of 4 to 5 seconds showed resonant behaviour with the waves, resulting in un-acceptable slack and causing the load cable DAF values to exceed the maximum allowable value of 1. 3. For significant wave heights of 2 meters, wave periods longer than 8 seconds showed tolerable DAF values. Synchronization of the jacket’s vertical oscillation with the waves showed to be an important initiator of high DAF. Since the initial oscillations are caused by slamming and the jacket's eigen-period is affected by the heave added mass, these two phenomena are very important.
