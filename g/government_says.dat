5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the <b>government</b> <b>says</b> it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{government}} {{pointed out}} that it was in the 9th century when Uyghurs migrated into Xinjiang, but since many Uyghurs believe in the opposite of whatever the Chinese <b>government</b> <b>says,</b> they eagerly believe books written by Uyghur authors which glorify their past and assume what authors like Almas write is automatically true.|$|E

As part of the resistive economy, the Supreme Leader of Iran has urged Iranians to consume more domestic products over imported ones.|$|E
25|$|The Mexican Army has {{severely}} curtailed {{the ability}} of the Mexican drug cartels to move cocaine inside the U.S. and Canada, prompting an upsurge in gang violence in Vancouver, where the cocaine price has increased from $23,300 to almost $39,000 per kilo as both the U.S. and Canadian drug markets are experiencing prolonged shortages of cocaine. As evidence of this pressure, the U.S. <b>government</b> <b>says</b> the amount of cocaine seized on U.S. soil dropped by 41 percent between early 2007 and mid-2008.

25|$|Unverified audio tapes {{from the}} summer of 2013 {{allegedly}} recording figures of the Egyptian military, including then-Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, suggest Egyptian military involvement in the mass-protests preceding Morsi's downfall. In the unverified tapes, the generals discussed rigging the legal case against Morsi, and authorized withdrawal of a large sum {{of money for the}} army's use from the bank account of Tamarod, the ostensibly independent grassroots group that was organizing protests against President Morsi. The tapes also suggest high-level collusion between the coup plotters and the Government of the United Arab Emirates. The tapes were first released on the Turkish Islamist channel Mekameleen, a fact that the Egyptian <b>government</b> <b>says</b> discredits the tapes as fakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} defends {{its land}} policy, given the common occurrences of natural disasters such as drought or bad weather. The <b>government</b> <b>says</b> that had farmers {{been allowed to}} own land, {{they might have been}} forced to sell it during drought. To prevent this, the EPRDF government believes land ownership should not be privatized. Accordingly, the government states that it should focus on its agriculture sector while it is developing its industrial sector simultaneously, so that it can balance everything once the other sectors are developed and increase productivity. Government transformation of the construction sector, for example, led to a rare construction boom from the early 2000s until cement and other shortages caused it to slow down. The government believes privatization should be employed in the future but not presently. Knowing that constitutional change is required to privatize lands, the government assumed that it would hold a long-term super majority in parliament, to enable it to make the transition.|$|E
25|$|The project {{attracted}} {{public criticism}} over its effectiveness to reduce congestion, prioritisation ahead of public transport, {{transparency of business}} case and local effect on Royal Park and Melbourne Zoo. Local councils and public transport advocates opposed the project and several community groups were formed to block its construction. Then Opposition Leader and now Premier Daniel Andrews campaigned against the project in the 2014 state election, promising to abandon the project if Labor won government. The Labor <b>government</b> <b>says</b> the project's western section may still be built, though not in the government's first term. The government initially proposed its West Gate Distributor as a lower-cost port link for heavy freight vehicles, but in early 2015 unveiled plans by infrastructure company Transurban to build the multibillion-dollar Western Distributor as a more expansive route, providing a second major river crossing and a partial western bypass in the city's inner west. The Coalition both in Federal Government and in state Opposition remain committed to building the East West Link.|$|E
