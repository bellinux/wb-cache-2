25|$|I {{know the}} case is desperate; but, sir, we must either quit the country or attack Mr. Hamilton. No time is to be lost. Were I sure of a reinforcement, I should not attempt it. Who knows what fortune will do for us? Great things have been {{effected}} by a few men well conducted. Perhaps we may be fortunate. We have this consolation, that our cause is just, and that our country will be grateful and not condemn our conduct <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>we</b> fall through. If we fail, the Illinois as well as Kentucky, I believe, is lost.|$|E

In figure 6, the underlying assumption is the usual decreasing returns to scale, due to which the PPF is concave to the origin. <b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>we</b> assumed increasing returns to scale, say if Crusoe embarked upon a mass production movement and hence faced decreasing costs, the PPF would be convex to the origin.

500|$|Michaels accused Al Davis {{of getting}} the {{officials}} to inspect Turner's kicking shoes before a field goal attempt {{to see if they}} contained illegal metal plates, and called the Oakland team official [...] "a man who has never contributed anything to football", to which Davis responded, [...] "It's utterly ridiculous, unbelievable. It seems the Jets always lose to us because of penalties. But I like them and don't want any feud <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>we</b> visit New York December 29 [...] ". The Jets left their white road uniforms in Oakland to be laundered and sent to them in San Diego, where they were to play their next game. The uniforms were not seen again once the team removed them in the Oakland locker room, and Jets management hastily ordered the green home uniforms, as well as the white uniforms the team had worn in the preseason, to be shipped from New York.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Suttirat Anne Larlarb {{says the}} real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper {{at any of}} the launches: [...] "The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it for him as a back up idea <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>we</b> needed to adhere to it. As we got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design." [...] Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire [...] "felt like I had arrived at [...] vision, that the person had arrived." [...] Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming, and wanted to [...] "give the audience kind of a payoff." ...|$|E
500|$|Disney {{had wanted}} Fantasia {{to be an}} ongoing project, with a new edition being {{released}} every few years. His plan was to substitute {{one of the original}} segments with a new one as it was completed, so audiences would always see {{a new version of the}} film. From January to August 1941, story material was developed based on additional musical works, including Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner, The Swan of Tuonela by Jean Sibelius, Invitation to the Dance by Carl Maria von Weber, the Polka and Fugue from Schwanda the Bagpiper by Jaromír Weinberger and Flight of the Bumblebee by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which was later adapted into the Bumble Boogie segment in Melody Time (1948). The film's disappointing initial box office performance and the USA's entry into World War II brought an end to these plans. Deems Taylor prepared introductions for The Firebird by Stravinsky, La Mer by Claude Debussy, Adventures in a Perambulator by John Alden Carpenter, Don Quixote by Richard Strauss, and Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky [...] "to have them for the future <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>we</b> decided to make any one of them".|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, {{the group}} issued their second album <b>In</b> <b>Case</b> <b>We</b> Die {{on their own}} Tailem Bend label. It {{featured}} guest appearances by local musicians and was produced by The Carbohydrates (James Cecil and Cameron Bird's production duo) in Cecil's Super Melody World studio, now {{set up in a}} large garage space in Melbourne's inner northern suburbs. It was mixed by Tony Espie (The Avalanches, New Buffalo, Robert Palmer), at 001 Studios in Melbourne. Cyclic Defrosts Vaughan Healey described a typical gig as [...] "a bewildering ride through dynamic tempo changes, finger clicks and swapped instruments. You never really know who is going to sing or what will happen next, and somehow the eight-piece juggles this anarchic structure with a music class worth of instruments and staging rearrangements." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Second Sons" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 20 {{reviews of}} the episode and judged 100% {{of them to be}} positive with an average score of 8 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] " [...] 'Second Sons' shines through efficient storytelling -- and a comparatively low number of storylines to keep track of this week." [...] Writing for IGN, Matt Fowler rated the episode a 9.0/10, and wrote [...] "This week's well-crafted and wonderfully acted Game of Thrones gave us a cold wedding, a hot bath and a blood-letting." [...] He especially praised the scenes between Sansa and Tyrion and between Ser Davos and Stannis. David Sims and Todd VanDerWerff, both writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode [...] "B" [...] ratings. Sims was frustrated by the episode's meandering pace, but praised the end of the episode, with Sam killing the white walker, as [...] "the most crucial, fascinating, electric moment of the night". VanDerWerff praised the use of nudity in the episode, writing [...] "...I actually think Game Of Thrones has gotten quite a bit better at utilizing nudity and sex in the midst of everything else as a method of telling its story. It’s {{come a long way from}} the 'sexposition' days of season one, when it sometimes seemed like the series would toss some breasts into the background of a scene just <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>we</b> got bored of hearing somebody talk at length." ...|$|E
