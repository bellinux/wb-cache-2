5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders <b>ejectable</b> had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn investigation {{was conducted to}} determine the feasibility of a small, low-cost, caseless, hybrid-booster/solid-fuel ramjet (H/SFRJ) that utilizes a common fuel grain and has no <b>ejectables.</b> Performance of an air-to-ground missile with a solid propellant booster and SFRJ sustainer, capable of being fired from an unmanned aerial vehicle or helicopter was obtained using an Air Force computer code. A H/SFRJ motor was then designed analytically and compared to the generated computer output. The results showed that a H/SFRJ that has performance equal to a solid-booster SFRJ is feasible. The final missile design had a range of 20 nm, a flight Mach number of 2. 0, a diameter and length of 5 and 99 inches respectively, and weighed 82 lb. Caseless hybrid rockets with erodible nozzles were tested to validate assumptions made in the design analysis. In addition, transition from hybrid-rocket booster to solid-fuel ramjet sustainer was demonstrated. (MM) [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

2500|$|Much of the {{reduction}} of the landing precision error was accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, derived from the algorithm used for guidance of the Apollo Command Modules returning to Earth in the Apollo program. This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to [...] "fly out" [...] any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the axial centerline that results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight. This is accomplished by a series of <b>ejectable</b> ballast masses consisting of two [...] tungsten weights that were jettisoned minutes before atmospheric entry. The lift vector was controlled by four sets of two reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that produced approximately [...] of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allowed the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone. Prior to parachute deployment the entry vehicle ejected more ballast mass consisting of six [...] tungsten weights such that the center of gravity offset was removed.|$|E

50|$|Once it was {{determined}} that the cockpit would be a sealed fireproof and blast-resistant capsule, inspired by the example of the Scott Crossfield incident in the X-15 rocket plane, consideration was then given to making the capsule <b>ejectable.</b> After studying examples from both aviation and 250 mph drag boat racing of <b>ejectable</b> or separable capsules, it was decided to pattern the capsule separation for RV1 largely after the drag boat model, in which the capsule separates only after a crash has already initiated. However, due to the much higher speeds and different motions expected in comparison to a drag boat if RV1 were to crash, it was decided to incorporate both a mechanism for actively ejecting the capsule and an aerodynamic decelerator. Banks of compressed air rams {{on each side of the}} capsule will serve as the ejection mechanism, with tilt switches mounted in the horizontal and vertical planes acting to initiate ejection without driver intervention. In the ejection sequence currently envisioned, if the RV1 pitches or rolls beyond preset limits, a tilt switch will open a solenoid valve that releases compressed nitrogen into the banks of rams. As the capsule is launched outward, the tension from a steel cable lanyard attached between the capsule and the chassis will pull a mechanism in the capsule that releases a ballute to decelerate and stabilize the capsule.|$|E

5000|$|In basketball, a {{technical}} foul (also colloquially {{known as a}} [...] "T" [...] or a [...] "Tech") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact {{during the course of}} play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an <b>ejectable</b> offense in leagues below the NBA, and potentially so in the NBA).|$|E
50|$|Hütter {{was asked}} to {{complete}} the design as quickly as possible, and borrowed heavily from the existing He 219, Junkers Ju 288 and Dornier Do 335. The only parts of new design were the wings and tail surfaces, which were constructed from wood as a weight-saving measure to enable better performance. The wings were extremely long, and resembled those of a high-performance sailplane. The cockpit was pressurized and, like the He 219, fitted with <b>ejectable</b> seats. The finished product was meant to be delivered in February 1945 {{and to be able to}} evade British de Havilland Mosquito fighters. There were also plans for variants powered by jet engines for the purpose of achieve higher altitudes but these were never carried out.|$|E
50|$|In baseball, each umpire has a {{considerable}} amount of discretion, and may eject any player, coach, or manager solely on his own judgment of unsportsmanlike conduct. The <b>ejectable</b> offense may be an excessively heated or offensive argument with an umpire, offensive interference (contact with the catcher on a play at the plate), malicious game play (especially pitchers attempting to intentionally strike batters with the ball or a manager or coach ordering a pitcher to do so), illegally applying a foreign substance to a bat or otherwise tampering with a ball (most famously, George Brett's Pine Tar Game), using a corked bat, charging the mound, or otherwise fighting. Between players and umpires, there is a common understanding that a certain level of argument is permitted, but players who too vigorously question an umpire's judgment of balls and strikes, or argue a balk, may risk an ejection.|$|E

5000|$|The RX-178 Gundam Mk-II {{are three}} {{prototype}} mobile suits {{developed by the}} Titans, an elite special unit of the Earth Federation forces, in UC 0087 - the first Gundam units seen in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. Aside from a new paint job of dark blue and black with red and yellow highlights, the Gundam Mk. II bears great aesthetic similarities to its One Year War-era predecessor, the original RX-78-2 Gundam from Mobile Suit Gundam. The Mk. II represented a small increase in mobility compared to the original, and with the deletion of the cumbersome and expensive core block system, room was freed upon for a more modern panoramic cockpit setup (a more or less standard accoutrement for mobile suits in the same series and time period), {{which is designed to}} offer increased situational awareness to the pilot. Armaments are fairly standard Gundam fare, including a beam rifle (chronologically speaking, the Mk. II's beam rifle was the first of such weapons to be powered by a replaceable e-pac device; this was later retconned with Gundam 0083) and twin beam sabers. Vulcan guns are not installed in the Mk. II by default, unlike previous models; however, an optional set can be added as an <b>ejectable</b> pod. The Mk. II may also arm a [...] "clay bazooka" [...] weapon, which is capable of disabling a mobile suit's mobility via an adhesive warhead (though it can equip normal explosive shells if desired). Aside from the aforementioned mundane enhancements, the Mk. II's most substantial contribution to mobile suit technology and largest upgrade over its predecessor is the then-revolutionary movable frame construction, which later inspired the designs in the novel Gundam Sentinel. Paradoxically, the Gundam Mk. II is not armored with the wonderfully durable Gundarium alloy material, first introduced in the series on the original RX-78 Gundam, making it no more or less physically durable than mass-production mobile suits of the era (the term Gundarium is a creation of the Zeta Gundam series; formerly, the same material was known as [...] "Lunar Titanium" [...] in Mobile Suit Gundam, and was renamed (or retconned from a meta standpoint) in honor of the original Gundam).|$|E
